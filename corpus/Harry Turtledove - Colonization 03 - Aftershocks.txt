harry turtledove colonization book aftershocks continuation of the worldwar series as the jet aircraft descended toward the airport outside the still slightly radioactive ruins of nuremberg pshing asked atvar exalted fleetlord is this visit really necessary i believe it the commander of the races conquest fleet told his adjutant my briefings state that a tosevite wise in the political affairs of his kind recommended that a conqueror visit the region he conquered as soon as he could to make those he had defeated aware of their new masters technically the greater german reich remains independent pshing pointed out so it does technically but that will remain a technicality i assure you atvar used an emphatic cough to show how strongly he felt about that the deutsche did us far too much harm in this exchange of explosivemetal weapons to let their madness ever break free again a pity we had to concede them even so limited an independence pshing said and that is also a truth atvar agreed with a sigh he swiveled one eye turret toward the window to get another look at the glassy crater that filled the center of the former capital of the greater german reich beyond it lay a slagged wilderness of what remained of homes and factories and public buildings conventional bombs had devastated the airport too but it was back in service pshing said if only we had some means of detecting their missilecarrying boats that can stay submerged indefinitely without those we could have forced unconditional surrender out of them truth atvar repeated with them though they could have inflicted a good deal more damage to our colonies here on tosev they will be surrendering the submarines they have left we shall not allow them to build more we shall not allow them to have anything to do with atomic power or explosivemetal weapons henceforward that is excellent that is as it should be pshing said if only we could arrange to confiscate the submersible boats of the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics as well we would truly be on our way toward a definitive conquest of this miserable planet i merely thank the spirits of emperors past atvar cast both his eye turrets down to the floor of the aircraft that carried him that neither of the other powerful notempires chose to join the deutsche against us together they could have hurt us much worse than the reich alone did and now we also have the nipponese to worry about pshing added who knows what they will do now that they have learned the art of constructing explosivemetal weapons they already have submarines and they already have missiles we never did pay enough attention to islands and their inhabitants atvar said fretfully small chunks of land surrounded by sea were never important back on home so we have always assumed the same would hold true here unfortunately it does not seem to be so before pshing could answer the aircrafts landing gear touched down on the runway outside nuremberg the races engineering slowly refined through a hundred thousand years of planetary unity was very fine but not fine enough to keep atvar from feeling some bumps as the aircraft slowed to a stop my apologies exalted fleetlord the pilots voice came back to him on the intercom i was given to understand repairs to the landing surface were better than is in fact the case peering out the window atvar saw deutsch males in the cloth wrappings that singled out their military drawn up in neat ranks to greet and honor him they carried rifles his security males had flabbled about that but the reich remained nominally independent if some fanatic sought to assassinate him his secondincommand in cairo would do well enough what was the name of the sly big ugly who suggested this course he asked pshing machiavelli his adjutant pronounced the alien name with care one syllable at a time he lived and wrote about nine hundred years ago nine hundred of our years i should say half as many of tosev s so he came after our probe then atvar said and pshing made the affirmative gesture the race had studied tosev sixteen hundred years before again half that many in tosevite terms the fleetlord went on remember the swordswinging savage mounted on an animal the probe showed us he was the height of tosevite military technology in those days a pity he did not remain the height of tosevite military technology as we were so confident he would pshing said when we understand how the big uglies are able to change so rapidly we will be able to prevent them from doing so in the future that will help bind them to the empire so it will if we can do it atvar replied if not we will wreck them one notempire at a time or if necessary we will destroy this whole world even our colonies on it that will cauterize it once for all one other possibility remained a possibility that had never entered his mind when the conquest fleet first reached tosev the big uglies might conquer the race if they did they would next mount an attack on home atvar was as sure of it as of the fact that hed hatched from an egg wrecking the world would prevent it as a surgeon sometimes had to prevent death by cutting out a tumor with the reich prostrate the big uglies would have a much harder time of it atvar knew that but the worry never went away the locals were quicker more adaptable than the race he knew that too close to fifty of his years of experience on tosev had burned the lesson into him again and again clunks and hangings from up ahead came to his hearing diaphragm the aircrafts door opening he did not go forward at once his security males would disembark ahead of him to form what was termed a ceremonial guard and amounted to a defensive perimeter it would not hold against concerted attack it might keep a single crazed big ugly from murdering him atvar hoped it would one of those security males came back to his seat and bent into the posture of respect all is in readiness exalted fleetlord he reported and the radioactivity level is acceptably low i thank you diffal atvar said the male had headed security since midway through the fighting he wasnt so good as his predecessor drefsab but drefsab had fallen victim to big uglies with even more nasty talents or perhaps just more luck than hed had atvar turned an eye turret toward pshing come with me it shall be done exalted fleetlord his adjutant said atvar let out a hiss of disgust at the weather outside which was chilly and damp cairo whence hed come had a reasonably decent climate nuremberg didnt come close and this was spring heading toward summer winter would have been much worse atvar shivered at the very idea as he emerged from his aircraft a deutsch military band began braying away the big uglies meant it as an honor not an insult and so he endured the unmusical at least to his hearing diaphragms racket the security officials parted to let a big ugly through not the fuhrer of the deutsche but a protocol aide if you advance to the end of the carpet exalted fleetlord the fuhrer will meet you there he said using the language of the race about as well as a tosevite could making the gesture of agreement atvar advanced to the edge of the strip of red cloth and stopped his security males kept him covered and kept themselves between him and the ranks of the deutsche the tosevite soldiers looked fierce and barbaric and had proved themselves formidable in battle they are beaten now atvar reminded himself they didnt seem beaten though by their bearing they were ready to go right back to war their ranks parted slightly out from among them came a relatively short rather stout big ugly in wrappings related to those of the soldiers but fancier he wore a cap on his head the hair atvar could see below it was white which meant he was not young when he took off the cap for a moment he showed that most of his scalp was bare another sign of an aging male tosevite as the deutsche had parted so rather more reluctantly did atvars security males the big ugly walked up to atvar and shot out his arm in salute being still formally independent he did not have to assume the posture of respect i greet you exalted fleetlord he said he was less fluent in atvars language than his protocol officer but he made himself understood i am walter dornberger fuhrer and chancellor of the greater german reich and i greet you fuhrer atvar knew he made a hash of the deutsch word but it didnt matter your males fought bravely now the fighting is over you shall have to learn that fighting bravely and fighting wisely are not the same had i led the reich when this war began it would not have begun dornberger replied but my superiors thought differently now they are dead and i have to pick up the pieces they left behind that was tosevite idiom the race would have spoken of putting an eggshell back together but atvar understood you shall have fewer pieces with which to work henceforward we intend to make certain of that you did too much harm to us to be trusted any longer i understand dornberger said the terms you have forced me to accept are harsh but you and the race have left me no other choice your predecessors had a choice atvar said coldly they chose the wrong path you are obliged to live with their decision and with what it has left you i also understand that the tosevite replied but you can hardly deny that you are wringing all possible advantages from your victory of course we are atvar said that is what victory is for or do you believe it has some other purpose by no means dornberger said in tones of professional admiration he added you were clever to set france up again as an independent notempire i did not expect that of you i thank you the fleetlord had not imagined he might know a certain amount of sympathy for the big ugly who now led the notempire that had done the race so much harm little by little through continual contact with you tosevites we do learn how to play your games you should be thankful we left you any fragments of your independence i am thankful to you for that dornberger answered i suspect i should also be thankful to the americans and russians who would not have taken it kindly to see the greater german reich disappear from the map the tosevite was indeed professionally competent both the usa and the soviet union had made it very clear to atvar that their fear of the race would increase if the reich were treated as an outright conquest after what he had suffered fighting germany he did not want the other notempires excessively afraid it might make them do something foolish he hated having to take their fears into account but they were too strong to let him do anything else his tailstump quivered in irritation pointing at dornberger with his tongue he said we no longer need to worry so much about the opinion of the reich and we shall do everything possible everything necessary to make sure we never have to worry about it again do you understand of course exalted fleetlord dornberger answered and atvar wondered how and how soon the deutsche would start trying to cheat him sweat ran down colonel johannes druckers face everyone knew the lizards preferred their weather hot as the sahara as the german sat a prisoner of war in a cubicle aboard one of their starships he scratched his bare chest the lizards were scrupulous theyd returned to him the coveralls hed worn aboard the upper stage of the a that had lifted him into earth orbit theyd even washed them but he couldnt bear the thought of putting them on not when he felt about ready to have an apple stuck in his mouth even naked he sighed longing for the fogs and chill of peenemunde the reichs rocket base on the baltic but peenemunde was radioactive rubble now his family lived in greifswald not far to the west he sighed again on a different grimmer note he prayed that they werent radioactive dust but he had no way of knowing the chair on which he sat was too small for him and shaped for a backside proportioned differently from his the sleeping mat on the floor was also too small and too hard to boot the lizards fed him canned goods imported from the lands they ruled and from the usa most of which were not to his taste it could have been worse hed tried to blow up this starship its antimissiles had knocked out one of the warheads hed launched from his upper stage its closein weapons system the other the race had still accepted his surrender afterwards few humans would have been so generous he got up and used the head every so often lizard technicians came in and fiddled with the plumbing it wasnt made for liquid waste the race like real lizards excreted only solids from trying to blow the starship to a cloud of radioactive gas hed been reduced to causing problems in its pipes that was funny if you looked at it the right way without warning the door to his cubicle slid open he was glad hed finished pissing getting caught in the act would have embarrassed him even if it wouldnt have flustered the lizard who caught him hed seen this fellow before he recognized the body paint i greet you superior sir he said anyone who flew in space had to know the lizards language i greet you johannes drucker the lizard named ttomalss answered i am here to inform you that you will soon be released that is good news i thank you superior sir drucker said but then his mouth twisted it would be better news if it did not mean my notempire had been defeated i understand i sympathize ttomalss said perhaps he even did he showed more knowledge of the way people worked that any other lizard the german had met drucker wondered how hed acquired it ttomalss continued but you will have the opportunity to help repair the damage have the opportunity to see the damage drucker thought he could have done without that opportunity hed been a panzer driver not a spaceman when the reich detonated an explosivemetal bomb to derail a lizard attack on breslau hed cheered then he wouldnt be cheering now can you drop me near peenemunde land he asked that is where my mate and my hatchlings live if they live anywhere at all but ttomalss made the races negative hand gesture captives are being exchanged outside nuremberg nowhere else very well drucker said since he couldnt say anything else from bavaria to pomerania through a warravaged landscape not a journey to look forward to but one he would have to make eventually a shuttlecraft will take you back to the surface of tosev the lizard told him in the meantime now that hostilities have concluded i have gained permission to inform you that you are not the only tosevite presently aboard this starship are you interested in meeting another member of your species after weeks with nobody but lizards to talk to what do you think aloud drucker said yes superior sir i would very interested be he used an emphatic cough then added i thank you did the lizards have a beautiful spy waiting to try to charm secrets out of him not likely not that hed be much interested anyhow not when he hadnt the faintest idea whether kathe was alive or dead had he watched too many bad films and read too many trashy novels that struck him as very likely indeed ttomalss said the other male is from the notempire of the united states he is here on a research mission i suppose you would describe it something in the way he hesitated didnt quite ring true to drucker but the german was hardly in a position to call him on it and the lizard had used the masculine pronoun so much for beautiful spies drucker laughed at himself all right he said no matter who he is or where he is from i look forward to meeting him wait here ttomalss told him as if he were liable to wait somewhere else the lizard left the cubicle ttomalss could leave drucker couldnt after about fortyfive minutes his captors had let him keep his watch the door slid open in came a young man with a shaved head and with body paint on his chest he nodded to drucker ignoring his nakedness and stuck out his hand hello do you speak english he said in that language some drucker answered in english then he shifted i must tell you though i am better in the language of the race that suits me fine the american said also in the lizards tongue hes very young drucker realized the shaved head had disguised his age he went on my name is jonathan yeager i greet you and i greet you drucker shook the proffered hand and gave his own name then he eyed the american yeager it is a german name it means hunter the last word was in english yes my fathers fathers father came from germany jonathan yeager said in musing tones drucker said i knew an officer named jager heinrich jager he was a landcruiser commander one of the best officers i ever served under i named my oldest hatchling for him i wonder if there is a relationship from what part of germany did your ancestor come i am sorry but i do not know the young american answered maybe my father does but i am not sure of that many when they came to america tried to forget where they came from so they could become americans i have this heard drucker said it strikes me as strange maybe that made him a reactionary european even if it did though he was a wildeyed radical when measured against the lizards he asked what sort of research are you engaged in here the unspoken question behind that one was why would the americans send a puppy instead of a seasoned man to druckers surprise jonathan yeager blushed all the way to the top of his shaved crown he coughed and spluttered a couple of times before answering i guess you could call it a sociological project that sounds interesting drucker said hoping yeager would go on and tell him more about it instead the american pointed an accusing finger his way and said and i know why you are here i have no doubt that you do drucker said if my attack had been a little more fortunate we would not be having this talk now that is a truth jonathan yeager sounded surprisingly calm maybe he was too young to take seriously the possibility of his own demise or maybe not he went on my father is an officer in the us army he would talk that way too i think professionals do drucker started to say something else but checked himself is your father by any chance the male who understands the race so well if he is i have some of his work in translation read i should have of him thought when i heard the name yes that is my father jonathan yeager said with what sounded like pardonable pride he does good work drucker said he is the only tosevite who ever made me believe he could think like a male of the race why are you here instead of him he has been here the younger yeager answered i first came here with him as his assistant i still wear the body paint of an assistant psychological researcher but i am better suited to the research for this part of the project than he is can you tell me why drucker asked jonathan yeager shook his head seeing that gesture instead of one from a scaly hand made drucker feel at home even though the american had told him no yeager said i am told you will be able to go home soon yes if i have any home left drucker answered i do not know whether my kin are alive or dead i hope they are well jonathan yeager said i look forward to going home myself i have been up here since the war began the race judged it was not safe for me to leave i would say that was likely to be true drucker agreed we fought hard i know yeager said but did you really think you could win did i think so drucker shook his head i did not think we had a chance but what could i do when your leaders tell you to go to war you go to war they must have thought we could win or they would not have started fighting they were jonathan yeager broke off shaking his head hed been about to say something like they were pretty stupid if they did drucker would have argued with him if he hadnt felt the same way the crisis had started while himmler was f uhrer and kaltenbrunner hadnt done anything to make it go away on the contrary hed charged right ahead fools rush in drucker thought he wondered how general dornberger would shape up as the new leader of the reich he also wondered how much trouble the ss would give the new fuhrer dornberger hadnt come up through the ranks of the blackshirts hed been soldiering since the first world war the secret policemen might not like him very well drucker had no sympathy for the ss not after theyd tried to get rid of his wife on the grounds that she had a jewish grandmother if all the blackshirts suffered unfortunate accidents he wouldnt shed a tear with ss men in charge of things his country had suffered an unfortunate accident except it hadnt been an accident kaltenbrunner had started the war on purpose something else occurred to him is it true what some males of the race have told me that france is to be made independent again i mean yes that is true jonathan yeager told him from the news reports i have seen the french are happy about it too he sounded pretty happy himself he was after all an american and the usa and germany had been at war when the lizards came they still didnt get along very well and gloating at a rivals misfortune was a constant all over the world and probably among the race as well i do not care whether they are happy or not drucker said it will mean a weaker germany and a weaker germany means a stronger race he was sure the lizards were recording every word he said he didnt much care theyd captured him theyd beaten his country if they thought he loved them because of it they were crazy back in the cubicle jonathan yeager shared with kassquit he said strange to think i was just talking with a male who could have killed both of us when kassquit made the affirmative gesture she almost poked him in the nose as far as jonathan was concerned the cubicle would have been cramped for her alone being smaller than people lizards built smaller too but she was used to it shed lived in a cubicle like this her whole life she said you can take off those foolish wrappings now you do not need them any more no i suppose not i certainly do not need them to keep me warm jonathan used an emphatic cough as he kicked off the shorts the lizards kept the starship at a temperature comfortable for them one that matched a hot summers day in los angeles even shorts made him sweat more than he would have without them kassquit was naked too shed never worn clothes not after shed got out of diapers the lizards ttomalss in particular had raised her ever since she was a newborn theyd wanted to see how close they could come to turning a human into a female of the race jonathan shaved his head plenty of kids of his generation girls as well as boys though not so many did that aping the lizards and incidentally annoying their parents kassquit shaved not only her head including her eyebrows but all the hair on her body in an effort to make herself as much like a lizard as she could shed told him once that shed thought about having her ears removed to make her head look more like a lizards and had decided against it only because she didnt think it would help enough she said i wonder if i will be allowed to meet him before he returns to the surface of tosev i should learn more about wild tosevites with a chuckle jonathan said i think he would be glad to meet you especially without wrappings the lizards language had no specific term for clothes which the race didnt use but could and did go into enormous detail about body paint what do you mean by earthly standards kassquit had a remorselessly literal mind do you mean he might want to mate with me would he find me attractive enough to want to mate with of course he would i certainly do jonathan used another emphatic cough he always praised kassquit as extravagantly as he could she unfolded like a flower when he did he got the idea the lizards hadnt bothered or maybe they just hadnt known people needed such things whenever he thought kassquit acted strangely he had to step back and remind himself it was a wonder she got even to within shouting distance of sanity and he hadnt been lying she was of oriental descent living in gardena california which had a large japaneseamerican population hed got used to asian standards of beauty and by them she was more than pretty enough her shaved head didnt put him off either he knew plenty of girls at ucla who shaved theirs the only thing truly odd about her was her expression or lack of expression her face was almost masklike she hadnt learned to smile when she was a baby lizards could hardly smile back at her and it was evidently too late after that she asked would you be upset if i decided to mate with him she didnt have much in the way of tact either to keep from examining his own feelings right away jonathan answered even if he finds you attractive i am not sure he would want to mate with you he is concerned with his own mate down in the reich and does not know her fate i see kassquit said slowly jonathan wondered if she really did she hadnt known anything about the emotional attachments men and women could form till she started making love with me he thought he hadnt wanted to explain to the german spaceman the sort of sociological research project in which he was engaged it was really more the lizards project not his he was just along for the ride he chuckled they brought me up here and put me out to stud he wondered how much theyd learned hed certainly learned a lot he went over to kassquit and put a hand on her shoulder she squeezed him she liked being touched he got the idea she hadnt been touched a whole lot before he came up to the starship touching was a human trait not one the race shared to anywhere near the same degree he will be going down to his notempire before long kassquit said truth jonathan agreed and you will be going down to your notempire before long kassquit said you knew i would jonathan told her i cannot stay up here this is your place but it is not mine i understand that kassquit answered she spoke the language of the race as well as someone with a human mouth possibly could and why not it was the only language she knew she went on intellectually i understand that but you must understand jonathan that i will be sorry when you go i will be sad jonathan sighed and squeezed her though he didnt know whether that made things better or worse i am sorry he said i do not know what to do about that i wish there were something i could do you also have a female waiting for you on the surface of tosev even if she is not a female with whom you have arranged for permanent exclusive mating kassquit said yes i do jonathan admitted you have known that all along i never tried to keep it a secret from you he wondered if karen culpepper would still be his girl when he came home theyd been dating since high school when hed come up to the starship he hadnt expected to stay and he hadnt thought he would have that much explaining to do once he got back he hadnt really believed the nazis would be crazy enough to attack the lizards over poland but they had and hed been here for weeks and hed almost died a couple of times too karen would have an excellent notion of where he was and why hed come up here he didnt think shed be very happy about it you will go back to her you will mate with her you will forget about me kassquit said she didnt know it but she was reinventing the lines everyone whod ever lost a lover used i will never forget you jonathan said which was the truth but even if it was he doubted it consoled her much had someone told him the same thing it wouldnt have consoled him either can that really be so she asked you know many other tosevites to you i am only one of many to me you are the most important tosevite i have ever known she let her mouth fall open mimicking the way lizards laughed the size of the sample is small i admit but it is not likely to increase to any great degree soon why if i meet the deutsch male before he leaves the ship it will go up from two to three she wasnt trying to make him feel sorry for her he was sure of that she didnt have the guile to do any such thing no doubt because of the way shed been raised she was devastatingly frank he said you could make it larger if you came down to visit the united states you would be most welcome in my city hed started to say in my house but kassquit wouldnt be welcome in his house his father and mother and he too when he was there were raising a couple of lizard hatchlings who were kassquits exact inverses mickey and donald were being brought up as much like human beings as possible the race wouldnt be delighted to learn about that and kassquits first loyalty was inevitably to the lizards i may do that she said on the other fork of the tongue i may not too is it not a truth that there are tosevite diseases for which your physicians have as yet developed no vaccines yes that is a truth jonathan admitted kassquit continued from the races research it appears that some of these diseases are more severe for an adult than they would be for a hatchling i do not wish to risk my health my life for the sake of a visit to tosev interesting as it might otherwise be well i understand that jonathan made the affirmative gesture but surely other tosevites will be coming here to the starship getting away from the personal getting away from guilt he couldnt help feeling at leaving someone with whom hed been making love as often as he could was something of a relief i suppose so kassquit answered but still you must understand you will be the standard of comparison i will judge every other tosevite i meet every other male with whom i mate by what i have learned from and about you so he couldnt get away from the personal after all stammering a little he said that is a large responsibility for me i think you set a high standard kassquit told him if i thought otherwise i would not want to share this compartment with you and i would not want to go on mating with you would i and i do she put her arms around him she was as frank about what she liked as about what she didnt he kissed the top of her head an american girl would have tilted her face up for a kiss kassquit didnt kisses on the mouth and especially french kisses alarmed rather than exciting her they made love on the sleeping mat it was harder than a bed would have been but far softer than the metal flooring afterwards jonathan peeled off the rubber hed worn and tossed it in the trash he didnt flush such things he had no idea what latex would do to the lizards plumbing and didnt care to find out the hard way kassquit said i think i begin to understand something of tosevite sexual jealousy it must be close to what i felt when after the colonization fleet arrived ttomalss began paying much less attention to me because he was paying much more attention to felless a researcher newly revived from cold sleep maybe jonathan said he didnt know what kassquit had felt then he supposed it was something strong though because ttomalss had been still was as close to a mother and a father as kassquit had i think it must be kassquit said earnestly for i know much of that same feeling when i think of you mating with that other female down on the surface of tosev understand that this is not rational but it does not appear to be anything i can help either jonathan wasnt nearly sure karen would want to mate with him after he got back to gardena but if she didnt some other girl some other girl who not only was but wanted to be a human being would he had no doubt of that while kassquit now she knew more of what being human was all about and she would go back to hiving among the lizards i am sorry jonathan said i never meant to cause you pain or jealousy you were the one who wanted to know what tosevite sexuality was like and all i ever wanted to do was please you while i showed you i understand that and you have pleased me kassquit used an emphatic cough but then she went on you have also shown me that there are times when the pleasure cannot come unmixed with pain and jealousy from everything i gather about the behavior of wild tosevites this is not uncommon among you however alien her background and viewpoint she wasnt a fool she was anything but a fool jonathan had discovered that before and now got his nose rubbed in it shed just told him something about the way love worked that hed never quite figured out for himself he assumed the posture of respect before her and then had a devil of a time explaining why armed guards stood outside the compartment housing the deutsch captive kassquit hoped the males would never have to use their weapons the thought of bullets tearing through walls through electronics through hydraulics through spirits of emperors past only knew what all was genuinely terrifying she used an artificial fingerclaw to press the recessed button in the wall that opened the door after it slid aside she stepped into the cubicle i greet you johannes drucker she said pronouncing the alien name as carefully as she could and i greet you superior female the wild big ugly stood very straight and shot out his right arm from what jonathan yeager had told her that was his equivalent of the races posture of respect the strange gesture made him seem wilder than jonathan yeager he looked wilder too he was hairy all over with short thick brown hair streaked with gray growing on his cheeks and chin as well as the top of his head no one had given him a razor and he spoke the races language with an accent different from and thicker than jonathan yeagers he seemed to be trying not to study her body which was covered only by the body paint of a psychological researchers assistant kassquit remembered both jonathan and sam yeager behaving the same way at their first meeting coming right out and staring was evidently impolite but difficult to avoid he said they told me i would another tosevite visitor be having they did not bother telling me you would a female be tosevite sexes and sexuality are matters of amusement and alarm to the race but seldom matters of importance kassquit answered and though i am of tosevite ancestry i am not precisely a tosevite myself i am a citizen of the empire pride rang in her voice johannes drucker said i understand the words but i do not think i understand the meaning behind them i have been raised in this starship by the race from earliest hatchlinghood kassquit said until quite recently i never so much as met wild big uglies she hardly ever said big uglies around jonathan yeager when speaking to this much wilder tosevite it came out naturally i see the captive said his mouth twisted up at the corners the tosevite expression of amusement now that you have started us meeting what do you think kassquit couldnt imitate that expression try as she would she answered the ones i have met are somewhat less barbarous than i would have expected with a loud barking laugh the deutsch captive said danke schon seeing that kassquit didnt understand he returned to the language of the race that means i thank you very much you are welcome kassquit answered only after the words were out of her mouth did she stop and wonder whether hed been sarcastic to cover her confusion she changed the subject saying i am told you came close to destroying this starship yes that is a truth superior female he agreed why she asked war whether carried on by the race or by big uglies still seemed very strange to her no one aboard this ship was trying to do the reich any particular harm most males and females here are researchers not combatants she thought that a paralyzingly effective comment the wild big ugly only shrugged do you think all of the tosevites in the deutsch cities on which you dropped explosivemetal bombs were doing nothing but fighting the race kassquit hadnt really thought about that at all to her the deutsche had been nothing but the enemy now that johannes drucker pointed it out though she supposed most of them had just been going on with their lives that made her examine her own side in a way she hadnt before why she said again anything that the enemy serves a fair target is johannes drucker replied that is how we fight wars and we have seen that the race is not very different no one invited the race to come here and try to conquer tosev do you think it is any wonder that we as hard as we could fought back i suppose not admitted kassquit who hadnt tried to look at things from the tosevite point of view do you not think that you would be using explosivemetal bombs on one another if we had not come we the wild big ugly raised an eyebrow in what shed come to recognize as a gesture of irony superior female you have no scales that i can see i am still a citizen of the empire kassquit replied with dignity i would rather be a citizen of the empire than a tosevite peasant which i surely would have been had the race not chosen me how do you know johannes drucker asked are you happy here aboard this starship living with nothing but males and females of the race would you not be happier among your own kind even as a peasant kassquit wished he hadnt asked the question that particular way the older and the more conscious of her alienness shed become the less happy shed grown some of the males and females of the race were only too willing to rub her snout in that alienness too she answered how can i know how does one find an answer to a counterfactual question carefully the wild tosevite said for a moment kassquit thought he hadnt understood then she realized he was making a joke she let her mouth drop open for a moment to show shed got it he went on everyones life is full of counterfactuals suppose i this had done suppose i that had not done what would i be now dealing with the things that are real is hard enough that was also a truth kassquit made the affirmative gesture she said i am told you do not know what has happened to your mate and your hatchlings i hope they are well i thank you johannes drucker answered i wish i knew one way or the other then i would also how to go ahead know now i can only at the same time hope and worry what will you do if they are dead kassquit asked not until the question was out did she think to wonder whether she should have asked it by then of course it was too late though still imperfectly familiar with the facial expressions wild big uglies used she was sure johannes druckers did not show delight he said the only thing i can do then is try to put my life back together one piece at a time it is not easy but it happens all the time it is certainly all the time in the reich happening now males and females of the race are also having to rebuild their lives kassquit pointed out and the race did not start this war the reich did no matter who started it it is over now the wild big ugly said the race won the reich lost putting the pieces back together is always easier for the winners was that a truth or only an opinion since kassquit wasnt sure she didnt challenge it she asked if your mate is dead will you seek another one you have all sorts of awkward questions is it not so johannes drucker laughed a loud tosevite laugh but still did not seem amused kassquit did not think he would answer but he did i cannot tell you that now it depends on how i feel and it also depends on whether i meet a female i find interesting and what makes a female interesting kassquit asked the wild big ugly laughed again not only awkward questions but questions different from the ones the males of the race the military males have asked what makes a female interesting ask a thousand male tosevites and you will have a thousand answers maybe two thousand i did not ask a thousand male tosevites i asked you kassquit said so you did instead of mocking her johannes drucker paused and thought what makes a female interesting partly the way she looks partly the way she acts and part of it of course depends on whether she me interesting finds too sometimes a male will find a female interesting but not the other way round and sometimes a female will want a male who does not want her i think the races mating season is a much tidier much less stressful way of handling reproduction kassquit said i am sure it is for the race the wild big ugly said but it is not how tosevites do things we can only what we are be confronting her own differences from the race kassquit had seen that too culture went a long way toward minimizing those differences but could not delete them she wondered whether to ask johannes drucker if he found her attractive and whether to use an affirmative answer if she got one to initiate mating in the end she decided not to ask none of his words showed he might be interested neither did his reproductive organ which was liable to be a more accurate or at least less deceitful indicator as she left the compartment she wondered if her decision would please jonathan yeager he was quiet when she returned to the compartment he did not ask her whether shed mated with the deutsch captive it was as if he did not want to know he did not have much to say about anything else either kassquit didnt care for that shed grown used to talking with the wild but not too wild tosevite about almost everything she felt empty alone when he responded so little at last she decided to confront things directly i did not mate with johannes drucker she said all right jonathan yeager answered still not showing much animation but then he asked why not he did not show much interest kassquit replied and i did not want to make you unhappy i thank you for that he said i thank you for thinking of me he hesitated then went on you ought to think of yourself too you know kassquit had thought of herself as a member of the race or as close an approximation to a member of the race as she could be shed given little thought to herself as an individual she hadnt been encouraged to give much thought to herself as an individual she said does it not seem that wild tosevites especially wild american tosevites concern themselves too much with their individual concerns and not enough with the concerns of their society he shrugged i do not know anything about that but if the individuals are happy how can the society be unhappy big uglies had a knack for turning things on their head the race always thought of society first if society was well ordered then individuals would be happy to look at individuals first was probably the mark of american tosevites with their mania for snoutcounting do you know that you are subversive she asked jonathan yeager when his eyes narrowed and the corners of his mouth turned up she responded to his amusement even if she couldnt duplicate the expression genetic programming she thought it couldnt be anything else he said i hope so as far as we tosevites are concerned a lot about the race could use subverting had he said that when he first came up to the starship she would have been furious but now she had seen that he had his own way of looking at things different from hers from his sense of perspective she was beginning to get one of her own she said well you are halfway to subverting me they both laughed as a senior researcher ttomalss stayed busy on a wide variety of projects some his own others assigned him by his superiors staying busy was what he got for being an expert on the big uglies of course his research on kassquit remained an important part of his work now that she was an adult though he did not have to give her constant attention as he had when she was a hatchling he still recorded everything that went on in her compartment he would do that as long as she lived she was far too valuable a specimen to let any data go to waste even if ttomalss couldnt evaluate all of it some other analyst would in years or generations to come the race would be a long time figuring out what made the tosevites respond as they did because he had been involved in her life so long and so closely ttomalss still evaluated as much of the raw data as he could kassquits interactions with jonathan yeager had taught him as much about the big uglies sexual dynamics as hed learned anywhere else those interactions had also taught him a great deal about the limits of cultural indoctrination for tosevites well you are halfway to subverting me kassquit had told the wild big ugly a couple of days before ttomalss reviewed the audio and video both tosevites had used their barking laughter so ttomalss presumed she was making a joke hearing it hurt even so because he feared truth lay beneath it you cannot hatch a beffel out of a tsiongis egg was a proverb older than the unification of home hed done his best with kassquit and had improved his chances of turning her into something close to a female of the race by not allowing her any contact with wild big uglies till she was an adult as he pondered the recording kept playing in his monitor before long kassquit and jonathan yeager were mating watching them ttomalss let out a small irritated hiss hed known how corrosive a force tosevite sexuality was now he was seeing it again he moved the recording back to kassquits telling jonathan yeager she had not mated with the other big ugly aboard the starship ttomalss had wondered whether she would hed made a point of not mentioning the subject so he could avoid influencing her actions since shed become acquainted with the pleasures of mating he had rather expected that she would indulge herself but no pair bonding he said and his computer recorded the words because kassquit is presently satisfied with jonathan yeager as a sexual partner she seeks no other these bonds of sexual attraction and the bonds of kinship that spring from them create the passionate attachments so characteristic of big uglies and so dangerous to the race the trouble is he thought that big uglies calculate less than we do if they are outraged because of harm that has come to individuals for whom they have conceived one of these passionate attachments they will seek revenge without regard for their own safety preventing damage from big uglies willing even eager to die if they can also hurt us is very difficult ttomalss wondered if that hadnt been the motivation behind the reichs attack on the race more than any of the big uglies other independent notempires the greater german reich struck him as a tosevite family writ large the notemperors of the reich had always stressed the ties of kinship existing among their males and females they had also stressed the innate superiority of the deutsche over all other varieties of tosevites ttomalss like other researchers from the race and like non deutsch big uglies was convinced that was drivel but the deutsche really believed it and believing in their own superiority believing in the wisdom of their notemperors because those leaders were perceived as kin the deutsche had charged off to war against the race without so much as a second thought ttomalss wondered if they the survivors a decided minority still relied so blindly on the wisdom of those leaders but he did not have to wonder not with a deutsch tosevite aboard this very starship he paid another visit to the compartment where johannes drucker was housed the big ugly who had almost destroyed the ship saluted him and said i greet you superior sir he did not make a difficult captive much to the relief of every male and female of the race aboard the starship and i greet you ttomalss said tell me how do you feel about the leaders of your notempire who took you into a losing war i always thought anyone who wanted the race to attack was a fool the big ugly replied at once his syntax strange but understandable i have in space been after all i know and always did know the race is stronger than the reich i blame my leaders for their ignorance that was a sensible answer a member of the race might have said much the same thing if you believed them to be fools ttomalss asked why did you and the other deutsche obey them without question i do not know johannes drucker said why did the males of your conquest fleet when they saw tosev was so different from what they had expected keep on saying it shall be done to your leaders even after those leaders ordered them to do many foolish things that is different ttomalss said testily how superior sir the deutsch male asked the answer should be obvious ttomalss said and changed the subject what will you and your fellow deutsche do if your new notemperor tries to lead you into further misadventures i do not believe he will johannes drucker said i have known him for some time he is an able sensible male ttomalss doubted druckers objectivity in any case the big ugly had been too literalminded to suit him let me rephrase that the psychological researcher said what will you deutsche do if some future leader seeks to lead you into misadventures i do not know johannes drucker answered how can i know until a thing happens seeing he wasnt going to get anywhere on that line of questioning ttomalss tried another what do you think of the female kassquit johannes drucker let out several yips of tosevite laughter i never expected a female tosevite aboard your starship to meet especially one without any wrappings he had to cast about to find the term the race used it made life here more entertaining than i thought it would be entertaining that was hardly the word ttomalss would have used did you find yourself interested in mating with her the big ugly shook his head then used the races negative hand gesture for one thing i hope my own mate is still alive down in the reich for another i did not think kassquit was interested in mating with me ttomalss wasnt so sure johannes drucker was right about that but gave no sign of what he thought the tosevite continued and i did not her attractive find or not very i like females with he gestured to show he meant hair and with faces that move more kassquit cannot help the way her face behaves ttomalss said that seems to happen when the race raises tosevites from hatchlinghood you have it with others tried drucker sounded accusing ttomalss hoped he was misreading the big ugly but didnt think so before he could answer drucker added i suppose it is a wonder that she is not more nearly insane than she is in fact in a way that casual comment infuriated ttomalss in another way he understood it judged by tosevite standards he couldnt have done a perfect job of raising kassquit despite his years of effort he said she is satisfied with her life here but naturally she knows no other johannes drucker said if she did know another life it would be as a chinese peasant ttomalss said do you think that would be preferable to what she has now johannes drucker started to say something then hesitated at last he answered i asked her this myself she could not judge i do not find it easy to decide either if you raise an animal in a laboratory is that preferable to the life the animal would in the wild have led the animal may live longer and be better fed but it is not free you big uglies value freedom more than the race does ttomalss said that is because we more of it have known the big ugly said your males of the conquest fleet have seen far more freedom than the males and females of the colonization fleet do they not prefer it more too how could you know that ttomalss asked in surprise with another loud barking laugh drucker answered i listen to the conversations you of the race among yourselves have radio intercepts are an important part of the business you now you know us tosevites pretty well so i would guess you are from the conquest fleet is that a truth or not a truth it is a truth ttomalss admitted i thought so the deutsch tosevite said you have a goodsized piece of your life here spent it is natural that we have changed because the race came to tosev is it so surprising that coming to tosev has changed the race too surprising yes it is surprising ttomalss answered the race does not change easily the race has never changed easily we changed very little when we conquered the rabotevs and the hallessi were those conquests easy or difficult johannes drucker asked easy much much easier than the conquest of tosev the big ugly nodded again then remembered the races affirmative gesture you did not need to learn anything from them when fighting against us you have had no choice he paused his face assumed an expression even ttomalss with his experience in reading tosevite physiognomy had trouble interpreting was it amusement the look of a big ugly with a secret contempt he couldnt tell johannes drucker went on you may end up finding that freedom causes you even more trouble than ginger i doubt that would be possible ttomalss said tartly johannes drucker laughed yet again ignorant big ugly ttomalss thought aloud he continued anyone would think you were a tosevite from the snoutcounting notempire of the united states not from the reich where your notemperor has more power than the true emperor he cast down his eye turrets at the mention of his revered sovereign we still have more freedom than you do the deutsch tosevite insisted nonsense ttomalss said think of what your notempire does to those of the jewish superstition how can you claim you are more free we do not do anything like that to members of the race that hit home on johannes drucker harder than ttomalss had expected the big ugly turned a darker shade of pinkish beige and looked down at the metal floor of the compartment not in reverence ttomalss judged but in embarrassment still not looking at ttomalss drucker mumbled the rest of us have more freedom how can you say that ttomalss asked how can any be free when some are not free how can you say you are free when you tried to conquer our whole world and enslave us the tosevite returned it is not the same ttomalss said after the conquest is complete tosevites will have the same rights as all other citizens of the empire regardless of species whether we wanted to join the empire or not where is the freedom in that you do not understand you willfully refuse to understand ttomaiss said and gave up on his interview with the obstreperous big ugly sam yeager called out to his wife hey hon cmere weve got an electronic message from jonathan what has he got to say for himself this time barbara asked but she was waving a hand when she hurried into the study no dont tell me let me read it for myself she adjusted her bifocals on her nose so she could more readily see the screen hell be home pretty soon will he she let out a long sigh of relief well thank heaven for that you said it sam agreed hed been sighing with relief every day since the germans surrendered he hadnt thought the nazis would start their war against the lizards he knew the reich was fighting out of its weight against the race and so he assumed the nazi bigwigs knew the same thing that hadnt proved such a good assumption jonathan had been up in space when the war started if a german missile had hit his starship barbara said i dont know how we could have gone on if anything had happened to jonathan i didnt think anything would sam answered if anything had happened to his only son after hed encouraged jonathan to go into space he didnt know how hed be able to go on living with barbara either for that matter he didnt know how hed be able to go on living with himself its all right now anyhow he said that as much to convince himself as to remind his wife and barbara did something shed never done in all the weeks since the war between the reich and the race broke out and endangered their son she put a hand on sams shoulder and said yes i guess it is he leaned back in his swivel chair and reached up to set his hand on hers if she was going to forgive him hed make the most of it i love you hon he said looks as if were together for the long haul after all that as if was a tribute to the long haul theyd already put in barbara had done graduate work in middle english before the fighting and was as precise a grammarian as any schoolmarm ever born and over more than twenty years her precision had rubbed off on sam he wondered if they did have as long a haul ahead as behind hed just turned fiftyeight would they still be married when he was eighty would he still be around when he was eighty he had his hopes so it does she smiled down at him as he was grinning up at her i like the idea she said youd better by now he said which made her smile broader but his own grin slipped on the other hand you know im liable to softly and suddenly vanish away because the snark i found damn well is a boojum he spoke elliptically whenever he spoke of what hed found with the help of some computer coding from a lizard expatriate named sorviss he spoke elliptically he didnt know who might be listening he didnt know how much good speaking elliptically would do him either barbara said they wouldnt but her voice lacked conviction sam said they might we know too well they might if they do though theyll be sorry because if anything happens to me the word will get out one way or another he chuckled of course that might be too late to do me a whole lot of good the story of samson in the temple never was my favorite but its the best hope i have these days that we should need such things barbara said and shook her head i just wish you hadnt squeezed it out of me yeager said now youre liable to be in danger too on account of it think of me as one of your lifeinsurance policies barbara said thats what i am because ill start shouting from the housetops if anything happens to you thats the best way i know of to get you out of a jam if you should get into one they cant stand the light of day or maybe i should say the light of publicity thats true enough sam agreed and so it was to a point if he and barbara both softly and suddenly vanished away she wouldnt have the chance to start shouting from the housetops presumably those who might be interested in silence could figure that out too yeager didnt mention it to his wife anybody could foul up hed seen that a foulup on the other sides part could well give her the chance to play the role shed talked about he said were liable to be worrying over nothing i hope we are im even starting to think we are if theyd found out where ive been id think they would have dropped on me by now probably barbara looked poised to say something else on the same subject but a crash from the kitchen distracted her oh god she exclaimed what have those two gone and done now she hurried away to find out something where well need to sweep up the pieces sam answered not that that counted for much in the way of prophecy he got up from his chair and followed barbara he was in the living room halfway between the study and the kitchen when he heard a door slam in the back part of the house he started to laugh so did barbara though he wasnt sure she was actually amused those little scamps she said there theyll be pretending as hard as they can that theyre innocent theyre learning yeager said any kid will do that kind of thing till his folks put a stop to it and were the only folks mickey and donald have the shattered remains of what had been a serving bowl lay all over the linoleum of the kitchen floor barbara clucked in dismay at the size of the mess then she clucked again that bowl was in the dish drainer she said theyre growing like weeds but i dont think theyre big enough to reach it not since i shoved it back sideways against the wall there sam examined the scene of the crime no chair pushed up against the counter he said musingly i wonder if one of them stood on the other ones back that would be interesting it would show theyre really starting to cooperate with each other now if only theyd start cooperating to clean up the messes they make but that would be too much to ask for wouldnt it barbara rolled her eyes sometimes its too much to ask for from jonathan or even from someone else i might mention i havent got the faintest idea who whom youre talking about sam said barbara rolled her eyes again more extravagantly than before but when she started for the broom closet sam shook his head thatll wait for a couple of minutes hon we cant let mickey and donald think they got away with it or else theyll try the same thing again tomorrow youre right barbara said if we read them the riot act they may wait till day after tomorrow if were lucky they may sam laughed though he knew perfectly well she hadnt been kidding side by side they walked to the bedroom the two lizard hatchlings they were raising called their own up till a few months before the door to that bedroom had been latched on the outside almost all the time the baby lizards essentially little wild animals would have torn up the house without even knowing what they were doing now they know some of what theyre doing and they still tear up the house sam thought is that an improvement he opened the door mickey and donald stood against the far wall if they could have disappeared altogether they looked as if they would have done it even donald bigger and more rambunctious than his brother seemed abashed which didnt happen very often yeager held up a piece of the broken bowl by the way the hatchlings cringed he might have been showing a couple of vampires a crucifix no no he said in a loud ostentatiously angry voice dont play with dishes are you ever going to play with dishes again both baby lizards shook their heads theyd learned the gesture from barbara and jonathan and him they didnt know the one the race used neither one of them said anything they didnt talk much though they understood a startling amount human babies picked up language much faster the lizards would have been amazed that the hatchlings were talking at all yeager chuckled under his breath barbara and i were bad influences he thought though behind in language mickey and donald were miles ahead of human toddlers in every aspect of physical development theyd hatched able to run around and catch food for themselves and theyd grown like weeds since evolution making sure not so many things were able to catch them they were already well on their way toward their full adult size sam remained a towering figure though and used his height and deep booming voice to good advantage youd better not go messing with mommy barbaras china he roared or youll be in big big trouble have you got that the young lizards nodded they had a pretty good notion of what trouble meant or at least that it was a good thing to avoid yeager nodded at them all right then he said you behave yourselves you hear mickey and donald both nodded some more satisfied hed put the fear of god in them at least till the next time sam let it go at that he didnt spank them save as a very last resort he hadnt spanked jonathan much either and jonathan hadnt had such formidable teeth with which to defend himself maybe the lizards have the right idea about bringing up their babies barbara said as she and sam went up the hall what except for making sure they dont kill themselves or one another leaving them pretty much alone till theyre three or four years old sam said itd be less work yeah but weve got a big head start on civilizing them weve got a big head start on exhaustion is what weve got barbara said we were a lot younger when we did this with jonathan and there was only one of him and hes human pretty much so sam agreed and his wife snorted he went on the one i take off my hat to is the lizard who raised kassquit he had to be mommy and daddy both give her attention all the time clean up her messes for years thats dedication to your research it wasnt fair to her though barbara said youve talked a lot about how strange she is well she is strange yeager said and no two ways about it but i dont think shes nearly as strange as she might have been if you know what i mean in the scheme of things she might have been a lot squirrellier than just wishing she were a lizard and he lowered his voice his own conscience was far from clear god only knows were going to raise a couple of squirrelly hatchlings well learn from them barbara had a lot of pure scholar left in her the lizards have learned a lot from kassquit sam answered i wonder if she thanks them for it but he didnt wonder he knew she did if mickey and donald ended up thanking him maybe hed be able to look at himself in a mirror maybe when monique dutourd had fled down into the bomb shelter below her brothers flat marseille like all of france had belonged to the greater german reich she and pierre and his lover lucie and everyone else in the shelter had had to dig their way out too when they ran low on food and water she wished theyd been able to stay longer she might have avoided the bout of nausea and vomiting that had wracked her but she was better now and her hair hadnt fallen out as had happened to so many whod been closer to the bomb the lizards dropped on her city of course tens of thousands whod been closer still were no longer among the living but those who survived were once more citizens of the republique francaise monique had been a girl when france surrendered to germany and only a couple of years older than that when the lizards drove the nazis and their puppets in vichy away from marseille but when the fighting ended france had returned to german hands and the germans hadnt bothered with ruling through puppets in the south any more now monique could walk through the outskirts of marseille without worrying about ss men if that wasnt a gift from god she didnt know what was she could even think about looking for a university position in roman history again and if she got one she would be able to say whatever she pleased about the germanic invaders whod helped bring down the roman empire hello sweetheart a man waved to her from behind the table on which hed set up his wares interested in anything ive got he looked to be selling military gear the germans whod survived the explosivemetal bombing of marseille had left behind when theyd been required to make their way back to the reich by the way he tugged at his ratty trousers that junk might not have been what hed been trying to interest her in since she wanted no more of him than she did of his junk she stuck her nose in the air and kept walking he laughed not a bit abashed and asked the next woman he saw the same not quite lewd question as monique drew closer to the region the bomb had wrecked she saw an enormous banner down but not out she smiled liking that france had been down a long time longer than ever before in her history perhaps but she was on her feet again now even if shakily a lot of lizards were on the streets of marseille the streets on the fringes of town the streets that hadnt been melted to slag by a temperature on the same order as those found in the sun returned french independence was one of the prices the lizards had extracted from the nazis in exchange for accepting their surrender monique hoped it wasnt the only or even the largest price the race had extracted from the reich back when marseille belonged to the germans a lot of the lizards who visited the city had been furtive characters theyd come to buy ginger and often to sell drugs humans found entertaining monique had no doubt a lot of them were still here for those purposes but they didnt have to be furtive any more nowadays they were the ones who propped up french independence what policeman would want to give them any trouble even more to the point what policeman would have the nerve to give them trouble they didnt occupy france as the germans had they didnt carry away everything movable as the doryphores colorado beetles in fieldgray had but france wasnt strong enough to stand on her own even against the battered enfeebled radioactive reich so the lizards had to prop up the new fourth republic and of course they had to be listened to of course monique turned a corner and found what she was looking for a little square where farmers down from the hills around town sold their cheeses and vegetables and smoked and salted meats to the survivors of the bombing for the most bloodthirsty prices they could extort how much for your haricots verts she asked a peasant with a battered cloth cap on his head stubble on his cheeks and chin and a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth fifty reichsmarks a kilo he answered and paused to look her up and down he grinned not very pleasantly or a blow job if youd rather for green beans thats outrageous monique said i have ham too the farmer said if you want to blow me for ham we can work something out i expect no your price in money monique said impatiently she didnt have to give this bastard anything she didnt want to he wasnt an ss man ill pay you thirty reichsmarks a kilo german money was the only kind in circulation new francs were promised but had yet to appear fifty take it or leave it the farmer didnt sound put out that shed failed to fall to her knees but he went on for once in my life i dont have to haggle if you wont pay me what i want somebody else will and you wont get a better price from anyone else around he was almost certainly right when the roads and railroads get fixed youll sing a different tune monique said all the better reason to get what i can now he answered do you want these beans or dont you like i say if you dont somebody will give me two kilos monique had the money her brother pierre had more money than he knew what to do with even at the obscene prices for which things were selling nowadays the lizards had bought a lot of ginger from him over the years and germans and frenchmen had bought a lot of goods hed got from the lizards after monique paid the peasant she held out her stringbag a universal french shopping tool and he poured haricots verts into it when he stopped she hefted the sack and glared at him grudgingly he doled out a few more beans getting cheated on price was one thing getting cheated on weight was something else hefting the stringbag again monique supposed hed come close to giving her the proper amount she bought potatoes from another farmer one who refrained from offering to take his price in venery of course his wife a woman of formidable proportions was standing beside him which probably had something to do with his restraint then monique headed back to the vast tent city outside of town that housed the many survivors whod come through even when their homes hadnt the tent city smelled like a barnyard she supposed that was inevitable since it had no running water the romans no doubt would have taken such odors as an inevitable part of urban life monique didnt couldnt she wished her nose would go to sleep whenever she had to come back a boy who couldnt have been older than eight tried to steal her vegetables she walloped him on the bottom hard enough to send him off yowling if hed asked her for some she probably would have given them to him but she wouldnt put up with thieves not even thieves in short pants as shed had to share a flat with her brother and his lover now she had to share a tent with them when she ducked inside she discovered they had company a lizard with impressively fancy body paint he jerked in alarm when she came through the tent flap lucie spoke reassuringly in the lizards language monique didnt speak it but caught the tone she wondered if it worked as well on the lizard as it would have on a human male lucie wasnt much to look at being pudgy and plain but she had the sexiest voice monique had ever heard pierre dutourd was also pudgy and plain so they made a good pair or at least a wellmatched one he was ten years older than monique and the difference looked even wider than it was how did you do she hefted the stringbag everything is too expensive she answered but the haricots verts and the potatoes looked pretty good so i got them excuse me the lizard said in hissing french is it that these foods were grown in the local soil but of course monique answered why because in that case they are liable to be in some measure radioactive the lizard replied your health would be better if you did not eat them they are the only food we can get monique said acid in her voice would our health be better if we starved to death well no the lizard admitted but why can you not get more healthful alimentation why monique wanted to hit him over the head with the stringbag because the race has dropped explosivemetal bombs all over france thats why she turned to pierre do you always deal with idiots keffesh isnt an idiot her brother answered and patted the lizard on the shoulder hes just new in marseille and doesnt understand the way things here are right now hes been buying and selling down in the south pacific till the war disrupted things well he ought to think a little before he talks monique snapped who is this badtempered person the lizard named keffesh asked pierre my sister he answered she is badtempered i agree but she will not betray you you may rely on that by the way keffeshs eye turrets swung back and forth he didnt want to rely on anything he stuck out his tongue at pierre as a human being might have pointed with an index finger it could be he said now that hed started speaking french he seemed content to stick with it but may i rely on you if you cannot bring in food and have to eat supplies that are possibly contaminated how is it that you will be able to bring in supplies of the herb my kind craves so much lucie laughed monique didnt know what if anything that did to keffesh it certainly would have got any human males complete and undivided attention lucie said that is very simple there is little profit in food there is great profit in ginger of course ginger will move where food would not ah keffesh said yes that is sensible very well then monique shook her head and set down the sack of vegetables she had no doubt lucie was right what did that say about the way things worked in the world that the coming of the lizards hadnt changed things much of all the conclusions she contemplated that was oddson the most depressing rance auerbach contemplated another perfect tahitian day it was warm a little humid with clouds rolling across the blue sky he could look out the window of the apartment he shared with penny summers and see the even bluer south pacific he turned away from the lovely spectacle and lit a cigarette smoking made him cough which hurt hed lost most of a lung and taken other damage from a lizard bullet during the fighting doctors told him he was cutting years off his life by not quitting too goddamn bad he thought and took another drag he limped into the kitchen and got himself a beer let me have one of those too will you penny called from the bedroom when she heard him open it okay his voice was a ruined rasp he popped the top off another beer walking back to give it to her hurt too another bullet from the same burst of fire had left him with a shattered leg here you go babe thanks she told him she was also smoking a cigarette in quick nervous puffs she grabbed the beer and raised it high heres to crime he drank he would have drunk to anything but he laughed too didnt know there was any such thing in free france ha she said and brushed a lock of dyed blond hair back off her cheek she was in her early forties a few years younger than rance and could pass for younger still because of the energy she showed now the next interesting question is how much longer will there be a free france now that theres a real france again you expect the froggies to sail out here with gunboats and take over after a long sentence rance had to pause and suck in air i dont think thats awful goddamn likely gunboats no neither do i but airplanes full of clerks and cops penny grimaced i wouldnt be half surprised and theyre liable to kill the goose that laid the golden egg if they do as far as power went free france was a joke it couldnt hold out for twenty minutes if the empire of japan or the usa or the race decided to invade it but none of them had because a place under nobodys thumb where people and lizards could make deals without anybody looking over their shoulders was too useful to all concerned how would that look though to a pack of functionaries back in paris not good we came here to get out from under rance said in his texas drawl what do we do if that doesnt work go somewheres else penny answered at once her kansas accent was as harsh as his was soft im thinkin about it how about you yeah he was surprised at how readily he admitted it tahiti with no laws to speak of with shameless native girls who didnt bother covering their tits half the time had been awfully attractive till he got here one thing nobody mentioned about the native girls was how often they had hulking badtempered native boyfriends and with no law to speak of he often felt like a sardine in a tank full of sharks where have you got in mind well like you said if the froggies get their hands on this place theyll squeeze it till its eyes pop penny said so what i was figuring was maybe going back to france its a lot bigger than tahiti you know they wont have half the cops and things they need to keep an eye on everybody on account of the nazis have been doing so much of that for so long if i had a hat id take it off to you rance said thats one of the sneakiest things i ever heard in all my born days of course theres a good deal to france if you know what i mean you have any place in particular in mind or just sort of all over the country hows marseille sound to you penny asked auerbach made motions of tipping the hat he wasnt wearing and sticking it back on his head are you out of your everloving mind he demanded do you remember what happened to us the last time we were in marseille the germans almost gave us a blindfold and a cigarette and lined us up against the wall and shot us thats right penny said placidly so what so what rance would have screamed but he didnt have the lungs for it perhaps because he couldnt make a lot of noise he had to think before saying anything else after thinking he felt foolish oh he said no more nazis right penny grinned at him bingo see youre not so dumb after all maybe not but maybe i am and maybe you are too rance said didnt marseille have an explosivemetal bomb land on its head yeah i think it did penny answered but so what again some of the ginger dealersll still be around and if the place got shaken up good that gives us a better chance to set up shop there rance thought about it at first it sounded pretty crazy then he liked the idea after that though he hesitated again going to be plenty of lizards in marseille or in whatevers left of it he remarked i hope so penny exclaimed you think i want to sell all the ginger weve got to a bunch of cooks in a restaurant but rance was shaking his head thats not what i meant you wait and see therell be lots of lizards all over france pretending theyre not telling the frenchmen what to do if they werent there how long would it be before the nazis were telling the frenchmen what to do again oh now penny saw what he was driving at thats right auerbach said if there are officialtype lizards all over france and you can bet your bottom dollar there will be they arent going to be real happy with us go ahead tell me im wrong penny looked glum cant do it goddammit good rance knew he had relief in his voice the lizards had arrested both of them in mexico for selling ginger and tried to use them in marseille to trap a smuggler the germans had fouled that up but the race had been grateful enough to set rance and penny up in south africa where theyd gone into the ginger business again and barely managed to escape a threecornered firefight with enough gold to come to tahiti but penny still looked discontented we cant stay here forever either even if the real french dont clamp down on the free french we arent doing enough business were too small and everything is expensive as hell do you want to try going back to the states auerbach asked we havent done anything illegal there american law doesnt care about ginger one way or the other if we went home i wouldnt be worrying about the law penny said rance could only nod about that shed come back into his life years after they broke up because she was on the run from gingersmuggling associates shed stiffed they hadnt been happy with her for keeping the fee she got from the lizards instead of turning it over to them and they werent happy with rance either hed killed a couple of their hired thugs whod come to his apartment to take the price for that ginger out of pennys hide he sighed which made him cough which made him wince which made him take another swig of beer to try to put out the fire inside him it didnt work it never worked but he drank an awful lot as he had ever since he was wounded enough hooch and he didnt feel things so much penny said if we cant stay here and we cant go to france and we cant go to the states what the hell can we do we can stay here quite a while if we sit tight auerbach answered we can go back to the states too and not have anybody notice us if we sit tight i dont want to sit tight penny paced around the bedroom she paused only to light another cigarette which she started smoking even more savagely than she had the first one all the time i lived in kansas i spent sitting tight that was the only thing people knew how to do there and ill sit tight when im dead in between the one and the other im going to live dammit i might have known you were going to say that rance remarked hell i did know you were going to say it but it doesnt help right now you know penny set her hands on her hips and exhaled an angry cloud of smoke okay hotshot youre so goddamn smart you keep thinking up reasons why we cant do this that or the other thing what do you figure we ought to do if i had my druthers id go back to the states auerbach said slowly ive got a little pension waiting for me and penny laughed a flaying scornful laugh oh yeah hell of a life you were living back there you just bet it was rance his ears heated hed had that miserable little apartment in fort worth and hed been drinking himself to death an inch at a time there for excitement hed go down to the veterans hall and play poker with the other fellows whod been left wrecked but not quite dead theyd all heard one anothers stories endless times often enough to keep a straight face while pretending to believe the juiciest parts of the lies the other fellows told if he went back hed fall into that same rut again he knew it that was how hed lived for a long time life with penny summers was a great many things but a rut never a roller coaster perhaps christ a roller coaster certainly but not a rut tahiti just wont be the same he said mournfully no matter what happens it wont be the same and our gold wont stretch as far as we hoped it would down in cape town hed almost got killed on account of that gold but it wasnt enough no matter how much blood had been spilled over it what does that leave then penny said englands too close to the nazis to be comfortable and the same people do business in canada as in the usa he pointed an accusing finger at her i know whats up you want to go back to france and you dont give a good goddamn how stupid it is for once he caught penny without a snappy comeback from which he concluded he was dead right his girlfriend did laugh again this time ruefully if you were younger and dumber id take you to bed with me and by the time i was through youd swear going back there was your idea if i was younger and dumber id be a lot happier either that or dead one rance drank the last beer in the bottle you want to take me to bed anyhow who knows how dumb ill be afterwards penny reached up to the back of her neck and undid the halter top she was wearing she pulled down her white linen shorts kicked them off to one side and stood there naked her body had yielded very little to time why the hell not she said come here guy afterwards they lay side by side sweaty and sated auerbach reached out with a lazy hand and tweaked her nipple what the hell he said you talked me into it how about that penny answered and i didnt even have to say anything i must not know what a persuasive gal i am that made rance laugh every woman ever born is persuasive that way if she feels like using it of course he watched penny cloud up and hastened to amend his words some are more persuasive than others the clouds went away penny turned practical we shouldnt have much trouble getting into france and our papers probably wont have to be too good the frenchiesll take a while to figure out what theyre supposed to be doing we should make quite a killing terrific rance said once we do it we can retire to tahiti penny poked him in the ribs and he supposed he deserved it felless was perfectly happy to leave the eggs shed laid the second clutch from gingerinspired matings in the local hatching room she hoped she would soon be able to leave the new town in the arabian peninsula herself as was her way she made no secret of what she hoped one of the locals said you could have stayed in marseille that at least would have shut you up when a bomb burst there who addled your egg felless retorted a bomb bursting here would have been the best thing that could happen to this place that made all the locals in the luggage shop where felless was trying to find something she liked hiss with derision she didnt care as far as she was concerned the new town was nothing but a small town back on home dropped onto the surface of tosev its males and females certainly struck her as provincial and clannish they shouldnt have theyd come from all over the homeworld of the race but only a few years on tosev had united them against the world outside the borders of their settlement one of them said you do not know what you are talking about several bombs have burst not far from here my friend was right one of those bombs should have burst on you his tailstump quivered in fury his friend a female added look at her body paint she does research on the big uglies that must mean she likes them and if liking big uglies does not prove she is addled what would males and females spoke up in loud agreement familiarity with the tosevites had bred only contempt for them in felless to these members of the race though she didnt want to admit that she said they are here there are more of them than we thought there would be and they know more than we thought they would we have to deal with them as they are worse luck we ought to get rid of all of them as we got rid of the deutsche a male said then we could make this world into something worth having not all the deutsche are destroyed felless said and they got rid of too many of us how long did you fear this town would be under attack from explosivemetal bombs as your neighbors were if you like big uglies so much you are welcome to them a female said angrily there they were again accusing felless of something of which she was emphatically not guilty with such dignity as she could muster she said since you will not listen to me what point is there to my even talking to you out she went accompanied by the jeers of the locals the building in which shed been housed was so overcrowded it boasted only a few computer terminals rather than one for every male and female of the race she had to line up to get her own electronic messages and to send any to the rest of the race on tosev and having stood in line she discovered that the messages waiting for her were not worth having shed just turned away in disappointment when a ceilingmounted loudspeaker called her name senior researcher felless senior researcher felless report to the unit managers office immediately fuming felless went if one of the idiot locals had complained about her because of the argument someone was going to hear about it she had every intention of being loud and obnoxious in her rebuttal when she buzzed the door the manager opened it what now felless snapped superior female you have a telephone call here the caller did not want to route it into the dormitory but sent it here for the sake of privacy the manager replied oh some of felless anger evaporated grudgingly she said i thank you here is the telephone the unit manager pointed i hope the news is good for you superior female when felless saw who waited for her on the screen her eye turrets twitched in surprise ambassador veffani she exclaimed i greet you superior sir i had no idea you she broke off were not communing in person with the spirits of emperors past veffani suggested when the race bombed nuremberg i thought i would be but the shelter we built proved better than that of the deutsch notemperor if you think this disappointed me you are mistaken of course we were also trying harder to dispose of him than of me or i hope we were at any rate i am glad to see you well superior sir felless said though she would not have been too sad to learn veffani had perished in the war he was a strict male and had punished her severely for using ginger still hypocrisy lubricated the wheels of social interaction what are your present duties are you still ambassador to the reich veffani made the negative hand gesture a military commissioner will deal with the deutsche for the indefinite future since however i have considerable experience in the northwestern region of the main continental mass i have been assigned as ambassador to the newly reconstituted notempire of france congratulations superior sir felless said with fulsome insincerity i thank you you are gracious veffani knew a good deal about fulsome insincerity himself he went on and with your own experience in the reich and in france you would make a valuable addition to my team here i have put in a requisition for your services and it has been accepted felless knew she should have been furious at such highhanded treatment somehow she wasnt if anything she was relieved i thank you superior sir she said doing something useful to the race will be a relief especially after confinement in this refugee center and among the provincials who make up the bulk of the local population do you know senior researcher i hoped you would say something like that veffani told her you are a talented female you have done good work i am going to give you only one warning i think i already know what it is felless said i am going to give it to you anyhow the ambassador replied plainly you need to have it repeated again and again here it is keep your tongue out of the ginger vial the trouble you cause through your sexual pheromones outweighs any good you can do with your research do you understand me i do superior sir felless added an emphatic cough veffani however had known her since not long after she came out of cold sleep since you understand will you obey not likely felless thought even here even now with no chance whatever for privacy she ached for a taste but veffani would surely make her rot here if she told him the truth and so with next to no hesitation she lied it shall be done she was not at all sure the diplomat believed her by the way he said i shall hold you to that he might have been warning her he didnt but he continued you shall report to marseille where you were previously posted marseille now felless was startled all over again i thought an explosivemetal bomb destroyed the city and so one did veffani answered but rebuilding is under way you will use your expertise in tosevite psychology to guide the big uglies toward increased acceptance of the race will i felless said tonelessly superior sir is this assignment not just a continuation of the punishment you have been inflicting on me for the unfortunate activity that occurred in your office in nuremberg unfortunate activity indeed veffani said you committed a criminal offense by tasting ginger senior researcher and you cannot delete that offense by means of a euphemism you also created an enormous scandal when your pheromones disrupted my meeting and caused the males who had come from cairo and me to couple with you only because of your skills have you escaped getting green bands painted on your upper arms and punishment much harsher than being forced to practice your profession where i order you to do so if you complain further you will assuredly learn what real punishment entails do you understand that yes superior sir what felless really understood was that she wanted revenge on veffani she had no way to get it or none she knew of but she wanted it the races ambassador to the reich no to france now said i do not ask you to be fond of me senior researcher i merely ask indeed i require that you carry out your assignment to the best of your ability it shall be done superior sir felless even believed veffani that made her no less eager for vengeance veffani said a transportation aircraft is scheduled to leave your vicinity for marseille tomorrow evening i expect you to be on it it shall be done felless said again whereupon veffani broke the connection and felless was aboard that transport aircraft though getting to it proved harder than shed expected it departed not from the new town in which she was a refugee but from one that looked close on the map but was a long boring ground journey away even getting her ground transportation proved difficult local officials were anything but sympathetic to the problems refugees faced at last anxious to be on her way and edgy from lust for ginger felless snapped suppose you get in touch with fleetlord reffet the commander of the colonization fleet and find out what his view of the matter is he ordered me awakened from cold sleep early to help deal with the big uglies and now you petty functionaries are hindering me you do so at your peril she hoped they would think she was bluffing she would have enjoyed watching them proved wrong but they yielded she was not only sent off to the new town from which the aircraft would leave she was sent off in a mechanized combat vehicle to protect her against tosevite bandits even though the deutsche were defeated the superstitiously fanatical big uglies of this subregion remained in a simmering state of revolt against the race the countryside by what she saw of it through a firing port was homelike enough that fit in with the weather which was perfectly comfortable more comfortable than it would be in marseille though that was a considerable improvement over cold damp nuremberg herds of azwaca and zisuili grazed on the sparse plants by the road felless went by too fast to tell whether the plants were tosevite natives or like the beasts imports from home the domestic animals reminded her that despite the difficulties the big uglies caused the settlement of tosev was proceeding as far as physical conditions went the world was indeed on its way to becoming part of the empire when the aircraft took off she tried to maintain a similarly optimistic view of political and social conditions that wasnt so easy but she managed with the reich prostrate one of the three major obstacles to full conquest of tosev had disappeared only the usa and the sssr remained surely they would blunder and fall one of these days too one of these days that didnt seem soon enough one of these days she would get another taste of ginger too that didnt seem soon enough either staring steadily at the ambassador from the race who sat across the desk from him vyacheslav molotov shook his head nyet he said queeks translator a pole turned the refusal into its equivalent in the language of the race queek let out another series of hisses and pops and coughs and splutters the interpreter rendered them into russian for the general secretary of the communist party of the ussr the ambassador urges you to contemplate the fate of the greater german reich before refusing so promptly that gave molotov a nasty twinge of fear as it was doubtless meant to do even so he said nyet again and asked queek are you threatening the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union with aggressive war the reich attacked you you had the right to resist if you attack us we shall also resist and do so as strongly as possible no one speaks of attack queek backtracked a little but considering the harm we suffered from the orbital installations of the reich it is reasonable for us to seek to limit these in other tosevite powers nyet molotov said for the third time fighting between the race and the soviet union stopped with each side recognizing the full sovereignty and independence of the other we do not seek to infringe on your sovereignty and you have no right to infringe upon ours we shall fight to defend it your independence would be respected queek began nyet molotov repeated he knew he sounded like a broken record knew and didnt care we reckon any infringement a major infringement one that cannot and will not be tolerated that is not an appropriate position for you to take in the present circumstances queek said i am of the opinion it is perfectly appropriate molotov said are you familiar with the phrase the thin end of the wedge queek obviously wasnt the pole who translated for him went back and forth with him in the language of the race at last the ambassador said very well i now grasp the concept i still believe however that you are needlessly concerned i do not molotov said stubbornly suppose the soviet union tried to impose such conditions on the race queek had no hair which was the only thing that kept him from bristling you have neither the right nor the strength to do any such thing he said you grow indignant when the shoe goes on the other foot molotov said which required another colloquy between the ambassador and his interpreter you have no more right to impose such limits on us than we do on you and as for strength we can hurt you and you know it full well and you will not have such an easy time wrecking us as you did with the reich for we are far less concentrated geographically than the germans were queek made noises that put molotov in mind of a samovar boiling over the interpreter turned them into rhythmically accented russian do you presume to threaten the race nyet molotov said yet again but the race also has no business threatening the soviet union you need to understand that very clearly he wondered if queek did he wondered if queek could reciprocity was something with which the race had always had trouble down deep the lizards didnt really believe earths independent nations had any business staying that way they were imperialists first last and always we are stronger than you queek insisted it could be said molotov who knew perfectly well it was but we have strength enough to protect ourselves and to protect our rights as a free and independent state more overheatedteakettle noises came from the lizards ambassador this is an unreasonable and insolent attitude the translator said by no means molotov saw a chance to take the initiative saw it and seized it i presume you have made this same demand upon the united states what has the americans response been queek hesitated molotov thought he understood that hesitation the lizard wanted to lie but was realizing he couldnt for molotov had but to ask the american ambassador to learn the truth after the hesitation queek said the americans have also raised a certain number of objections to our reasonable proposal i must admit molotov was tempted to laugh in his scaly face instead the leader of the soviet union said why then do you suppose we would acquiesce where they refuse he had not a doubt in the world that the americans objections had been expressed a great deal more stridently than his own with an amazingly human sigh queek replied since the soviet union prides itself on rationality it was hoped you would see the plain good sense manifest in our proposal it was hoped we would give in without protest you mean molotov said this was an error a miscalculation on your part we are more wary of the race now than we were before your war against germany i am sure the americans feel the same way i am especially sure the japanese feel the same way we are most unhappy with the nipponese queek said we have never accorded them recognition as a fully independent empire even though we also never occupied most of the land they ruled at the time of our arrival now that they have begun detonating their own explosivemetal bombs they have begun to presume for themselves a rank above their station now they too are beginning to be able to defend themselves against your imperialist aggression molotov said our relations with japan have been correct since the war we fought against the japanese when i was young they still claim large stretches of the subregion of the main continental mass known as china queek said regardless of what sort of weapons they have we do not intend to yield this to them the people of china i might add maintain a strong interest in establishing their own independence once more and in remaining neither under your control nor under that of the japanese molotov pointed out this desire for freedom and autonomy is the reason for their continued revolutionary struggle against your occupation this is a revolutionary struggle the soviet union encourages in ways inconsistent with maintaining good relations with the race queek said i deny that molotov said stonily the race has continually made that assertion and has never been able to prove it this is fortunate for the soviet union queek replied we may not be able to prove it but we believe it to be a truth nonetheless many of the chinese bandits proclaim an ideology identical to yours they were in china before the race came molotov said they are indigenous and unconnected to us the first of those statements was true the second tautology of course chinese were chinese and the last a resounding lie but the lizards hadnt caught the nkvd or the gru in the act of supplying the chinese peoples liberation army with munitions to go on with the struggle till they did molotov would go right on lying queek remained unconvinced even that pack of bandits who have lately taken hostages from among our regional subadministrators and threatened them with death or torment if we do not return to them certain of their comrades the polish interpreter no friend to marxistleninist thought pronounced tovarishchi with malicious glee whom we are now holding imprisoned he demanded yes even those freedom fighters molotov answered calmly he could not prove the lizard wasnt talking about kuomintang reactionaries who also carried on guerrilla warfare against the race and even if queek was talking about the patriots of the peoples liberation army nothing would have made molotov admit it he doubted queek was in any case the peoples liberation army he judged would have been unlikely to threaten mere torment to whatever hostages it had taken it would have gone straight to the most severe punishment unless of course someone found some good tactical reason for the lesser threat one individuals bandit i see is another individuals freedom fighter queek remarked molotov tried to remember whether the lizard had been so cynical when he first became the races ambassador to the ussr not long after the fighting stopped the soviet leader didnt think so he wondered what could have changed queeks outlook on life not to be outdone molotov replied indeed that no doubt is why even the race can reckon itself progressive the chair in which queek sat had an opening through which his short stumpy tail protruded that tail quivered now molotov watched it with an internal smile the only kind he customarily allowed himself hed succeeded in angering the lizard queek said no matter what sort of denials you give me i am going to reiterate a warning i have given you before if the chinese rebels and bandits who profess your ideology should detonate an explosivemetal bomb the race will hold the soviet union responsible and will punish your notempire most severely do you understand this warning yes i understand it molotov said suddenly fighting to keep from showing fear rather than glee i have always understood it i have also always reckoned it unjust these days i reckon it more unjust than ever a disaffected german submarine officer might give his missile warheads to chinese factionalists of any political stripe in preference to surrendering them to you and the japanese might furnish the chinese such weapons to harm the race and harm the peaceloving soviet union at the same time he found the first of those farfetched the second struck him as only too possible he would have done it were he ruling in japan but queek said did you not just tell me your relations with the nipponese were correct if they are not your enemies why would they do such a thing to you was that naivete or was it a nasty desire to make molotov squirm molotov suspected the latter he replied until recently the leaders of japan have not been in a position to embarrass the soviet union in this way do you not think it would be to their advantage to use an explosivemetal bomb against the race and to do so in such a way as to go unpunished for it to his relief queek had no fast snappy comeback after a pause the lizard said here for once you have given me a justification for caution that may not be altogether selfserving i think you may be confident that the nipponese will receive a similar warning from our representatives to their empire as you probably know we do not maintain an embassy in nippon at present though recent developments may force us to open one there good molotov thought i did distract him then now to try to make him feel guilty any assistance the race could provide us in reducing the effects on our territory from your war with the germans would be appreciated if you seek such assistance ask the reich queek said curtly its leaders were the cause of the war molotov didnt push it hed got the lizard ambassador to respond to him instead of his having to react to what queek said given the races strength that was something of a diplomatic triumph a squad of little scaly devils strode through the captives camp in central china they stopped in front of the miserable little hut liu han shared with her daughter liu mei one of them spoke in bad chinese you are the female liu han and the hatchling of the female liu han liu han and liu mei were both sitting on the kang the low clay hearth that gave the hut what little heat it had yes we are those females liu han admitted a moment later she wondered if she should have denied it for the little devil gestured with his rifle and said you come with me you two of you you come with me what have we done now liu mei asked her face stayed calm though her eyes were anxious as a baby shed been raised by the scaly devils and shed never learned to smile or to show much in the way of any expression you two of you you come with me was all the little scaly devil would say and liu han and liu mei had no choice but to do as they were told they didnt go to the administrative buildings in the camp which surprised liu han it wasnt some new interrogation then she got another surprise when the scaly devils led her and liu mei out through the several razorwire gateways that walled off the camp from the rest of the world outside the last one stood an armored fighting vehicle another little devil this one with fancier body paint waited by it he confirmed their names then said you get in where are you taking us liu han demanded you never mind that you two of you the scaly devil answered you get in no liu han said and her daughter nodded behind her you get in right now the scaly devil said no liu han repeated even though he swung the muzzle of his rifle in her direction not till we know where were going what is wrong with this stupid big ugly one of the other scaly devils asked in their own hissing language why does she refuse to go in she wants to know where they will be taken answered the little devil who spoke chinese i cannot tell her that because of security tell her she is an idiot the other little scaly devil said does she want to stay in this camp if she does she must be an idiot indeed maybe that conversation was set up for her benefit the little devils knew she spoke their language but they were not usually so devious liu han had feared they were taking liu mei and her out to execute them if they werent if they were going somewhere better than the camp she would play along and where on all the face of the earth was there anywhere worse than the camp nowhere she knew i have changed my mind she said we will get in thank you two of you the little devil who spoke chinese might not be fluent but he knew how to be sarcastic he was even more sarcastic in his own language she must think she is the emperor who cares what a big ugly thinks the other scaly devil replied get her and the other one in and get them out of here he evidently outranked the scaly devil who spoke chinese for that male said it shall be done he opened the rear gate on the mechanized combat vehicle and returned to chinese you two of you get in there liu han went in ahead of liu mei if danger waited inside she would find it before her daughter did but she found no danger only nieh hoting the peoples liberation army officer nodded to her i might have known you would be coming along too he remarked as calmly as if theyd met on the streets of peking is your daughter with you before liu han could answer that liu mei climbed up into the troopcarrying compartment of the combat vehicle nieh smiled at her she nodded back she couldnt smile herself i see you are here he said to her where are they taking us do you know liu han asked nieh hoting shook his head i havent the faintest idea wherever it is it has to be better than where we have been since liu han had had the identical thought she could hardly disagree i was afraid they were going to liquidate us but now i dont think they will no i dont think so either nieh said they could do that in camp if they decided it served their interests before liu han could answer the scaly devils slammed the rear gate shut she heard clatterings from outside what are they doing she asked still anything but trusting of the little scaly devils locking us in nieh hoting answered calmly the gates on this machine are made to open from the inside from this compartment to let out the little scaly devils soldiers when they want to fight as ordinary infantry but the little devils will want to make sure we do not go out till they take us wherever they take us that makes sense liu mei said yes it does liu han agreed it went some distance toward easing her mind too maybe we are being taken to a different camp or for a special interrogation she assumed the little devils could hear whatever she said so she added since we are innocent and know nothing i do not see what point there is to interrogating us any more nieh hoting chuckled at that there were surely some things of which they were innocent but carrying on the proletarian revolution against the small scaly imperialist oppressors was not one of them the mechanized combat vehicle started moving the seats in the fighting compartment were too small for human fundaments and the wrong shape to boot liu han felt that more when the ride was jouncy as it was here along with her daughter and nieh she braced herself as best she could that was all she could do it had been cool outside it soon became unpleasantly warm in the fighting compartment the little scaly devils heated it to the temperature they found comfortable the temperature of a very hot summers day in china liu han undid her quilted cotton jacket and shrugged out of it after a while she had a good idea she put it on the seat and sat on it it made things a little more comfortable her daughter and nieh hoting quickly imitated her i wish i had a watch she said as the scaly devils vehicle rattled along without one she could only use her stomach to gauge the passage of time she didnt think they would be giving out the midday meal in camp yet but she wasnt sure we will get where were going wherever that is when we get there and nothing we can do will make that time come sooner nieh said you sound more like a buddhist than a marxistleninist liu han teased with only him and her daughter to hear that was safe enough to say had it reached anyone elses ears it might have resulted in a denunciation liu han didnt want that to happen to nieh who was not only an able man but also an old lover of hers the revolution will proceed with me or without me nieh said i would prefer that it proceed with me but life does not always give us what we would prefer liu han knew that only too well when the japanese overran her village theyd also killed her family then the little scaly devils drove out the japanese and kidnapped her and made her part of their experiments on how and why humans mated as they did that was why liu mei had wavy hair and a nose unusually large for a chinese her father had been an american similarly kidnapped but bobby fiore was long years dead killed by the scaly devils and liu han had been fighting them ever since she peered out through one of the little openings in the side wall of the combat vehicle a viewport for the closed firing port just below she saw rice paddies little stands of forest peasant villages occasional beasts in the fields once an oxdrawn cart that had hastily gone off to the side of the road so the combat vehicle wouldnt run it down it looks a lot like the country around my home village she said more rice i liked eating it in the camp it was an old friend even if the place wasnt id got used to noodles in peking but rice seemed better somehow freedom would seem better liu mei said liberating the countryside would seem better she was still a young woman and found ideology about as important as food liu han shook her head somewhere between bewilderment and pride when she was liu meis age shed hardly had an ideology shed been an ignorant illiterate peasant thanks to the party she was neither ignorant nor illiterate anymore and her daughter never had been with more jounces the mechanized combat vehicle went off the road and into a grove of willows there with newly green boughs screening off the outside world it came to a stop though the motor kept running a rattle at the back of the vehicle was a male undoing whatever fastening had kept the rear gate closed it swung open in the language of the race the scaly devil said you tosevites you come out now if they didnt come out now the little devils could shoot them while they were in the troopcarrying compartment liu han saw she had no choice out she came bumping her head on the roof of the vehicle she looked around as soon as she had her feet on the ground the turret of the combat vehicle mounted a small cannon and a machine gun those bore on the chinese men with submachine guns and rifles who advanced toward the machine in their midst were three woebegone little scaly devils one of the chinese called you are nieh hoting liu han and liu mei thats right liu han said her agreement mixing with those of the others she added who are you that doesnt matter the man answered what does matter is that you are the people for whom we are exchanging these hostages he swung the muzzle of his submachine gun toward the unhappy little devils he and his comrades were guarding negotiations between the men of the peoples liberation army for that was what they had to be and the little scaly devils who made up the crew of the combat vehicle did not last long when they were through the little scaly devils in chinese hands hurried into the vehicle while liu han and her daughter and nieh hurried away from it the scaly devils slammed the doors to the troop compartment shut as if they expected the chinese to start shooting any second and the chinese leader said hurry we have to get out of here we cant be sure the little scaly devils dont have an ambush laid on fleeing through the willow branches that kept throwing little leaves in her face liu han said thank you so much for freeing us from that camp you are experienced revolutionaries the peoples liberation army man answered the movement needs you we will give it everything we have nieh ho ting said the kuomintang could not defeat us the japanese could not defeat us and the little scaly devils shall not defeat us either the dialectic is on our side the little scaly devils knew nothing of the dialectic but they like the party took a long view of history eventually history would show which was correct liu han remained convinced the proletarian revolution would triumph but she was much less certain than she had been that it would happen in her lifetime but im back in the struggle she thought and hurried on through the willows not even during the fighting after the conquest fleet landed on tosev had gorppet seen such devastation as he found when the small unit he commanded moved into the greater german reich one of the males in the unit a trooper named yarssev summed up his feelings when he asked how did the big uglies stay in the war so long when we did this to them why were they so stupid i cannot answer that gorppet said all i know is they fought hard up till the moment they surrendered truth superior sir yarssev agreed and now their countryside will glow in the dark for years because of their foolish courage he was exaggerating but not by any tremendous amount every male moving into the reich wore a radiationexposure badge on a chain around his neck orders were to check the badges twice a day and the troops followed those orders nowhere on four worlds had so many explosivemetal bombs fallen on so small an area in so short a time but not every area of the reich had had a bomb fall on it in between the zones where nothing was left alive the deutsche who had survived the war struggled to get on with their lives to raise their crops and domestic animals to care for refugees and demobilized soldiers to rebuild damage from conventional weapons as the occupying males of the race moved into the reich the local tosevites would pause in what they were doing to stare at them some of those tosevites would have fought against the race in earlier conflicts others though females and young were surely civilians the quality of the stares was the same in either case though nasty creatures arent they superior sir yarssev said no doubt about it gorppet agreed i have seen stares from big uglies who hated us before i have served in basra and baghdad but i have never seen such hate as these deutsche display better they should hate their own notemperor who was foolish enough to think he could beat us yarssev said they never hate their own no one ever hates his own this is a law through all the empire as sure as i hatched out of my eggshell the detachment came to the sea not much later came to the sea and headed west gorppet had seen tosevite seas before the one south of basra was quite tolerably warm the one off cape town was cooler but of an interesting shade of blue this one this one was cold and gray and ugly it splashed lethargically up onto the mud of the coastline then rolled back why would anyone want to live in a country like this a male asked chilly and flat and horrible sometimes you live where you have to live not where you want to live gorppet answered maybe some other big uglies chased the deutsche into this part of the world and would not let them live anywhere better maybe superior sir the other male said and maybe having to live here is what makes them so mean and tough that could be gorppet agreed something certainly has he wished he had a taste of ginger he had plenty more than plenty stashed away in south africa but it might as well have been on home for all the good it did him hed been very moderate all through the fighting males who tasted ginger thought they were stronger and faster and brighter than they really were if they went into action against coldly pragmatic big uglies with the herb coursing through them they were all too likely to do something foolish and end up dead before they could make amends when we stop for the evening he thought taste when we stop for the evening they came to the vicinity of peenemunde as light was failing they would have gone no farther had it been early morning teams of the races engineers had already taken possession of the principal spaceport the deutsche used they had also set up warning lines to keep other males from venturing too far into the radioactivity without proper protection no site in the reich nuremberg probably included had taken as many bombs as peenemunde nothing will grow here for a hundred years yarssev predicted and i mean a hundred tosevite years twice as long as ours i suppose not gorppet said and yet wasnt it here that the big ugly who calls himself the deutsch notemperor these days was holed up during the fighting i think so yarssev replied too bad the miserable creature came out alive if you want to know how i feel truth gorppet said for he agreed with all his liver but if any tosevite could emerge alive from the slagging the race had given peenemunde that bespoke some truly formidable engineering prowess he let out a wry hiss the race had seen as much in the fighting in poland the weapons the deutsche used there were alarmingly close to being as good as the ones the race owned and the big uglies had had a lot more of them if the race hadnt pounded their notempire too flat to let them keep supporting their army things might have gone even worse than they had as usual field rations tasted like the mud that lined the southern shore of the local sea gorppet fueled himself as he would have put hydrogen into a mechanized combat vehicle having fueled himself he did taste ginger he was sure he wasnt the only male in the small group who used the tosevite herb penalties against it had grown harsher since females came to tosev but that hadnt stopped many males except for making sure his troopers didnt do anything that would get themselves and their comrades killed in combat gorppet didnt try to keep them from tasting that would hardly have been fair not when he had the ginger habit himself he poured some of the herb into the palm of his hand even before he raised palm to mouth the heady scent of the ginger was tickling his scent receptors he never tired of it it always seemed fresh and new his tongue shot out almost of its own accord ahhh he murmured as bliss flowed through him he felt bigger than a big ugly faster than a starship with more computing power between his hearing diaphragms than all the races electronic network put together some small part of him knew the feeling was an illusion but he didnt care this side of mating maybe not even this side of mating it was as good a feeling as a male of the race could have while it lasted like the pleasure of mating it didnt last long enough and when it faded the crushing depression that followed was as bad as it had been good one solution was to have another taste and then another and gorppet chose the harder road waiting till the depression faded too over the years hed come to take it as part of the experience connected to the herb when they set out again the next morning the road along which they were traveling west came together with another on which were about their number of deutsch soldiers coming home from poland no one had disarmed the deutsche they still carried all their hand weapons and several of them wore bandoliers of bullets crisscrossed on their chests the males in gorppets unit nervously eyed the big uglies the deutsche did not have the look of defeated troops on the contrary they looked as if they were ready to start up the war again then and there they might win if they did too at least in this small engagement gorppet was uneasily aware of it before either side could start spraying bullets around he stepped away from the males he commanded and strode toward the deutsche i do not speak your language he called does anyone among you speak the language of the race if none of them did he was liable to be in a lot of trouble but as hed hoped a deutsch male came out from among the big uglies and said i speak your language what do you want i want my small group and your small group to pass by in peace gorppet answered the war is over let it stay over you can say that the tosevite replied his face was grimy his wrappings were filthy he smelled powerfully of the rank odor big uglies soon acquired when they did not bathe he went on yes winners can say the war is over for losers the war is never over winners can forget losers remember we have much for which to remember the race i have nothing to say to that gorppet said i am not a politician i am not a diplomat i am only a soldier as a soldier i tell you this if you attack us now you will be sorry and your notempire will be sorry with a bark of tosevite laughter the deutsch soldier said how can you make us sorrier after what the race has done to the reich how can you make this notempire sorrier after all you have done to it if you attack us you cannot kill us all before we radio the situation to our superiors gorppet replied trying to hold his voice steady helicopter gunships will punish you for fighting and the race will take further vengeance on the reich for violating the surrender is this a truth or is it not it is a truth the big ugly admitted it is a truth about which few of my males care right now many of them have lost their mates and hatchlings do you understand what this means it means they do not greatly care if they live or die i do understand yes gorppet said though he knew he did so only in theory tosevite kinship ties and tosevites willing to kill without thought for their own lives once those ties were broken had complicated life for the race since the conquest fleet landed gorppet tried the only real direction in which he thought he could go what they want to do now they may regret later is this a truth or is it not do you command them yes i command them the deutsch soldier replied you make good sense i almost wish you did not for i am as ready as any of my males to seek revenge against the race but i will tell the soldiers what you have said after that we shall have to see with the war over and lost my hold over them is weaker than it was we shall stay alert gorppet said we shall not attack you the war is over but if we are attacked we shall fight back with all our strength i understand the big ugly walked back toward his own males calling out in their guttural language some of the deutsche shouted at him they did not sound happy nor anything close to it be ready for anything gorppet warned the males he led do not open fire on them unless they fire on us but be ready he was willing to let the deutsche use the crossroads first and held up his males so they could the tosevite officer led his big uglies forward they towered over the males of the race some of them shouted things some shook their fists but to gorppets vast relief they didnt start shooting forward he called after the deutsche had passed forward his own small group went he kept one eye turret on the terrain the other on the map hed been given unlike the maps hed had in the sssr this one seemed to know what it was talking about when toward evening his males reached a town he stopped a local and asked greifswald he made himself understood the local nodded a big ugly affirmative and said greifswald ja gorppet turned back to his males we have reached our assigned station dismallooking dump isnt it with a curse half in yiddish half in polish mordechai anielewicz used the hand brake on his bicycle how am i supposed to get anywhere if the roads are all kaputt the jewish fighting leader muttered burntout trucks made the asphalt impassable these particular vehicles were of human manufacture but he had to look closely to see which side had used them the lizards had pressed plenty of humanmade models into service in poland and most of them had been imported from germany he got off the bicycle and walked it around the jam hed been doing that every kilometer or two on the journey down to widawa hed got his family out of lodz before the fighting started and sent them southwest to this little town that had kept them safe or safer anyhow when the germans hit the city with an explosivemetal bomb but the wehrmacht had overrun widawa and bertha and miriam and david and heinrich were every bit as jewish as he was of course even after he passed the wrecks he couldnt get back on the road right away someones airplanes had cratered it with bomblets anielewiczs legs ached as he brought the bicycle forward theyd been doing that since the last round of fighting when hed breathed german nerve gas without the antidote he would have died then as things were hed got off lucky of the others whod breathed the gas heinrich jager after whom his younger son was named had died at an early age ludmila gorbunova had suffered far more from the lingering effects of the stuff than he had ludmila had been in lodz odds were all too good or all too bad she wasnt suffering at all any more over the years mordechai had come to take his aches and pains for granted he couldnt do that now the nazis had used poison gas again in this new round of fighting how much of it had he breathed how much harm was it doing just how much residual damage did he have those were all fascinating questions and he lacked answers to any of them and in a most important sense none of them mattered much not when measured against the one question the overriding question what happened to my family no there wasnt one question only another lay underneath it one he would sooner not have contemplated have i still got a family after half a kilometer the road stopped being too battered for a bicycle he got back up on the bike and rode hard the harder he worked the worse his legs felt till after a while they stopped hurting so much he let out a sigh of relief that had happened before if he put in enough exercise he could work right through the cramps sometimes no road signs warned him he was coming into widawa for one thing polish roads had never been well marked for another widawa wasnt a town important enough to require much in the way of marking and for a third the war had been here before him if there had been signs they werent upright any more a lot of trees in the forest just north of widawa werent upright any more when the road curved around the forest and gave him his first glimpse of the town he saw that a lot of the houses in it werent upright any more either his mouth tightened hed seen a lot of ruins in the first round of fighting and now in this one another set wouldnt have been so much out of the ordinary except that these might hold the bodies of his wife and children a burntout german panzer and an equally burntout lizard landcruiser sprawled in death a few meters apart just outside of town had they killed each other or had some different fate befallen them mordechai knew he would never know he pedaled past them into widawa people on the street hardly bothered to look up at him what was one more middleaged bicycle rider with a rifle slung on his back theyd surely seen a surfeit of those already he put a foot down and used a boot heel for a brake nodding to an old woman with a head scarf who wore a long black dress he asked granny who knows about the refugees who came in from lodz she eyed him he spoke polish notable only for a warsaw accent he looked like a pole being fairskinned and lighteyed but the old woman said well jew youd best ask father wladyslaw about that i dont know anything i dont want to know anything she went on her way as if he didnt exist anielewicz sighed some people had a radar better than anything electronic in the lizards arsenal hed seen that before thanks he called after her but she might as well not have heard a couple of shells had hit the church workmen were busy repairing it mordechai shrugged at that but didnt sigh jews would have fixed up a synagogue before they worried about their houses too is the priest in mordechai asked a carpenter hammering nails into a board the man nodded and shifted his cigarette to the corner of his mouth so he could talk more readily yeah hes there what do you want to talk to him about im looking for my wife and children anielewicz answered they came here out of lodz not long before the germans invaded ah the cigarette twitched you a jew at least he asked instead of showing he could tell yes mordechai said the other fellow had a hammer he had a rifle dont you like that dont care one way or the other the carpenter answered but youre right youd better talk to the father he gestured with the hammer toward the doorway as mordechai walked over to it the pole started driving nails again inside the church father wladyslaw was pounding away with a hammer too repairing the front row of pews he was a young man and startlingly handsome in a tall blond way if his politics had fit the nazis would have scooped him into the ss without a second thought with all the noise he didnt notice mordechai for a bit when he did his smile was friendly enough oh hello he said getting to his feet and brushing sawdust off his cassock what can i do for you today im looking for my wife and children mordechai said again and gave his name father wladyslaws eyebrows flew upward the famous fighting leader he exclaimed your kin would have been some who came out of lodz thats right mordechai said people in town tell me youd know about them if anybody does are they alive there the question was out but he got no sure answer for it for the priest replied im sorry but i dont know the germans overran us twice and kidnapped people each time they retreated some were jews some were poles whod lived here for generations uncounted im not even sure why but who can tell with germans theyve run out of jews in germany anielewicz said bitterly they need some fresh people to keep the gas chambers and the ovens busy you may well be right father wladyslaw said i wish i could give you more definite news of your loved ones but i fear i cant youll have to go inquire among the refugees who are still here i pray your family is among them thank you father mordechai said the priest seemed a decent fellow then he added several choice comments about the nazis he was ashamed of himself as soon as they were out of his mouth which was of course much too late im sorry dont be father wladyslaw told him if you think i havent called them worse than that youre wrong theyre supposed to have published a list of the people they took theyre supposed to have already released those people anielewicz said and they have published it and they have turned a few people loose but nobody believes that list is everybody or even close to everybody your family is not on it the priest asked if they were i wouldnt be here mordechai answered thanks for your help father i wont take up any more of your time the refugee tents are on the south edge of town thats right father wladyslaw said i wish you luck there either in finding them or in learning of them nodding anielewicz walked out of the church the priest started hammering again even before hed left the tents and huts in which the refugees were staying looked even shabbier than the town of widawa the fighting had smashed them up too and theyd been less prepossessing to begin with a sharp stink assailed mordechais nose he wouldnt have let his fighting men pay sanitation so little heed poles and jews spilled out into the spaces between tents to see who the newcomer was anielewicz got the notion the people of widawa would just as soon they all disappeared but with lodz radioactive rubble a lot of them had nowhere to go he stared this way and that he didnt see his family he did spot someone he knew rabinowicz are bertha and the children here were they ever here the other jew answered news to me if they were but ive only been here a couple days myself wonderful mordechai muttered he looked around again hed thought a good many jews had come from lodz to widawa but rabinowiczs was the only face he recognized what had happened to the jews who were here then were they dead were all they hauled off to the reich for a fate that couldnt possibly be good he asked some of the poles and got a different answer from each of them damn nazis took em away a woman said not everybody a man disagreed some got taken away yes but some got shot right here and some ran off nobody got shot right here another man insisted the germans said they were gonna but they never did does anybody know if bertha and miriam and david and heinrich anielewicz got away safe or if they got taken back to germany mordechai asked nobody knew any which way people were too busy arguing over what had happened to be very interested in giving details the two men whod disagreed went nose to nose with each other both of them shouting at the tops of their lungs mordechai wanted to knock their heads together that might have let in some sense he couldnt think of anything else that would he lacked the energy to treat the two loud fools as they deserved instead he turned away sick at heart his wife and children were either carried off to germany or dead a bad choice or a worse one he would have to beard the nazis in their den to find out hed need help from the lizards there but he thought they would give him the paperwork and help hed require they despised the german ruling party too he tried one more thing my son heinrich had a beffel for a pet an animal from the lizards world it would squeak when it was happy does anybody remember that and two people did that damned thing a woman said yes the germans nabbed the people who had it they took them away when they got run out of here the other person an old man nodded they did go into germany then mordechai breathed thank you both from the bottom of my heart he didnt know if he ought to be thanking them jews who went into germany were not in the habit of coming out again but his family hadnt simply been slaughtered here that was something he hoped nesseref was feeding orbit her tsiongi when the telephone hissed for attention the pet started eating while she hurried into the bedchamber wondering who was calling i greet you the shuttlecraft pilot said waiting to see whose image appeared on the computer monitor to her surprise it was not a male or female of the race but a big ugly i greet you superior female he said in the language of the race mordechai anielewicz here good to see you nesseref answered glad hed named himself no matter how well she liked him she had trouble telling tosevites apart i hope you are well the big ugly said on the whole yes nesseref replied the fallout levels have been high but my apartment building was damaged only once and even then the filters functioned well by now everything has been replaced and radioactivity levels are falling but i hope very much that you are well mordechai anielewicz you have not been shielded from all the radioactivity that descended on poland i am well enough for now anielewicz told her past that i do not worry about myself i worry about my mate and my hatchlings they have been carried back into the reich by retreating deutsch armies and they very well may be dead by now yes they are of the jewish superstition as you are is that not a truth nesseref said i have never understood the irrational loathing of the deutsche for tosevites of the jewish superstition it struck her as no more absurd than any other tosevite superstition belatedly she realized she should say something more shed forgotten the strong ties of sexuality and other emotions that linked big uglies in family units for your sake i hope you find them well i thank you mordechai anielewicz said they were alive at least fairly recently i have found tosevites who saw and remember my youngest hatchlings beffel he did an excellent job of imitating the squeak of the little animal from home at that squeak orbit came racing into the bedroom plainly furious that nesseref might have concealed a beffel somewhere in the apartment his tail lashed up and down up and down his mouth was open so his scent receptors could better pick up the hated odor of a beffel but images on the monitor meant nothing to him at last with the air of someone who knew hed been tricked but couldnt figure out how the tsiongi went away nesseref said there is still some hope then i am glad of that she used an emphatic cough to show how glad she was i thank you mordechai anielewicz said again i want you to help me locate them if that should prove possible what can i do nesseref asked in some surprise if it is within my ability you may rest assured that i will do it as the ties of family were less important among the race than with the big uglies so the ties of friendship were more important and mordechai anielewicz though a tosevite was unquestionably a friend once more i thank you he said as you surely know i have some prominence with the race because of my rank among the jews of poland still my primary dealings these past many years have been with the races authorities in lodz now those authorities are reporting only to the spirits of emperors past he didnt cast down his eyes other than that his knowledge of the races beliefs was flawless he finished i would like you to help me obtain the assistance of the authorities in warsaw warsaw also received an explosivemetal bomb from the deutsche nesseref reminded him the present administration for this subregion is in pinsk ah pinsk yes i understand i had forgotten because of my own troubles anielewiczs face twisted into a grimace nesseref believed to denote unhappiness the deutsche would not have tried to bomb that city for fear the bomb would go wrong and strike the soviet union which they did not want in any case this new administration is made up of males and females unfamiliar to me i would greatly appreciate your good offices in dealing with them are you planning to travel there in person nesseref asked if i must but only if i must the big ugly answered and used another unhappy grimace i hate to travel all the way to the eastern edge of this subregion when all my concerns are here in the west that is another reason i want your help i understand you shall have it the shuttlecraft pilot said she waved aside the tosevites further thanks friends may ask favors of friends let me make inquiries in pinsk she noted the telephone code from which he was calling it wasnt his phone of course but one belonging to some military detachment or bureaucratic outpost of the race may i leave messages for you here you may mordechai anielewicz said and again i thank you from the bottom of my heart that was a tosevite idiom literally translated but nesseref figured out what it had to mean after anielewicz broke the connection nesseref telephoned the new authorities in pinsk yes we have heard from this tosevite a female told her we are hesitant to grant his request for assistance in entering the reich in search of those other individuals for we know that the deutsche are liable to make it as difficult as possible for him to carry out the aforesaid search you are from the colonization fleet nesseref said that was an obvious truth no females had been part of the conquest fleet nesseref went on i think you are too inexperienced to grasp the attachment big uglies place on their sexual partners and hatchlings you would not be doing this male a favor by protecting him from himself you are also part of the colonization fleet the bureaucrat in pinsk answered sharply why is your experience more valid than mine i have made a friend of this tosevite nesseref replied am i mistaken or would you have recently come from a new town where you had only limited contact with big uglies that is a truth the other female admitted in some surprise if you can note it perhaps you do know what you are talking about i will take what you say under advisement i thank you nesseref made some more calls doing all she could to get the races functionaries to help mordechai anielewicz two or three of the functionaries with whom she spoke said she wasnt the first person asking them to help the big ugly she was miffed the first time she heard that then she decided shed made a mistake anielewicz had the right to do whatever he could to try to recover the tosevites who were important to him orbit walked into the bedroom a couple of times while nesseref was on the telephone the tsiongi prowled around the room and even poked his longsnouted head into the closets a couple of time he thought hed heard a beffel and it hadnt come out that meant it should still be in there his logic was impeccable or would have been if hed understood how video monitors worked as things were he got to be one increasingly frustrated animal and then nesserefs telephone hissed again she thought it would be one of the bureaucrats with whom shed talked calling back for more information or possibly mordechai anielewicz with a new suggestion or request but it wasnt it was in fact a big ugly calling on the security hookup of her apartment building yes what do you want she asked him i have for you delivery he spoke the language of the race fairly well it is animal exercise wheel oh yes i thank you nesseref had ordered that during the fighting but no one had been able to deliver it more urgent concerns had all but overwhelmed the races supply system wait one moment i will admit you she let him go through the buildings outer door inside part of the lobby had been turned into what almost amounted to an airlock system one designed to keep as much radioactive outside air as possible from circulating in the halls and units of the building only after fans blew the contaminated air out onto the street did the inner door open and admit the big ugly instead of pressing the buzzer by her doorway as a male or female of the race would have done he knocked on the door orbit let out a growling hiss no nesseref said sharply as she opened the door stay the tsiongi lashed its tail angry that it didnt get to attack this obviously dangerous intruder here grunting the tosevite delivery male lifted the crate off the dolly hed used to move it to the elevator the dolly was of big ugly manufacture heavier and grimier than anything the race would have used after setting the crate in the center of the floor the big ugly handed nesseref an electronic clipboard and stylus saying you sign this here superior sir superior female nesseref corrected him before signing she checked to make sure the crate said it contained the exercise wheel shed ordered as soon as her signature went into the system her account would be debited the price of the wheel but everything seemed to be in order she scribbled her signature on the proper line on the clipboard i thank you superior female the big ugly got it right the second time he bent into a clumsy version of the posture of respect then left her apartment let us see what we have here nesseref said orbit was certainly curious his tongue lolled out so the scent receptors on it could catch all the interesting odors coming from the crate nesseref s eyes caught something shed missed when ordering the exercise wheel on the side of the crate were the dreaded words some assembly required she sighed did some mean a little or a lot shed find out orbit thought he was a very helpful tsiongi as soon as shed opened the crate he started jumping in and then jumping out again he tried to kill some of the plastic bags that held fasteners he poked his snout into every subassembly as nesseref put it together long before she had the whole wheel done she was ready to throw the animal for whom it was intended right out the window here she said when despite orbits best efforts at assistance she finally did put the wheel together this says your wheel is impregnated with the odor of zisuili to make you enthusiastic about using it domestic tsiongyu helped herd zisuili back on home their wild cousins and occasional unreliable or feral tsiongyu preyed on the meat animals orbit jumped into the wheel and started to run before long he hopped out again maybe hed worn himself out doing his best to lend nesseref a hand maybe he didnt feel like running in it no matter what it smelled like tsiongyu had a reputation for perversity on a smaller scale they were something like big uglies miserable beast nesseref said more or less fondly as if doing her a favor orbit deigned to turn an eye turret in her direction for a moment then he curled up by the exercise wheel slapped his tail down on the floor a couple of times and went to sleep nesseref s laugh quickly turned rueful orbit had no worries bigger than not being able to go outside for a good run she wished she could say the same reuven russie came home to find his father on the telephone with atvar anything you might be able to do would be greatly appreciated exalted fleetlord moishe russie said mordechai anielewicz is a longtime friend and he has also helped the race a great deal in the fight against the deutsche i can do less than you might think the fleetlord of the conquest fleet replied i can encourage our males and females in the subregion of poland to assist him and i shall do that but the reich retains political independence that limits actions available to me there how unfortunate reuvens father said and used an emphatic cough i regret not being able to do more atvar didnt sound regretful he sounded if anything indifferent after a moment he went on and now if you will excuse me i have a great many things to do his image vanished from the screen moishe russie turned away from the telephone with a sigh he looked up in surprise hello reuven i didnt think youd be back from the office so soon my last two appointments canceled on me one right after the other reuven answered you took the afternoon off i got mine by default the lizards dont care what happened to anielewiczs family not even a little his father made a disgusted noise down deep in his throat were good enough to do things for them but theyre too good to do things for us especially if that would take some real work from them ive seen it before but never so bad as now you dont even remember anielewicz do you i was just a little boy a very little boy when we got smuggled out of poland reuven said i know that but if anielewicz had decided to fight for the germans against the race when the conquest fleet landed poland might have stayed in nazi hands his father said thats how important he was and now atvar doesnt care whether his family is alive or dead lizards dont really understand about families reuven said emotionally no moishe russie agreed emotionally no but intellectually yes they arent stupid they just dont want to take the trouble for someone whos done a lot for them and i think its a disgrace whats a disgrace reuvens mother asked she glanced over to her only son youre home early i hope theres nothing wrong he shook his head only canceled appointments like i told father better canceled appointments than a canceled family rivka russie said she turned a mild and speculative eye on him and when will you be bringing jane by the house again was that a hint he should settle down and start having a family of his own he was within shouting distance of thirty and still single so it might well have been on the other hand jane archibald remained a student at the lizards moishe russie medical college while hed resigned because he wouldnt go to their temple and give reverence to spirits of emperors past and she wasnt jewish herself which struck reuven as likely to prove a bigger obstacle in his parents eyes he wasnt sure how big an obstacle it was in his own eyes it certainly hadnt been enough to keep him from becoming janes lover every male student at the medical college had wanted to be able to say that now that hed actually done it he was still trying to figure out what it meant to his life you dont answer my question his mother said bringing jane by had been simpler in the days when they were just fellow students and friends being lovers with her complicated everything not necessarily because of what it meant now but because of how it might change his whole future for the time being he temporized i will mother as soon as i can good rivka russie nodded ill be glad to see her and you know the twins will reuven snorted his younger sisters looked on jane as the font of everything wise and womanly her contours were certainly a good deal more finished than theirs though theyd blossomed to an alarming degree the past couple of years thoughtfully moishe russie remarked i wouldnt mind seeing jane again myself rivka russie was wearing a dish towel around her waist shed been back in the kitchen cooking she took off the towel wadded it up in her hands and threw it at her husband ill bet you wouldnt she said darkly but not too darkly for she started to laugh before reuvens father tossed the towel back to her say something simple and you get into trouble moishe russie rolled his eyes precisely as if he hadnt expected to get into trouble by saying that particular simple thing jane archibald was definitely a girl a woman worth seeing laughing still reuvens mother went back to the kitchen his father pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and lit one you shouldnt smoke those things reuven said clucking like a mother hen you know how many nasty things the lizards have shown they do to your lungs and to my circulatory system and to my heart moishe russie nodded nodded and took another drag theyve shown all sorts of horrible things about tobacco its not ginger for heavens sake reuven said people can quit smoking and lizards can quit tasting ginger too for that matter his father answered it just doesnt happen very often you dont get the enjoyment out of tobacco that the race gets out of ginger reuven said to which his father could hardly disagree especially when his mother might be listening he persisted what do you get out of it anyhow i dont know his father eyed the glowing coal on the end of his cigarette it relaxes me and one tastes very good after food that doesnt sound like enough reuven said no i suppose not moishe russie shrugged its an addiction i can hardly deny it there are plenty of worse ones thats about the most i can say whats the most you can say about which father one of the twins asked reuven hadnt heard the twins come into the front room theyd probably been helping their mother get supper ready they sounded even more alike than they looked reuven couldnt be sure whether esther or judith had spoken moishe russie held up his cigarette that there are worse drugs than the ones that go into these a thin gray column of smoke rose into the air from the burning end of the cigarette oh that was esther reuven was sure of it well maybe she wrinkled her nose it still smells nasty her sister nodded does it their father sounded honestly surprised it does reuven judith and esther all spoke together reuven added if you hadnt killed most of your sense of smell from years of those stinking things youd know it yourself would i moishe russie studied the cigarette or what was left of it then stubbed it out i dont suppose my sense of smell is really dead more likely just dormant why dont you find out reuven asked his sisters nodded their faces glowing he and they often rubbed one another the wrong way but they agreed about this his father ran a hand over his bald crown a silent genetic warning that reuven wouldnt keep his own dark hair forever it was in fact already starting to retreat above his temples moishe russie said maybe i will one of these days that meant never reuven knew it his sisters a lot younger and a lot more naive than he knew it too disappointment shone from them as excitement had a moment before he was opening his mouth to let his father know what he thought when his mother preempted him by calling supper supper was a leg of mutton with potatoes and carrots and onions a dish they might have eaten back in warsaw before the war except for the red palestinian wine that went with it holding up his glass of the local vintage reuven said weve got a while to go before we catch up with france youre turning into a wine maven his father asked chuckling moishe russie sipped the wine too and nodded maven or not i wont say youre wrong on the other hand these grapes are a lot less radioactive than the ones they use to make burgundy or bordeaux a point reuven admitted i think were pretty lucky the nazis didnt try harder to land an explosivemetal bomb on jerusalem then we wouldnt be able to say that about the wine then odds were they wouldnt have been able to say anything at all but he chose not to dwell on that why didnt they try harder to bomb us judith asked at fifteen she didnt think death was real reuven wished he could say the same his father answered they did send a couple of rockets our way but the race knocked them down they saved most of their firepower to use against the lizards though moishe russies face twisted either they hated the race more than they hated us or else they thought the race was more dangerous if i were a betting man id put my money on the second choice rivka russie sighed so would i her eyes like her husbands were bleak and far away remembering how things had been in germanheld poland before the conquest fleet landed reuven recalled that time only dimly as one of hunger and fear he was glad his memories held no more detail too to the twins anything before they were born might as well have been the days of ancient rome theyre lucky he thought out in the front room the telephone hooked into the lizards network hissed for attention moishe russie rose ill get it maybe alevai the fleetlord has changed his mind or thought of something more he can do for poor anielewicz he hurried out a moment later though he called not atvar at all its for you reuven for me reuven bounded out of his chair even though he was only halfway through supper the only person likely to call him on the races telephone system was hello jane he said switching from the hebrew usual around the house to english how are you couldnt be better jane archibalds english had the notquitebritish accent of australia blue eyes glowing she smiled out of the screen at him ive passed my comprehensive exams so i escape at the end of this term congratulations reuven exclaimed he would have been sweating out his comprehensives too if he hadnt left the medical college he knew what monsters they were then he caught the crucial verb escape thats right she nodded her golden hair flipped up and down canadas accepted me youve known forever that i didnt want to start a practice anyplace the lizards rule reuven nodded back at her the lizards had been harsh in australia seizing the whole continent for themselves with humans a distinct afterthought jane went on and so sweetheart the time is coming and its coming soon when we have to figure out where we go from here or if we go anywhere at all from here if were going anywhere im going to canada reuven said slowly and jane nodded again hed known he would have to make a choice like that one day he hadnt thought he would have to make it quite so soon even more slowly he went on im going to have to think about that i know you will jane replied i envy your having a family you can get along with believe me i do but ive got to tell you one more thing dear dont take too bloody long before he could find an answer her image vanished from the screen straha was used to fighting cravings the exshiplord had started tasting ginger not long after hed fled the conquest fleet and had rarely been without it since it helped make living among the american big uglies tolerable even so now and again he wished he hadnt antagonized atvar to the point where it was either flee or face the fleetlords fury he let out a soft hiss if the assembled shiplords had chosen to oust atvar and name me in his place all of tosev might belong to the race now he thought surely he could have led the conquest fleet better than that mediocre male a large majority had thought he could but the race required threequarters concurrence before making such a drastic change and he hadnt got that atvar remained in command to this day and straha remained in exile to this day he had all the ginger he wanted it wasnt illegal in the usa as it was everywhere the race ruled stashed away in his house mostly of tosevite construction but with gadgetry from the race was almost enough of the precious herb to let him set up as a dealer if he felt like a taste he could have one the big ugly who served as his driver and bodyguard wouldnt say no if anything hed assume the tosevite facial grimace connoting benevolence and get straha more ginger still but turning his eye turrets away from ginger as much as he could was something straha had long since got used to doing keeping the papers sam yeager had given him a secret was something else again straha didnt know exactly what yeager had given him those papers only extracting a promise that he wouldnt look at them unless the big ugly suddenly died or disappeared straha had kept the promise too regardless of how tempted he was to see what yeager thought so important what does he know straha wondered why does he not want me to know it too how much trouble will come if i learn it not too much surely that was the voice he sometimes heard inside his head when he wanted one taste of ginger on top of another it was an ever so persuasive voice one that could talk him into almost everything almost he counted sam yeager a friend in the same way that he counted friends among the race yeager relied on him trusted him he had to be worthy of that trust didnt he before temptation could dig its claws into him too deeply his driver came into the kitchen from the front room and said i greet you shiplord and i greet you straha replied the big ugly spoke his language about as well as a tosevite could what do you want now why do you think i want anything replied the male who served and guarded him strahas mouth fell open in a laugh because you are who you are because you are what you are his driver laughed too in the noisy tosevite way all right shiplord i suppose you have a point he bent into the posture of respect though in doing so he showed as much mockery as he did subordination given the security clearance and status he had to have to be allowed to work with straha that made a certain amount of sense very well then straha said with a certain amount of asperity he was jealous of his rank despite the realities of the situation suppose you tell me what you do want then it shall be done shiplord the driver said again mixing obedience with mockery you surely know that the colonization fleet has released its domestic animals in the areas the race rules i should hope so straha exclaimed considering the azwaca and zisuili in my freezer here exactly so his driver agreed are you also aware how rapidly these animals from home are spreading in the desert regions of tosev these are for the most part not deserts to us or to our beasts straha said home is a hotter drier world than this one what you call desert is to us more often than not a temperate grassland however you like the big ugly said with a shrug very much like one a male of the race might have used but that is not the point the point is these beasts are making themselves at home here faster than anyone could reasonably have expected this is certainly true in northern mexico i have heard as much in fact straha said and you will also have heard that animals from home respect international borders not at all they are also establishing themselves in the american southwest indeed i have heard that too straha said you still have not told me what you want though is it not obvious the tosevite returned how do we get rid of the miserable things we do not eat them why are you asking me straha said i am not an ecological engineer and i do not know what resources you have available to you we are willing to commit whatever resources prove necessary his driver said these animals are highly unwelcome here and they seem to be spreading very fast wherever the weather stays warm the year around they appear at home unless you can hunt them into extinction they probably will stay that way too straha said how nice the big ugly said his voice sour that was an english idiom translated literally into the language of the race it didnt mean what it said but just the opposite i am sure my superiors will be delighted to hear that he didnt mean what he said there either straha said i expect that we are also introducing the plants from home on which our domestic animals prefer to feed they too will take advantage of any ecological niches available to them here on tosev in fact i am given to understand that this process has already begun in the subregion of the main continental mass called india terrific the driver didnt bother to translate that ironic comment into the language of the race but left it in english straha had grown reasonably fluent in the language of the usa as the years went by gathering himself the tosevite switched to strahas tongue how are we supposed to hunt weeds into extinction as a matter of fact i doubt you can do it straha replied now that we have come to tosev we are going to make this world as much like home as we can you would be addled to expect us to behave any differently the war between the race and us tosevites has never really stopped has it his driver said we are not shooting at each other as much as we used to but we are still fighting when there is shooting you big uglies do not usually enjoy it straha said i offer the example of the deutsche for your contemplation believe me shiplord my superiors are contemplating it his driver said but you did not answer my question or did not answer it fully i am surprised you needed to ask it straha replied of course the struggle goes on by whatever means appear convenient the leaders of the race will not be excessively concerned as to what those methods are results will matter far more to them they are not in a hurry they are never in a hurry that has cost them here on tosev the big ugly remarked truth straha admitted i advocated more haste myself which led to nothing but my exile but our usual slow pace also has its advantages we move so slowly our pressure is all but imperceptible that does not mean it is not there however pursing his absurdly mobile lips the big ugly let out a soft low whistle the sound was utterly different from anything the race could produce straha had needed a long time to figure out what it meant something on the order of resignation at last his driver said well we shall just have to go on exerting pressure of our own if we intend to survive is that not also a truth yes i should say so straha answered the question is whether you tosevites will be able to discover and to use effective forms of pressure i think we shall manage his driver said if there is one thing we big uglies are good at it is making nuisances of ourselves straha could hardly quarrel with that had the tosevites not been good at making nuisances of themselves their world would be firmly under the dominion of the race today the exshiplord turned an eye turret toward the driver and found a way in which to change the subject are you not letting the hairs between your mouth and your snout escape from cutting im growing a mustache yes the big ugly replied in english why straha asked i have seen other male tosevites with such adornments and i do not have a high opinion of them when yours is complete you will look as if you have a large dark brown moth that last necessarily was an english word perched on your upper lip his driver laughed loud noisy tosevite laughter i think itll look good he said still in english if i decide i dont like it i can always shave the damn thing off you know i suppose so straha said we of the race would not be so casual about altering our appearance i know that the driver returned to the language of the race it is one of the advantages we tosevites still have over you ginger is another he held up a fleshy hand to keep straha from interrupting i do not mean its effect on males i mean its effect on females like it or not you are becoming more and more like us in matters pertaining to mating strahas thoughtful hiss was the races equivalent of the drivers low whistle the american authorities had not saddled him with a fool life would have been easier if they had slowly the exshiplord said we are doing our best to resist these changes and may yet succeed and we may succeed in keeping your domestic animals out of the united states his driver said but i do not think that is the way to bet besides you are not thinking in the long term here shiplord how long before some enterprising male or female sends a big crate of ginger back to home aboard a starship what will happen then do you suppose this time strahas hiss was more dismayed than thoughtful once commerce between tosev and home got going half the males and females involved in it would want to smuggle ginger for the sake of the profits involved in it only items of enormous value and low bulk traveled between the stars nothing else made economic sense and without the tiniest shred of doubt the tosevite herb fit the bill in every particular interstellar smuggling between home and either rabotev or halless had never amounted to much between home and tosev well straha thought however large that problem may become it is not one about which i shall have to worry winter in edmonton had put david goldfarb in mind of siberia not that hed ever been to siberia of course but he was used to the mild temperatures of the british isles a great many words might have described winter in edmonton but mild wasnt any of them goldfarb had almost dreaded summer wondering if it would rise above the subarctic to his surprise and relief it did it got as warm as london ever did and even a bit warmer at the end of june it soared into the eighties and stayed there for more than a week i should be wearing a pith helmet and shorts he told his boss when he came into the saskatchewan river widget works ltd hal walsh grinned at him i wouldnt lose any sleep if you did he answered but youd look like a jerk if it decided to snow while you were dressed that way to goldfarbs still inexperienced ear walsh sounded like a yank an englishman would have said something like a right chump in place of the widgetmasters american slang but that when you got right down to it was beside the point could it snow goldfarb asked in a small voice jack devereaux spoke before walsh could it doesnt snow in summer here more than every other year for a horrid moment goldfarb thought he was serious when hal walshs grin made it plain the other engineer didnt mean it goldfarb glared at devereaux if you pull my leg any harder itll come off in your hand he said doing his best to seem the picture of affronted dignity all he accomplished was to make walsh and devereaux both laugh at him his boss said if you cant look at the world crosseyed you shouldnt be working here you know really every once in a while british reserve came in handy i never should have noticed this time walsh stared at him wondering whether to believe jack devereaux was quicker on the uptake okay david he said now you can let go of my leg fair enough new boy on the block goldfarb often felt he had to make a stand and defend his own turf he turned to hal walsh whats on the plate for this morning the usual walsh replied trying to steal more secrets from the lizards gadgetry and turning it into things people can use if youre very very good sometimes youre even allowed to have an idea all your own devereaux added but youre not supposed to let on that you did then everybody else might start having ideas too and where would we be if that happened about where we are if the ideas we come up with are better than the other blokes goldfarb answered walsh said that notion you had for showing telephone numbers is a winner david we just got an order from the calgary police an order big enough that i think youve earned yourself another bonus check any time calgary buys from edmonton you know weve got something good jack devereaux added they dont love us and we dont love them its like toronto and montreal or los angeles and san francisco down in the states glasgow and edinburgh goldfarb murmured picking an example from the british isles he nodded to walsh doing his best not to seem very pleased at the news of the bonus the money was welcome in this world money was always welcome but as a jew he didnt want to seem excited about it he cared what gentiles thought about his people and didnt want to give them an excuse to think nasty thoughts after a little more chat each of the engineers fixed a cup of tea and took it to his desk goldfarb had been pleasantly surprised to find tea so common in canada hed assumed the dominion like the usa was a land that preferred coffee he was glad hed been wrong fortified he studied the latest piece of hardware hal walsh had given him it had his boss assured him come from the engine of a lizard landcruiser what it did in the motor was rather less certain he just had the widget not the engine of which it was a part he thought it was the electronic controller for the fuelinjection system that took the place carburetors had in earthly internalcombustion engines you know what the trouble is dont you he said to jack devereaux of course i do his fellow engineer answered our gadgets look like they do what they do these lizard creations are nothing but electronic components slapped together they arent obvious the way our technology is thats it goldfarb nodded gratefully the very thing i was thinking of we have to work hard to figure out what theyre good for and what they could be good for if we tweaked them a little he glowered at the control unit it had a highly specialized job to do and if it was anything like most lizard widgets did that job extremely well he wouldnt have been surprised to learn the americans and germans and russians had copied it for their tanks not that the germans were allowed any panzers these days the collapse of the reich left him altogether undismayed back in his days with the raf his work with lizard technology had been perfectly straightforward if it had to do with matters military and especially with matters pertaining to radar hed done his best to adapt it to related human uses if it didnt hed either ignored it or passed it on to someone whose bailiwick it was things didnt work like that at the saskatchewan river widget works here the more outlandish his ideas the better anybody could come up with direct conversions of lizard gadgets to their nearest human equivalents sometimes that was worth doing his system for reading phone numbers was a case in point but thinking lefthanded was liable to pay off more in the long run bloody wonderful he thought how do i go about thinking lefthanded he couldnt force it whenever he tried he failed turning his mind away from the widget in front of him letting his thoughts drift as they would worked better but that was a relative term sometimes inspiration simply would not strike hed feared hal walsh would sack him if he failed to come up with something brilliant his first couple of days on the job but walsh whod been doing this sort of directed woolgathering a lot longer than he had took dry spells in stride and now goldfarb had one solid achievement under his belt having seen that he could do it his boss was less inclined to insist that he do it to order david spent the whole day playing with the lizard control gadget and by quitting time had come up with nothing in the least resembling inspiration walsh slapped him on the back dont lose any sleep about it he advised give it another shot tomorrow if its still not going anywhere well pull another gadget out of the bin and see what your evil twisted imagination does with that all right at the moment goldfarb didnt find his imagination either evil or twisted he had enough trouble finding it at all the sun still stood high in the sky when he started home in summer daylight lingered long here edmonton was farther north than london almost as far north as belfast his last posting in the raf in winter of course the sun hardly appeared at all but he didnt want to think about winter with long days to enjoy when he got back to his flat they called them apartments in edmonton in the american style he broke into a grin roast chicken he exclaimed my favorite itll be ready in about twenty minutes his wife called from the kitchen would you like a bottle of beer first id love one he answered as far as he was concerned canadian taverns couldnt come close to matching proper british pubs but canadian beer in bottles was better than its british equivalents he smiled at naomi when she brought him a bottle of moosehead youve got one for yourself too have you and why not she answered saucily her accent british on top of the faint german undertone she still kept after escaping from the reich in her teens not long before no more jews got out of germany alive she took a sip its not bad she said not bad at all was she comparing it to the british brews she remembered or to the german ones from long ago david goldfarb didnt have the nerve to ask dinner was only a couple of minutes away when the telephone rang muttering under his breath goldfarb got up and answered it hullo if it was some cheeky salesman he intended to give the bugger a piece of his mind hullo david old chum so good to catch up with you again the voice on the other end of the line was cheerful english educated and familiar recognizing it at once goldfarb wished he hadnt roundbush he said and then his voice harsh what do you want with me youre a smart lad i daresay you can figure that out for yourself basil roundbush answered cheerfully you didnt do as you were told and im afraid youre going to have to pay for that automatically goldfarbs eyes went to the gadget that showed the numbers of incoming calls if he knew where the raf officer whod given him so much trouble was he might be able to do something about him or have the authorities do something about him but the screen on the device showed no number at all as far as it was concerned nobody was on the other end of the call with a laugh roundbush said i know youve flanged up something from the lizards telephone switching gear that wont help you you know ive got plenty of chums among the race there are times when they need to neutralize such circuits and they havent any trouble doing it he obviously knew whereof he spoke sod off and leave me alone goldfarb growled i dont want anything to do with you and i dont want anything to do with your bleeding chums either youve made that plain enough roundbush still sounded happy but no one cares very much about your view of things you know youve been uncooperative and now youre going to have to pay the price i rather wish it were otherwise you had promise but such is life he hung up so did goldfarb cursing under his breath who was that naomi called as she set the table basil roundbush goldfarb wished he could have come up with a comforting convincing lie the gentle clatter of plates and silverware stopped his wife hurried out into the living room what did he want she asked i thought we were rid of him for good i thought we were too david answered i wish we were but no such luck he sighed he didnt come right out and say what he wanted but he didnt have to not really i already know that he wants a piece of my hide his right hand folded into a fist hell have a devil of a time getting it thats all ive got to say glen johnson stared into space from the control room of the lewis and clark in solar orbit not far from the asteroid ceres there was a lot of space to see the stars blazed clear and steady against the black sky of hard vacuum the glass that held the vacuum at bay had been coated to kill reflections except for knowing that it kept him alive johnson could ignore it turning to mickey flynn the lewis and clarks second pilot the man just senior to him he said i wonder how many of those stars you could see from earth on a really clear night sixtythree percent flynn answered at once how do you know that johnson asked he was prepared to take the figure as gospel truth flynn collected strange statistics the way head hunters collected heads simple he said now beaming as if the entire magnificent show out there beyond the window had been created for his benefit alone i made it up he had a splendid deadpan if hed claimed hed read it somewhere or done some arcane calculations to prove it johnson would have believed him as things were johnson snorted thatll teach me to ask you a serious question no flynn said itll teach me to give you a serious answer if id been any more serious i would have been downright morose his face donned moroseness as he might have donned a sweater all it got him was another snort from glen johnson johnson peered ahead toward jupiter on which ceres and the lewis and clark were slowly gaining i keep thinking i ought to be able to see the galilean moons with the naked eye when jupiters in opposition in respect to us you will be able to flynn told him well only be two astronomical units away then more or less half as far as we would be back on earth but for now we have the same sort of view we would from back home minus atmosphere of course before johnson could say anything the other pilot held up a hand as if taking an oath and that i assure you is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you hannah johnson said at which flynn assumed an expression of injured innocence nevertheless johnson believed him the numbers felt right flynn and walter stone the first pilot both knew the mathematics of space travel better than he did hed flown fighter planes against the lizards and then upper stages into earth orbit other people had done the thinking while hed done the real piloting if he hadnt got overly curious about what was going on aboard the american space station he never would have been shanghaied when the space station turned out to be a spaceship he hadnt wanted to come along but he wasnt going back not after two and a half years in weightlessness lieutenant colonel johnson lieutenant colonel glen johnson his name rang out over the lewis and clarks pa system oh christ he thought what have i done to piss off the commandant now but it wasnt the commandant the pa operator went on report to scooter launching bay one immediately lieutenant colonel johnson lieutenant colonel see you later johnson said to flynn as he pushed off from a chair and glided out of the control room and ill be glad to be seen flynn called after him johnson was already swinging from one corridor handhold to the next in weightlessness imitating chimpanzees swinging through the trees was the best way to get around corridor intersections had mirrors mounted to cut down on collisions whats going on johnson asked when he got to the launch bay a technician was giving the scooter a little rocket with a motor mounted at the front and another at the rear a onceover he said theres some kind of medical trouble in dome on that rock with the big black vein through it okay i know the one you mean johnson said about twenty miles rearward of us right he waited for the tech to nod then went on is it bad enough that they want me to bring a doctor over one of the things going out into space had done was let people find new ways to maim themselves but the technician said no what they want you to do is bring the gal back here so the doc can look her over see whats going on gal johnson clicked his tongue between his teeth women made up only about a third of the lewis and clarks crew losing anybody hurt losing a woman the idea shouldnt have hurt twice as much but somehow it seemed to whats wrong with her she hurt herself no the tech said again belly pain okay ill go get her the lewis and clark had a chamber that could be spun to simulate gravity only aboutg but that was enough for surgery operating in weightlessness with blood floating everywhere wasnt even close to practical the chamber so far as johnson knew hadnt been used yet but there was a first time for everything youre ready the tech said youre fully fueled oxygen supply is full too batteries are good radio checks are all nominal let me in then johnson glided past the technician and into the scooter after he closed the gastight canopy he ran his own checks it was his neck after all everything looked the way the tech said it was johnson would have been astonished and furious had that proved otherwise as things were he spoke into the radio mike ready when you are okay a gastight door slid shut behind the scooter a moment later another one slid open in front of it a charge of compressed air pushed the little rocket out of its bay johnson waited till it had drifted far enough away from the lewis and clark then lit up his attitude jets and his rear motor and started off toward dome he smiled in enormous pleasure as he made the trip mickey flynn and walter stone were both much more qualified to pilot the lewis and c ar cthan he was if he ever got stuck with that assignment it would only be because something had gone drastically wrong somewhere in a scooter though in a scooter im the hottest damn pilot in the whole solar system he said after making sure he wasnt transmitting without false modesty he knew he was right his years as a combat flier and in earthorbital missions gave him a feel for the little rocket nobody else aboard the lewis and clark came close to matching this was spaceflight too spaceflight in its purest form spaceflight by the seat of his pants he made only one concession to his instruments he kept an eye on the radar screen to make sure his mark one eyeball didnt miss any tumbling rocks that might darken his day if they smacked into the scooter he had to be especially watchful heading toward dome since he was going so to speak against the flow he spied one large object on the radar that he couldnt see at all but he didnt let it worry him he supposed it was inevitable that the lizards should have sent out unmanned probes to keep an eye on what the americans were doing in the asteroid belt that made life difficult but not impossible and as the americans ran up more and more domes and spread farther and farther away from the lewis and clark the lizards surveillance job got harder and harder their spy ship was well off the track between the lewis and clark and dome so johnson didnt waste more than a moments thought on it he fired up the radio once more dome this is the scooter i say again dome this is the scooter i understand you have a pickup for me over thats right scooter said whoever was manning the radio at the pressure dome liz brocks hurting pretty bad were hoping its her appendix anything else would be worse estimate your arrive time twenty minutes sounds about right johnson agreed ill get her back and the docll figure out whats going on with her hope everything turns out okay out under his breath he muttered liz brock thats not so good she was the ships numberone expert on electrolyzing ice to get oxygen for breathing and fuel and hydrogen for fuel she was also a nicelooking blonde shed never shown the least interest in johnson but he didnt believe in wasting valuable natural resources he used his forward rocket motor to kill his velocity relative to the little asteroid on which dome had gone up then guided the scooter into the domes airlock with tiny delicate bursts from his attitude jets ever so slowly the scooter settled toward the floor of the airlock the gravity of the asteroid which was less than a mile across seemed almost as much rumor as reality as soon as the outer airlock door closed and his gauges showed there was pressure outside johnson unsealed the scooters canopy he didnt have to wait long two people floated into the airlock liz brock and a man who was helping her he said weve loaded her up with as much codeine as she can hold and then maybe a little more for luck doesnt help the electrolysis expert said her voice was slow and dragging doesnt help much i mean i feel like im drunk i feel like my whole heads weightless but i still hurt she looked like it she had lines at the corners of her mouth that hadnt been there the last time johnson saw her skin stretched tight across her cheekbones she kept one hand on the right side of her belly though she didnt seem to notice she was doing it after she got into the scooter johnson fastened her safety harness when she didnt do anything but fumble with it anxiously he asked the fellow whod helped her into the airlock shes not throwing up is she no the man answered which relieved him dealing with vomit in the scooter was the last thing he wanted to do he used his attitude jets to slide out of the airlock then went back to the lewis and clark faster than hed gone away when he returned to the ship dr miriam rosen was waiting at the inner airlock door to the shuttle bay come on liz lets get you over to the xray machine she said well see if we can figure out whats going on in there all right liz brock sounded altogether indifferent maybe that was the codeine talking maybe too it was the pain talking johnson wanted to tag along to find out whatever he could but didnt have the nerve he watched the doctor lead away the electrolysis expert before long hed get answers through the grapevine and he did things came out piecemeal as they had a way of doing it wasnt appendicitis he heard that pretty soon he didnt hear what it was for three or four days liver cancer he exclaimed to walter stone who told him what can they do about that not a damn thing the senior pilot said grimly keep her from hurting too bad till she dies thats about the size of it he seldom showed much of what he thought but he was visibly upset here could have been you or me too just as easy no rhyme or reason to this only dumb luck yeah johnson felt lousy too he didnt mind being an ambulance driver but he hadnt signed up to be in essence a hearse driver and there were also other things to worry about this wont hurt the plan too much will it now stone looked stern and determined nothing hurts the plan glen nothing good glen johnson said weve still got a lot of work to do with a shriek of decelerating jet engines the japanese airliner rolled to a stop on the runway just outside of edmonton the pilot spoke over the intercom first in his own language and then in english hardly more comprehensible what the hell is he talking about penny summers asked one from column a two from column b rance auerbach guessed penny gave him a dirty look he ignored it and went on it would have been a lot faster and a lot cheaper to fly a us airliner out of tahiti and it would have made stops in the states too penny pointed out i didnt want to take the chance well okay auerbach said with a sigh but ill tell you something there arent a hell of a lot of places left where we can go without somebody wanting to take a shot at us as soon as we get there that gets old you know what i mean things ought to be pretty peaceful for the layover here penny sighed too rance knew what that meant whenever she came to someplace peaceful she got bored when she got bored she started turning things on their ear hed had enough of things getting turned on their ear telling her so wouldnt do him any good he knew as much he didnt think she started stirring things up on purpose which didnt mean they didnt get stirred up groundcrew men wheeled a deplaning ladder up to the airliners front door rance grunted even more painfully than usual as he heaved himself upright except for a couple of trips back to the head hed been trapped in a nonetoospacious seat ever since midway island he hadnt been sitting here forever he couldnt have been but it sure as hell felt that way baggage and customs and passport control through gate four a groundcrew man bawled again and again gate four he pointed toward the airport terminal as if none of the deplaning passengers could possibly have noticed the big red above the nearest gate without his help well well what have we here a canadian customs man said examining their documents with considerable interest papers from the race valid for south africa only rather emphatically valid for south africa only i might add then all these endorsements from free france a japanese transit visa and a transit visa for the dominion here fascinating you dont see things like this every day you see anything wrong rance put a little challenge in his raspy ruined voice and you sir do not sound like a south african the customs man said you sound like an american from the south doesnt matter what i sound like auerbach said only thing that matters is my papers are in order thats right penny agreed a lot of places they could have made things go smoothly by greasing the functionarys palm there were parts of the usa where that would have worked like a charm eyeing this customs man auerbach thought a bribe would only get him in deeper he kept his hand away from his billfold i think we had better have a look at your baggage the canadian official said a good thorough look he and his pals spent the next hour examining the baggage not only by eye but with a fluoroscope a customs man patted rance down a police matron took penny off into another room when she came back steam was coming out of her ears but the matron shrugged to the customs men so penny had passed the test you see rance said were clean he was awfully glad neither he nor penny had tried to sneak a gun through the dominion canadians didnt like that sort of thing at all the lead customs agent glared at him you have close to fifty pounds of ginger in your suitcases he pointed out its not illegal rance and penny spoke together thats so the customs man didnt sound happy about it but couldnt deny it still i strongly suggest you would be very wise to keep your noses clean while you are in edmonton give me those preposterous papers with quite unnecessary force he applied the stamps that cleared them for entry because auerbach wasnt up to carrying much they rented a little cart to get all the luggage to the cab rank fortunately the first waiting cabby drove an enormous oldsmobile whose equally enormous trunk devoured all the suitcases with the greatest of ease four seasons hotel penny told him as he held the door open for her and rance yes maam he answered best hotel in town his accent wasnt that far removed from her midwestern tones next best thing to being back in the states auerbach thought he hadnt known what to expect from the hotel choosing one from thousands of miles away couldnt be anything but a gamble but this gamble paid off not bad penny said as bellmen all but fought over their suitcases how long do you expect to be staying sir the desk clerk asked rance only a few days rance answered with luck theyd sell their ginger here and then head on to france with a nice stash without luck theyd have to try to smuggle the ginger past the noses of the races french chums and probably past the lizards own snouts too rance didnt like thinking about all the things that could happen without luck phew penny said when they finally made it to their room yeah rance hobbled over to the bed let his stick fall to the thickly carpeted floor and stretched out at full length on the mattress his back made little crackling noises jesus that feels good he said i feel like i was stuffed into a sardine can for the last month i know what you mean penny lay down beside him the japs make seats and spaces between seats that suit them but theyre too damn cramped for americans im not a great big gal but im not teenytiny like that either he reached out and let his hand rest almost as if by accident on her leg one thing led to another and then to another after that both of them worn out by long travel and other happier exertions fell asleep on that big comfortable bed when rance woke up he heard the shower going it stopped a couple of minutes later penny came out wrapped in a white hotel towel oh good she said when she saw his eyes were open now i dont have to shake you youd better not sitting up made rances ruined shoulder yelp but he did it anyhow what time is it asking her was easier than looking at the clock on the nightstand half past six she answered why dont you spruce up too then we can go downstairs and get ourselves some supper as if to spur him out of bed she let the towel drop okay he said groping for his stick when he would sooner have been groping her but soap and hot water were good in their own way after endless hours in that airplane he felt filmed with grime scraping sandy graystreaked stubble off his chin and cheeks made him look less like a stumblebum and more like an upandcoming ginger dealer everybody in the vintage room the four seasons restaurant looked like somebody whether he was or not whiskies arrived with commendable speed the steaks rance and penny ordered took a lot longer though the service was courteous and attentive but it was slow after japanese food on the airliner auerbachs stomach seemed empty as outer space he finally lost patience when his waiter walked by he growled what are you doing waiting for the calf to grow up so you can butcher it im sorry sir the waiter didnt sound more than professionally sorry im sure your supper will be ready before too very long off he went the restaurant wasnt crowded but things didnt move very fast even so a couple of tables over a fellow with a splendid graying handlebar mustache waved for his own waiter i say he boomed in tones unmistakably uppercrust british has everyone in your kitchen died of old age oh good penny said with a laugh were not the only ones who cant get fed not the only ones starving to death you mean rance grumbled he studied the englishman after a moment he grunted softly god damn me to hell and throw me in a frying pan if thats not basil roundbush i havent seen him in years but thats got to be him couldnt be anybody else by jesus that ginger smuggler you have connections with penny asked the very same auerbach said now what the devil is he doing here i hadnt heard that hed given up on england he paused for that matter with the nazis down for the count theres no point in giving up on england you know his eyes narrowed maybe hes here on business yeah pennys eyes lit up maybe we could do some business if he is finding somebody like that we wouldnt need to chase around after locals with connections it could save us a lot of time youre right money too rance grabbed his stick and used it to get to his feet he limped over to the table where basil roundbush was sitting and sketched a salute long as youre not getting fed either want to not get fed along with my lady friend and me roundbushs gaze swung toward him the englishman was so handsome rance wondered if he ought to let him anywhere near penny but it was done now and no slower than if hed seen rance day before yesterday roundbush said auerbach as i live and breathe he sprang to his feet and shook rances hand what are you doing in this benighted land without supper this and that we can talk about it if you want to auerbach said and i might ask you the same question i will ask you the same question when you get over there i hope my waiter eventually realizes where ive gone or even that ive gone but roundbush grabbed his own drink and followed rance back to his table he bowed over pennys hand and kissed it she did everything but giggle like a schoolgirl auerbach had known she would sourly he waved to his waiter for another drink roundbushs waiter came by the empty table and stared in blank dismay more handwaving got that straightened out the dinners did eventually arrive over what even a texan had to admit was pretty good beef rance asked and what are you doing in canada taking care of a nasty little spot of business basil roundbush answered chap named david goldfarb fellow wouldnt do what he was supposed to cant have that go on bad for business dont you know goldfarb rances ears pricked up not the fellow you sent down to marseille why yes how the devil could you know that before auerbach spoke roundbush answered his own question dont tell me you were the people the lizards had involved in that fiasco small world isnt it too damn small sometimes rance said it could be it could be basil roundbush waved airily in any case the blokes not wanted anything to do with us since he knows rather more than he should and so he shrugged unfortunate but thats how life is sometimes you ask me you ought to leave him alone rance said you asked for trouble sending a jew down into the reich id give you whatfor too you tried that on me penny kicked him under the table he wondered why till he remembered they might be able to sell roundbush their ginger well that was water over the dam now the englishman gave him a frosty stare im afraid your opinion doesnt much concern me old man i intend doing what suits me not what suits you rances temper kindled he didnt care who the limey was or how big a wheel nobody brushed him off like that nobody you can goddamn well leave him alone mister or youll answer to me penny kicked him again harder he ignored that too hed thought she would make trouble here and now he was doing it roundbush didnt laugh in his face but he came close he said if you think your foolish words will do the slightest thing toward changing my mind old man i must tell you youre mistaken if you think im just talking old man youre full of shit rance replied penny did her best to take his leg off at the ankle the lizards had done their best to take it off at the thigh he wasnt afraid of anything not any more not even maybe especially not of dying it gave him an odd sort of freedom he intended to make the most of it whenever the telephone rang these days whether at home or at the saskatchewan river widget works david goldfarb answered it with a certain amount of apprehension he also answered it with pencil and paper handy to record the phone numbers of callers that wouldnt do him any good with basil roundbush of course but it might help with local hired muscle if the englishman chose to use any goldfarb had no way of guessing how many scrambler sets roundbush had brought along saskatchewan river widgets he said now pencil poised david goldfarb speaking hello goldfarb we met once upon a time a long ways away from here do you remember it wasnt roundbushs voice it wasnt a british voice at all that accent was american with an odd twang the fellow on the other end of the line also spoke in a harsh rasp as if he hadnt had a cigarette out of his mouth for five minutes since the day he was born more than anything else that rasp reminded david goldfarb of who the caller had to be marseille he blurted and then youre one of the yanks the lizards used to try to nab pierre dutourd thats right the american said names rance auerbach in case you dont recollect you ought to be interested in hearing i had supper with that fellow called roundbush last night goldfarb already had his number written down he could pass it on to the police with no trouble at all voice tight he said and i suppose youre going to tell me youre the one who plans on finishing me off anything more he could pass on to the police would be welcome too but this auerbach said christ no you damn fool i just wanted to make sure you knew old basil was gunning for you i told him to leave you the hell alone and he told me to piss up a rope so im on your side son nobodyd been on goldfarbs side for a long time actually that wasnt quite true without jerome jones help he never would have been able to emigrate from britain at all and without george bagnall he might still be languishing in bureaucratic limbo in ottawa but roundbush and his chums seemed much more determined to do him harm than anybody was to do him good he said i know dear basil is in edmonton thanks thats nice auerbach said do you know he intends to do you in too as a matter of fact yes david answered talking about it felt surprisingly good im taking what precautions i can those were pitifully few and he could do even less for naomi and the children than he could for himself i told the son of a bitch hed answer to me if he tried any nasty business on you rance auerbach said he didnt cotton to hearing that but i told him anyhow after he sent you to france he can damn well leave you alone now did you goldfarb was frankly amazed and no doubt showed it in an absent way he wondered what sort of name rance was the yanks could come up with some strange ones but that didnt matter he went on and what did he say to that nothing too kind is my guess right the first time auerbach coughed then muttered damn he drew in a breath whose wheezing goldfarb could hear over the telephone before continuing no he wasnt too happy but then he doesnt think i can do much remembering how physically damaged the american was goldfarb feared his former raf superior was right he didnt want to say that what he did say was what can you do less than id like dammit on account of im not gonna be here real long but ive already talked to some of the cops here auerbach answered for some reason or other canadians take things like death threats a lot more seriously than we do down in the states was that supposed to be funny goldfarb couldnt tell he said youre supposed to take things like that seriously arent you auerbach laughed then he coughed again then he cursed again he said only goes to show youve never lived in texas after another round of coughs and another round of soft curses he went on listen you know where you can get your hands on a pistol without filling out forms from here to next week no goldfarb answered hed been advised hell hed been told to leave his service weapon behind when he came to canada hed done it too and spent the time since basil roundbush first called wishing he hadnt too bad the american said the trouble with guys like good old basil and his pals is they dont play by the rules if you do youre liable to end up a dead duck i know david said unhappily but what can you do about all this what can i do about it for that matter well making sure you dont get killed would be a good start auerbach answered i quite agree david goldfarb said ive been trying to do that myself for quite some time now what can you do about it i dont right know i wish i were gonna be here longer the american said ive got a marker or two i may be able to call in but god only knows if theyre still worth anything finding out will take a little bit of doing i havent tried to get ahold of these people in a long time and i wont be able to tell them everything about this business even if they arent pushing up lilies somewhere david pondered that it could add up to any number of different things but he saw one that looked more likely than any of the others you know germans he asked and wondered if he really wanted to find out the answer for close to half a minute he didnt at last auerbach said well youre nobodys fool are you i like to think not anyhow goldfarb said of course people like to think all sorts of things that others might find unlikely and isnt that the sad and sorry truth rance auerbach said okay hang in there goldfarb ill see what i can do he hung up from the next desk over hal walsh said i hope that wasnt trouble david as goldfarb set his own phone back in its cradle i dont think so david told his boss walsh nodded not entirely convinced since goldfarb wasnt entirely convinced either he just shrugged and went back to work he had to look down at the drawings in front of him for a while before he could remember what the hell hed been trying to do he spent the rest of the day at half speed he couldnt keep his mind fully on the latest project hal walsh had set him his eyes kept drifting toward the telephone when it rang half an hour later he jumped but it was only naomi asking him to stop at the grocery for a few things on the way home from work i can do that he said i should hope so his wife answered its not that hard especially now when you have sensible money to deal with though shed lived in britain for the larger part of her life shed never quite come to terms with pence and shillings and pounds canadian dollars and cents made her much happier than the traditional currency ever had goldfarb left the office about half an hour later than he might have otherwise he was doing his best to make up for being distracted as usual when the weather was even close to decent he walked home his flat was less than a mile from the widget works that kept the beginnings of a middleaged potbelly from becoming too much more than a beginning with a choice of several grocers shops on the way he intended to stop at the one closest to his block of flats walking was all very well but walking with a paper sack was something else again he was halfway across the street on whose far side stood the grocers when he heard the roar of a racing automobile engine and a couple of shouts of look out his head whipped around a big chevy an enormous auto for one used to british motorcars was bearing down on him and the driver plainly had not the slightest intention of stopping had he panicked he would have died right there he waited as long as he thought he possibly could perhaps a whole second then dashed forward the chevys driver couldnt react quite fast enough the edge of his mudguard touched goldfarbs jacket but then he was past and then that driver had to slam on the brakes to keep from smashing into the cars stopped at the light at the next corner he couldnt do that quite fast enough either not at the speed he was going it had been a while since david heard the crash of crumpling metal and shattering glass but the sound was unmistakable goldfarb sprinted toward the chevy that had come to grief he hoped the driver had gone straight through the windscreen it never for a moment occurred to him to doubt that the fellow had tried to run him down on purpose and if the bastard hadnt got himself a face full of plate glass goldfarb wanted answers from him maybe the local constabulary could get them or maybe hed start bouncing the buggers head off the pavement till he sang but the driver hadnt gone through the windscreen he managed to get his door open and started to run stop him goldfarb shouted stop that man in britain a crowd would have taken off after the man he didnt know what would happen in canada he found out a crowd took off after the fellow a crowd led by the man with whose car the driver had just collided a younger fellow brought the fleeing driver down with a tackle that would have earned him pats on the back in a rugby scrum he almost killed you buddy somebody said to goldfarb it was like he didnt see you at all oh he saw me all right david said grimly hes just sorry he missed the other man stared at him and tried to laugh thinking hed made a joke when he didnt laugh back the other fellow went off shaking his head goldfarb didnt care because a police car screeched around the corner and stopped the men who piled out were dressed more like american cops than british bobbies but that didnt matter much they took efficient charge of the miscreant he tried to kill me goldfarb told one of them before he smashed into that other motorcar he almost ran me down while i was crossing the street probably drunk the policeman said no i mean it literally david insisted he did try to kill me he swerved towards me but i managed to dodge both policemen looked at him one of them said maybe youd better come to the station then sir and give a statement id be glad to if youll let me ring my wife when we get there so she knows im all right and ill be late goldfarb answered the policemen nodded he rode to the station in the front seat the man whod tried to run him down in the back they didnt say a word to each other all the way there sweating in his coveralls johannes drucker waited for a lizard to open the door to his cubicle aboard the starship hed tried to destroy at precisely the appointed moment the door slid open the male drucker presumed it was a male who stood in the doorway said come with me it shall be done superior sir drucker answered the lizards mouth fell open the gesture the race used for laughter i am a female she said my name is nesseref now come my shuttlecraft is waiting at the rotation hub of this ship it shall be done superior female drucker said both stressing the word and adding an emphatic cough that made nesseref laugh again when drucker strode out into the corridor he found two armed lizards waiting to make sure he didnt go anywhere he wasnt supposed to now that they were finally releasing him the german spaceman had no intention of doing that but he would have mistrusted one of them were their roles reversed he wished those roles had been reversed he followed nesseref toward the hub of the starship the guards followed him with every deck they went inward they got lighter by the time they reached the rotation hub they weighed nothing at all nesseref entered her shuttlecraft first then called come in i have an acceleration couch shaped for a tosevite i thank you drucker said and obeyed the couch looked to be of american manufacture he strapped himself in nesseref wasted no time in using her maneuvering jets to get free of the starship drucker watched her work in silent fascination at last he broke the silence your ship has far more in the way of computeraided controls than the upper stage i flew a good thing too the lizard replied i think you tosevites have to be addled to come up into space in your inadequate machines we used what we had drucker answered with a shrug he spoke in the past tense the reich would not be going into space again any time soon if the race had its way and that was all too likely germans would never go into space again he asked now that i am returning to tosev where in deutschland will you land me by the city called nuremberg nesseref answered such are my orders nuremberg drucker sighed hed been warned but still that is in the far south of the land and my home is in the north could you not have picked a closer shuttlecraft port there are no closer functioning shuttlecraft ports nesseref answered in fact i am given to understand that that is at the moment the only functioning shuttlecraft port in the subregion had no one told you of this well yes johannes drucker admitted unhappily but it still presents great difficulties for me how am i to travel from nuremberg to my home will the railroads be working will folk on the ground give me money to travel i know nothing of any of this nesseref s voice held nothing but indifference my orders are to put you on the ground at the shuttlecraft port outside nuremberg i shall obey them obey them she did with an efficiency that outdid anything merely teutonic a single neat burn took the shuttlecraft out of earth orbit after that she hardly even had to adjust the machines course another burn halted the shuttlecraft above the tarmac of the port and let its legs kiss the ground with hardly a jar nesseref opened the hatch the mild air of german summer mingled with the hot dry stuff the race preferred get out she told drucker i do not want any more radioactive contamination than i can help getting it shall be done drucker scrambled down the ladder and let himself drop to the soil of the vaterland no one lizard or human came across the tarmac to greet him now that he was here he was on his own he looked toward what had been the famous skyline of nuremberg no more that skyline had been truncated abridged some of the massive buildings were simply gone others were wreckage half as tall as they had been he shook his head and let out a soft sad whistle no matter how harshly the reich had used him and his family it was still his country seeing it brought low like this tore at him shouldnt have bothered attacking that starship he thought the war was already lost by then i should have landed the upper stage of my a in some neutral country the usa maybe england and let myself be interned too late now too late for everything now hed expected to go out in a blaze of glory when he made the attack run on the lizard ship no such luck now he had to deal with the consequences of living longer than hed thought he would he glanced around the tarmac again no nobody cared he was here he didnt have ten pfennigs in his pocket what point to taking money into space where would he spend it but he faced different questions here how would he get along without it where would he find his next meal if he did find a meal how would he pay for it where would he find his next meal somewhere to the north that was all he knew as the crow flew greifswald was about five hundred kilometers from nuremberg he wasnt a crow and he didnt think hed do much in the way of flying any time soon hed be walking and likely walking a lot more than five hundred kilometers who was it whod said a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step somebody chinese he thought he took the first step on the way back toward greifswald before long he was off the tarmac of the shuttlecraft port he soon discovered the lizards had machinegun and artillery and missile emplacements around it none of the males he presumed they were males though hed been wrong with the shuttlecraft pilot paid him any attention he was authorized to be there he didnt care to think what would have happened if he hadnt been before long he came on a road leading northeast he started tramping along it that was the direction in which he wanted to go pretty soon hed either come to a village or farmhouse or hed pass a stream or a pond any which way hed get himself a drink he wondered how much radioactivity hed take in from the local water for that matter he wondered how much he was taking in every time he inhaled however much it was he couldnt do anything about it and he wondered why he saw no motor traffic on the road he didnt need long to find the answer to that the lizards had cratered it with dozens of little bomblets he remembered those weapons from the earlier round of fighting hed driven panzers then and hadnt worried so much about roads but wheeled vehicles couldnt go anywhere without them after a couple of kilometers he came upon a gang filling in craters the bomblets had left behind no bulldozers no tractors no powered equipment of any kind just men with shovels and picks and mattocks and crowbars slowly and methodically getting rid of one hole after another by their clothes some were local farmers others demobilized wehrmacht men still in grimy fieldgray it was hard to tell which group seemed more weary and dejected a soldier picked up a bucket and raised it to his mouth that was all drucker needed to see he waved and broke into a shambling trot and called hey can i have a swig out of that bucket who the devil are you asked the fellow whod just drunk water dribbled down his poorly shaved chin he pointed and what kind of crazy getup is that drucker glanced down at his coveralls the reich had had a thousand different dress and undress uniforms almost as many as the race had different styles of body paint nobody could keep track of all of them drucker gave his name adding lieutenant colonel reichs rocket force i was captured out in space the lizards just turned me loose tell you the truth im trying to figure out what to do next rocket force huh the wehrmacht man paused to wipe his sweaty forehead on his sleeve fat lot of good you buggers did anybody but he picked up the bucket and handed it to drucker the water was barely cool but went down like dark beer when drucker set down the bucket the fellow whod given it to him asked so where are you headed herr rocket man greifswald drucker answered he saw that meant nothing to anyone but him so he made things plainer its up near peenemunde by the baltic ach so the demobilized soldier raised an eyebrow if its up near peenemunde is anything left of it i dont know drucker said bleakly ive got i had anyway a wife and three kids i have to see if i can track them down good luck said the fellow whod given him water he sounded as if he thought drucker would need luck better than merely good drucker was afraid he thought the same thing after a moment the exsoldier remarked hell of a long way from the baltic to here how do you propose to get there walk if i have to drucker replied im getting an idea of what the roads are like are any trains running a few the former wehrmacht man said the rest of the laborers who seemed happy to get a break nodded when he continued not bloody many though they nodded again he waved and you see what the highways are like its not just this one either theyre all the same the stinking lizards paralyzed us weve got people starving because theres no way to get food from here to there and everything you can get costs ten times too much another laborer added the reichsmark isnt worth the paper its printed on any more ouch drucker winced we went through that after the first world war do we have to do it again the exsoldier said if everybodys got money and theres nothing to buy prices are going to go through the roof thats life he spat ill worry about all that scheisse later when ive got the time right now im just glad im still breathing a hell of a lot of people in the reich arent hey karl one of the other laborers said several men put their heads together and talked in voices too low for drucker to make out what they were saying they passed something back and forth among themselves he couldnt tell what they were doing there either he was almost on the point of wondering whether he ought to turn and run like hell when they broke apart the former wehrmacht man karl turned toward him and held out a moderately fat wad of banknotes here you go colonel he said thisll keep you eating for a couplethree days anyhow thank you very much drucker exclaimed from what he could see none of the laborers had enough to be able to spare much but they knew he had nothing at all and so theyd reached into their pockets he nodded thanks from the bottom of my heart its nothing karl said we all know what youre going through were all going through it too except for the ones whove been through it already theyre trying to come out the other side hope you make it up to greifswald hope you find your family too thanks drucker said again and if he didnt find his family hed have to to try to come out the other side too the phrase struck him as all too apt with a last nod he started walking again heading north heading home after the nazis occupied poland theyd built an enormous death factory at treblinka theyd been building an even bigger one outside oswiecim auschwitz theyd called it in german when the lizards came mordechai anielewicz had longed for revenge against the tormentors of the jews for a generation now he had it and now having it he discovered the folly of such wishes he could go anywhere he chose in the muchreduced greater german reich as a leader among the polish jews whod fought side by side with the lizards against the nazis in two wars now and as a man whod made sure his friends among the lizards helped all they could he had the backing of the race before entering germany hed got a document from the races authorities in poland authorizing him to call on the males occupying the reich for assistance he also had documents in german to overawe burgomeisters and other functionaries what hadnt occurred to him was how few german functionaries were left to overawe the lizards had done a truly astonishing job of pounding flat the part of germany just west of poland hed known that in the abstract the wehrmachts assault on poland had petered out not least because the germans couldnt keep their invading army supplied as he entered germany he saw exactly what that pounding had done kreuz where mordechai entered the reich had taken an explosivemetal bomb the center of the city had simply ceased to be except for one church spire and most of a factory chimney which still reached toward the heavens like the skeletal fingers of a dead man fused shiny glass gradually gave way to rubble outside the center of town this is what the nazis did to lodz anielewicz thought this is what they did to warsaw and to as many other cities as they could hit but theyd taken worse than theyd given that was dreadfully clear he asked a lizard officer how many deutsch cities did the race bomb with explosivemetal weapons i do not know not precisely the male answered many tens of them without a doubt hundreds very possibly the deutsche were stubborn they should have yielded long before they did they had no hope of defeating us and merely inflicted more suffering on their own population by refusing to give up the futile fight many tens hundreds very possibly the answer was horrifying enough to mordechai when he first heard it it became far more so when he got to the makeshift hospital on the far side of what had been kreuz tents and shacks housed people maimed or blinded or horribly burned by the explosivemetal bomb the handful of doctors and nurses and civilian volunteers were desperately overworked and had next to nothing with which to treat their patients mordechai multiplied that improvised hospital by tens hundreds very possibly he shivered though the day was fine even warm what sort of miracle was it that any germans survived at all a bespectacled doctor in a long none too clean white coat came up to him you are a person of some influence with the lizards he stated his voice brooking no argument you must be to be clean and well fed and traveling so what if i am mordechai asked you will try to obtain for us more medical supplies the doctor said again as if stating a law of nature you see what we lack humility anielewicz thought aloud he said youd ask this of me even though im a jew he let the german he had used slide into yiddish if the doctor the nazi doctor he thought couldnt follow too bad but the man only shrugged i would ask it if you were satan himself he answered i need these things my patients need these things you arent the only ones who do anielewicz observed that does not make my need any less urgent the doctor said from his point of view he might even have been right germans in torment suffered no less than jews in torment anielewicz wished he could deny that if he did though what would he be but the mirror image of a nazi roughly he said ill do what i can by the way the doctor looked at him the man thought he was lying but he spoke of the matter with the first lizard officer he encountered a couple of kilometers farther outside of kreuz the male responded i understand the physicians difficulties but the number of injured deutsche far outstrips our ability to provide all physicians with all required medicaments we shall do what we can it may not be much and it may not be timely but we shall make the effort i thank you mordechai answered there he told his conscience relax ive made the effort too every time he went into a village he asked about soldiers bringing jews back into germany from poland most of the time he got only blank stares by way of reply a few people glared at him nazi teachings had sunk deep those germans eyed a jew maybe the first theyd ever seen in the flesh surely the first theyd seen for years as if he were satan incarnate more germans though groveled before him he needed a little while to realize that was a residue of nazi teachings too he had authority therefore he was to be obeyed if he werent obeyed something dreadful would befall the villagers they seemed convinced of it at times he wished it were true none of the germans he questioned knew anything about his wife and sons and daughter none of them had seen a beffel he made a point of asking about pancer the alien pet might have stuck in peoples minds where a few jews wouldnt have registered the logic was good but he had no luck with it he pedaled into a little town called arnswalde as the sun was setting for the brief summer night of northern germany with the beating the reichsmark had taken since the nazis surrendered the polish zlotys in his wallet seemed good as gold better he got himself an excellent roast duck an enormous mound of red cabbage and all the fine lager he could drink for the price of a couple of apples back in poland the fellow who served him the feast was one of those who fawned on the occupiers take the leftovers with you sir he said theyll make you a fine breakfast see if they dont all right i will thanks mordechai said do you have enough for yourself here though ach jathe german answered with a chuckle that might have been jolly or might have been nervous when did you ever hear of a tavern keeper who starved to death he didnt look as if he were in any imminent danger of starving so anielewicz took the duck and some cabbage without a qualm he even let the tavern keeper give him an old beatup pot in which to carry them either the man was generous by nature or he was a fool or the zloty was worth even more than mordechai had thought twilight lay over arnswalde when he came out of the tavern hed just climbed onto his bicycle when a young blond woman walked up to him pointing to the pot she came straight to the point you have food in there yes he said eyeing her not too long before shed probably been very pretty a perfect aryan princess he thought now her hair was tangled and matted her face and legs she was wearing a short skirt so he could see quite a lot of them scrawny rather than pleasantly rounded his nose wrinkled she hadnt bathed in a long time again she didnt beat around the bush saying feed me and you can have me here he gave her the pot take it i dont want you not for that im looking for my wife and children she snatched the pot out of his hands as if afraid he would change his mind thank you she said youre one of the decent ones there are a few but only a few believe me she turned her head in the direction of the tavern and spat not him he takes it all out in trade believe me mordechai sighed somehow that didnt surprise him the german girl after all had no zlotys to pay for roast duck she said who are your people maybe i know them i doubt it his voice was dry theyre jews the wehrmacht would have brought them back from widawa in poland a woman my age a girl two boys and a beffel if you know what a beffel is one of the lizards pets she shook her head jews she said in tones of wonder i thought there werent any jews any more i thought they were whats the word i want extinct thats it in germany in all the greater german reich jews were extinct or close enough youre talking to one mordechai said not without a certain sour pride how funny the german girls laugh was hard if you had screwed me then idve got in trouble for sleeping with a jew maybe anielewicz said maybe not too the rules are liable to change now you know he wondered if they would if the lizards would try to enforce tolerance on the reich he wondered if it mattered one way or the other the people the peoples the germans would have had to learn to tolerate were dead now extinct as the girl had said who would have thought a jew could be decent she murmured more than half to herself shed learned what her teachers taught all right what would you say if i said who would have thought a german could be decent mordechai didnt know why he bothered maybe because he thought she might be reached maybe just because despite dirt and hungerinduced leanness she was a pretty girl and part of him the eternally optimistic male part wouldnt have minded sleeping with her at all she frowned she knew he was trying to tell her something important but she couldnt for the life of her figure out what but germans germans are decent she said as if stating a law of nature all at once anielewicz wanted to snatch back the pot full of duck and cabbage the only reason he didnt was that it would have confirmed her in all the worst things she thought about jews germans could always see when they were being maligned but rarely noticed when they were maligning anyone else the girl could have no idea what was going through his mind she said if youre looking for people the army kept falling back to the northwest during the fighting if they had people along with them thats where those people would have gone thanks anielewicz said she was trying to be decent anyhow i guess ill go in that direction then i hope you find them she said mordechai nodded maybe she could be reached maybe she had been reached a little she went on you can sleep in my bed tonight if you want to i mean do nothing but sleep he smiled i dont think id better if i tried i would want to do something besides sleeping she smiled too she took it for a compliment as hed hoped she would and he hadnt even been lying with a nod he got the bicycle rolling and started off toward the northwest to see what he might find kassquit had known this moment would come shed been aware of it ever since the shuttlecraft ferried jonathan yeager up to her starship sooner or later he would go back to the surface of tosev it had turned out to be later because the fighting that broke out with the deutsche made it unsafe for him to go home now though the time for his return was here kassquit had known it would come yes but shed never imagined how much it would hurt if the war had not come she said as he methodically packed his wrappings and other belongings into the satchel in which hed brought them if the war had not come i say you would have been gone much sooner that might have proved a good thing for i do not think i would have missed you so much after a briefer acquaintance me jonathan yeagers expression indicated amusement or friendship or pleasure maybe some of all three superior female i am nothing but a wild big ugly how many times did you say so yourself when you were getting to know me he spoke the language of the race much more fluently than he had when he first came up to the starship with improved fluency came an ironic slant on the world that reminded kassquit of the electronic messages his father had posted while pretending to be a male of the race could such things be inherited kassquit did not think so but she knew how ignorant she was of tosevite genetics in any case such matters were far from the most urgent things on her mind she clung to jonathan yeager saying do not make yourself less than you are you are the most exciting thing that ever happened to me she used an emphatic cough not that she really needed one he knew how she felt his arms went around her he stroked her she had never imagined how stimulating the touch of another could be of course no male of the race had ever touched her intending to arouse her but she relished jonathan yeagers touch even when he wasnt particularly intending to arouse her i cannot stay here he said now you know i cannot your place is here my place is down on the surface of tosev one day if you can safely arrange it you shall have to visit me ttomalss would not approve kassquit knew as much he would cite concern about disease he would even be sincere but he would also be afraid to let her go because he would fear the influence of wild big uglies on her and he would not admit that if she subjected him to torment jonathan yeager was subjecting her to torment by going tears slid from her eyes and rolled down her cheeks he turned away that wasnt disgust as it would have been from a male of the race kassquit had learned as much it was embarrassment jonathan yeager was emotionally vulnerable to tears to a degree she found amazing she said before you came here i did not realize what an important part of my personality had not fully developed because i did not realize that i did not know what i was missing now that i do the future looks much lonelier than it did before i am sorry superior female jonathan yeager answered i did not come up here intending to cause you pain i came up here intending to give you pleasure to make you happy i hope i did that too you know you did kassquit exclaimed but because you made me so happy you make me sad that you will not be making me happy any more that sounded convoluted even to her but jonathan yeager had no trouble sorting it out he said i will always remember you i will always be fond of you even if a time should come that we cannot be anything more than friends we shall always be friends why should a time come kassquit answered her own halfformed question tosevites contract to mate exclusively with only one partner yes that is a truth the wild big ugly agreed you think you will eventually enter into one of these contracts kassquit knew she sounded grim but couldnt help it jonathan yeager nodded his head then made the races affirmative gesture it is likely most males and females do and at that point you will not want to mate with me kassquit asked the wild tosevite coughed and looked away it is not that i would not want to he said but then i should not if an exclusive mating arrangement proves not to be exclusive complications soon follow tosevite sexuality is difficult enough without complications i think as far as kassquit could see any sexuality was difficult trying to meet a partners needs and trying to get ones own met by a partner who lacked full understanding of ones body because his was different were even more difficult than the certainties of stroking oneself they were also much less lonely though she hadnt understood that not till jonathan yeager came aboard the starship and now more loneliness loomed ahead of kassquit jonathan yeager was likely to enter one of those exclusive partnerships even if he didnt mating opportunities for him would be down on the surface of tosev kassquit wondered where she would ever find another one she wondered if she would ever find another one by what she knew of things it seemed unlikely how much of that did jonathan yeager understand he had to be intellectually aware of it shed explained till he was probably tired of listening but did it mean anything to him sometimes kassquit thought one thing sometimes the other she got no more time to wonder now a hiss from the door announced the presence of a visitor and only one visitor would be coming at this time the shuttlecraft pilot jonathan yeager exclaimed yes the shuttlecraft pilot kassquit said dully she put on a fingerclaw to open the door a male of the race stood in the corridor which of you big uglies is the one called jonathan yeager he asked making a botch of the name jonathan yeager barked tosevite laughter then said i am he turned to kassquit goodbye i hope i see you again i know i will always remember you goodbye she said and embraced him the shuttlecraft pilot turned both his eye turrets away from them disgusting he muttered in a low voice kassquit didnt think she was supposed to hear it but she did after a moment the shuttlecraft pilot spoke louder are you ready to leave jonathan yeager the launch window will not last indefinitely in case you are not aware of it i am aware of it jonathan yeager picked up the bag of belongings hed brought up from the surface of tosev i am ready then let us go the shuttlecraft pilot said and go they did kassquit closed the door behind them the panel smoothly slid shut the races engineers knew their business for many years being alone in her cubicle had seemed a refuge a place where she was not the strange one in a starship in effect in a world where no one else was like her now suddenly the compartment seemed a prison a trap when she looked over at the sleeping mat she imagined mating there with jonathan yeager all she had left now were imagination and memory the wild big ugly was gone he wouldnt come back soon if he ever came back at all what am i going to do kassquit whispered she knew what would have been expected of a female of the race to return to the way she had been as if nothing had happened when males and females of the race werent in season sexuality meant nothing to them they would assume it meant nothing to her either she wished it didnt part of her wished it didnt anyhow the rest longed for it what am i going to do she said again not for the first time she wished the deutsche had chosen some other moment to launch their attack on the race her reason for that wish though was undoubtedly unique had jonathan yeager not been forced to stay in the starship so long she wouldnt have developed this emotional attachment to him her life would have been simpler in a sense purer but now you understand more of what being a tosevite is truly like she thought now you know you are not merely a poor copy of a female of the race half of her was glad to have the knowledge the other half would as gladly have done without it she sighed she would never make a proper female of the race and she would never make a proper big ugly either what did that leave her wonder if i could become a proper rabotev or hallessi she laughed at her own foolishness why not no one else would have found it funny but laughter soon faded what would she do now that she was by herself again the question wouldnt go away no answer suggested itself either someone outside asked for attention the speaker by the door hissed again who is it kassquit asked i ttomalss may i come in yes superior sir kassquit opened the door for him as she had for the shuttlecraft pilot she bent into the posture of respect i greet you superior sir and i greet you kassquit the psychological researcher said i came in to inquire about your feelings now that the wild big ugly named jonathan yeager is returning to the surface of tosev yes i thought you might kassquit didnt realize how sarcastic she sounded till the words were out of her mouth ttomalss let out a wounded hiss your wellbeing is a matter of considerable concern to me you know not only for personal reasons but also because of what i am trying to learn about successfully integrating the races cultural patterns with the limits imposed by tosevite biology yes i understand that superior sir and i apologize kassquit said on the whole sincerely how do i feel she took a deep breath confused may well be the best word too much has happened to me emotionally and it has happened too fast for me to be at all certain what it means bereft is another word that comes to mind it was so important then for you to have this contact with one who was like you biologically even if so different culturally ttomalss asked superior sir at the moment i feel it was kassquit said how i will feel in several days time or in a years i cannot tell you at present but for now i feel i have been deprived of something i never knew i needed ttomalss sighed i feared that might be so when we began this experiment i especially feared it might be so when jonathan yeager stayed longer than anticipated solidifying your sexual and emotional bonds with him i do take some consolation in noting that tosevite emotions while generally stronger than those of the race are also generally more transient that was meant to console kassquit too and should have instead it somehow made her furious so you think my emotions will go away just because i am a big ugly do you she shouted i think you had better go away superior sir she turned the honorific into a curse and used an emphatic cough afterwards when she took a step toward the psychological researcher he left in a very great hurry indeed jonathan yeager descended from the shuttlecraft and let his feet thump down on the concrete runway at los angeles international airport the breeze smelled of the nearby ocean it played on him at random not with the gentle regularity of the starships ventilation system after so long random breezes felt strange unnatural he laughed random breezes were anything but his teeth started to chatter after so long aboard the lizards starship the breeze that swept across the airport also felt damn cold because of the sea breeze the airport was one of the coolest spots in the la basin jonathan knew that hed never known it to be so downright arctic though he moved away from the shuttlecraft as trucks came up to refill its hydrogen and oxygen tanks a car came up too a familiar car there was his father behind the wheel they waved to each other the car stopped jonathans dad hopped out and gave him a hug good to see you son he said good to have you home good to be back dad jonathan answered itd be even better if i werent freezing to death he tacked on an emphatic cough it seemed the most natural thing in the world except for the odd word of english here and there hed spoken nothing but the language of the race for a couple of months going back to his native tongue felt odd english seemed sloppy and imprecise after the lizards language his father laughed its a nice day if you ask me but youve been up in the bake oven for a while so you wouldnt think so he went around to the passenger side of the buick and opened the door hop in and well head for home your momll be just as glad to see you as i am shes riding herd on mickey and donald right now how are they doing jonathan asked he hadnt been able to inquire about them while he was on the starship as far as the race was concerned they didnt exist theyre growing like weeds his father answered theyre only two and a half now but theyre already something like threequarters as big as they will be and talking quite a bit too if lizard psychologists wore hats theyd have to eat em because they say that kind of thing just doesnt happen jonathan slid into the car it was warmer in there than outside what else has been going on while i was away he asked tossing his bag onto the back seat his father got behind the wheel and started up the hydrogenburning engine oh this and that he answered his tone was casual too casual jonathan shot him a sharp look the elder yeager went on we can talk more about that when we get home okay okay jonathan didnt know what else to say the car glided up to a security gate in the chainlink fence that kept normal traffic off the runways his dad showed a guard his id the guard nodded and handed his dad a clipboard his father signed the paper it held and gave it back the guard opened the gate the car left the restricted area and went out into a parking lot jonathan found another question with a certain amount of apprehension he asked hows karen doing not too bad his father answered judiciously she comes over once or twice a week she likes the hatchlings you know yeah jonathan answered does she still like me she hasnt said much his father paused as he left the lot and merged into traffic your mother and i havent asked her a whole lot of questions you know we figured it would be best if you took care of all that yourself okay jonathan said again and then after a moment thanks uh does she know what all i was doing up on the starship well his father made another one of those judicious pauses let me put it this way i dont think she thinks you were playing tiddlywinks up there oh jonathan thought about that he sighed has she said anything about it not much his dad sounded admiring on the farm and in the minor leagues and in the army keeping your mouth shut was praiseworthy a phrase his father sometimes used when his mother couldnt hear was he wouldnt say shit if he had a mouthful he meant it as approval but what was karen not saying jonathan sighed hed have to find out on the other hand karen might not want to say anything to him ever again but if she didnt would she keep coming around to see mickey and donald s e might dammit he thought she was wild to learn anything she could about lizards a lot of kids maybe even most her age and jonathans were the same way getting from the airport to jonathans house took about half an hour up in the starship he would have gone around a significant fraction of the earths circumference in that time his dad pulled into the driveway when they got out jonathan noticed something he hadnt before he pointed to his fathers hip are you wearing that pistol all the time now dad every waking minute his father answered dropping his right hand to the holstered and its always where i can grab it fast when im sleeping too are things really that bad jonathan knew about the attacks on his father and the house of course but none of them had come to anything so he had trouble taking them seriously no his fathers voice belied the word after a moment the elder yeager added theyre worse before jonathan could respond to that the front door opened and his mother hurried out to say hello between embraces and kisses he stopped worrying about the pistol for a while im so glad to see you his mom said over and over im so glad youre safe she didnt know how close that german had come to blowing the starship out of the sky he didnt intend to tell her either all he said was its great to be back he wondered if he meant it next to where hed been the stucco house looked like a primitive makeshift i bet youll be glad to sleep in your own bed again his mother said from what your father tells me a lizard sleeping mat isnt what youd call comfortable my own bed sounds great mom jonathan didnt have to work too hard to sound enthusiastic the sleeping mat hadnt been all that great but hed be sleeping alone in his room hed had company friendly company up on the starship his eyes slid to his father by the way his dad was holding his mouth a little too tightly he knew what jonathan was thinking his mother said i wonder if the hatchlings will remember you its been a goodsized part of their lives since theyve seen you lets go find out jonathan said he wanted to discover if mickey and donald still knew who he was too and if he was dealing with the hatchlings his mom wouldnt have the chance to harass him about how he shouldnt have gone up to the starship in the first place or about how he shouldnt have spent all his time up there fooling around with kassquit he missed the girl the lizards had done their best to raise as one of theirs he couldnt help it hed broken off a love affair it never would have worked not for life not the way his folks marriage had he could see that but it had been intense while he was up there with him and kassquit closed up in one little cubicle all the time how could it have been anything else when he got inside the house he dropped his bag in the middle of the living room his mom gave him a look his dad murmured its okay this once barbara his mother frowned but nodded a second later mickey and donald were in their room when jonathan opened the door he gaped at how much theyd grown sure as hell they were well on their way to being fullsized lizards but they looked funny he needed a moment to realize why they wore no body paint he wanted to speak to them in the language of the race that wouldnt work they didnt know it any more than kassquit knew any human tongue as shed been raised as a lizard they were being brought up as people hi guys jonathan said in english im jonathan remember me they came up to him slowly a little bit warily he was bigger than either of his parents their eye turrets swiveled as they looked him up and down did they have any idea who he was however much he wanted to he couldnt tell then mickey took another step toward him and stuck out his right hand hello jonathan he said his mouth couldnt make all the sounds of english any more than jonathans could shape all those the lizards language used he was probably talking baby talk too but jonathan understood him hello mickey he said gravely and shook the little scaly hand then he nodded to donald hello donald how are you hello donald was bigger and stronger than mickey but mickey talked better he or maybe she had always been the more clever hatchling before jonathan and the lizards could say anything more the telephone rang jonathan jumped a bit hed got used to hearing hisses but then old habit took over ill get it he said and hurried into the kitchen hello hello mr yeager said the voice on the other end of the line karens voice could i im not my dad jonathan broke in wondering what the devil would happen next im me im back hi oh karen said then there was silence quite a bit of silence at last karen went on hello jonathan did you have a good time up on the starship she knew what hed been doing up there all right he could hear it in her voice yeah i did jonathan could hardly deny it i didnt expect to stay up there so long though who would have thought the germans would really start that war im awful glad to be home his mother would have coughed at the colloquialism but shed stayed down at the other end of the house he gave it his best shot id like to see you again if you still want to see me well more silence karen finally continued i do want to go on seeing mickey and donald and thatll mean seeing you too wont it but thats not what you meant i know it isnt you were doing research yeah but that kind of research another pause maybe when i come over there for the hatchlings we can talk about the other stuff thats about the best i can do okay okay jonathan said at once it was as much as hed hoped for maybe even a little more do you still want to talk to my dad no never mind itll keep karen said goodbye she hung up so did jonathan maybe the sound of the handset going onto the cradle told his father it was safe to come into the kitchen he glanced at jonathan and chuckled youre still in one piece i see he remarked yeah jonathan knew he sounded relieved maybe we can work things out i hope so shes a nice girl his dad pulled a couple of bottles of lucky lager out of the icebox and handed one to jonathan come on out to the back yard that wasnt an invitation he usually made but jonathan followed whats up he asked when they were standing on the grass you asked what was new when you got into the car i didnt want to tell you there or in the house here i think its okay whod put a microphone on a lemon tree his father sounded as weary and cynical as jonathan had ever heard him whats up jonathan asked again swigging from the bottle of beer and his father told him as he listened his eyes got wider and wider thats what im sitting on his father finished do i need to remind you just how important it is not to repeat it no sir jonathan said at once still shocked maybe more shocked than hed ever been in his life besides whod believe me everything kassquit and jonathan yeager had done together on the starship everything from mating to cleaning their teeth was recorded ttomalss studied the video and audio records with great attention how better to learn about the interactions between a civilized tosevite and one of the wild big uglies from the surface of tosev what he found distressed him in a number of ways he had spent kassquits entire lifetime shaping her as he thought she should go when she was with him even now she behaved as a civilized being ought to behave but when she was with jonathan yeager when kassquit was with jonathan yeager she behaved much as a wild big ugly did she learned to imitate him far more quickly than she had learned to imitate ttomalss and shed startled ttomalss with how fast shed learned to imitate him while she was a hatchling also infuriating to the senior researcher was how quickly and accurately jonathan yeager could divine what was in kassquits mind blood will tell the male thought unhappily that was not the conclusion he would have wanted as a culmination of his longrunning experimental project he was so distressed about what he found he called felless to talk about it i greet you senior researcher she said when she saw his image in the video screen i am glad to speak with you and i greet you superior female ttomalss wondered if his hearing diaphragms were working as they should felless only rarely admitted to being glad to speak with anyone and most especially not with him a moment later she explained why she was after so much time spent dealing with the frangais it is good to talk shop with a member of my own species ah ttomalss said yes i can certainly understand that and why are you interested in speaking with me felless asked for your insights of course ttomalss answered which was even more or less true he told her of the disturbing data about kassquit why does this surprise you she asked sounding surprised herself a common law of psychological development states that hatchlings are more influenced by their peers than by the previous generation this holds for the race it holds for the rabotevs and it holds for the hallessi too why should it not also hold for the big uglies i had assumed it would be different as a result of the prolonged parental care they receive which makes them unlike the species the other species i should say of the empire ttomalss replied i might also note that the leading tosevite psychological theories stress the primacy of the relationship between parents and hatchlings felless mouth opened wide in hearty unabashed laughter why in the name of the emperor do you take tosevite psychological theories seriously she asked i have examined a few of them for one thing they strike me as preposterous for another they contradict one another in any number of ways demonstrating that they cannot all be true and that very likely none of them is true i do understand that ttomalss said stiffly i have been examining tosevite psychological theories a good deal longer than you have i might add and one point where they are in unanimity is on the vital importance of this bond but it makes no logical sense felless exclaimed even in tosevite terms it makes no logical sense there i might well disagree with you superior female ttomalss said some of the big uglies appear to have very persuasive arguments for the nurturing influence of parents upon hatchlings given their biological patterns i have no trouble finding these arguments plausible plausibility and truth hatch from different eggs felless said something ttomalss could hardly deny the female from the colonization fleet went on consider senior researcher where will even a big ugly end up spending most of his time with his parents and their other hatchlings or with his peers with his peers of course whom will he have to work harder to accommodate his parents and their other hatchlings or his peers again his peers of course his parents and close kin are biologically programmed to be accommodating to him if they were not they probably could not stand him at all big uglies being what they are if however he acts as if he has his head up his cloaca among his peers are they not likely to inform him of this in no uncertain terms no male or female of the race with whom i am familiar has ever composed songs of praise for the tosevites kindness or gentle manners the pungent irony there forced a laugh from ttomalss who also could hardly deny felless words held some truth no no songs of praise he agreed laughing still and after some thought he continued that may well be a cogent analysis superior female it may indeed as always experimental data would be desirable but the superstructure of your thought certainly appears logical for which i thank you felless replied she sounded more cordial toward him than she had for some time on the other fork of the tongue he hadnt praised her much lately either she was a female who took praise seriously in musing tones ttomalss said you might provoke some interesting responses if you were to publish that thesis in a tosevite psychological journal for which i do not thank you felless used an emphatic cough i have enough difficulties with big uglies as is to want to avoid more not to provoke them very well ttomalss shrugged i thought you might find it amusing to watch the allegedly learned tosevites banding together to destroy you with overheated rhetoric again no felless said the trouble with big uglies is they might not stop with overheated rhetoric if i upset them badly enough they might try to destroy me with explosives is it not a truth that the followers of the male called khomeini still raise a rebellion against us despite his capture and imprisonment yes that is a truth ttomalss admitted but they remain imprisoned in the grip of superstition contributors to psychological journals even tosevite psychological journals have a more rational outlook i do not care to test this experimentally felless said and here is my suggestion for you senior researcher since kassquit will be influenced by her peers you would do well to persuade her that her true peers are males and females of the race not the barbaric big uglies on the surface of tosev and now if you will excuse me she disappeared from the video screen even so ttomalss protested but i have always done my best to persuade her of that and it had worked it still worked to a point ttomalss couldnt imagine kassquit betraying the race in any truly important matter but the sexual bond shed so quickly established with jonathan yeager formed the basis of a social intimacy with him different from the sort shed established with the race wonder if i ought to arrange a new sexual partner for her he thought that might lessen her despondence over the departure of the wild big ugly but it might also present new and more serious problems solving one difficulty with tosevites all too often did produce another worse one the whole world of tosev was a large unexpected difficulty or rather a multitude of them he dictated a note to himself so he would not forget the possibility then returned to analyzing the recordings of kassquits conversations with jonathan yeager at one point shed asked him would you not like to spend all your time living and working among the race ttomalss suspected she meant would you not like to spend all your time staying with me if i could do it in the service of my notempire then maybe the wild tosevite male had answered but i would like to have some of my species around for the sake of company we are too different from the race to be very comfortable with its members all the time was that us propaganda countering the races propaganda that formed the only indoctrination kassquit had had till jonathan yeagers arrival or was it simply his view of where the truth lay if so was he right ttomalss feared he was no wild rabotev or hallessi would ever have said such a thing the other two species in the empire had been on the same road as the race they just hadnt gone so far along it when the conquest fleets got to their planets the big uglies had been going in another direction altogether when the race arrived that so many of them were still going in a different direction told how strong their impetus had been and yet the direction was not so different as it had been before the conquest fleet came it was the resultant of their former course and that which the race tried to impose on them which component of the vector would prove stronger in the end remained to be seen the telephone hissed for attention senior researcher ttomalss speaking ttomalss said i greet you i greet you superior sir kassquits image appeared in the screen hello kassquit ttomaiss did his best to disguise his concern how may i help you how was he supposed to analyze her behavior if she kept subjecting him to it i do not know i doubt anyone knows if you do not know how i can help you why did you call me ttomaiss asked in some irritation he didnt expect a rational answer hed had several similar conversations with kassquit since jonathan yeager departed for the surface of tosev i am sorry superior sir she said something hed heard a great many times before but i have no one else with whom i might speak that unfortunately was a truth and it was a truth of ttomaiss own creation he sighed he recognized the obligation under which it placed him very well he answered say what you will i do not know what to say kassquit wailed i feel as if my place in this society is not what i thought it was before i made the acquaintance of the wild big ugly that is not a truth ttomalss appended an emphatic cough your place here has not changed in the slightest then i have changed for i do not feel as if i fit that place any more kassquit said ah that for once was something ttomalss could get his teeth into many males from the conquest fleet have similar feelings in trying to reintegrate with the more numerous members of the colonization fleet their time on tosev and their dealings with tosevites have changed them so much they no longer find the old ways of our society congenial something like this seems to have happened to you yes now his tosevite ward used an emphatic cough of her own how is this syndrome cured by all appearances it wasnt always curable ttomalss had no intention of admitting that he said the chief anodyne is the passage of time he had also heard this was true of the aftermath of brief tosevite sexual relationships another point he carefully did not bring up kassquits shoulders slumped i shall try to be patient superior sir that is all you can do i fear ttomalss said he would have to try to be patient too after a brief tour of duty at greifswald gorppets small unit had returned to the deutsch center with the preposterous name of peenemunde the move made sense the place was plainly the largest and most important center in the area or rather it had been it had taken a worse pounding than any hed imagined let alone any hed seen he and the males he commanded were constantly checking their radiation badges to make sure they were not picking up dangerous levels of radioactivity despite the explosivemetal bombs that had fallen on the site the wreckage remained impressive gorppet spoke to one of his troopers this was on its way to becoming a spaceport as large as any back on home that would seem to be a truth superior sir the male called yarssev agreed when we first came to tosev the deutsche had not even begun launching rockets from this site gorppet said yarssev made the affirmative hand gesture that is also a truth superior sir how long did the race take to move from the first launch of a rocket to a spaceport gorppet asked i have no idea superior sir yarssev answered it has been a long time since they tried to make me learn history and i have long since forgotten most of what they taught me so have i gorppet said but this i will tell you we did not go from rocket to spaceport in a fraction of an individuals lifetime well of course not superior sir yarssev said if you ask me there is something unnatural about the way the big uglies change so fast i would have a hard time arguing with you there because i think that is also a truth gorppet said and i will tell you something else i think there is something unnatural about the way the deutsche are surrendering their armaments do you yarssev gestured the broad low damp plain was full of the implements of war landcruisers mechanized fighting vehicles artillery pieces rocket launchers machine guns stacked infantrymales weapons but gorppet made the negative gesture not enough remember what these big uglies threw at us in poland they had more than this and better than this too they do not love us they have no reason to love us i think they are trying to hold out to conceal as much as they can what will you do superior sir yarssev asked and gorppet had to hiss in dismay that was an unfortunate question he wished with every lobe of his liver that the trooper had not asked it he answered there is not much i can do you know i am only a smallunit group leader i have no tremendous authority certainly not enough to compel the deutsche to do anything all i have is a lot of combat experience and it tells me something is wrong here yarssev found another unfortunate question have you given your views to the company commander gorppet let out another dismayed hiss yes as a matter of fact i have his opinion of the situation differs from mine that was all he would say to yarssev the company commander was smugly convinced the deutsche were obeying all treaty requirements gorppet hissed once more back in the days when he was an ordinary trooper hed seen that officers all too often didnt want to listen to him it wasnt so much that they were smarter or more experienced than he was but they had rank and so they didnt have to listen hed been sure things were different among officers that they paid attention to their fellows if not to their inferiors to his company commander though he remained an inferior deutsch males moved among the weaponry they were turning over to the race deutsch civilians were properly submissive to the race they knew their notempire had taken a beating these were not civilians they wore the gray wrappings and steel helmets of soldiers they also wore an almost palpable air of resentment and regret that the fighting had ended look at them gorppet pointed with his tongue do they have the look of males who will contentedly return to civilian life does it matter if they are contented or not yarssev asked in return so long as they are demobilized and have no weapons with which they can wage war against us why should we care if they hate us because if they hate us they will seek to hide and to regain weapons gorppet answered patiently at the moment they are merely submitting because they have no choice i would sooner see them truly conquered yarssev didnt argue with him any more of course not gorppet thought am an officer he sees no point to arguing with officers because he will not convince them even if he is right gorppet laughed when hed been a trooper himself most officers had looked like addled eggs to him too now though he was sure he was right and yarssev wrong perspective counted for a great deal perspective gorppet made the affirmative hand gesture although no one had asked him anything even if his company commander wasnt interested in what he had to say he could think of some males who might be he found his topranking underofficer and told him not to let the deutsche steal any troopers while he was gone then went over to the tents marking brigade headquarters not far away the brigade commanders tent of course was bigger and more impressive than any of the others gorppet ignored it the tent he had in mind was the least obtrusive one in the whole compound when he walked in a male of a rank not much higher than his turned one eye turret away from a computer terminal and toward him yes what do you want the fellow asked his tone implying that it had better be something interesting and important superior sir does brigade intelligence believe the deutsche are in fact turning over all weapons required under the terms of their surrender gorppet asked now both the males eye turrets swung his way what makes you think they are not smallunit group leader he asked sharply what i see delivered here superior sir gorppet answered it does not seem to be materiel of the quality my unit faced when we fought the deutsche in poland if it is not where has that materiel gone where has it gone the officer from intelligence repeated the deutsche say the race destroyed most of it in combat there is without a doubt some truth to that would you not agree certainly superior sir gorppet said then brash as if hed just had a big taste of ginger which he hadnt he went on but would you not agree that it also gives the deutsche a very handy excuse for hiding whatever they think they can get away with give me your name the male from intelligence rapped out the order liver in turmoil gorppet obeyed how much trouble had he found for himself the other male spoke into the computer then to gorppet again and your pay number gorppet gave him that too he wondered if anything would be left of him by the time this male was through but then after a hiss of surprise the fellow asked you are the male who captured the agitator khomeini yes superior sir gorppet admitted with what he hoped was becoming modesty have you spoken of this matter to your company commander the male from intelligence asked i have he is of the opinion that the deutsche are honoring their obligations gorppet said i am of the opinion that he is a fool the male from intelligence said he could not see a sunrise if he were out in space he paused what made you come here smallunit group leader if your superior officer told you this matter that concerned you was unimportant what made me come here gorppet echoed superior sir i did not like fighting the deutsche once you may believe me when i say i never want to have to fight them again he added an emphatic cough no one wants to fight the deutsche again no one with sense the male said no one wants to fight any of the independent tosevite notempires again the reich caused us altogether too much damage another war would only be worse truth gorppet said with another emphatic cough and you do not know everything the deutsche are doing the other male said or rather everything they are not doing their delivery of missile components and their surrender of poison gas have been well behind schedule their excuses i might add challenge credulity more blame on battle damage gorppet asked why yes as a matter of fact you have encountered similar claims the other male returned gorppet made the affirmative gesture the other male eyed him appraisingly then said smallunit group leader gorppet you show wit and initiative have you ever wondered if you were wasted as an infantrymale what do you mean superior sir gorppet asked my name is hozzanet the male from intelligence said a sign he was interested in gorppet sure enough and he went on it might be possible to arrange a transfer to my service if you are interested then you would be able to devote your full energies to tracking down tosevite deceit that is tempting gorppet admitted but i am not sure i would want to pursue it he did not think males from intelligence would be encouraged to taste ginger the reverse he was sure they would be more closely monitored than ordinary infantrymales and if they ever connected him with the ginger deal in south africa that had involved males of the race shooting at one another but if they ever connected him with that deal he was in endless trouble no matter which service he belonged to still hozzanet said speaking off the record and hypothetically i ask no questions note sticking your tongue in the ginger vial every once in a while would not disqualify you if you are in the habit of doing things like feeding females ginger to get them to mate with you you would be well advised not to consider such a position i see gorppet said slowly no i am not in the habit of doing any such thing with females i have mated with females who have tasted ginger but such tasting has always been at their initiative i understand hozzanet said many males have done that here on tosev i among them whether we like it or not the herb is changing our sexual patterns here and will continue to do so but that at the moment is a patch of scales shed from ones back i ask again are you interested in serving in intelligence i may be superior sir gorppet said may i have a day to think on it hozzanet made the affirmative gesture gorppet assumed the posture of respect and left the tent he didnt know what hed expected on visiting brigade intelligence but he was sure he hadnt expected an invitation to join it he was on his way back to his small group when a beffel trotted across the path in front of him it turned one eye turret his way gave him a friendly beep and went on about its business and hello to you too little fellow gorppet said a beffel was a welcome reminder of home hed walked on for several paces before he paused to wonder what in the emperors name a beffel was doing in the midst of the wreckage of the greater german reich down but not out monique dutourd had seen those signs so many times in marseille she was sick of them she was by late summer sick of everything that had anything to do with her home town she was sick of wreckage she was sick of high prices everywhere she looked she was especially sick of the tent city in which she had to live and of being crammed into a tent with her brother and his lover french officials had promised things would be back to normal by now she hadnt believed the promises and her skepticism was proving justified the french hadnt done anything but what the germans told them to do for a solid generation now the germans were gone the french bureaucrats were on their own with no one to tell them what to do they didnt do much of anything monique picked her way through one of the market squares everybody who had peaches and apricots wanted an arm and a leg for them she scowled shipping hadnt come back the way the bureaucrats promised it would either she almost ran into a lizard pardonnezmoi monsieurthe creature said in hissing french monique wanted to laugh in its pointed scaly face but she didnt in a way dealing with someone who couldnt tell whether she was male or female was refreshing she wished a good many of her crude countrymen had the same problem she wished even more that dieter kuhn had had it for once thinking of the ss sturmbannfuhrer made her smile odds were hed died when the lizards detonated their explosivemetal bomb on marseille if he hadnt hed gone back to the reich once france regained her freedom any which way he was out of her life for good thinking of his being out of her life for good made her a lot more cheerful than she would have been otherwise that in turn made her more inclined to spend her money well actually her brothers money on the fruit she wanted than she would have been otherwise stringbag full of apricots in a wire basket behind her she rode a battered bicycle back to the tent city shed had a far better machine before the bomb fell now she was glad to have any bicycle at all the chain shed used to secure it while she shopped weighed more than it did commotion rocked the tent city when she reached it a squad of hardfaced men in uniform were trundling a man and woman into a waiting motorcar a crowd followed yelling and cursing and throwing things monique couldnt tell if they were pelting and reviling the captives or their captors whats going on she asked a man who was just standing there watching with luck that made him something close to neutral purification squad he answered and jerked a thumb toward the captives they say those two were in bed with the bochies oh are they finally down here monique said and the man nodded now that france was free again everyone whod collaborated with the nazis in any way was all at once fair game since the country had been under german rule for a quarter of a century the new government could make an example of almost anyone it chose no one said a word in protest though to complain was to appear unpatriotic unfrench and probably progerman and therefore a fitting target for the purification squads theyd been in the news for weeks fanning out through northern france to get rid of people described as traitors to the republic but everything reached marseille more slowly than almost anywhere else till now traitors here had been allowed to go on about their business like anybody else one of the men from the purification squad drew his pistol and fired it into the air that gave the angry crowd pause it let the men get the couple theyd captured into the automobile some of them got into it too others piled into another motorcar behind it both cars drove away in a hurry are they really collaborators monique asked ferdinand and marie not that i ever heard of and ive known them for years with a shrug the man went on it could be that i did not know everything there is to know about what they did but it could also be that someone who does not care for them for whatever reason or for no reason at all wrote out a denunciation he said no more had he said any more he might have got into trouble himself twentyfive years under the nazis had taught wariness theyd also taught frenchmen once lovers of freedom to write denunciations against their neighbors for any reason or as the man had said for none do the purification squads ever let people go once they seize them monique asked she got only another shrug by way of answer the man with whom shed been talking had evidently decided hed said everything he was going to say monique shrugged too she couldnt blame him for that under the germans talking to strangers had been a good way to land in trouble things didnt look to have changed too much with the coming of the new regime with the motorcars gone the crowd that had followed the purification squad out to them began to break up monique walked her bicycle to the tent she shared with pierre and lucie she brought the bicycle into the tent too the folk of marseille were notoriously lightfingered even at the best of times in times like these a bicycle left outside for the evening was an open invitation to theft hello monique said as she ducked her way through the tent flap and came inside she wondered if her brother would be dickering with keffesh or some other lizard and would have to explain her presence what infuriated her most was that he always sounded so apologetic but he and lucie were alone in the tent this evening lucie was cooking something that smelled good on a little aluminum stove pointing to it monique asked is that wehrmacht issue probably lucie answered she went on if it is what difference does it make i dont know for certain that it makes any difference monique said but i wouldnt let the purification squads know youve got a german stove patiently pierre dutourd said monique probably seveneighths of the people in this camp are cooking off wehrmachtissue stoves there are a lot more of them in france than there are frenchmade stoves these days without doubt you have reason monique said but will the purification squads care even the least little bit about reason oh pierre nodded his jowls wobbled a little monique was glad she was slimmer than her older brother i dont think we need to worry about the purification squads we have enough friends among the race to make it very likely indeed that theyll leave us alone i hope youre right monique was willing to admit he might well be the lizards didnt formally occupy france as the germans had but the french were still too weak still too unused to ruling themselves to have an easy time standing on their own two feet if they werent going to lean on the nazis the race was their other logical prop that savory odor monique smelled turned out to come from a rabbit stew full of wild mushrooms with a tolerable rose with some cheese and afterwards the fruit monique had bought it made a good supper monique and lucie washed the dishes in a bucket of water then lucie and pierre settled down as they usually did of evenings to hardfought games of backgammon backgammon held no interest for monique she wished she had her reference books she never had finished that article on the cult of isis in gallia narbonensis her books like the apartment from which her brother had spirited her were bound to be radioactive dust these days she sighed wondering if she would be able to find a teaching position in the new france she was sick of living with her brother and lucie but the reichsmarks the race had given her not so long ago were worth hardly anything at the moment new french francs were coming into circulation and german money was shrinking in value almost as fast as it had after the first world war it seemed most unfair her brother didnt think so there he exclaimed in triumph after winning the game if wed been playing for money id own you now lucie for all practical purposes he did own lucie monique was almost angry enough to say so which wouldnt have made the tent a more enjoyable place to live pierre and lucie started another game that didnt make the tent any more enjoyable either not as far as monique was concerned her brother and his lover unfortunately had other ideas and they outnumbered her the tyranny of democracy she thought she heard footsteps outside not the soft skittering strides of lizards but the solid steps of men and men wearing heavy shoes at that one of them said here this is the place right outside the tent flap he spoke clear parisian french that should have warned monique what would happen next but she was taken by surprise when the men with pistols burst into the tent the man whod spoken outside now spoke again which of you women is monique dutourd i am monique answered automatically what do you want with me you were a nazis whore the man snapped france needs to be cleansed of the likes of you come along or youll be sorry he gestured with his pistol now see here my friends pierre dutourd said making what sounded to monique like a dangerously unwarranted assumption you are making a mistake if you will but wait a moment shut up you fat tub of goo the leader of the purification squad said coldly i tell you this only once after that now the muzzle of the pistol pointed right at the bridge of pierres nose moniques brother sat silent as a stone good the other man said come along with me whore im not a whore monique insisted trying to fight down a nasty stab of fear how could she make these hardeyed purifiers understand how could she make them believe you are to be interrogated their leader said as if she hadnt spoken after the interrogation your punishment will be set he sounded as if there werent the slightest doubt she would be punished in his mind there probably wasnt the nazis interrogated me too at the palais de justice monique said i hope you will be gentler than they were terror at the thought of another such interrogation was what had made her let dieter kuhn do what he wanted with her but the leader of the purification squad said we shall do everything that is necessary the fire of righteousness burned in his eyes as it had burned in the eyes of the germans whod questioned and tormented her shed had no choice with the germans she had no choice now with such dignity as she could muster she said be it noted that i come with you under protest be it noted that no one cares the zealot answered get moving under the cover of his comrades automatics monique left the tent and stepped out into the warm night somewhere close by a cricket chirped you can afford to make noise monique thought bitterly no one is going to interrogate you the purification squad hustled her through the camp toward a waiting motorcar as she had on her previous tour of duty in marseille felless found that she liked the place better than nuremberg since shed hated nuremberg with a deep and abiding loathing that wasnt saying much but it was something the weather here though not up to the standards of home or even of the new town in the arabian peninsula where shed been a refugee was certainly an improvement on nurembergs at this season of the year it was more than tolerable she soon discovered she liked marseille better now than she had on her first visit too even though the races explosivemetal bomb had torn out its liver then the deutsche had been in charge of the city and their arrogance their automatic assumption that they were not just equal but superior to the race had gone a long way toward making her despise them and the place both the francais now the francais were easier to deal with technically this subregion called france still wasnt part of the territory the race ruled from cairo it functioned as an independent notempire but the francais big uglies listened to what the race had to say to them the alternative was listening to the deutsche and the francais had done that for too many years to want to do it any more felless did wish ambassador veffani wouldnt keep turning an eye turret her way but she couldnt do anything about that i greet you superior sir she said polite as always when he telephoned and i greet you senior researcher veffani said sounding more friendly than he usually did i seek your opinion in an area that falls within your field of professional expertise go ahead superior sir felless vastly preferred a technical question to his hectoring her over her ginger habit the reason he usually called i shall he said here is my question do you believe that by leaving tosevite notempires formally independent but in fact dependent on the race we can lay the foundations for fully incorporating them into the empire it was an interesting question felless had no doubt she was far from the only one contemplating it at last she said on the two other planets the race conquered half measures were unnecessary here they may well be expedient we have the chance to experiment both with france and with the reich ruling big uglies should not be a matter for experiment veffani laughed a wry laugh too often though it is you would know better than i superior sir felless didnt like flattering him especially not in view of all the grief hed caused her but his question might prove important for the race and so she was willing to put aside her own feelings and it wasnt as if she were speaking an untruth as a male from the conquest fleet veffani did have more experience with tosevites than she she went on perhaps such an approach could aid in the ultimate assimilation of tosev perhaps it could veffani said perhaps we should find out if you can draft a memorandum outlining your views i will forward it to cairo with a recommendation for serious consideration and with your name noted of course i thank you superior sir felless said it shall be done excellent veffani answered i have long known you are capable of excellent work i am glad to see you realizing your potential goodbye his image vanished from her monitor he hadnt even taken her to task for her ginger habit not directly maybe he thought shed given up tasting if so he was wrong she still used the tosevite herb whenever she got the chance but she did try to be careful about giving her pheromones a chance to subside before appearing in public she didnt want to lay yet another clutch of eggs shed mated once since coming to france but to her relief hadnt become gravid as a result shed got involved in the memorandum when the speaker by the door hissed for attention felless hissed too in annoyance who is it she asked i business administrator keffesh came the reply i would like to ask your assistance on a matter of some delicacy now what is that supposed to mean felless wondered irritably she realized shed have to find out she could open the door without fear of embarrassment she hadnt tasted in several days with a sigh she rose from her desk and poked a fingerclaw into the doors control panel as it slid open she said i greet you business administrator and i greet you superior female keffesh assumed the posture of respect that was polite but not altogether necessary not with his rank close to hers it likely meant he wanted something from her and so wanted her in a good mood well hed already come out and said he was after something what is this delicate matter felless asked keffesh approached it obliquely do i correctly understand that in a psychological experiment before this latest round of fighting with the deutsche you awarded a tosevite female named monique dutourd a large sum of money before i answer let me consult my records felless did then made the affirmative gesture yes that appears to be correct is it germane it is superior female keffesh answered you see monique dutourd has the same mother and father as pierre dutourd a big ugly with whom i have done a substantial amount of business you surely know how among the tosevites these connections count for a good deal indeed i do felless made the affirmative gesture again you do well to note their importance i might add but i do not quite see let me explain keffesh said monique dutourd is at the moment in a certain amount of difficulty with the francais authorities for she is accused of having had a sexual relationship with a deutsch officer while the deutsche occupied this subregion the francais as you must also know are seeking to destroy memories of the deutsch occupation and to punish those who aided and comforted the occupiers yes i know that too felless said the race encourages it as it makes the francais more likely to be dependent on us in principle i approve of this keffesh said in practice monique dutourds difficulties make it harder for pierre dutourd to carry on his business that is unfortunate perhaps but felless shrugged why should it matter to me or to the race as a whole before keffesh could answer she swung both eye turrets toward him wait what sort of business is this big ugly in now keffesh hesitated superior female i told you this was a matter of some delicacy i hope i may rely on your discretion he brought his hand up near his mouth and shot out his tongue as if he were tasting ginger had felless not been in the habit of tasting too she probably wouldnt have known what that meant as things were she said i believe i understand ahh relief filled keffeshs hiss i hoped you would i had been given to understand that you would by that he no doubt meant hed heard of felless gingerinduced disgrace he went on if you could arrange leniency from the francais superior female you would not find me ungrateful you would not find pierre dutourd ungrateful either what exactly was he offering all the ginger she could taste something like that surely her tailstump quivered in excitement she tried to make it hold still doing her best to sound casual she said i make no promises who can make promises where big uglies are involved but i will see what i can do i thank you superior female keffesh went into the posture of respect again i could ask for nothing more and now i shall not disturb you any further he left the chamber felless returned to the memorandum first things first she told herself but she couldnt concentrate her mind kept going back to ginger at last sighing she saved the memorandum and started trying to telephone the francais authorities that didnt prove easy the links between the races phone system and that of france were as yet tenuous at last though she reached an official with the formidable title of minister of purification do you speak the language of the race she asked wondering where she could find an interpreter if he didnt but joseph darnand did after a fashion i speak it but a little bit he replied his accent thick but comprehensible speak you slowly if it please you what is it that you want i want you to release a certain prisoner here in marseille a female named monique dutourd felless told him she waited for the big ugly to say it shall be done but darnand acted for all the world as if france were as much an independent notempire as the reich had been before the fighting one moment if it please you he said i shall consult my records very well felless could hardly say no to that it took a lot longer than the promised moment felless reminded herself that tosevite dataretrieval systems were much less efficient than those of the race she had to remind herself of that several times before joseph darnand finally returned to the line he said i regret senior researcher that this will be difficult without doubt this female carried on a sexual relationship with a deutsch officer and not just any deutsch officer but one from their secret police such betrayal must be punished unless there is some vitally important reason to forgive at first felless thought he was flatout refusing such disobedience from a big ugly supposed to be dependent on the race would have infuriated her but then she saw a possible loophole in his words is it not true that this particular female was forced into this sexual relationship against her will that counted for a great deal among tosevites she knew thanks to ginger and ingenious males it was also beginning to matter to the race on tosev she claims this joseph darnand said scornfully but what female in such circumstances would not claim it our interrogators do not believe it to be true not at all but i and the race speaking through me do believe it to be true in this case felless knew how far she was stretching things she personally knew next to nothing about the case and speaking through her was not the fleetlord or an ambassador but a ginger dealer with a small hiss of annoyance at herself and her role here she went on and this female has cooperated with us we would strongly appreciate her release she added an emphatic cough for good measure after another long silence on the other end of the line the francais minister of purification sighed oh very well he said i shall give the appropriate orders at least you unlike the deutsche are polite enough to disguise your commands as requests he knew he was supposed to be subservient then felless had wondered having got what she wanted she could afford to be gracious i thank you very much she said wondering how much ginger keffesh would pay her for her services it is nothing by joseph darnands tone it was much more than that he growled something in his own language as he broke the connection felless didnt mind annoying him in fact she rather enjoyed it comrade general secretary the ambassador from finland is here vyacheslav molotovs secretary said good very good molotov said by all means show him into the office i have looked forward to this interview for many years at last i am in the position to bring it off good morning comrade general secretary urho kekkonen said in fluent russian he took tea from the samovar in the corner of the room and helped himself to smoked salmon on rye bread good morning molotov replied enough socializing now has your government come to a decision about the contents of the note you received from the foreign commissariat of the soviet union kekkonen slowly and deliberately chewed and swallowed he was a big broadshouldered man who wore glasses thicker than molotovs we have comrade general secretary he answered finland rejects your demands in all particulars what molotov was astonished and had to work hard not to show it i would strongly suggest that you reconsider i would very strongly suggest that you reconsider nyet kekkonen spoke one of molotovs favorite words with almost offensive relish are you mad molotov demanded is your government mad for a generation you have sheltered under the wing of the reich but the reich these days is a dead bird where will you shelter now from the just wrath of the workers and peasants of the soviet union at your aggression you were unjust when you invaded us in urho kekkonen answered and you have not improved since we have no intention of reconsidering if you invade us again we shall fight again we defeated you then molotov said coldly we can do it again you know and as i said germany is in no position to aid you i understand that the finn said i understand it most thoroughly that is why my government has entered into consultations with the race we were not eager to do this you must understand but the soviet unions attitude left us no choice for molotov the words were like a blow in the belly he hadnt made a worse miscalculation since the pact with the nazis you would betray mankind he barked his voice harsh nyet kekkonen repeated our government would and will protect our country from aggression dealing with the lizards is the only choice available to us at the moment because it is our only choice we have taken it it was not the choice molotov had expected the finns to take theyd jealously protected their independence against the ussr theyd also protected it as much as they could against the germans theyd been the reichs allies but not unlike hungary and romania its subject allies molotov tried the best arrow left in his quiver how will your people take the news that you have surrendered to the race kekkonens smile was almost as cold as any molotov might have produced you misunderstand comrade general secretary in no way have we surrendered to the race what molotov was so furious and so alarmed he had trouble sounding dry did you not just tell me that you are allowing the race to occupy finland yes the race will have a military presence in my country urho kekkonen replied but the lizards will not occupy us any more than the germans occupied us we remain independent the males of the race in finland will remain in their bases unless we are attacked in which case they will cooperate with us in our defense an attack on finland will be construed as an attack on the race i see molotov said this agreement does not infringe on your sovereignty kekkonen shook his big head we do not care to have anyone infringe on our sovereignty the soviet union has had some small trouble grasping this over the years it includes you it includes the reich and it also includes the race i see molotov said again i had not believed the lizards would enter into such an agreement if i had i never would have issued that ultimatum perhaps no one had proposed such an arrangement to them before the finnish ambassador answered perhaps no one was in a position to propose such an agreement to them before but we did and they wasted no time in accepting of course they accepted molotov snapped youve let them put their foot in the door we judged it better to let them put their foot in the door than for you to force your foot in kekkonen said molotov didnt answer right away he was thinking furiously the lizards never would have agreed to such a bargain before the latest round of fighting with the germans but theyd left the reich independent but weak theyd recreated an independent but weak france and now they were fostering an independent finland that could never be anything but weak they have hit upon something new he thought now they are seeing what they can do with it the lizards still werent skilled diplomats not by earthly standards odds were they never would be but they played the game better than they had on first coming to earth then theyd hardly realized there was a game to be played they could learn he wished they hadnt started learning here kekkonen said i presume we may now consider your ultimatum withdrawn ought to tell him no molotov thought ought to tell him we would be happy to go to war with the finns and the lizards both that would jolt him out of his smug bourgeois complacency but it would also result in disaster for the soviet union molotov knew that only too well had he not known it the recent horrid example of the greater german reich would have rubbed his nose in it fighting the lizards was a tactic of last resort and so staring hatefully at kekkonen through his spectacles he bit off one word da he took a certain amount of satisfaction in noting how relieved the finn looked kekkonen hadnt been sure he wouldnt throw his country onto the funeral pyre for the sake of pride the nazis had after all but the nazis werent rational and never had been the ussr was and would remain in the struggle against imperialism indefinitely if he had to retreat today he would advance tomorrow after urho kekkonen had left molotov summoned andrei gromyko and marshal zhukov he told them what the finns had done zhukov cursed gromyko came to the point what did you tell him vyacheslav mikhailovich that we withdraw the ultimatum the words were sour as vomit in molotovs mouth but he brought them out even so turning to zhukov he asked or do you think i made a mistake no zhukov said at once when the devils grandmother starts fooling with your plans you have to change them molotov was relieved there unlike kekkonen he didnt show it had zhukov been bound and determined to fight the lizards he would have brushed molotov aside and done it but hed fought them a generation before and wasnt eager to repeat the experience any more than molotov was gromykos shaggy eyebrows twitched just when you think the race too stupid to survive you get a surprise like this what do you suggest to avoid similar unfortunate surprises andrei andreyevich molotov asked well if we were going to present romania with an ultimatum this would be a good time to put it back on the shelf gromyko answered of course we had no such plan in mind of course molotov said in a hollow voice all three men looked at one another romania still held bessarabia and northern bukovina lands the ussr had reclaimed under the vienna award only to lose them again in the aftermath of the hitlerite invasion now that the reich could no longer come to the aid of its friends the romanian government would have been next on the list after finland but if the romanians screamed for help and the lizards answered that would just give the race a longer frontier with the ussr dammit why wasnt this anticipated zhukov glared at molotov we could have ended up with our dicks in the sausage machine as he had with kekkonen molotov had to fight for calm if zhukov got angry enough the red army would start running the soviet union the very next day but molotov knew that acting as if he was afraid of that only made it more likely to happen after a deep breath he asked georgi konstantinovich did you expect the finns to seek support from the lizards me no way in hell zhukov answered but im a soldier i dont pretend to be a diplomat i leave that kind of worrying to people who do pretend to be diplomats now he glowered at andrei gromyko better at gromyko than at me molotov thought gromykos equanimity was almost as formidable as molotovs the foreign commissar said we tried something it didnt work the world will not end no one reasonable could have imagined that the finns would prefer the race to their fellow humans zhukov grunted they preferred the nazis to their fellow humans back in they dont much like us for some reason or other that would do as an understatement till a better one came along as zhukov said the finns had become hitlers cobelligerents as soon as they got the chance now they were teaching the lizards to play balanceofpower politics all that to avoid the influence of the peaceloving workers and peasants of the ussr molotov shook his head the finns he said are an inherently unreliable people thats true enough marshal zhukov agreed in musing tones he went on we could probably win a war in finland even against the race the lizards logistics are very bad we could probably win a war against the race in finland gromyko said acidly the nazis more or less won a war against the race in poland but they didnt win their war against the race could we of course not zhukov answered at once of course not i agree molotov said that is why when kekkonen presented me with a fait accompli i saw no choice but to withdraw our note we cannot anticipate everything georgi konstantinovich even the dialectic shows only trends not details we shall have other chances oh very well zhukov sounded like a sulky child it is not as if our own sovereignty were weakened gromyko said and the marshal nodded that satisfied him as least for the moment it salved molotov but it didnt satisfy him the soviet unions sovereignty survived its prestige as he knew too well had taken a beating something would have to be done about that not in europe barring desperate times he didnt foresee the lizards eye turrets were looking that way but the ussr had the longest land frontier of any nation any human nation on earth persia molotov murmured afghanistan china of course always china with considerable pleasure atvar studied the reports he had received from helsinki and moscow swinging one eye turret toward pshing he said here is something that for once appears to have worked very well indeed the soviet union has retreated from its threats against finland and our influence over that small notempire is increased his mouth fell open in a laugh since we had essentially no influence over finland up until this time any influence is an increase truth exalted fleetlord his adjutant agreed after a moment though he added a pity we could not arrange to incorporate the notempire into the territory we administer directly i too would have liked that atvar said but when our representative broached the idea to the leaders of the finnish notempire they flatly refused we have taken what we could get not everything we wanted but much better than nothing pshing sighed on this world exalted fleetlord we have never been able to get everything we wanted too often we have had to count ourselves lucky to get any of what we wanted that unfortunately is also truth the fleetlord said it is why i agreed to this half measure in fact something less than a half measure but it did succeed in making the sssr pull back what would you have done had the sssr chosen to invade this small notempire in spite of our presence there pshing asked let me put it this way i am glad we did not have to put it to the test atvar felt like adding an emphatic cough to that but didnt he didnt care to have his adjutant know just how glad he was one thing we have done since coming to tosev is show the big uglies that they can indeed that they must rely on our word because of that the russkis were convinced we would honor our commitment to finland and so did not presume to test it if you think this makes me unhappy you are mistaken what can we do to increase our influence over the finns now that we have established this presence pshing asked i do not yet know that atvar answered we have had little to do with that subgroup of big uglies up till now not least because of the truly horrendous climate of their notempire reports from both the russkis and the deutsche indicate that they are firstrate fighters our own experts indicate that the deutsche have not stinted in keeping them supplied with the most sophisticated tosevite weaponry not explosivemetal bombs i hope his adjutant exclaimed not to my knowledge for which i praise the spirits of emperors past atvar cast down his eye turrets for a moment no we are nearly certain the finns do not possess weapons of that type then in case of emergency we can use the threat of employing such weapons against them to bring them toward meeting our requirements pshing said but atvar made the negative hand gesture that has been considered it has also been rejected analysis indicates that the finnish tosevites would be more likely either to resist on their own or to call on the russkis for aid against us how could they do that pshing asked they are presently calling on us for aid against the sssr tosevite diplomatists have a phrase balance of power atvar said what this means is using your less annoying neighbor to protect you from your more annoying neighbor if the annoyance level changes the direction of the alliance can also change and change very quickly i see pshing said yes that is the sort of system big uglies would be likely to devise you speak sarcastically but your words hold an egg of truth the fleetlord said because the big uglies have always been divided up into so many competing factions they have naturally needed to develop means for improving their particular groups chance for shortterm success the only kind they consider and reducing the chances of their opponents and now that we are a part of this competitive system we have had to adopt or adapt these techniques ourselves without them we would be at a severe disadvantage back in the days of ancientest history i am certain that our ancestors were more virtuous pshing said you would probably be surprised atvar answered in preparing for this mission i had to study a good deal more ancientest history than is commonly taught in schools i can understand why so much of it is suppressed as a matter of fact back in the days before the empire unified home our ancestors were a cantankerous lot they would likely have been better equipped to deal with the big uglies than we are because they seem to have spent a good deal of their time cheating one another exalted fleetlord you shock me pshing said well i was shocked myself atvar admitted the trouble is our early ancestors actually did these things and were experienced in diplomacy and duplicity since the empire unified home a hundred thousand years ago we have forgotten such techniques we did not really need them when we conquered the rabotevs and hallessi though the fleetlords of those conquest fleets studied them too and of course our socalled experts aboard the colonization fleet studied our earlier conquests on the assumption that this one would be analogous that is why they have been of so little use to us false assumptions always lead to bad policy experts aboard the colonization fleet pshing echoed that reminds me exalted fleetlord you will surely recall senior researcher felless oh yes atvar made the affirmative gesture the alleged expert on big ugly psychology who decided to imitate or exceed the tosevites sexual excesses why should i recall her pshing what has she done now to draw my eye turrets in her direction another disgrace with ginger i am not precisely sure exalted fleetlord his adjutant answered no one appears to be precisely sure she used her influence in france to obtain the release of a certain prisoner charged with previous collaboration sexual collaboration with the deutsche as i understand things it does appear that the prisoner was in fact coerced into this sexual collaboration a tosevite crime that ginger has allowed us to discover as well indeed the fleetlord said what is the difficulty if felless was acting in the interest of justice as appears to be the case the difficulty exalted fleetlord is that the prisoner in question also has a family connection to one of the leading tosevite ginger smugglers in marseille pshing replied oh i see atvars voice was heavy with meaning did senior researcher felless come to the big uglys aid from a sense of justice or from a longing for a limitless supply of the tosevite herb then no one knows pshing answered ambassador veffani notes that her work has been excellent of late but he also suspects that she still tastes ginger judging motivation is not always simple one could hardly disagree with that atvar said veffani is a more than competent male i presume he is continuing to monitor developments in france he is exalted fleetlord pshing said if ambiguity diminishes he will notify us and will take the actions he deems justified very well it wasnt very well but atvar couldnt do anything about it save wait what other tidbits of news have we we have received another protest from the notempire of the united states concerning incursions of our domestic animals into their territory pshing said they have also begun complaining that the seeds of certain of our domestic plants have spread north of the border between our territory and theirs if those are the worst complaints the american big uglies have they should count themselves lucky atvar said with a scornful laugh they are fortunate they seem not to realize how fortunate they are i shall not personally respond to this protest you may tell them to compare their situation to that of the deutsche and having done so to decide if their sniveling use that word has merit it shall be done exalted fleetlord pshing replied in fact i shall take considerable pleasure in doing it the american tosevites complain because they have lost a fingerclaw not because they have lost fingers exactly so atvar said you may also tell them that and you need not soften it very much and you may tell them that they are welcome to slay any of our domestic animals they find on their side of the border and to enjoy the meat once they have slain them furthermore tell them they may pull up any plants of ours they find in their land we shall have no complaints if they do but if they labor under the delusion that we can stop animals from wandering and plants from propagating and spreading my opinion is and shall remain that they are deluded indeed may i tell them that pshing asked eagerly why not the fleetlord said the americans have selfrighteousness as a common failing as the deutsche have arrogance and the russkis have obfuscation tell ambassador lodge what he needs to hear not just what he might want to hear again exalted fleetlord it shall be done his adjutant said and again i will enjoy doing it atvar called up some maps of the northern part of the lesser continental mass he checked climatological data then hissed in derision it appears unlikely that our plants will be able to flourish in most of the regions where the american big uglies raise most of their food crops their harsh winters will kill plants used to decent weather they have not lost even a fingerclaw they may perhaps have chipped one the farmers in the subregion of the greater continental mass called india have a genuine grievance against us there our plants compete successfully against those they are used to growing as you say the americans have nothing large that exercises them so they have to get exercised over small things pshing answered the next tosevite we discover who cannot complain at any excuse or none will be the first truth atvar used an emphatic cough i truly believe that their constant carping was what finally pushed the deutsche into war against us they complained so often and over so many different things they finally persuaded themselves they were doing what was good and true and right and so they attacked and so they failed i doubt it will teach them much of a lesson but we shall do our best to make sure they lack the strength to try adventurism again unlike tosevites we have the patience for such a course pshing observed yes the fleetlords thought went down another road fortunate that the sssr unlike the reich chose to see reason had the russkis been determined to try to annex finland in spite of our prohibition life would have become more difficult we would have beaten them pshing said of course we would have beaten them atvar replied but beating them would have been the same as beating the deutsche difficult annoying and much more trouble than the cause of the quarrel was worth he paused and if that is not a summary of our experience on tosev i do not know what is sam yeager swung up onto his horse with a certain amount a certain large amount of trepidation i havent done any riding since hector was a pup he said hell i havent done any riding since i was a pup not since i got off the farm anyhow thats more than forty years ago now his companion a sunblasted sheriff named victor watkins let out a chuckle around a cigarette its like riding a bicycle lieutenant colonel once you figure out how to do it you dont forget we could go further and faster in a jeep but four legsll take us where four wheels couldnt even if the wheels are on a jeep and i know where the critters are and the stuff theyre grazing on okay yeager couldnt remember the last time hed heard anybody actually say critters maybe mutt daniels his manager when the lizards came to earth had mutt was from mississippi and had a drawl thick as the mud there sam went on seeing them is what i came here for so lets do it right sheriff watkins urged his horse forward with knees and reins awkwardly sam followed suit the horse didnt give him a horse laugh but it could have it wasnt like riding a bicycle he wished he were riding a bicycle at a slow walk they went south out of desert center california toward the chuckwalla mountains desert center lived up to its name it was a tiny town no more than a couple of hundred people on us a place for folks on the way to somewhere else to stop and buy gas and take a leak yeager couldnt imagine living there it was ever so much more isolated than the farm where hed grown up he wiped sweat from his face before putting back on the broadbrimmed stetson watkins had lent him i can see how desert center got its name he said weather only a lizard could love oh i dont know the sheriff said i like it pretty well myself ive lived in these parts more than thirty years of course i was born up in st paul so i got sick and tired of snow in a big fat hurry i can see that sam let out a small sigh hed never played in st paul it belonged to the american association only one jump down from the majors and one jump up from any league where he had played if he hadnt broken his ankle on that slide into second down in birmingham he sighed again plenty of ballplayers might have made the big leagues if they hadnt got hurt it was more than twenty years too late to worry about that now he yanked his mind back to the business at hand something a small lizard scurried away from his horses hooves and disappeared into the shade under a cactus when he looked up he saw a few buzzards wheeling optimistically through the sky other than that the land might have been dead nothing but sagebrush and cacti scattered not too thickly over the pale yellow dirt their sharpedged shadows seemed to etch themselves into the ground somehow the landscape didnt look quite the way sam had thought it would after a couple of minutes he put his finger on why none of those tall cactuses he said you know the kind i mean the ones that look like a man standing there with his hands up victor watkins nodded saguaros yeah you dont see that many of em this side of the colorado river over in arizona now theyre all over the damn place are they yeager said and the local nodded again sam went on hardly seems as if anything much could live here well its after ten in the morning sheriff watkins said pretty much all the critters are laying in burrows or under rocks or anywhere they can go to get out of the sun come here around sunup or sundown and youll see a lot more jackrabbits and kangaroo rats and snakes and skunks and i dont know what all and there are owls and bobcats and coyotes he pronounced it keyeoats at night and sometimes deer down from the mountains in spring after we get a little rain its real pretty country yeah yeager knew he sounded dubious thinking of this country as pretty any time struck him as being on the order of thinking frankenstein handsome because hed put on a new suit but watkins said hell yes flowers and butterflies all over the place you even get toads breeding in the mud puddles and croaking away like mad if you say so sam couldnt really argue he hadnt been in these parts just after some rain from what he could see they didnt get rain any too often something large enough to be startling buzzed past his nose what was that he asked as it zipped away june bug nope hummingbird watkins glanced over at yeager listen remember to drink plenty of water thats what weve got it along for heat like this it just pours out of you he swigged from one of his canteens sam dutifully drank the water had been cold back in desert center it wasnt cold any more he pointed to a small cloud of dust a couple of miles ahead whats that if everything takes it easy in the middle of the day lizard critters dont the sheriff said far as theyre concerned this is like a day in the park they like it fine bettern fine mad dogs and englishmen and these funnylookin things they rode on a little while longer heading toward the dust then watkins pointed too at a plant sam might not have noticed there these started growing about the same time the critters showed up now that his attention was drawn to it yeager saw it was different from the others past which his horse had taken him it wasnt quite the right shade of green it put him in mind of tarnished copper hed never seen any leaves that looked like these they might almost have been blades of grass growing along its branches it didnt have flowers but those red disks with black centers at the ends of some of the branches might have done the same job sam reined in can i get a closer look at it thats what were here for watkins said sam dismounted as clumsily as hed boarded his horse he walked over to the plant from the lizards world scuffing up dust at every step when he reached out to touch it he yelped and jerked his hand back in a hurry its like a nettle he said its got little sharp doohickeys a fine scientific term that in between the leaves found that out did you sheriff watkins voice was dry rubbing his hand yeager asked you ever see anything eating these plants nope the sheriff answered not unless you mean the lizards animals nothin that oughta live herell touch em havent seen any bees go to those red things either all right that had been sams next question he took a notebook from his pocket and scribbled in it if bees wouldnt visit these things how did they get pollinated could they get pollinated or whatever they used as an equivalent here on earth evidently or this one wouldnt be here watkins said you put on leather gloves and try and yank that thing out youll find out its got roots that go clear to china why am i not surprised yeager wrote another note back on home plants would have to suck up all the water they possibly could it made sense for them to have roots like that a lot of earthly plants did too sam suspected these would prove very efficient indeed sheriff watkins said come on these things are just the sideshow you really want to see the animals right i dont know sam said thoughtfully do i if these things start crowding out the stuff that used to grow here whatll the bugs and the kangaroo rats and the jackrabbits eat if they dont eat anything whatll the lizards and the bobcats eat the more you look at things like this the more complicated they get remounting his horse proved pretty complicated too but he managed not to fall off the other side supposing youre right watkins said as they rode on toward the animals from home isnt that reason enough to give the lizards hell for what theyre doing to us what theyre doing to earth i mean not just to the usa they dont want to listen yeager answered they say weve got cows and sheep and dogs and cats and wheat and corn and thats what these things are to them only natural theyve brought em along natural my ass watkins spat these critters are about the most unnaturallooking things ive seen in all my born days he pointed ahead look for yourself were close enough now sure enough sam could peer through the dust now and see what raised it the lizards domestic animals made him feel hed been yanked back through seventy million years and was staring at a herd of dinosaurs they werent as big as dinosaurs and they had the lizards turreted eyes but that was the general impression they were lowslung went on all fours and had instead of horns bony clubs on the ends of their tails one of them whacked another in the side the one that had been whacked bawled and trotted away those are zisuili sam said the lizards use them for meat and for their hides zisuili leather is top of the line as far as theyre concerned hot damn watkins said sourly what do we do about em look how they eat everything right down to the ground worsen goats for christs sake theres nothing but bare dirt left once theyve gone through somewhere and this land wont take a whole hell of a lot of that i see what youre saying yeager answered its probably why they kick up so much dust he clicked his tongue between his teeth you were right sheriff this is what i came to find out about sure enough ive already found out more than i want victor watkins said question is like i said what do we do about the goddamn things the two men had no trouble getting close to the zisuili though their horses didnt much care for the alien animals smell neither odors nor sight of earthly creatures and people bothered the beasts from home noting that yeager said we shoot em whenever we see em they arent shy of us are they no but when the shooting starts they run like hell watkins replied a guy with a machine gun would get a lot more done than a guy with a rifle desert centers a rugged kind of place but machine guns dont exactly grow on trees around here some machine guns can probably be arranged sam said but he wondered how many machine guns the usa would need from the pacific to the gulf of mexico and for how many miles north of the border and machine guns couldnt do anything about plants from home what could nothing he saw short of an army of people pulling them up by the roots the lizards were making themselves at home on earth sam had read plenty of sciencefiction stories about people reshaping other planets to suit themselves but never one about aliens reshaping earth for their convenience he didnt need to read a story about that by all the signs he was living it neither he nor watkins had much to say as they rode back to desert center they passed another couple of plants from home however the things propagated theyd sure as hell got here well do everything we can sam promised as he got down from his horse and with more than a little relief headed for his car youd better the sheriff said he walked off toward his office not looking back another car was parked by the buick it hadnt been there before a couple of men in business suits came out of the little cafe across the street and walked briskly toward sam lieutenant colonel yeager one of them called when sam nodded both men produced revolvers and pointed them at him youd better come along with us sir the first one said orders sorry pal but thats how it is walter stone stared out through the window of the lewis and clarks control room in considerable satisfaction amazing what you can do with aluminized plastic isnt it he said not so bad glen johnson agreed you put out a big enough mirror you pick up plenty of sunshine for power and for heat and for i dont know what all else stone looked sly are you sure you dont johnson looked sly too who me they both grinned a mirror that focused a lot of light down to one small point was a splendid tool it was also a weapon if that point of light ever suddenly swung across a lizard spy ship with a sigh stone said the only trouble is that would mean war back home which we cant afford i know johnson grimaced its not just that we cant afford it either wed damn well lose are you sure the senior pilot asked you bet your ass i am johnson said and tacked on an emphatic cough dont forget im the guy who flew all those orbital missions i know what the race has got out there hell i know half that hardware by its first name push comes to shove we get shoved okay okay half to glens relief half to his disappointment stone didnt want to argue with him he liked arguments he wouldnt have any trouble winning stone waved at the mirror again one of the reasons were out here is to complicate the lizards lives in all sorts of ways they havent even thought about yet having plenty of power and energy available is a long step in that direction did i say you were wrong johnson asked and then say whats this i hear about another ship heading this way before too long walter stone suddenly looked a lot less like a buddy and a lot more like a pissedoff colonel goddamn radio room here leaks like a goddamn sieve he growled they open their mouths any wider theyll fall right in yeah well probably answered johnson who hadnt heard the rumor from any of the radio operators but come on now that ive got some of the word give me the rest of it its not like im going to send the race a postcard or anything bad security stone said johnson gave him a look it must have been an effective look because the senior pilot turned red and muttered under his breath at last with very poor grace he went on yeah its true theyre building it out in orbit now next opposition or somewhere fairly close to then itll head out here and well see some new faces good johnson said im sick of seeing your old face that earned him a glare from stones old face grinning he probed some more how many people will they be sending out all i know is the complement is supposed to be larger than the crew of the lewis and clark stone answered johnson nodded glad of the news that was more than hed known stone went on two reasons first they wont have as long a trip so they can bring more people with the same resources and second theyll have improved the design of the new ship how johnson asked eagerly this was the stuff he wanted to hear all right but stone said how how the devil should i know matter of fact i dont know that for a fact he paused listened to himself and shook his head in annoyance before continuing im just assuming there will be were not lizards after all we dont think our designs are set in cement neither do they not exactly johnson said its just that weve been refining our designs for fifty years a hundred tops and theyve been doing it for fifty thousand after that long they dont find the need to make a whole lot of changes dont teach your grandma to suck eggs stone said irritably i know all that as well as you do and you know i know it too yeah but youre cute when youre angry johnson said which won him another glare from the senior pilot he grinned again and went on with more people well be able to spread out a lot farther the lizards wont be able to keep an eye on us so easy which is the point of the exercise stone said as if to an idiot no kidding johnson grinned once more refusing to let the other man get his goat then he let his imagination run away with him one of these days maybe well have a regular fleet of ships going back and forth between earth and the asteroid belt his eyes and voice went far away maybe one of these days we will be able to go home again but walter stone shook his head again this time in flat negation forget about it his tone brooked no contradiction if a ship comes out here itll stay out here for good we havent got enough to let us afford to send anything back especially not a big ship nice to dream about yeah but it wont happen johnson thought it over and discovered he had to nod might have done poor liz brock some good though he said no again stone wasnt taking any arguments for one thing you die with cancer of the liver back on earth too and for another the point is to make it so we dont need to go back to earth for anything were supposed to be figuring out how to do everything we need here without going back to earth thats the plan and were going to make it work its only part of the plan johnson said well of course stone sounded surprised he had to mention that a chime from the ships pa system announced the hour johnson said im off his shift was done stones still had two hours to go adding dont let anybody steal the chairs while im gone johnson glided out of the control room since the chairs like all the furniture were bolted down that didnt seem likely as a parting shot though it could have been worse johnson brachiated to the galley he ate strawberries beans potatoes plants from the evergrowing hydroponics section he also gulped vitamin pills not a whole lot of food that had come up from earth was left it was mostly reserved for celebrations he missed meat but less than hed thought he would when it disappeared from the menu some people were still complaining about that the dietitian fixed one of them with a fishy stare and said its healthy itll help you lose weight im already weightless the irate technician answered if i lose any more ill invent antigravity there you see said the dietitian who didnt realize her leg was being pulled that would be worthwhile wouldnt it that would be impossible is what it would be the technician snarled christ id eat a lab rat by now but we havent got any more of those left either he took his food and glided off in high dudgeon johnson was dutifully chewing his beans and wondering if the methane they made people generate was put to good use he supposed he could ask somebody from the lifesupport staff about that when lucy vegetti came floating into the galley when the geologist saw glen she smiled and waved so did he he would have flown over and given her a big hug but men didnt make moves like that not by the rules that had sprung up for the most part informally aboard the lewis and clark since men outnumbered women about two to one women had all the choice johnson didnt necessarily like it but he knew better than to fight city hall after lucy got her food she came over to him and gave him a hug that was in the rules how you doing he asked i didnt know youd gotten back from ceres they dont need me down there not for a while she answered she was short and stocky and very definitely looked italian on earth she might have been dumpy but nobody sagged in space she ate some potato and sighed god i miss butter but anyhow im here for a while the ice miners are a going concern on the asteroid so pretty soon theyll send me out prospecting somewhere else meanwhile i get to come back to the big city and look at the bright lights for a while her wave encompassed the lewis and clark god help you johnson said all that time away has softened your brain they both laughed but he knew what she meant there were more people aboard the lewis and clark than anywhere else for millions of miles seeing faces she hadnt set eyes on for a while not seeing the faces shed been cooped up with for weeks had to feel pretty good glen added you need somebody to drive your hot rod for you just let me know id do better to let brigadier general healey know she said and he nodded with regret altogether unfeigned his opinion of the spaceships commandant was not high the commandants opinion of him was if anything even lower had healey had his druthers he would have flung johnson out the air lock when he came aboard the lewis and clark unlike the others here johnson hadnt intended to come out to the asteroid belt in the first place hed just been curious about what was going on at the orbital space station hed found out all right lucys smile changed she lowered her voice and went on i like riding with you his ears heated so did certain other relevant parts he and lucy had been lovers before the watermining project took her away now that she was back he hadnt known whether she would be interested again all a guy on the lewis and clark could do was wait and hope and look cute he snorted when that crossed his mind hed never been real good at cute but lucy had made the first move so he could make the next one any time babe more fun than the exercise bike i sure as hell hope she laughed again now that you mention it yes not that its the highest praise in the world you know later in the privacy of his tiny cubicle she gave him praise of a more substantial nature weightlessness wasnt bad for such things except that the people involved had to hang on to each other to keep from coming apart no gravity assist there johnson found nothing at all wrong with holding lucy tightly when he peeled off his rubber afterwards though he had a thought foolish and serious at the same time what the devil will we do when we run out of these things he asked lucy gave him a practical answer anything but the real thing we cant afford to have any pregnancies till we build a spinning station to simulate gravity and we cant stand the drain on our medical supplies that a lot of abortions would cause i hear theyve already had one or two he said not much liking the idea but none of the animal research suggested that getting pregnant while weightless was a good idea for people ive heard the same thing lucy said nodding but nobodys named names which is probably just as well yeah johnson reached out and caressed her sure as hell in the absence of gravity nothing sagged pretty soon lucy was caressing him too he wasnt so young as he had been but he wasnt so old as he would be either he rose to the occasion and he and lucy spent the next little while trying not to get her pregnant again straha woke one morning to find the weather exasperatingly chilly it is going to be autumn again before long he said to his driver at breakfast as if the big ugly could do something about that i shall have to endure the worst of this planets weather in los angeles no such thing shiplord the driver replied shaking his head as an afterthought he used the races negative gesture too if you wanted to go to siberia now i thank you but no straha said with dignity this is quite bad enough i do not require worse and remember his driver went on after another forkful of scrambled eggs winter here only comes half as often as it does on home that is a truth straha admitted the inverse truths are that it lasts twice as long and is more than twice as bad even here his driver let out several yips of tosevite laughter we would call this weather perfect or close enough you really need to go to someplace like arabia to make you happy that is one place the race is welcome to although the race may be welcome to arabia i am not welcome in arabia straha said that will be true for as long as atvar lives and our medical care is quite good then go out to the desert here his driver said it will be cooler than it was in high summer but not so cool as it is here now that straha said that is almost tempting and have i heard that certain of our animals and plants have begun making homes for themselves in that area that is a truth shiplord the big ugly agreed it is not a truth we are very happy about but i do not know what we can do about it is not sam yeager investigating this truth you find so unfortunate straha enjoyed mentioning yeagers name every now and again for no better reason than to make his driver jumpy today it worked as well as it ever did how do you know that the driver demanded his voice sharp because he told me straha answered i did not and do not think that was any great secret azwaca and zisuili are not beasts easily confused for anything tosevite your newspapers and your television shows have been full of reported sightings and speculations some clever some anything but about what their effect on the landscape will be speculations about the beasts from your planet are one thing his driver answered speculations about sam yeager are something else again something a good deal more sensitive straha started to ask why then checked himself he knew why his driver had spelled it out for him before yeager was the sort of tosevite who kept sticking his snout where it didnt belong hidden in a safe place in the house were papers yeager had entrusted to him the results of that snoutsticking straha had fairly itched to learn what those papers contained ever since the big ugly gave them to him but yeager was his friend and had asked him not to look at them except in case of his death or sudden disappearance he would have obeyed such a request from a friend who was a member of the race and he had obeyed it for the tosevite too that didnt mean he wasnt curious his driver went on one of these days i fear that yeager will go too far for his superiors if indeed he has not gone too far already when that happens saying you are his friend will do you no good saying you are his friend may end up doing you a good deal of harm is it as bad as that if it was as bad as that maybe he would have to arrange to warn yeager again it is not as bad as that shiplord his driver answered now in tones of somber relish it is a great deal worse than that he has done quite a lot to upset those superior to him really straha said as if he couldnt imagine such a thing how did matters come to such a pass because he would not leave well enough alone the big ugly answered if you fail to listen to warnings for long enough no more warnings come things start happening to you instead unfortunate things very unfortunate things he spoke the proper words but he did not sound as if he thought such things were unfortunate to the contrary in fact what could he have learned that was so dreadful straha asked now seriously alarmed his drivers mobile tosevite face twisted into an expression straha recognized as annoyance i do not know the big ugly said adding i do not want to learn it is none of my affair now pride filled his voice i am not like yeager i obey my orders if my superiors were to order me to put my hand in the fire i would do it to show he meant what he said he took out a cigarette lighter and flicked the wheel to produce a flame put that thing away straha exclaimed i believe you you do not need to demonstrate he was speaking the truth too big uglies far more than the race reveled in such displays of fanaticism another click closed the lighter you see shiplord you are my superior and i obey you too the driver laughed again i thank you straha tried to hold irony out of his voice which of them was the superior varied from day to day sometimes from moment to moment strahas rank meant little here his utility to the american government counted for more and his driver these days was much more consistently useful than he was the big ugly dropped into english im going outside to fiddle with the car for a while i cant get the timing quite the way i like it these hydrogen engines are a lot harder to monkey with than the ones that use gasoline i hope you enjoy yourself gordon straha answered also in english some males and females of the race had the same fondness for tinkering with machinery straha had never understood it himself tinkering with the way males and females worked had always been more interesting to him he went to the computer and turned it on using the races network to send and receive electronic messages was risky he was only illicitly present on the network the more he did anything but passively read the more likely he was to draw the systems notice and to be expelled from it but this was the one safe way he had to communicate with sam yeager sometimes risks had to be calculated his telephone might be monitored and so might the big uglys the same went for the mail as i have warned you before he wrote am once more given to understand that the authorities from your notempire are seriously concerned with your putting your snout where they wish it would not go i trust you will do nothing so rash as to cause them to have to punish you he studied the message made the affirmative gesture and sent it when he walked out to the front room once more he saw his driver still bent over the engine of his motorcar sam yeager usually responded very promptly to his electronic messages here though a couple of days went by with no answer that puzzled straha but he could hardly ask anyone what it meant when a reply did come he knew at once that yeager had not written it his friend had some odd turns of phrase but handled the language of the race about as well as any male this message was formal and tentative and had a couple of errors in it that sam yeager wouldnt have made my father has not come to home for several days now it read we have a message that new duties call him away but we have not heared from him we are worried jonathan yeager straha stared at that he stared at it most unhappily wondering how much trouble sam yeager was in and whether his tosevite friend still remained alive to be in trouble his driver had known what he was talking about but if he had intended straha to deliver another message it came too late and yeager had delivered a message to straha if the big ugly disappeared the exshiplord was to read the papers with which hed been entrusted hed wanted to do that ever since he got them now that he could his eagerness felt oddly diminished some things he discovered were more desirable before they were attained than afterwards and now that he felt free to look at those papers he had to wait for the chance his driver stuck annoyingly close to home for the next several days as if he knew something was going on under his snout but couldnt put a fingerclaw on what eventually though the tosevite discovered errands he had to run when he drove off straha hurried to his bookshelves and pulled out a fat volume full of pictures of the fessekk pass region of home one of the most scenic spots on the whole planet the volume was a gift from a male of the colonization fleet whod visited straha hed glanced at it once and set it aside but its size made it perfect for concealing the papers yeager had given him his driver who cared nothing for the fessekk pass had walked by it hundreds of times without paying it the least attention so for that matter had straha he sighed as he opened the envelope the papers inside were liable to be the only memorial his tosevite friend would ever have he took them out and began to read they were of course in english straha understood the spoken language well enough he read it only haltingly its spelling drove him mad why did this set of big uglies need several different characters to symbolize the same sound and why did they let the same character represent several different sounds because they are eggaddled idiots straha thought resentfully but after a little while as he realized just what sam yeager had given him he stopped fretting about the vagaries of english spelling he stopped fretting about anything at all he read on spellbound to the last page that last page was a note from yeager if you are reading this i am dead or in deep trouble the tosevite wrote in strahas language if you can get this to the race i expect it will be plenty for them to let you back into their territory in spite of everything you have done i know you have often been unhappy here in the united states everyone deserves as much happiness as he can get grab with both hands the signature below was written twice once in english once in the characters of the race he is right straha whispered in slow astonishment with this i truly could restore my good name he had not the tiniest bit of doubt about it hed dreamt of returning to the eggshell of the race since very shortly after defecting to the united states he had known it would take a miracle as long as atvar remained fleetlord now here in his hands he held a miracle the next question was did he want to use it he had never imagined that question might arise with a miracle but here it was he could take this to the races consulate in los angeles and be assured of reconciliation forgiveness acceptance he could see the new towns he could live in one of them in the society of his own kind but what else would happen if he did after the little scaly devils prison camp liu han didnt mind living in a peasant village not in the least shed hated the idea after living in peking for a good many years nieh hoting laughed at her when she said that out loud he answered it proves everything is in the yardstick you use to measure it youre probably right she answered what yardstick do we use to measure the little scaly devils imperialism that got his attention and also his thought slowly he said in china they are worse than the japanese and worse than the roundeyed devils from europe what other yardstick is there none i suppose liu han admitted not much liking the thought and how do we measure our struggle against the little devils to her surprise nieh brightened he said there i have good news tell me liu han said eagerly we could use some good news truth he said in the little devils language liu han made a face at him almost as if they were still lovers laughing nieh hoting returned to chinese our fraternal socialist comrades in the soviet union have seen fit to increase their arms shipments to the peoples liberation army they have seen fit to increase them by quite a bit in fact liu han clapped her hands that is good news why when the russians have kept us half starved for so long well i dont know for certain i dont think anyone knows for certain what goes through molotovs beady little mind nieh said which made liu han laugh in turn the peoples liberation army officer went on i meant that seriously mao understood stalin he could think along with him but molotov he shook his head molotov is inscrutable ill tell you what i think though please liu han nodded remember not long ago the soviet union gave finland an ultimatum and the finns instead of knuckling under to the russians ran under the wing of the scaly devils like a duckling running to its mother finland as far as liu han was concerned was so far away it might as well have been on the world the little scaly devils came from she wasnt sure shed even heard of it till the soviet union pressured it even so she nodded again i understand this is the russians revenge if they cannot get what they want from finland she had to pronounce the unfamiliar name with care they will do what they can do to make the little devils sorry elsewhere and we happen to be the elsewhere exactly so nieh eyed her with respect the party was lucky when you joined us and got an education you see very clearly you would have wasted your life as an oppressed peasant woman but liu han laughed at him this time this has nothing to do with education if a strong peasant loses a quarrel with a stronger one what does he do not fight him again he would lose again and lose face doing it no he sows hatred against his enemy in the other people in the village so the other man will have trouble wherever he goes eeenieh said a highpitched sound of glee you are right you are so very right thats just what the russians are doing so comrade molotov thinks like a peasant does he im sure he would be offended to hear it what kind of weapons are we getting liu han was sure that would be answered at the next central committee meeting but she didnt want to wait she had one particular question will the russians send us anything that we can use to wreck the scaly devils landcruisers that last was a word chinese had adapted from the language of the race the japanese had had only a few of the fearsome vehicles while those of the scaly devils roamed everywhere deadly and all but unstoppable nieh hoting was smiling again yes for once the red army truly is opening its storehouse to us the russians are sending us plenty of their mines with the wooden casings the ones even the little devils have trouble detecting bury those on roadways and in fields and the landcruisers will be most unhappy good liu han said they deserve to be unhappy but mines are not enough what about rockets so we can take the fight to the little devils instead of waiting for them to come to us you know what the russians always say about those things nieh answered that has not changed while we were imprisoned liu han made another face a sour one this time they say they cannot send us anything like that because it would let the little scaly devils know where the weapons came from but i thought you said they truly opened their storehouse to us they did nieh was grinning again after the fighting in europe they somehow got hold of a lot of german antilandcruiser rockets i dont know how maybe these were rockets the germans gave them instead of surrendering them to the little devils or maybe they got them from one of the german puppet regimes however they got them they have them and they are sending them to us ahhh liu han bowed to nieh as if hed been responsible for getting the rockets rather than just for giving her the news about them are these weapons only promised or are they really on the way the first caravan has already crossed the mongolian desert he answered the weapons or some of them are in our hands liu han did not have sharp teeth like a tigers but her smile would have sent any tiger with a drop of sense scurrying back into the undergrowth shed been fighting the little scaly devils most of her adult life fighting them with a hatred not only ideological and nationalistic but personal if the peoples liberation army had the chance to strike them a heavy blow that delighted her on every one of those levels before she could say as much a womans cry of anger and a moment later a mans cry of pain burst from a peasant hut not far away she whirled in surprise so did nieh hoting a heartbeat later the man himself burst from the hut running for all he was worth he might have run faster had he not been yanking up his trousers with one hand ten million little devils liu han exclaimed who has hsia shoutao tried to outrage now no sooner had she spoken than her own daughter came out of that hut liu mei was carrying a chamber pot her expressionless face was even more frightening than it would have been had fury filled it she flung the pot with both hands as a man might fling a heavy stone the pot flew through the air and smashed against the back of hsias head he fell forward onto his face and lay motionless as if shot blood poured from his scalp so did urine and night soil the chamber pot had been full eyes blazing in her deadcalm countenance liu mei said he tried to take what i did not want to give him first i stamped on his foot then i kicked him then i did this and now im going to kill him wait nieh hoting got between hsia shoutao and liu mei who plainly meant exactly what shed said shed drawn a knife and was advancing on the officer and communist party dignitary shed felled hsia groaned and tried to roll over liu han had wondered if the flying chamber pot smashed in the back of his skull evidently not too bad she thought you know how he is with women she said to nieh you know hes always been that way with women he tried to outrage me too you know back in peking not long after the little devils came im not pretty enough for him any more so now what does he do he tries to molest my daughter if you ask me he deserves whatever liu mei gives him a crowd had gathered drawn by the commotion several women laughed and jeered to see hsia shoutao bleeding and filthy on the ground if that didnt mean liu mei was far from the only one hed tried to molest liu han would have been astonished but nieh still held up a hand ordering liu mei to stop you have punished him as he deserves the peoples liberation army general said he is a good officer he is a bold officer he is fierce against the little scaly devils liu mei did stop but she didnt put away the knife he is a man you are a man she said he is an officer you are an officer he is your friend he has been your aide no wonder you take his side the women most of them peasants but some lesser party functionaries yelled raucous agreement one of them threw a stone at hsia it thudded into his ribs he writhed and grunted he still wasnt more than half conscious no now nieh spoke sharply and set a hand on the pistol in his belt i say enough hsia may be subject to selfcriticism and revolutionary justice but he will not be mobbed the revolutionary struggle needs him his words probably wouldnt have stopped the angry women the pistol did liu han wondered if the struggle between men and women would end before the struggle against the little scaly devils she doubted it she wasnt sure even the coming of perfect communism would make men and women get along mother rage still filled liu meis voice will you let this this man protect his friend so no the struggle between the sexes surely had a long way to go with great reluctance liu han nodded i will i do not like it but i will let revolutionary justice see to him from here on out we will remember him smeared with blood and night soil we will all remember him like that he wont trouble you again im sure of it no but he will touch someone else liu mei said grimly i didnt knock out enough of his brains to keep him from doing that she was bound to be right liu han wouldnt have minded seeing hsia dead not personally not even a little bit but nieh said he will also trouble the scaly devils again and that is more important not to me liu mei said he didnt put his filthy hands inside your trousers she didnt advance on hsia any more though and she did put the knife away a couple of people drifted back toward their huts the worst was over hsia shoutao wouldnt get all of what was coming to him but liu mei had already given him a good piece of it hsia groaned again this time he managed to sit up something like reason was in his eyes his hand went to the back of his head when he found it was wet he jerked it away when he found what the moisture was he frantically rubbed his hand in the dirt beside him i should have cut it off you when i had the chance liu han told him if i had this wouldnt have happened to you im sorry hsia said vaguely as if he couldnt quite recall why he should be apologizing sorry you got hurt sorry you got caught liu han said sorry for what you did dont make me laugh dont make us all laugh we know better the women who were still watching hsia wallow in filth and blood clapped their hands and cried agreement liu han found a smile stretching wide across her face russian arms for the peoples liberation army hsia shoutao humiliated it was a very good day indeed reuven russie walked slowly and glumly to the office he shared with his father the sun shone hot and warm in jerusalem even in early autumn making the yellow limestone from which so much of the city was built gleam and sparkle like gold the beauty was wasted on him so was the sunshine his father had to keep slowing down so as not to get ahead about halfway there moishe russie remarked you could have gone to canada no i couldnt not really reuven had already wrestled with himself a great many times emigrating would have been too easy and if i had my children probably would have ended up not being jewish i didnt want that not after weve been through so much to hold on to what we are his father walked on a few paces before reaching out to set a hand on his shoulder for a moment thats a fine thing to say a fine thing to do he observed especially when you think about the woman you were giving up dont remind me was the first thing that went through reuvens mind hed miss janes lush warmth for he didnt know how long but it would be a while after a few silent steps of his own he said im going to be thirty before too long if id had to decide the same thing six or eight years ago who knows how i would have chosen maybe that has something to do with it moishe russie admitted on the other hand maybe it doesnt too plenty of men your age plenty of men my age gevalt plenty of men my fathers age if he were still alive would think with their crotch first and worry about everything else later that was probably true that was in fact undoubtedly true and as far as reuven was concerned anyone who didnt think with his crotch around jane archibald had something wrong with him after a bit he said too easy again his father understood him as his father generally did being a jew in canada you mean he said well maybe but once more maybe not it is possible to be a jew in a country where they dont persecute you for it up until just a little while ago remember the race didnt charge us anything for the privilege of worshiping in our own synagogues reuven nodded i know but people take it more seriously now dont they because they see its endangered some do his father said maybe even most do but some dont take anything seriously for a while when you were a little younger i was afraid you might be one of those but i think every young man makes his father worry about that he let out a wry chuckle then sighed and some a few go to this temple the lizards put up and give reverence to the spirits of emperors past jane went reuven said she had to if she wanted to stay in the medical college she always said it wasnt anything bad said the atmosphere put her in mind of a church as a matter of fact i never said it was bad for the race moishe russie replied or even for people necessarily but its not a place for jews a church isnt bad a mosque isnt bad but theyre not ours he paused you know the word apikoros ive heard it reuven answered its as much yiddish as hebrew isnt it means somebody who doesnt believe or doesnt practice doesnt it his father nodded usually a particular kind of person who doesnt believe or practice the kind who thinks its unscientific to believe in god if you know what i mean comes from the name of the greek philosopher epicurus now i happen to think epicurus was a good man not a bad one though i know plenty of rabbis whod have a stroke if they heard me say that but he wasnt ours either back in the days of the maccabees ideas like his led too many people away from being jews these shrines to the spirits of emperors past are another verse of the same song i suppose so reuven said after some thought a good education will make you an apikoros sometimes too wont it it can moishe russie agreed it doesnt have to if it did youd be in where in canada did jane end up somewhere called edmonton reuven answered shed sent a couple of enthusiastic letters hed written back but shed been a while replying now as shed said she would she was busy making a new life for herself in a land where the lizards didnt rule canada his father said in musing tones i wonder how shell like the winters there they arent like the ones in jerusalem or like the ones in australia either i dont think more like warsaw unless i miss my guess he shuddered the weather is one more thing i dont miss about poland almost all of reuvens childhood memories of the land where hed been born were of hunger and fear and cold he asked is there anything you do miss about poland his father started to shake his head but checked himself quietly he answered all the people the nazi mamzrim murdered reuven didnt know what to say to that in the end he didnt say anything directly but asked has anielewicz had any luck finding his family not the last i heard his father answered and that doesnt look good either the fightings been over for a while of course he did his best to sound optimistic a countrys a big place and i doubt even the verkakte germans could keep proper records while the lizards were pounding them to pieces alevai youre right and alevai theyll turn up reuven walked around the last corner before their office and now weve turned up too after the grim talk moishe russie put on a smile bad pennies have a way of doing that i wonder what we have waiting for us today something interesting maybe reuven suggested holding the door open for his father when i started practice i didnt think so much of it would be just routine thats not always bad his father said the interesting cases are usually the hard ones too the ones that dont always turn out so well did you become a doctor so you could sew up cut legs and give babies shots and tell people with strep throats to take penicillin reuven asked or did you want to see things youd never seen before maybe things nobody else had seen either i became a doctor for two reasons to make sick people better and to make a living moishe russie answered if i see a patient whos got something ive never seen before i always worry because that means i havent got any knowledge to fall back on i have to start guessing and its easier to guess wrong than it is to guess right youd better be careful father reuven said you sound like youre in danger of turning into a conservative some ways maybe moishe russie said thats what general practice does it makes you glad for routine consider yourself warned if you wanted to stay radical your whole life long you should have gone in for surgery surgeons always think they can do anything thats because they get to play god in the operating room and they have trouble remembering the difference between the one who made bodies and the ones who try to repair them they went into the office good morning dr russie yetta the receptionist said and then good morning dr russie she smiled and laughed at her own wit reuven smiled too but it wasnt easy hed heard the same joke every third morning since starting in practice with his father and he was bloody sick of it his father managed a smile that looked something like sincere good morning he said a good deal more heartily than reuven could have done what appointments have we got today yetta ran down the list a woman with a skin fungus theyd been fighting for weeks another woman bringing in her baby for a booster shot a man with a cough another man a diabetic with an abscess on his leg a woman with belly pain a man with belly pain maybe we can do both of those at once reuven suggested two for the price of one his father snorted yetta looked disapproving she liked her own jokes fine no matter how often she repeated them a doctor making jokes about medicine was almost as bad as a rabbi making jokes about religion all right well have enough to do today even without the people who just drop in his father said well have some of those too i expect we always do some people of course got sick unexpectedly others didnt believe in appointments any more than reuven believed in muhammad as a prophet he got to see the woman with the stubborn skin fungus a mrs kratz yetta stayed in the room to make sure nothing improper occurred as she did with all female patients custom aside she could have stayed out reuven had no lecherous interest in mrs kratz and would have had none even without the fungus on her leg she was plump and gray and older than his father here he said and handed her a little plastic tube this is a new cream its a sample about four days worth use it twice a day then call and let us know how its doing if it helps ill write you a prescription for more all right doctor she sighed i hope one of these creams works one of these days this one is supposed to be very strong reuven said solemnly the active ingredient one new to human medicine was closely related to the chemical the lizards used to fight what they called the purple itch he didnt tell that to mrs kratz he judged her more likely to take offense than to be delighted after she left the man with a cough came in reuvens nose wrinkled how much do you smoke mr sadorowicz he asked the aroma that clung to the fellows clothes gave him a head start on etiology here i dont know mr sadorowicz answered coughing whenever i feel like it whats that got to do with anything reuven delivered his standard lecture on the evils of tobacco mr sadorowicz plainly didnt believe a word of it he didnt want to get an xray when reuven recommended one either he didnt want to do anything reuven suggested reuven wondered why the devil hed bothered coming in mr sadorowicz departed still coughing yetta came in again heres mrs radofsky and her daughter miriam shes here for miriams tetanus booster all right reuven answered then he brightened mrs radofsky was a nicelooking brunette not far from his own age while miriam who was about two gave him a highwattage littlegirl smile hello reuven said to her mother im afraid im going to make her unhappy for a little while her arm may swell up and be tender for a couple of days and she may run a bit of a fever if its anything more than that bring her back and well see what we can do it wouldnt be much but he didnt say that he rubbed miriams arm with an alcoholsoaked cotton swab she giggled at the sensation of cold then shrieked when he injected her he sighed hed known she would he taped a square of gauze over the injection site mrs radofsky cuddled and comforted her daughter till she forgot about the horrific indignity shed just suffered thank you doctor she said i appreciate that even if miriam doesnt i want to do everything i can to keep her well shes all ive got to remember her father by oh reuven said he got caught in the rioting last year mrs radofsky the widow radofsky said as reuven expressed sympathies she asked yetta and what do i owe you reuven hoped the receptionist would give her a break on the bill but she didnt the polish tosevite named casimir pointed proudly to the shuttlecraft port he bowed to nesseref not the races posture of respect but shed learned an equivalent the big uglies often used you sees superior female he said speaking the language of the race badly but understandably field is ready for usings i see nesseref tried to sound happier than she felt then she made the affirmative gesture yes it is ready for use that is a truth and i am very glad to see it during the fighting the deutsche had done their best to render the shuttlecraft port unusable by what the males from the conquest fleet said their best was far better than it had been during the earlier round of combat theyd plastered it with bomblets from the air just as the race might have done some of the bomblets were concretebusters others were antipersonnel weapons and had had to be disposed of with great care they could blow the foot off a male or female of the race or for that matter off a big ugly despite the races best efforts a couple of them had done exactly that they lurked in the weeds off the edges of the ports concrete landing area nesseref wasnt altogether sure every single one of them had been disposed of even yet and with resources so scarce after the fighting ended casimirs construction crew had had to repair the landing field with hand tools rather than power machines nesseref had never imagined big uglies slapping hot asphalt into holes and smacking it down flat with shovels that gave the shuttlecraft port a curiously mottled appearance and contributed to her feelings of unease about it she had other reasons for feeling uneasy too pointing she said your patches are not as strong as the concrete they replace is that not also a truth it are superior female casimir admitted ungrammatically but the patchings will do well enough one of this days make all pretties again pretty not importants neat not importants working are importants there is some truth in what you say nesseref admitted are much truthings in what i say casimir answered nesseref didnt want to admit that the locals whole way of doing things struck her as slipshod they had a habit of fixing things just well enough to get by for a while that well and no better as a result they were always mending tinkering repairing where the race would have done things right the first time and saved itself a lot of trouble sometimes work that was fast and sloppy work that would last for a while but not too long was good enough nesseref suspected that was the case here better repairs would come but they could wait for now the shuttlecraft port was usable a male of the race waved to nesseref from the control building off to one side of the patched concrete she skittered off toward him without so much as turning an eye turret back toward casimir she wouldnt have been so rude to a member of the race but that thought didnt cross her mind till shed gone a long way from the big ugly she shrugged as she trotted along it wasnt as if he were a particular friend as mordechai anielewicz was well shuttlecraft pilot are we operational the male asked does everything meet with your approval senior port technician i believe we are nesseref answered the field is not all it could be but it can be used for operations good the technician said this was also my opinion but i am glad to have it confirmed by one who will actually fly a shuttlecraft it will be good to have shuttlecraft coming in and going out again too nesseref said this subregion has been cut off from direct contact with our space fleet for too long now air transport is all very well but we did not come to tosev in aircraft indeed the shuttlecraft technician said unlimited access to space and its resources and the mobility it gives us are our principal remaining advantages over the big uglies i suppose you are right but if you are that is a genuinely depressing thought nesseref said the technician only shrugged maybe that meant he didnt find it depressing more likely it meant he did but didnt know what the race could do about it nesseref shrugged she didnt know what the race could do about it either the first shuttlecraft that had come into western poland since the fighting stopped landed the next day it disgorged a new regional subadministrator to replace bunim who was now only radioactive dust the female whose name was orssev looked around in disapproval verging on horror what a miserable place to find oneself she said is it always so cold here listening to her carp nesseref began to understand why males from the conquest fleet complained about males and females from the colonization fleet nesseref was a female from the colonization fleet herself of course but even she could see that orssev was not inclined to give poland a fair chance and she knew things orssev didnt superior female she said this is the end of the period of relatively good weather in this area we shall have most of a year of truly bad truly freezing weather on the way a year of homes i mean tell me you are joking orssev said please tell me so what did i do to deserve such a fate nesseref didnt know the answer to that question either and wasnt much interested in finding out orssev was plainly a prominent female or she wouldnt have had the rank of regional subadministrator but she might well have got her post here because shed offended someone even more prominent polands weather was not of the sort to which administrators were drawn and nesseref could not tell a lie about that i am sorry but i spoke the truth she said winter in this subregion is unpleasant in the extreme i shall protest to fleetlord reffet the new regional subadministrator said i am being used with undeserved cruelty i wish you good fortune nesseref said as neutrally as she could she didnt want to come right out and call orssev an idiot addled in her eggshell offending the prominent was rarely a good idea but however prominent she was orssev wasnt very bright the males of the conquest fleet not those from the colonization fleet kept administrative appointments firmly in their fingerclaws that made sense they knew the big uglies better than the colonists did nesseref didnt think the fleetlord of the colonization fleet would be able to get orssevs assignment changed even if he were inclined to do so orssev went into the control building presumably to start pulling whatever wires she could to try to leave poland the shuttlecraft pilot whod brought her down also went into the control building which meant the shuttlecraft wasnt scheduled to fly out again right away nesseref hoped it also meant she would be assigned to take it wherever it did need to go next technicians swarmed over the shuttlecraft inspecting and adjusting lorries rolled out and topped up its hydrogen and oxygen tanks no one shouted nesseref s name and told her to be prepared at short notice she concluded she could go back to her apartment and get ready before she was summoned to duty once more getting ready consisted largely of making sure orbit had enough food and water to keep him happy while she was gone the tsiongi ran in his wheel hed run in it enough to give it a squeak nesseref thought that reprehensible it seemed more like the slipshod manufacturing big uglies might do than anything she would have expected from the race she sprayed the hub of the exercise wheel with a lubricant orbit didnt care for the odor and hopped out and lashed his tail till it diminished no sooner had nesseref put away the container of lubricant than the telephone hissed i greet you she said and i greet you shuttlecraft pilot a male from the shuttlecraft port replied your first assignment has come in i am prepared she answered the only possible response from a pilot where am i to go this continental mass the eastern subregion known as china the male said burn parameters and time are already in the shuttlecrafts computer anticipated launch time is he named the moment i shall be there nesseref said do i have a passenger or will i fly this mission by myself you have a passenger the male at the port answered she is a physician named selana her specialty is skin fungi tosevite bacteria and viruses do not trouble us but some of these organisms find us tasty this problem appears to be more severe in china than elsewhere very well said nesseref who thanked the spirits of emperors past that such fungi had never troubled her she snatched up the small bag she always took on shuttlecraft flights since she didnt use cloth wrappings her needs while on a journey were less than those a big ugly would have had in similar circumstances the jolt of acceleration the weightlessness that followed felt like old friends that had been away too long once weightlessness began she had a chance to make small talk with selana why are these skin fungi so common in china senior physician she asked i believe it is the astonishing amount of excrement in everyday use there the other female answered the local big uglies use it for manure and fuel and sometimes mixed with mud as a building material as well facilities for disinfecting bodily waste as you may imagine from that are for all practical purposes nonexistent i am sorry i asked nesseref said weightlessness did not nauseate members of the race as it sometimes did tosevites but disgust could do the job another thought occurred to her how do any tosevites raised in such an environment survive their burden of disease must be far worse than ours it is and a great many of them do not survive selana said this takes me back to the most primitive days of the race at the very dawn of ancientest history we once lived something like this though the greater abundance of water in china creates a more unsanitary situation than we ever knew over such a wide area nesseref did not want to believe that the race had ever lived in such close conjunction to filth such a thought would damage the sense of superiority she felt toward the big uglies she said spirits of emperors past be praised that we do not live in such appalling conditions any more truth selana said and added an emphatic cough but here on tosev we are forced to do so because the natives do so this creates difficulties of its own senior physician nesseref said the big uglies do nothing but create difficulties selana did not argue with her having got to greifswald johannes drucker rather wished he hadnt the town where he and his family had lived hadnt taken an explosivemetal bomb but it had been heavily fought over and nearby peenemunde and stralsund and rostock had taken any number of hits from explosivemetal weapons so the radioactivity level remained high few people still dwelt among the ruins the ones who did might have slipped back in time several hundred years instead of coal or gas they burned wood from the wrecked buildings all around them they had no running water they stank and so did the city the neighborhood where the druckers had lived was even more ruinous than the rest of the town no one seemed to live there these days gangs of scavengers prowled through the wreckage after whatever they could find nobody admitted to hearing of drucker or his family try the red cross shelters pal one heavily armed forager told him maybe youll have some luck there try the graveyards the foragers sidekick added plenty of new people staying there these days he laughed so did his comrade drucker wanted to kill them both he had a pistol too a comforting weight on his right hip but the ruffians looked very alert he gave a curt nod and walked off through the rubblestrewn streets checking the red cross shelters was actually a good idea drucker had done that every time he passed one on the long road up from nuremberg but even having done so he knew too well that he might have missed his family he couldnt go through the endless tents and huts one by one looking for kathe and heinrich and claudia and adolf he had to rely on the records in each camp headquarters and the records were in a most shocking state of disarray anyone who expected the usual german efficiency as he had was out of luck its the war he thought at last and for the first time since bismarck and kaiser wilhelm i unified germany the reich had run into a catastrophe too large for it to cope with surviving from day to day took precedence over keeping the files that would have made administering the state over the long haul so much easier drucker understood that without liking it it made his life too difficult for him to like it even a little checking the graveyards also wasnt the worst idea in the world he realized glumly or it wouldnt have been if so many bodies hadnt been bulldozed or just flung into mass graves without headstones of any sort and if so many others didnt still lie under rubble and if so many hadnt simply been vaporized someone rode past on a bicycle the way things were now a sign of prosperity the man knew how valuable that bicycle was too he had an assault rifle slung on his back and looked extremely ready to use it drucker called out to him excuse me but where is the red cross shelter closest to town north the man answered on the road to stralsund not quite halfway there not far from the damned lizards camp he started to pedal on but then grudged a few more words i hope you find whoever youre looking for thanks drucker said so do i he trudged up the road to his right the gray ugly baltic rolled up the flat muddy beach and then sullenly retreated again he smelled salt water and stale seaweed and dead fish the odors of home and when he got to the shelter in the late afternoon he smelled ordure and unwashed humanity the same stinks hed known in every camp and in every town on his way up from bavaria more lizard troopers prowled around this red cross shelter than hed seen at most of the others they looked jumpier and more alert than the males hed seen elsewhere too he came up to one of them and said i greet you in the language of the race and i greet you the lizard answered it wasnt much of a greeting the male looked ready to shoot first and ask questions later if at all what do you want his hissing voice was hard with suspicion i am looking for my mate and hatchlings from whom i am long separated drucker said the answer and the fluency with which he used the races language made the lizard relax a little he went on and i am also curious why you watch the refugees in this particular camp so closely why i will tell you why the male said because there are many deutsch soldiers here males against whom we fought in poland we do not trust them we have no great reason to trust them i see drucker said slowly he nodded hed been running into occupation troops up till now lizards whod come into the reich after the surrender and who hadnt done any fighting beforehand but the males here had been combat soldiers no wonder they didnt trust anything or anybody drucker risked one more question where is the administrative center for this camp that way where the flag flies the lizard answered pointing with the muzzle of his weapon you may proceed i thank you johannes drucker said the lizard didnt wish him any sort of luck finding his family some of that no doubt was because lizards didnt think in terms of families and the rest he was an enemy why should a male of the race waste any sympathy on him he was just coming up to the large tent above which the red cross flag flew when a man not far from his own age rode up on a bicycle the fellow carried an impressive collection of lethal hardware he swung down from the bicycle grunted and stretched and started to walk it into the tent a woman standing in the entranceway exclaimed you cant do that it is forbidden too bad the man answered in german flavored by polish and something else im not going to have it stolen if you dont like it thats rough hes right drucker said theres no place to chain it up out here and itll disappear without a trace if he just leaves it most irregular the woman sniffed she didnt seem to see that things were different in the reich nowadays but after another glance at the weaponry festooning the other fellow she stopped arguing thanks pal the stranger said to drucker appreciate it some people have trouble getting the idea that times have changed through their thick heads after a moment drucker placed the mans secondary accent hed heard it before thicker in poland and the soviet union before the lizards landed yiddish that was it youre a jew he blurted with an ironic bow the other man nodded and youre a german i love you too he said mordechai anielewicz at your service im trying to find my family after some of you nazi bastards hauled them out of poland all drucker said was im trying to find my family too they were in greifswald but they arent any more and not much of the town is left he paused staring at the other man mordechai anielewicz jesus i know you a million years ago actually back in the first round of fighting against the race i was colonel heinrich jagers panzer driver he gave his own name were you anielewiczs eyes narrowed gottenyu maybe you were and if you were maybe youre not quite a nazi bastard after all maybe my younger son is named for heinrich jager my older son is drucker said what happened to him after that russian pilot took him off to poland he didnt mention how he and his fellow tank crewmen had killed several ss men to make jagers escape possible he married her the jew answered hes dead now you know the explosivemetal bomb skorzeny tried to set off inside lodz we stopped that he and ludmila and i we all breathed in some nerve gas doing it too it hit him hardest he was never quite right afterwards and he died twelve thirteen years ago im sorry to hear it drucker said but thanks for telling me he was a good man one of the best officers i ever served under and i always wondered what happened to him once he got away he was one of the best mordechai anielewicz eyed drucker you drove a panzer then what have you been doing since i stayed in the wehrmachtdrucker replied ended up in the upper stage of an a the lizards captured me after i shot two missiles at one of their starships if they hadnt knocked both of them down i dont suppose they would have bothered taking me alive but they did eventually they set me down in nuremberg i had a devil of a time getting here but i managed now if i could manage to find my wife and kids anielewicz looked at him as if hed failed a test you served under heinrich jager and you stayed in the wehrmacht he had the sense to get away dont get high and mighty with me drucker snapped i know something about what the reich was doing to jews i didnt do any of that i had it done to me in fact you had it done to you anielewicz snarled you son of a bitch you he cursed in yiddish and polish what do you know about it he looked ready to grab one of his weapons and start shooting drucker had thought him a dangerous man a generation before and saw no reason to change his mind now he slid his legs into a position from which he could better open fire too but instead of grabbing for his pistol he answered anielewicz in a low urgent voice ill tell you what i know about it the ss grabbed my wife because they got wind she had a jewish grandmother thats what hed never thought he would tell that to anyone but who in the reich ever imagined talking with a jew and it worked mordechai anielewicz relaxed suddenly and completely all right then he said you do know something he cocked his head to one side from what youve said you got her back howd you manage that i know a thing or two about the ss how drucker chuckled mirthlessly i told you i was an a pilot i had connections my co was general dornberger hes fuhrer now wherever the devil he is i had enough pull to bring it off officially kathe got a clean pedigree if you have pull you should use it anielewicz agreed his face clouded again back in the s there were an awful lot of jews who didnt have any drucker didnt know how to reply to that all he could do was nod he hadnt thought much about jews or had much use for them before k athe got in trouble with the blackshirts at last he said the only thing i want to do now is find out if my family is alive and get them back if they are fair enough were in the same boat there no matter how we got dropped into it anielewicz pointed at drucker if you know the fuhrer why arent you using your pull now to have him help you look for your kin two main reasons i suppose drucker answered after a little thought i wanted to do it myself and im not sure theres anyone to find yes knowing theyre dead would be pretty final wouldnt it anielewiczs voice was grim still and all if youve got a card left to play dont you think its time to play it drucker considered then slowly nodded he raised an eyebrow and if i try to find out for myself maybe i should try to find out for you too that thought did cross my mind mordechai anielewicz allowed ive got pull with the lizards myself shall we trade drucker considered again but not for long he stuck out his hand anielewicz shook it sam yeager had never imagined that a jail could be so comfortable his place of confinement didnt look like a jail it looked like and was a farmhouse somewhere in nobody had told him exactly where he was but it had to be colorado or new mexico he could watch television though no station came in real well he could read denver and albuquerque papers he could do almost anything he wanted except go outside or write a letter or use a computer his guards were very polite but very firm why are you keeping me here he demanded of them one morning for about the five hundredth time orders replied the one who answered to fred yeager had heard that about five hundred times too you cant keep me forever he said though he had no evidence that that was true what will you do with me whatever we get told to do answered the one called john so far nobodys told us to do anything except keep you on ice he raised an eyebrow maybe you ought to count your blessings about that lieutenant colonel by which he no doubt meant they could have buried yeager in the yard behind the house without anyones being the wiser that was probably no that was certainly true but i havent done anything sam said knowing full well he was lying and you havent even tried to find out whether ive done anything which was the gods truth fred looked at john john looked at the one named charlie who hardly ever said anything he didnt say anything now either he only shrugged john who seemed to be the boss answered we havent had any orders to interrogate you either maybe they dont want us knowing whatever you know i dont ask questions i just do what im told but i dont know anything sam protested another great thumping lie fred chuckled maybe they dont want us catching ignorance then of the three there that day and of the other three who spelled them in weekly shifts he was the only one with even a vestigial sense of humor he pointed at sams empty cup you want some more coffee there sure yeager answered and the agent poured the cup full again after a couple of sips sam tried a question he hadnt asked before by whose orders are you keeping me here im an officer in the us army after all he didnt really expect to get an answer charlie just sat there looking sour fred shrugged as if to say he was pretending he hadnt heard the question but john said whose orders ill tell you why the hell not youre here on the orders of the president of the united states mister officer in the us army the president sam yelped what the dickens does president warren care about me i havent done anything he must think you did john said and if the president thinks you did something buddy you did it that unfortunately was likely to be correct and sam knew only too well what earl warren was liable to think hed done hed done it too even if these goons didnt know or want to know that he had to keep up a bold front though if he didnt he was ruined and so he said tell the president that i want to talk to him about it man to man tell him its important that i do not just for me for the country he remembered the papers hed given straha and the things hed told barbara and jonathan it was important all right crap charlie said from him an oration john said the same thing in a different way president warrens a busy man why should he want to talk to one not particularly important lieutenant colonel why should he want to make one not particularly important lieutenant colonel disappear sam returned thats not for us to worry about john answered we got told to put you on ice and keep you on ice and thats what were doing yeager didnt say anything he just sat there and smiled his most unpleasant smile charlie didnt get it yeager hadnt expected anything else john didnt get it either that disappointed yeager after a few seconds silence fred said uh john i think hes saying the big boss might want to see him for the same reason he had him put on ice whatever the hell that is bingo sam said happily john didnt sound or look happy like i care what hes saying he sent sam an unpleasant look of his own other thing hes been saying all along is that he doesnt know why he got nabbed if hes lying about that who knows what else hes been lying about what that translated to was who knows what were liable to have to try to squeeze out of him back in his baseball days sam had known a fair number of smalltime smalltown hoodlums men who thought of themselves as tough guys it had been a good many years but the breed didnt seem to have changed much even if these fellows got their money from a much more important boss at this point sam had two choices of his own he could say something like anything happens to me youll be sorry or he could just sit tight he decided to sit tight these guys struck him as the sort who would take a warning as a sign of weakness not as a sign of strength he wondered if straha had yet decided he was really missing and whether the exshiplord had looked at the papers hed given him sam had his doubts if straha had seen those papers wouldnt he have got them to the lizards in cairo just as fast as he could yeagers bet was that he would have and if he had the fur would have started flying by now sam was sure of that maybe his captors had been expecting him to speak up and warn them when he sat tight they didnt seem to know what to make of it were they unused to people who could bargain from a position of strength or were they just too dumb and too far down on the totem pole to realize he had some strength in this bargaining match fred was the one who looked to have a clue he gathered up the other two by eye and said i think we need to talk about this they couldnt go off into another room and leave sam unattended if they did he was liable to be out the door like a shot he didnt know where the next closest house was hed come here at night and had no idea how big a farm this was but he might well make life difficult for these guys of course they might shoot him if they caught up with him it would be too bad if they did too bad for him and very possibly too bad for the usa and the whole world he wondered if he could slide out of here while they talked among themselves no sooner had the idea crossed his mind than john said dont even think about it buddy yeager wondered how hed given himself away had his eyes slid longingly toward the door whatever the answer he sat where he was after a couple of minutes his guards broke apart tell you what were going to do fred said his voice so full of sweet reason sam instantly grew suspicious were going to do just like you say lieutenant colonel well pass your request along and well see what comes of it if it gets turned down its not our fault is that fair he beamed at yeager i dont think kidnapping me in the first place was exactly fair sam answered besides how do i know i can believe you you can say youll pass it along and then just forget about it how would i know youre telling the truth what do you want us to do john asked put it in writing thatd be nice yeager said dryly everybody laughed as if they were good buddies sitting around shooting the breeze somewhere nobody was going to put anything in writing if some people hadnt put this that and the other thing in writing sam wouldnt have been where he was now in a lot of different ways he wished he werent he decided to press just a little when you do pass the word along you might want to let people know its already liable to be later than they think crap charlie said again if you say so sam answered but i think its important for the president to know everything thats going on now you listen up lieutenant colonel john said you arent in a real good place to start telling people what to do nothings happened to your family yet you want to make real sure nothing does you know what i mean why you son of a sam surged to his feet he took half a step forward but only half a step all three of his watchdogs packed armys all three of them had the pistols out and pointed at his brisket in less time than he would have imagined possible the difference between these guys and the smalltown muscle hed known in his younger days suddenly became obvious the smalltown punks had been minor leaguers same as hed been in those days these fellows could have played in yankee stadium and made the allstar team every year too yeah they were bastards but they were awfully damn good at what they did very slowly yeager sat down again john nodded smart boy he said his disappeared again so did freds charlie held on to his he looked disappointed that sam hadnt given him the chance to use it john went on you really dont want to get your ass in an uproar lieutenant colonel honest to god you dont we said wed pass things along and we will sam studied him saying things is easy really doing them thats something different im telling you president warren needs to talk to me he doesnt know how much trouble he may end up in if he doesnt talk is cheap john said thats what i just told you yeager answered but how many laws are you guys breaking by holding me here like this not letting me see my lawyer not letting me know what the charges against me are or even if there are any charges against me national security charlie intoned as if reciting holy writ yeager might have guessed he would say that yeager had in fact guessed he would say that and he had a comeback ready if it turns out youre right and everything works out okay you guys are heroes but if things go wrong whos going to end up with egg on his face you guys will because whoevers over you sure as hell isnt going to sit still and take the blame thats not for you to worry about lieutenant colonel fred said thats for us to worry about and do we look worried no sam admitted but the point is maybe you ought to crap charlie said a man of strong opinions and limited vocabulary john and fred didnt contradict him and dammit they didnt look worried sam had to hope hed planted some seeds of doubt and that planting seeds of doubt mattered because of the time hed spent in space jonathan yeager was going to graduate from ucla a couple of quarters later than he would have otherwise that had been the biggest thing on his mind when he got back to gardena till his father disappeared he and his mother both knew or thought they knew why his father had disappeared if they went to the papers they might raise enough of a stink to get his dad released they hadnt done it not yet the stink they would raise might turn out to be a lot bigger and messier than that and so now that classes had started again jonathan drove up to westwood every day feeling as if he were in limbo he didnt know where his dad was or when or if he might return the police were supposed to be looking for sam yeager so was the army so was the fbi nobodyd had any luck jonathan feared nobody was likely to have any luck either he felt in limbo at ucla too because hed dropped a couple of quarters behind he wasnt in so many classes with his friends theyd gone on and he hadnt what hed learned from kassquit and from the race was and would be immensely valuable to him but it wasnt the sort of thing that fit into the university curriculum that was on his mind as he left his modern political science class modern of course meaning since the coming of the lizards and headed out to the grass between royce hall and powell library to eat the ham sandwich and orange and cookies hed brought from home brownbagging it was cheaper than buying lunch from any of the campus greasy spoons and his mom had started watching every penny since his dad hadnt come home from desert center after all shed said once you never know i might disappear next he was just sitting down when karen walked by before he quite knew what he was doing he waved hi he said you got a few minutes she paused obviously thinking it over theyd been an item theyd been more than an item theyd been drifting toward getting married till he went up to the starship to instruct kassquit about tosevite sexual customs since then since then things had been tense no two ways about it hed known they would be when he rode the shuttlecraft into space he hadnt known the war between the reich and the race would strand him up there for so long which only made things between karen and him that much tenser at last though frowning she nodded how are you she asked leaving the walkway to sit down beside him any word about your father she sounded genuinely worried there theyd known each other since high school and shed always got on well with his folks nothing jonathan answered with a grimace zero zip zilch i wish to god there were im sorry she said and brushed a lock of red hair back from her face freckles dusted her nose and cheeks and shoulders she sunburned if you looked at her sideways despite that she wore a fleshcolored halter top to show off the body paint that alleged she was a military communications specialist like a lot of people of their generation she was as passionately interested in the lizards as was jonathan after a moment she found another safe question to ask how are mickey and donald shed been there when they hatched from their eggs jonathan supposed that was a breach of security but he hadnt cared at the time and his father had let him get away with it theyre fine he answered growing like weeds and learning new words all the time he hesitated then plunged you know they always think its hot when you come over to see them do they karens voice wasnt hot it was colder than winter in los angeles ever got i like seeing them i like seeing your mom too you that hasnt worked out so well since you got back and you know it hasnt jonathans sack lunch lay by him forgotten go easy he said ive told you and told you what happened up there wasnt what i thought it was going to be when i left i know she said it lasted longer so you had more fun than you figured you would when you left but you went up there intending to have fun thats the long and short of things isnt it jonathan he admitted what he could scarcely deny thats some of it yeah but its not all it was almost like what fooling around with a real lizard would be we both learned a lot from it ill bet you did karen said i didnt mean it like that darn it jonathan said now shes thinking about coming down here to see what life among the big uglies is like and all she ever wanted to do before was stay on the starship and pretend she was a lizard and what would she do if she did come down here karen demanded whatever it was would she do it with you jonathans ears heated that had nothing to do with the weather even though the day like a lot of allegedly earlyautumn days in los angeles was well up into the eighties i dont know he muttered its research is what it is is that what you call it karen said how would you like it if i were doing research like that she laced the word with scorn and jonathan knew he wouldnt like it for hell he took a deep breath theres one way that wouldnt happen even if kassquit did come down to earth he said sure there is if she landed in moscow karen said thats not what i meant jonathan said not even close she knows about marriage i dont think she really understands it but she knows what it means thats why he blushed again thats why my dad wasnt up there being experimental if you know what i mean and so karen said and so jonathan plunged and so if i were engaged to you it wouldnt be the same as married but it would be on the way to the same thing and shed see that it meant she and i couldnt do uh anything any more he brought the words out in a quick almost desperate rush karens eyes widened widened more in fact than jonathan had ever seen them do ever so slowly she said are you asking me to marry you yeah jonathan nodded feeling very much as if hed just gone off the high board without bothering to see if there was any water in the pool i guess that kind of is what im doing will you i dont know i dont know what to tell you karen shook her head not in rejection but in bemusement if youd asked me before you went up to the starship the last time idve said yes in a minute now now it sounds more like youre asking me to marry you to give you an excuse not to fool around with kassquit than for any other reason and i dont think i like that very much that isnt why jonathan protested though it had sounded like why to him too he did his best to make it sound like something else it was the only way i could think of to tell you im sorry about what happened up there and that there isnt anybody but you i want to spend my life with his mother wouldnt have approved of his ending a sentence with a preposition right this minute he didnt care whether his mother would have approved or not and this time hed said the right thing or something close to it karens expression softened thats very sweet jonathan she said ive thought for a long time that we might one day like i say i used to like the idea but things changed when you went up there im going to have to sort that out we werent engaged or anything jonathan thought about adding that hed used some of the things karen had taught him with kassquit but not being of a suicidal bent he didnt no not really karen said but we were as close as makes no difference i thought so anyway that had teeth sharp ones jonathan considered explaining again how hed done everything hed done with kassquit purely in the spirit of scientific inquiry again he thought better of it what he did say was just as inflammatory though he didnt realize it at the time come to think of it maybe youd better not marry me it might not be safe for you what do you mean not safe karen asked i know youre crazy but i never thought you were especially dangerous thanks i think he wished hed kept his mouth shut he hadnt told her about this when he found out about it after he got back from the starship he hadnt told anybody the son of an officer he knew secrets could leak if you started running your mouth but he was afraid his father had disappeared because of what he knew didnt that mean he jonathan had an obligation to make sure the secret couldnt be wiped out and karen could be counted on after all she knew about the hatchlings didnt she the more you looked at things the more complicated they got his father had insisted on that for as long as he could remember here as other places his old man looked to have a point you still havent told me what you meant karen reminded him well jonathan did his best to temporize ive got some idea of why my dad disappeared and it has to do with something he knew and something he told me something he knew karen echoed while people worrying about nothing but classes and lunch walked back and forth only a few feet away something he knew that he wasnt supposed to you mean sounds like something out of a spy story i know it does im sorry jonathan answered youre liable to be in trouble just because you know me im sorry he realized he was repeating himself he also wondered how the devil the conversation had got so far away from his proposal so fast karen said you know something that was just an ordinary question she waited for him to shake his head before going on youre going to have to tell me now if you want me to marry you i mean you cant have that kind of great big secret from somebody youre married to hey thats not fair you dont even know what youre asking for jonathan protested you dont know how much trouble you might get into either remember the guy who tried to firebomb our house as far as we could find out nothing ever happened to him karen only folded her arms across her chest across that ridiculously unconcealing halter top and waited she said one word talk and jonathan saw that having come this far he couldnt do anything but talk he leaned close to her so none of the happy unconcerned students going by would hear anything out of the ordinary telling what he knew didnt take long when he was done he said there are you satisfied my god karen said quietly oh my god she looked around the bright sunsplashed ucla campus as if shed never seen it before what do we do now thats what ive been trying to work out jonathan replied i still dont have any answers i like and speaking of answers you still owe me one for the question i asked you a little while ago what oh that karens voice remained far away ill worry about that later jonathan this is more important jonathan wondered if he ought to be insulted he wondered if he ought to get angry he discovered he couldnt do either the trouble was he agreed with her mordechai anielewicz had imagined any number of things in his search for his family having a german along though a german who was interested in helping him had never once crossed his mind but johannes drucker had a missing family too anielewicz had always had trouble imagining germans as human beings how could they be human and have done what theyd done but if a man desperately searching for his wife and sons and daughter wasnt a human being what was he what was funny in a horrid macabre sort of way was that what drucker had thought about jews pretty much mirrored what he himself had thought about nazis i never worried my head about the enemies of the reich he told mordechai one evening if my leaders said they were enemies i went out and dealt with them that was my job i never cared about rights or wrongs till kathe got in trouble nothing like the personal touch anielewiczs voice was dry you think youre joking the german spaceman said no dammit im not joking now mordechai couldnt help letting some of his anger show if every other german had a jewish grandmother or grandfather none of that murderous nonsense would have happened drucker sighed and looked around the little tavern in which they were drinking beer and eating a rather nasty stew there wasnt much to see only the fireplace gave light and heat hard to say youre wrong he admitted and then laughed without much humor hard to imagine im sitting here talking with a jew i cant remember the last time i did that oh what about your wife anielewicz asked acidly he watched the german flush but maybe that wasnt altogether fair again he had the feeling that one of them was looking out of a mirror at the other drucker said i didnt mean it like that dammit i meant with somebody who really believes what difference does that make mordechai said the taint is in the blood not in the belief right otherwise they wouldnt have cared about your wife they wouldnt have cared about converts they wouldnt have ahhh he made a disgusted noise why do i waste my time he took another pull at the pilsner in his stein it was thin and sour a telling measure of the reichs troubles across the table from him johannes drucker bit his lip you dont make this easy do you should i mordechai returned how easy was it for us when you held poland how easy was it for us when you invaded poland again this spring explosivemetal bombs poison gas panzers what did we do to deserve that you sided with the lizards instead of mankind drucker answered there was just enough truth in that to sting but it wasnt the whole truth nor anything close to it oh of course we did anielewicz said thats why i came looking for your colonel jager because i sided with the lizards all the time drucker sighed again all right things werent simple things are never simple just getting here or trying to taught me that jews anielewicz thought were born knowing that he didnt say as much to the german what point to it what he did say was weve both been through the mill if we start fighting with each other now it wont do us any good and it wont make it any easier for us to find our families if theyre there drucker said what are the odds he poured down his remaining beer in a couple of long dispirited gulps ive pulled the wires i know how to pull looking for my family mordechai said i didnt have any luck but ill pull them again for yours and ill help you get in touch with your fuhrer am i really saying this he wondered so you can pull your wires for your family and for yours drucker said yes and for mine anielewicz wondered whether the reich would have bothered keeping records of jews kidnapped in the fighting in poland with anyone but the germans he would have had his doubts as a matter of fact he still did have his doubts big ones but the possibility remained hed seen german efficiency and german bureaucracy in action in the warsaw ghetto if any battered beaten retreating army would have kept track of the prisoners with whom it was falling back the wehrmacht was that force the next morning after a breakfast about as unpleasant as supper had been anielewicz led drucker to the little garrison the race used to watch the refugee camp there he ran into lizard bureaucracy which turned out to be every bit as inflexible as the german variety no said the male to whom he addressed his request i have not the authority to take any such action i am sorry in the best tradition of bureaucrats regardless of species he sounded not in the least sorry trying to conceal his exasperation mordechai demanded well who does have the authority and where do i find him no one here the lizard replied again like any good bureaucrat he seemed to take pleasure in thwarting those who came before him johannes drucker proved fluent in the language of the race you did not fully answer the jewish fighting leaders question where can we find someone with that authority he didnt use anielewiczs religion as a slur but as a goad reminding the lizard he wasnt helping an ally it got through too with a resentful hiss the male said the closest officers with the authority to treat with the upper echelons of the reich are based near the place called greifswald he made a hash of the pronunciation but it wasnt a name easy to mistake for any other anielewicz turned to drucker back where we started from ive got a seat on the rear of my bicycle must be close to twenty kilometers drucker answered we can split the pedaling i wont argue mordechai said drucker wasnt far from his own age and very likely had stronger legs odds were hed never breathed in nerve gas anyhow they returned to greifswald in the early afternoon after going back through some of the flattest dullest terrain mordechai had ever seen bomb craters gave it most of the relief it had none of them was from an explosivemetal bomb but he still wondered how much radioactivity he was picking up hed wondered that ever since he came into germany for that matter hed wondered back in poland he tried to make himself stop wondering he couldnt do anything about it drucker was pedaling as they rode into the lizard encampment over his shoulder he said do you suppose these males will give us the runaround too i hope not was all anielewicz could say if the lizards chose to be difficult he couldnt do much about that either but they didnt one of the males in their communications section turned out to have fought alongside some of the jewish fighters mordechai had commanded your males helped save my unit several times he said folding into the posture of respect anything you require you have but to ask i thank you mordechai answered a little taken aback at such wholehearted cooperation he introduced drucker and explained why the german spaceman needed to be connected to the leader of what was left of the reich it shall be done the lizard said i do not fully understand this business of intimate kinship but i know of its importance to you tosevites come with me i shall arrange this call drucker stared at anielewicz in something close to amazement this is too easy he said in german something will go wrong youd better be careful mordechai answered in the same language you keep saying things like that and people will start thinking youre a jew yourself drucker laughed though anielewicz again hadnt been joking but nothing went wrong inside of a couple of minutes the lizard was talking with a male of the race in flensburg a not too radioactive town near the danish border from which general dornberger was administering the broken reich a couple of minutes after that dornbergers image appeared on the screen he was older than anielewicz had expected he would be old and bald and by all appearances tired unto death ah drucker he said im glad to see youre alive not many who went up into orbit came down again sir i was lucky if you want to call it that the spaceman answered if id killed my starship instead of failing im sure the lizards would have killed me too we need every man we have to rebuild walter dornberger said a sentiment that struck anielewicz as almost too sensible to come from the mouth of a german fuhrer dornberger went on whos that with you hans anielewicz spoke for himself im mordechai anielewicz of lodz he waited to see what reaction that brought all dornberger said was ive heard of you hitler would have pitched a fit at the idea of talking to a jew himmler no doubt would have been quietly furious dornberger just asked and what can i do for the two of you were looking for our families anielewicz answered druckers is missing from greifswald and mine was kidnapped from widawa by retreating german troops hed said it so many times it hurt less than it had before if anyone can order german records examined to help us find them youre the man he startled himself hed almost added sir dornbergers hand disappeared from the screen for a moment it came back with a cigar which he puffed how is it that the two of you have become friends friends mordechai shrugged that may go too far he said to which drucker nodded the jewish fighting leader went on but we both knew and we both liked a panzer officer named heinrich jager you knew and liked walter dornbergers expressions sharpened jager the deserter the traitor sir now anielewicz did say it he saved germany from getting in what you got in he also saved my life but youd probably think that was a detail that may be true dornberger replied it doesnt make him any less a deserter or a traitor sir he was a deserter drucker said but a traitor never et tu brute the german fuhrer murmured his eyes swung back to mordechai and if i dont help you i suppose youll tell your friends the lizards on me sir its my family anielewicz said tightly ill do whatever i can whatever i have to to get them back wouldnt you dornberger sighed without a doubt very well gentlemen i will do what i can i do not know how much that will be things being as they are our records are in no small degree of chaos goodbye his image vanished hope mordechai said as he and drucker left the tent from which theyd spoken with the new fuhrer i know drucker said is it a blessing or a curse he cocked his head to one side whats that funny noise had he not asked anielewicz might not even have noticed the small whistling beep but when it came again the hair prickled upright on his arms and at the nape of his neck my god he whispered thats a beffel whats a beffel drucker asked but mordechai didnt answer hed already started running straha watched his driver take the motorcar off on an errand that would keep him gone for at least an hour the exshiplord let out a hiss of satisfaction he hurried into the bathroom and scrubbed off his body paint with rubbing alcohol as he would have if he were going to redo it but instead of repainting himself as the male of thirdhighest rank in the conquest fleet he chose the much simpler pattern of a shuttlecraft pilot the job he did wasnt of the best but it would serve neither the big uglies nor his own kind would be likely to recognize him at once as he carried an attache case of tosevite manufacture out the front door of his house he turned one eye turret back toward the building wondering if he would ever see it again and if it would still be standing in a few days time a considerable portion of him wished sam yeager had never entrusted him with this burden but yeager had and the big ugly must have known the likely consequences of that sighing straha walked down to the end of the block turned right and walked two more blocks in front of a small grocery store stood a public telephone in a booth of glass and aluminum straha had never used a tosevite public phone before he read the instructions and followed them letting out a relieved hiss when he was rewarded with a dial tone after inserting a small coin he dialed the number he had memorized back at the house the phone rang three times before someone answered it yellow cab company yes thank you straha spoke the best english he could i am at the corner of rayen and zelzah i wish to go to downtown to the consulate of the race he waited wondering if hed have to repeat himself but the female on the other end of the line just echoed him rayen and zelzah yes sir about five minutes i thank you straha said and hung up the cab took about twice as long as the predicted time to arrive but not so long as to make straha much more nervous than he was already the driver hopped out and opened a rear door for him hello the big ugly said dont pick up a male of the race every day when he spoke again it was in strahas language i greet you superior sir and i greet you straha replied in the same tongue how much of my language do you speak not much not well the tosevite answered i like to try where you want to go his accent was indeed thick but comprehensible to the consulate straha repeated it in english to make sure he was not misunderstood and gave the address in english too it shall be done the driver said and proceeded to do it straha had judged his regular driver a tosevite who cared less for safety on the road than he might have next to this fellow the other male big ugly was a paragon of virtue how the cab driver arrived at the consulate with his motorcar uncrumpled baffled straha but it was a fact here we are he remarked cheerfully as he pulled up in front of the building i thank you straha answered though he was feeling anything but thankful he gave the big ugly a twentydollar bill which more than covered journey and gratuity american money had never felt quite real to him and odds were good one way or another he would never have to worry about it again a couple of tosevites who reminded straha of his regular driver stood outside the consulate they glanced at him as he walked inside but did nothing more he wondered if his driver had yet discovered him missing if so the big uglies would be looking for a shiplord not a shuttlecraft pilot straha hurried up to the reception desk yes asked the male at that desk swinging an eye turret his way how may i help you shuttlecraft pilot he too saw only what he expected to see what straha wanted him to see now with more than a little pleasure straha threw off the disguise i am not a shuttlecraft pilot he replied i am a shiplord shiplord straha commanding well formerly commanding the th emperor yower of the conquest fleet his mouth flew open in a laugh at the receptionists startled jerk the other male recovered fairly quickly saying if you are who you claim to be you must know there is and has been an order for your arrest i am who i say i am straha answered i am certain you have a database with the scale patterns of my snout and palm included in it you are welcome to take those patterns from me and compare them to verify such an incendiary claim we would of course have to do that the receptionist said but if you are who you say you are why would you subject yourself to arrest and certain punishment after so many years of treason straha hefted the attache case what i have in here will protect me from punishment once he sees it once he understands what it means even atvar will recognize as much he had better straha thought not even his malice against me could withstand this could it half of him wanted to flee the consulate but hed already come too far for that now he was in trouble with the americans as well as the race i do not know anything about that the receptionist would not give him his proper title but was talking into a telephone attachment to the computer after a moment he swung his eye turrets toward straha please go to the security office on the second floor your identity will be ascertained there it shall be done straha said when he got to the security office he found the males and females there almost jumping out of their hides their tailstumps quivered with excitement most of them hadnt been anywhere near tosev when he staged his spectacular defection but they all knew of it this will not take long the senior security officer said advancing on him with a couple of trays full of waxy greenish plastic i have to take the impressions and then scan the patterns into the computer i am familiar with the procedure i assure you straha replied he let the officer press the plastic to his snout and left palm then waited for him to finish the scanning and comparison by the way the officer stiffened when the data came up on the monitor straha knew hed proved he was himself he said you will now please be so kind as to take me to the consul here i believe his name is tsaitsanx is that not correct absently the security officer made the affirmative gesture it shall be done he sounded dazed although perhaps i should formally place you under arrest first no not while i have this straha waved the attache case if tsaitsanx is not fluent in written english it would be wise to have a male or female i suppose a male from the conquest fleet who is fluent with us the consul does read the local language yes the security male said he ordered a couple of his subordinates to escort straha to tsaitsanxs office as if afraid the former shiplord would do something nefarious if allowed to walk the corridors unattended tsaitsanx proved to have come with the conquest fleet though straha had not known him the consul said i always knew you lived in my area indeed i have spoken with males and females who met you at functions given by ah more legitimate expatriates but i never expected to make your acquaintance here and i do not know whether to greet you or not you had better greet me straha opened the attache case and pulled out the papers sam yeager had given him examine these if you would be so kind i assure you they are genuine i would not be here if they were not they were given to me by one of those rare creatures a tosevite with a conscience examine them i shall tsaitsanx replied what have we here he read with great attention for a little while then as if of their own accord his eye turrets lifted from the papers in front of him and focused intently on straha by the emperor shiplord do you know what these papers mean i know exactly what they mean consul exactly straha said i would not be here if i did not i believe that tsaitsanx returned to his reading but not for long have i your permission to scan these documents and transmit them to cairo you have straha was sure the consul would have done so without his permission had he withheld it but he did appreciate being asked after sending the papers on their electronic way tsaitsanx said that brings me to the next question what to do about you shiplord i cannot scan you and transmit you to cairo it would be convenient if you could straha said before long the big uglies will realize i have gone missing they may not know why on the other fork of the tongue they may and this is bound to be one of the first places they search by now nesseref had flown into los angeles several times it was in her view one of the better tosevite facilities for receiving shuttlecraft for that matter she would rather have landed there than at cairo no one had ever shot at her when she descended toward the los angeles airport that also did duty as a shuttlecraft port shuttlecraft your descent is nominal in all respects a big ugly at the local control center radioed to her continue on trajectory and land in the usual area it shall be done nesseref answered i hope the ambulance is waiting to bring the sick male directly to the shuttlecraft had she been dealing with her own kind she would have assumed that to be the case with big uglies you never could tell but the tosevite on the other end of the radio link said shuttlecraft pilot that ambulance is waiting at the terminal here so are the hydrogen and oxygen for your next burn as soon as you are refueled you are cleared for launch so you can get that male to proper medical facilities for your kind i hope he makes a full recovery i thank you nesseref said both for your kind wishes and for the wellorganized preparations you have made to assist one of my species braking rockets fired deceleration pressed nesseref into her seat she eyed the radar and her velocity the races engineering was good very good most shuttlecraft pilots almost all in fact went through their whole careers without ever coming close to using a manual override but the pilot who wasnt alert to the possibility was the one who might come to grief not this time electronics and rocket motor functioned with their usual perfection landing legs deployed the shuttlecraft gently touched down on the concrete of the los angeles airport three vehicles immediately rolled toward it the hydrogen and oxygen trucks and another one with flashing lights and with red crosses painted on it in several places nesseref had seen vehicles with such symbols in poland and recognized this one as a tosevite ambulance will the male require aid to board the shuttlecraft she asked releasing the landing ladder so that its extensible segment reached the concrete i am given to understand that he will not replied the tosevite in the control tower he is said to be weak but capable of moving on his own very well nesseref said i await him she didnt have to wait long her external camera showed the male leaving the ambulance by the rear doors and moving toward the landing ladder at a startlingly brisk clip noting his body paint she let out a small hiss of surprise as he scrambled up toward the cabin nobody had bothered to tell her he was a shuttlecraft pilot too i greet you he said as he slid down into the compartment with her he got into his seat and fastened the safety harness with a practiced ease that showed he was indeed familiar with shuttlecraft and i greet you comrade nesseref answered are you in pain i have analgesics in the firstaid kit and will be happy to give you whatever you may need i thank you but i am not suffering in the least except from anxiety the male said when this shuttlecraft lifts off i shall be the happiest male on or rather above the surface of tosev he certainly didnt seem infirm nesseref wondered why shed been summoned halfway around the planet to take him to cairo for that matter she wondered why she wasnt taking him to the nearby city of jerusalem which boasted more specialized medical facilities what sort of pull did he have she was astonished to discover a shuttlecraft pilot with any pull at all she said we cannot go anywhere till the big uglies give us hydrogen and oxygen i understand that he said a touch of asperity in his voice who do you think you are nesseref thought in some annoyance before she could call him on it the tosevite in the tower radioed please open the port to your hydrogen tank i say again to your hydrogen tank it shall be done nesseref said i am opening the port to my hydrogen tank i repeat to my hydrogen tank the tosevites had sensibly adopted the races refueling procedures which minimized the possibility of error nesseref s fingerclaws entered the proper control slot the hydrogen tank rolled forward and delivered its liquefied contents as soon as nesseref said i am full the hose uncoupled and the truck withdrew now open the port to your oxygen tank i say again to your oxygen tank the big ugly in the control tower told her it shall be done nesseref repeated she went through the ritual once more the control activating that port was nowhere near the one for the hydrogen port again to make sure the two were not mistaken for each other after the oxygen truck finished refilling her tank it also disengaged and drove away from the shuttlecraft am i now cleared for takeoff nesseref asked i want to get this male to treatment as quickly as possible i understand shuttlecraft pilot replied the big ugly in the control tower there will be a fiveminute delay do you understand five minutes or shall i convert it to your time system i understand nesseref said as the male beside her let out a loud hiss of dismay what is the difficulty we have an airliner coming in for a landing a little low on fuel the tosevite answered due to the short notice given for your arrival we could not divert it to another airport as soon as it is down you will be cleared very well i understand nesseref didnt see what else she could say the other shuttlecraft pilot the male was twisting and wriggling as if he had the purple itch nesseref turned an anxious eye turret toward him she hoped he didnt the purple itch was highly infectious she didnt want to have to have the cabin here sterilized hurry the male kept muttering under his breath please hurry after what wasnt a very long delay for nesseref but one that must have seemed an eternity to that male the big ugly in the control tower radioed shuttlecraft you are cleared for takeoff again apologies for the delay and i hope your patient makes a full recovery i thank you los angeles control nesserefs eye turrets swiveled as she gave the instruments one last check after satisfying herself that everything read as it should she said control i am beginning my countdown from one hundred i shall launch at zero the countdown of course was electronic as it neared the zero mark her fingerclaw hovered over the ignition control if the computer didnt trigger the shutt lee rafts motor she would but again everything went as it should ignition began precisely on schedule acceleration squashed her it squashed the other shuttlecraft pilot too even so he let out an exultant shout through the roar of the rocket praise the emperor and spirits of emperors past i am finally free nesseref asked him no questions till acceleration cut off and left them weightless and the shuttlecraft quiet then she said can you tell me how you can sound so delighted in spite of an illness shuttlecraft pilot i have no illness the male answered which by then wasnt the greatest surprise nesseref had ever had he went on changes in my appearance are from makeup which makes me look infirm and also disguises me nor i must confess do i share your rank my name is straha perhaps you will have heard of me had nesseref not kept her harness on her startled jerk would have sent her floating around the cabin straha the traitor she blurted so they call me the male replied no he was no shuttlecraft pilot hed been a shiplord and a highranking one before going over to the big uglies he continued no so they called me i have redeemed myself now how nesseref asked in genuine astonishment wondering what could have made the race welcome straha once more something must have or she wouldnt have been ordered to los angeles and no one there would have helped him disguise himself to get to the shuttlecraft he answered i am sorry but i had better not tell you that until the authorities decide what to do with this information it should not be widely spread about is it as sensitive as that nesseref asked and straha made the affirmative gesture once more she wasnt very surprised if he hadnt learned something important the race wouldnt have done anything for him cairo control came on the radio then to report that the shuttlecrafts trajectory accorded with calculations but your departure was late the control officer said in some annoyance we have had to put two aircraft in a holding pattern to accommodate your landing my apologies nesseref said the big uglies held me up because one of their aircraft was landing at the facility and lacked the fuel to go into a holding pattern inefficiency the control officer said it is the tosevites besetting flaw the only thing in which they are efficient is addling us truth nesseref said while strahas mouth opened wide in amusement even though it hadnt been her fault nesseref felt bad about inconveniencing the aircraft her landing was delaying since she couldnt do anything about it though she put it out of her mind and concentrated on making sure the landing went perfectly on her radar she spotted not only those two aircraft but also helicopter gunships on patrol around the landing area straha saw them too and understood what they meant i should be honored he said atvar does not want this shuttlecraft shot out of the sky i too am thoroughly glad the fleetlord feels that way nesseref replied i have taken gunfire from the big uglies a couple of times while landing here and i do not wish to do it again there are too many parts of this planet where our rule is far less secure than it should be if i had succeeded in overturning atvar during the first round of fighting straha began but then he checked himself and laughed again this time with a waggle in the lower jaw that showed wry amusement he finished it is entirely possible that things might look no different save that you would be flying atvar here to see me and not the other way round i like to think that would not be so but i have no guarantee that what i like to think would be a truth braking rockets roared the shuttlecraft approached the concrete landing area to nesserefs vast relief no fanatical big uglies opened fire on it it settled to the surface of tosev as smoothly as it might have on a training video no mere mechanized combat vehicle came out to meet the shuttlecraft but a clanking slabsided landcruiser the fleetlord takes your safety very seriously nesseref said to straha i have not been met by a landcruiser here since my first descent to this city perhaps he worries about my security straha replied and perhaps he just wants to secure me he sighed i have no choice but to find out you at least shuttlecraft pilot are sure to remain free nesseref pondered that as she and the renegade shiplord left the shuttlecraft and headed for the massive armored vehicle awaiting them inside the races administrative center in what had once been known as shepheards hotel atvar awaited the arrival of the landcruiser coming through cairo from the shuttlecraft with all the delighted anticipation with which he would have faced a trip to the hospital for major surgery i hoped straha would stay in the united states forever he said to kirel and pshing as long as he remained out of my jurisdiction i could pretend he did not exist believe me such pretense left me not in the least unhappy that is understandable exalted fleetlord pshing answered strahas defection his treason hurt us far more than any of the mutinies ordinary soldiers raised during the first round of fighting against the big uglies truth atvar sent his adjutant a grateful look and now with what he has given us i am not altogether sure i can punish him at all let alone as he deserves for that treachery what he has given us kirel said is in a word trouble i would not have been altogether dismayed had that knowledge like straha himself stayed far far away we shall have to calculate our response most carefully we have always had to calculate our responses to straha and everything that has to do with him most carefully atvar replied to which kirel returned the affirmative gesture the two of them had been the only males in the conquest fleet who outranked straha what would strahas rank be now that at the moment was the least of atvars worries but it would not be shiplord again so he vowed he peered out the window toward the west the direction from which the landcruiser would come and there it was like a bad dream brought to life the outer armored gate of the compound slid back to admit it as soon as it had gone through the outer gate closed and the inner gate opened the two gates were never open at the same time that would have invited the big uglies to fire a gun or launch a rocket through them as if they need an invitation to make trouble atvar thought a voice came from the intercom exalted fleetlord the passenger has entered the compound i thank you atvar replied one of the larger lies hed ever hatched no one felt easy about speaking strahas name in public hed been an object of reproach among the males of the conquest fleet since fleeing to the americans while males and females of the colonization fleet had trouble believing such a defection could have taken place to them it seemed like a melodrama set in the ancientest history of home back in the days before the empire unified the planet for a hundred thousand years treason had been unimaginable except to straha exalted fleetlord ah what shall we do with him now that he is here asked one of the males at the gate shoot him as soon as he comes out of the landcruiser atvar thought but however much he was tempted to imitate the savage and barbarous big uglies he refrained send him here to my office he said no escort him here he will not know the way the last time he had anything to do with the business of the conquest fleet our headquarters were in space it shall be done exalted fleetlord came the reply the male down there was properly obedient properly subordinate atvar wished he hadnt been kirel spoke in musing tones i wonder what he will have to say for himself something clever something sneaky of that i have no doubt straha knows everything atvar said if you do not believe me you have but to ask him both kirel and pshing laughed then as the door to the fleetlords office opened their mouths snapped shut in strode straha two armed infantrymales flanking him the first thing atvar noticed was that he wouldnt have recognized straha in a crowd the next thing he noticed was that strahas body paint was not as it should have been irony in his voice the fleetlord said i greet you shuttlecraft pilot straha shrugged i needed the makeup and the false body paint to get away from the american big uglies they worked only then did he bend into the posture of respect and i greet you exalted fleetlord even if neither of us much wants to see the other well that is a truth and i will not try to deny it atvar said you relieve me in one way straha you are not claiming friendship or even comradeship as i feared you might not likely straha said and appended an emphatic cough as i told you i did not do what i did for your sake i did it for the sake of my friend the big ugly having done it though i thought i might get a warmer reception here than among the american tosevites he waggled an eye turret at atvar or was i wrong as a matter of fact i truly am not sure atvar replied you know the harm you did the race when you defected straha made the affirmative gesture and i also know the service i just did the race with those documents i sent you is it a service i wonder straha spoke in musing tones fleetlord reffet would reckon it one straha said slyly fleetlord reffets opinion atvar checked himself he did not care to advertise his longrunning feud with the head of the colonization fleet picking his words with some care he went on fleetlord reffet has had a bit of difficulty adapting to the unanticipated conditions existing on tosev straha laughed at that you think he is as stodgy as i always thought you were atvar sighed evidently he didnt need to advertise the feud there is some truth to that he admitted but we have just fought one war that was harder and far more expensive than anyone thought it would be there was i am told a big ugly who exclaimed one more such victory and i am ruined after a fight of that sort i understand the sentiment i not only understand it i agree with it and so i am something less than delighted to receive these documents though i cannot and do not deny their importance tosev has changed you too straha said in surprised tones it took longer to change you than it did me but it managed perhaps atvar answered knowing the renegade shiplord was right tosev changes everyone and everything it touches straha made the affirmative gesture we discovered that even before we made planetfall he said now if this were up to me what i would do is atvar let out an angry hiss before he could turn that hiss into coherent speech kirel said i see there is one way in which tosev has not changed you at all straha you still want to give orders even when you are not entitled to do so truth pshing put in straha ignored pshing he did not ignore kirel you have not changed either you hatched out of atvars eggshell right behind him and something else has not changed atvar said we are taking up the quarrels that preoccupied us before your defection as if you had never left it is if you like a tribute to the power of your personality for which i thank you yes straha sounded smug atvar had been sure he would the fleetlord went on but shiplord kirel is correct you do continue to seek to take command where you have no authority it is possible the words tasted bad on atvars tongue it is possible i say that by providing these documents to the race you have made it unnecessary for us to punish you for defecting strahas hissing sigh held nothing but relief you are stodgy atvar even yet but you do have integrity i thought you would i counted on it in fact do not waste praise too soon atvar warned you may perhaps be allowed to live once more in lands the race rules to rejoin the society of your kind but straha i am going to tell you something that is not only possible but certain you will live here as an ordinary citizen as a civilian if you think for an instant that your past rank will be restored to you you are completely and utterly addled do you understand me he watched the male who had come so close to overthrowing him watched with the greatest and closest attention ever so slowly ever so reluctantly straha made the affirmative gesture but then still full of selfimportance the exshiplord said a civilian yes but not i hope an ordinary one when i went over to the americans they interrogated me most thoroughly on matters pertaining to the race now that i have lived so long in the united states do you not believe i will know things about these big uglies you could not learn elsewhere well that is undoubtedly a truth atvar agreed we will indeed debrief you and no doubt you will provide us with some valuable insights perhaps we will even use you as a consultant should the need arisehe gave his old rival such salve for his pride as he could before going on but i repeat under no circumstances will you ever return to the chain of command count yourself lucky that you enjoy the fleetlords mercy kirel added were his body paint on my torso you would not be so fortunate were the fleetlords body paint on your torso kirel the big uglies would be ruling all of tosev straha said unadulterated fury filled kirels hiss enough atvar said loudly and tucked on an emphatic cough too much in fact straha you would do well to remember that your continued wellbeing depends on our goodwill for example you are known to be a ginger addict perhaps in gratitude for the services you have performed a supply of the herb will quietly be granted you on the other fork of the tongue perhaps it will not straha shot him a baleful glare maybe i spoke too soon when i praised your integrity maybe you did atvar gestured to the guards who had accompanied the returned renegade into his office take him to security let his interrogation begin now tell the staff there that i will want him questioned by particular experts in tosevite affairs i do not wish to lose any possible information we might gain from him it shall be done exalted fleetlord the more senior of the two guards said he and his comrades led straha away the door had hardly closed behind them before kirel said as far as i am concerned the americans were welcome to him i agree atvar said but he is here and he as given us valuable information he paused for a moment and oh by the emperor and by the spirits of emperors past how i wish he had not exalted fleetlord we have sought this information for years pshing said yes and now having obtained it we are going to have to act upon it one way or another atvar said i was not lying when i told straha this war would be harder than the one we fought against the reich the american big uglies have a larger land mass more industrial capacity a larger presence in space and if reports are correct more missilecarrying submarines full of explosivemetal bombs i do not relish the prospect of fighting them given all this how can we possibly avoid fighting them kirel asked i do not know the answer to that either atvar said unhappily and i blame straha for putting me in this predicament as long as the renegade had returned atvar intended to blame him for everything he could ttomalss had not wanted to go down to the surface of tosev again his visit to china had found him a prisoner of the big uglies his visit to the greater german reich hadnt involved him in any physical danger but had been acutely frustrating leaving him wondering whether the deutsche truly were rational beings the hopeless war theyd launched against the race had shown him hed had good reason to wonder too but when the fleetlord of the conquest fleet personally commanded him to report to the races administrative center in cairo what choice had he none whatever and he knew it and he had to admit the prospect of talking about the big uglies with a returned expatriate was intriguing traveling from the shuttlecraft port to shepheards hotel for some reason the tosevite name had stuck was almost enough to give him a panic attack cairo reminded him too much of peking where hed been kidnapped in its astonishing crowding and equally astonishing medley of stinks oh the big uglies here wore different kinds of wrappings and spoke a different language the bits of chinese he remembered did him no good at all but those he thought were incidentals the essences of the two places struck him as being all too similar when he got his first look at the administrative center he exclaimed this was once a place where big uglies came for pleasure i know tosevites are addled but the notion strikes me as improbable even so with a laugh the male who was driving him replied we have somewhat improved the defensive perimeter superior sir somewhat yes ttomalss replied with what he thought of as commendable understatement i note a double wall machinegun emplacements and rocket emplacements i am sure there are also many other things i do not note that would be an accurate assumption yes superior sir the driver said as the first armored gate opened for his vehicle when the second gate closed behind it ttomalss said i must admit i feel a good deal more secure now this may be an illusion i know such things often are on tosev but the feeling is not to be despised anyhow the chamber to which he was assigned had plainly been built with big uglies in mind its proportions especially the high ceiling and the plumbing fixtures proclaimed as much but the sleeping mat the furniture the computer in its little alcove and the heating system that made sure tosevite chill did not creep into the room made it tolerable perhaps even better than tolerable as soon as ttomalss had stowed his effects he telephoned straha the computer in the exshiplords chamber said he was out and could not be immediately reached which annoyed ttomalss till he realized he couldnt be the only member of the race questioning straha he recorded a message and settled down at the computer to find out what had happened in space and around tosev while he was traveling down from the starship and making his way through cairo none of the news channels mentioned strahas return to the eggshell of the race or the inflammatory information that had made the return possible that struck ttomalss as wise things would only be worse if a public clamor made coming to a wise decision more difficult the lead story was consolidation of the races informal control over the subregion called france ttomalss heartily approved of that informal control did not seem to raise the big uglies ire and had a good chance of leading to formal control some time in the future ttomalss was still getting the details of the story about france when the computers telephone attachment hissed i greet you he said and i greet you senior researcher the male a screen window showed was wearing the body paint of a shuttlecraft pilot not a shiplord that presented ttomalss with a problem after giving his own name he asked how shall i address you superior nuisance seems to fit straha answered and ttomalss mouth fell open in startled laughter the renegade went on the big ugly named sam yeager respects your work senior researcher for whatever that may be worth to you praise from one who does good work himself is praise indeed ttomalss said i have met sam yeager only briefly but i know his hatchling jonathan yeager a good deal better he shows considerable promise and i am familiar with the older tosevites work he is perceptive he is more than perceptive there are times when i wonder if he somehow had the spirit of a male of the race hatched by mistake into a big uglys body straha said when i was in exile he was the best friend i had regardless of species i see ttomalss wondered what that said about straha and about the expatriates from the race in the united states do you straha said i doubt it did anyone tell you that i did what i did not for the sake of the race but for the sake of sam yeager to try to save him from the difficulties into which he seems to have fallen with officials of the government of his own notempire yes i was informed of that ttomalss said it does not particularly surprise me ties of kinship are stronger among the big uglies than they are among us ties of friendship are stronger among us than among them this bespeaks our higher degree of civilization an individual chooses his friends but has no control over who his kinsfolk are still a friendship across species lines is somewhat out of the ordinary sam yeager is no ordinary big ugly as you have already admitted straha said i hope he is safe and unharmed the tosevites play political games more violently than we do the renegade paused the other thing i will note senior researcher is that i am no ordinary male of the race you could not have made yourself so difficult if you werettomalss replied truth straha used an emphatic cough fortunately he took the comment as praise rather than the reverse and i am proud to note that i have proved as difficult for the tosevites as i have for the race he waggled one eye turret at ttomalss and now i have no doubt you will want to put me under the microscope the way all these other snoops have done it is my duty but ttomalss wondered how much straha cared about duty he had abandoned first the race and then the american big uglies when expedience seemed to dictate such a course that sort of untrammeled individualism was more typical of tosevites than of his kind well go ahead then straha suddenly sounded amiable so amiable it made ttomalss suspicious but he had the invitation and would do his best to make the most of it very well how is it that you put the tosevite yeagers welfare above that of any male of the race why should i not when straha returned a question for a question ttomalss certainty that he was in for a difficult time hardened but then the exshiplord condescended to explain i have become more intimately acquainted with him than with any male of the race on tosev i like him better too he is both intelligent and reliable and he obtained the information i sent on to atvar at considerable risk to himself i do not even know if he is presently living if he is not i am more certain the spirits of emperors past will cherish his spirit than those of a good many males of the race i could name that was a more detailed answer than ttomalss had expected straha showed a good deal of hostility toward the race but a defector could hardly be expected to show anything else ttomalss tried a related question do you believe yeagers virtues as you describe them reflect him as an individual or the notempire from which he comes now that is an interesting question straha said one can tell you are a true psychological researcher and not one of those males from security whose vision is so narrowly focused they might as well have no eye turrets at all i thank you ttomalss said his voice dry now instead of praising the question would you be so kind as to answer it straha laughed if i happen to feel like it he said do you enjoy this chance to be rude to a male whose proper rank is so much higher than your own that was a wellaimed claw ttomalss had to look inside himself before replying yes perhaps i do after a heartbeats pause he added and you still have not answered the question since you show a certain basic honesty perhaps i will straha still sounded amused i fear the answer will be more ambiguous than you might prefer however life is full of ambiguities ttomalss said well well my congratulations straha told him you are not a hatchling any more you have become an adult more than half mockingly ttomalss bent into the posture of respect once more i thank you he said and once more you have not answered he wondered if straha would keep on playing word games with him but the exshiplord just said oh very well part of it is yeager as yeager and part is yeager as an american that notempire stresses individualism to a degree the race finds incomprehensible good big uglies can be very fine indeed under that system and yeager is bad big uglies have full scope for their evil inept ones for their incompetence there are many great successes in the united states and as many dreadful failures yes i have heard something of this ttomalss said in my view it is freedom turned to license i think the same thing straha said do you know that not long after the ships of the colonization fleet were attacked i told an american reporter i believed his notempire had made the assault he was fully prepared to print the story in a leading periodical until i explained i was merely yanking his tailstump the government of the united states would never have permitted such a story to appear ttomalss said so i thought as well senior researcher but he assured me i was wrong other american big uglies have told me the same thing straha said the americans insist that an altogether untrammeled flow of information produces the most rapid progress their preferred word for change if progress is seen as desirable one would be hard pressed to disagree with them amazing ttomalss said even he was unsure whether he meant the american tosevites preposterous lack of concern for security or their astonishing pace of technological change there is i trust you will agree a certain irony to my present situation straha said oh indeed ttomalss replied but then your situation in the united states was full of irony almost from the beginning was it not most of what has changed lately is the scope of things i like the way you put that the scope of things straha said before the big uglies used me without much trusting me because i had betrayed the race now the race will use me without much trusting me because i am betraying the americans this leaves me nowhere to go no one to turn to ttomalss had wondered if straha fully understood his own situation hearing that the psychological researcher decided he had one less thing to worry about because of whom she knew kassquit found herself sitting on several secrets that when they hatched from their eggs might go up like explosivemetal bombs the first electronic message from jonathan yeager asking for the races help in locating his father had come some days before shall do what i can shed written back do not know how much that will be she had liked sam yeager well enough in their couple of meetings and rather better than well enough in their electronic correspondence but her feelings for jonathan yeager were the main factor in her seeking to help his father she had telephoned reffets office first of all because shed discovered that sam yeager wild tosevite was roaming the races electronic network she thought she might get prompt attention from the fleetlord and in fact she did he returned her call quite quickly when she explained what she wanted and why he said as a matter of fact that matter is already under investigation no decision has yet been made as to whether to raise it with the relevant tosevite authorities i see kassquit said not seeing at all there is some concern for this big uglys safety i understand that reffet said there is concern for more than the safety of this one big ugly i assure you that was all he would say kassquit tried calling fleetlord atvar but his adjutant would not forward her call she reported the curious and not altogether satisfactory conversations to jonathan yeager and then almost without warning ttomalss departed for the surface of tosev i must aid in the interrogation of a returned defector a shiplord who has spent almost all of his time on tosev in the notempire of the united states he said the infamous straha kassquit asked and ttomalss made the affirmative gesture kassquits mind leaped does his arrival have anything to do with the disappearance of the big ugly called sam yeager she succeeded in astonishing her mentor how could you possibly know that ttomalss demanded i am you will remember still in touch with jonathan yeager kassquit replied and i know that sam yeager and straha are acquaintances the connection struck me as logical i see kassquit said much as kassquit had to reffet that is very perceptive of you my data indicate that sam yeager and straha are not merely acquaintances but friends i hope to confirm this in discussion with straha he paused that remark in fact was perceptive enough to make me believe you deserve to wear your junior researchers body paint not merely to show you are my ward and my apprentice but with all appropriate rights and privileges would you like me to initiate the approval process when i find the time i thank you superior sir kassquit exclaimed that would be very generous of you it would also give her a secure place of her own in the races hierarchy which was not to be despised and how your colleagues who disliked you for undertaking to raise a big ugly hatchling will be discomfited to see that hatchling taking a place in their profession i have not even the faintest notion of what you are talking about ttomalss said so matteroffactly that kassquit almost failed to notice the irony then hed gone down to the surface of tosev he kept in touch with kassquit through electronic messages and telephone calls jonathan yeager also kept in touch with her through electronic messages the wild big ugly she gradually realized was frantic with concern over his fathers safety kassquit wondered if anyone would ever feel that much concern for her she doubted it such things were not in the style of the race noting his intensity made her wish they were do you know why your father has disappeared she wrote him of course i do he wrote back he disappeared because he knew too much he added the races conventional symbol for an emphatic cough too much about what kassquit asked about things it was dangerous to know about jonathan yeager replied well of course kassquit said with a snort when she saw that she wrote what sorts of things i told you the sorts of things that are dangerous to know the wild big ugly answered that made kassquit hiss in annoyance jonathan yeager was being deliberately obscure his father had played the same sorts of games with electronic messages after a moment though her annoyance subsided are you not being more specific for reasons related to security she inquired exactly so he replied am sorry but that is how things are if you knew everything it might put you in danger and it might put me in more danger than i am already in too kassquit hadnt thought about danger to jonathan yeager once she did think about it though it made sense if sam yeager had disappeared because of something he knew and if jonathan yeager knew the same thing logic dictated that he too might disappear kassquit did make one attempt to learn more writing if this knowledge is dangerous perhaps you should pass it on so that it is not lost if something unfortunate happens to you i thank you but i think i had better not wrote the wild big ugly who had been her lover an english word he used to describe a relationship with which the race was not familiar also think my father took care of this matter to make sure the data would not disappear with him puzzle pieces that hadnt quite fit together now suddenly did he passed the data on to the shiplord straha who brought them to cairo with him kassquit wrote she did not include the conventional symbol for an interrogative cough jonathan yeager waited longer before replying this time as if thinking through just what his response ought to be when it finally came it was cautious believe that to be a truth yes he broke off the electronic conversation a little later perhaps from concern that he might reveal too much what hed already said was enough much more than enough to stimulate kassquits always active curiosity straha had been a stench in the scent receptors of the race ever since his spectacular defection he had been favorably received on his return to cairo kassquit knew that from ttomalss he had to have learned something important to get a favorable reception from atvar that reinforced the notion that sam yeager had known something vital and passed it on to the renegade shiplord the next time she spoke with ttomalss she asked him what spectacular piece of information did straha learn from sam yeager she was pleased when ttomalss did not bother pretending he had no idea of what she was talking about what he did say was i had better not tell you the information is inflammatory enough that i am lucky if that is the word i want which i doubt to have been entrusted with it myself whom would i tell kassquit asked who among the race would want to learn anything from me please remember superior sir i am nothing but a big ugly from an orphaned clutch the metaphor fit imperfectly but it was the only one the race had few take me seriously what you tell me would stay safe and secure ttomalss laughed you are ingenious i cannot deny that in fact i applaud it few in the race would have thought to use outcast status as a justification for receiving sensitive data even so i am afraid i must tell you no the secrecy classification for this data is too red for me to have any other choice by the emperor kassquit exclaimed irked that her ploy had failed by the way you make things sound we might be at war with another tosevite notempire by this time tomorrow truth ttomalss said we might be and then as jonathan yeager had before him he ended his conversation with kassquit as fast as he could by the emperor she said again and again looked down at the floor of her cubicle to show reverence for a male shed never seen and never would see is it as bad as that it almost surely was ttomalss as she knew from a lifetime of experience was not the sort to panic over nothing what could straha know the question tormented her like an itch under the scales she laughed when the simile crossed her mind laughed and ran a hand along her smooth scaleless skin no the language of the race and its images did not always fit her well that she could laugh instead of mourning said she was in a better mood than usual but laughing brought her no closer to the truth whatever that was wherever it lay what could straha know what could sam yeager have known how was she supposed to figure that out when shed never set foot on the surface of tosev whatever it was though it had to be something that had to do with the race maybe her not setting foot on tosev didnt matter after all should not be guessing she thought should know the data are all in front of me some of the races games played either in groups or against a computer involved solving elaborate puzzles where all the relevant pieces and many that were not were displayed together this was like one of those games except she wasnt sure she could see all the pieces as in those games she could pause and review the evidence she didnt have access to the conversations she and sam yeager had had when he visited the starship ttomalss and other psychological researchers endlessly studied those recordings for what they revealed about how big uglies thought but she could go over all the electronic conversations shed had with the wild tosevite those where he admitted his species and also those in which he appeared as regeya and maargyees fictitious members of the race under whose names hed managed to sneak onto the electronic network kassquit discovered she enjoyed reviewing those messages sam yeager had an odd and interesting slant on the world part of that of course was because he wasnt really a male of the race his perspectives were alien but part shed gathered from meeting jonathan yeager and the deutsch pilot johannes drucker was sam yeager himself he had an odd and interesting slant on the world even compared to other big uglies he also had wideranging interests wideranging curiosity that kassquit knew was more common among tosevites than among the race but even for a tosevite sam yeager had a sense of what was interesting that swooped and darted and landed in unpredictable places among them kassquit paused and reread a few of the things sam yeager had said in the guise of regeya she let out a soft speculative hiss very much as if she were in truth the female of the race she wished herself to be she didnt know she couldnt know not without asking some questions to which she wouldnt get answers ttomalss had already told her that those answers whatever they were were too secret for her to be allowed to learn them no she didnt couldnt know but she had what she thought was a pretty good idea she almost wished she didnt the deutsche had come much too close to destroying this starship and had destroyed too much that was the races now she feared the americans might get their chance glen johnson was sleeping when alarms inside the lewis and clark started screaming he jerked and thrashed and tried to get out of his sleep sack without undoing the straps that secured him in it that didnt work he had to wait till his brain fully engaged before his hands could reach for and open the fastening screw you brigadier general healey he muttered as the sirens howled insistently he understood the need for periodic drills he just resented having this one wake him up anything he resented he blamed on the spaceships shorttempered commandant that seemed fair whenever healey found something he didnt like he blamed johnson the numberthree pilot had just pushed off toward the doorway to his cubicle when he realized what sort of drill it was the ones the lewis and clark ran most often were pressureloss drills because that was the sort of misfortune likeliest to strike not this time this set of sirens was summoning the spaceships crew to battle stations jesus johnson muttered as he swung hand over hand to the control room he couldnt remember the last time the ship had run a battlestations drill he couldnt remember any battlestations drills that made him wonder if it was a drill if its not we go down swinging he thought that wasnt a good thought to have not when they wouldnt even take out any lizards while they fought the races machines would do the dirty work he almost bumped into mickey flynn at the entrance to the control room they did an alphonse and gaston act after you no after you before flynn preceded him into the lewis and clarks nerve center walter stone was already there it was his shift well flynn asked are we radioactive dust gas stone answered radioactive gas i am wounded flynn declared wounded or not he strapped himself into his chair johnson got into the seat behind those of the two men senior to him what the hells going on he asked this is a drill isnt it please god tell me its a drill were not under attack stone said all the lizard spy ships weve identified are sitting there quietly if there are any we havent identified theyre sitting there quietly too even before johnson had finished his sigh of relief flynn said the assumption here of course is that they may not necessarily keep on sitting there quietly ive heard assumptions i liked better now that you mention it so have i johnson said they havent shown hostility since we first spotted them why are we worried all of a sudden from behind him a rough voice said you always were a nosy son of a bitch werent you johnson yes sir general healey johnson answered as far as he was concerned brigadier general charles healey won the sob prize hands down he turned around and smiled into the commandants hard bluntfeatured face its made me what i am today sir healey didnt like taking sarcasm he preferred dishing it out after muttering under his breath he said youre plainly supernumerary here perhaps your station ought to be out in the scooter engaging targets from the flank if you say so sir johnson shrugged it wasnt even a bad idea he didnt think it would help much he didnt think anything would help much against a determined lizard attack but it wouldnt hurt either of course if things went wrong as they were bound to do hed have the loneliest death in the solar system tell me where to go and ill go there he knew healey would rise to the line like a trout rising to a fly but before healey could say anything walter stone asked sir what the devil is going on stone could get away with questions like that the commandant approved of him brigadier general healey scowled and sighed and answered things are heating up between cairo and little rock i dont know why exactly the scowl got deeper he didnt like not knowing but they are we need to be ready for whatever happens ive heard news i liked better mickey flynn observed me too stone agreed what touched this off sir president warrens not crazy the way the nazis were he couldnt be threatening the lizards hes not healey said theyre angry at us and i dont know just why i told you that he shook his head annoyed at having to repeat himself if they want to bad enough they can wipe us right out of the asteroid belt and thats with the ship full of johnnycomelatelies johnson said healey gave him another venomous look presumably for seeing the truth and presuming to tell it if they want to bad enough they can wipe us off the face of the earth flynn said wed hurt em if they tried it healeys voice was savage wed hurt em a lot worse than the germans did were stronger to begin with and the nazis already gave their defenses one good pounding johnson nodded at that every word the commandant said was true and yet he didnt have to put and yet into words walter stone did it for him mickeys right sir im not saying youre wrong wed hurt em wed hurt em plenty but if they wanted to they could smash us back to the stone age theyd really have to want to johnson said thats the point of all the bombs and rockets and submarines theyd know they were in a fight another few years healey muttered maybe just another couple of years another couple of years and the goddamn lizards would have been talking out of the other side of their snouts you boys all know it thats why were here one of the reasons anyhow flynn said the anumberone reason and you know it as well as i do healey ground out he scowled at mickey flynn challenging him to disagree the lewis and clarks numbertwo pilot maintained a discreet silence there are a few other things going on johnson said the mining the colonies on every rock where we can run up a dome we havent just come out here to fight a war were here to stay if we can do a little more spreading out before the lizards try and drop the hammer on us all sorts of good things here stone agreed the race doesnt have any real notion of how many goodies there are either from what they say the solar systems in their empire are tidier places than ours smaller suns mickey flynn said fewer leftover chunks of rock after their planets formed an eyebrow quirked they dont know what theyre missing if they give us the time we need it wont be missing them johnson said brigadier general healey gave him a nasty look dont violate security he snapped and that did it johnson lost his temper christ on a crutch sir give it a rest he said im not on the radio to the race and we all know whats going on youre insubordinate healey said maybe i am and maybe its about time too johnson retorted somebodys needed to tell you to go piss up a rope ever since before we left earth orbit if im the one stuck belling the cat okay i am thats all you have been nothing but trouble since you came aboard this spacecraft healey said i should have put you out the air lock then oh he has his uses sir flynn said after all whose money would we take in card games if he werent here that was slander johnson more than held his own but it distracted the commandant and johnson too stone continued the work of changing the subject if the lizards are angry enough at us now what we might be able to do in a few years doesnt matter remember the hermann goring the reichs imitation of the hermann goringthe reichs imitation of the lewis and clark had been blown to atoms during the last round of fighting stone went on so why the devil are the lizards ticked at us brigadier general healey shook his head i do not have that information i already told you i dont have it i wish to god i did every inch of him screamed that he thought he was entitled to the information and that he blamed people back on earth for withholding it from him the lizards are playing it close to their scales too dammit youd think theyd be screaming from the housetops if they caught us doing something we werent supposed to but they arent thoughtfully stone said sounds like they will fight if theyre pushed but they dont want to do it unless they decide they have to but theyre pushing us healey said thats what makes this such a confusing mess have they given us any demands flynn asked nothing ive heard the commandant sounded all the more frustrated and i should hear god damn it to hell how am i supposed to do my job if i dont know what the devil is going on what it sounds like is if anybody admitted what the fuss was about everything would go up in smoke right then and there johnson said brigadier general healey nodded as if he and johnson hadnt had words a few minutes before the riddle facing him was a bigger source of irritation than even his numberthree pilot youre right and that doesnt make any sense either nothing makes sense if you dont know the answers mickey flynn observed the people who do know the answers must have or think they have good reason to make sure nobody else finds out we call them senseless they call us ignorant odds are we and they are both right theyd better not be senseless or all of us and an awful lot of people and lizards back on earth are in a ton of trouble johnson said this is true flynn agreed on the other hand i could refer you to the late doctor ernst kaltenbrunner if he werent late of course he was senseless and now he is and will remain permanently senseless johnson grimaced and protested yeah but the nazis have been off the deep end ever since hitler started slaughtering jews we arent like that weve always played straight he hesitated we played straight with everything i know about except the lewis and clark as a matter of fact its not us healey said i have been assured of that had it been us the race has had plenty of chances to take us off the board and that was also true then johnson said what if we havent played straight with things nobody up here knows anything about like what walter stone asked how should i know johnson answered if i did know it wouldnt be something nobody knew about elementary my dear watson flynn murmured what if what if what if brigadier general healey snarled what we need are facts the only fact weve got is that the race is leaning on the united states if it leans too hard weve got to fight back or knuckle under were not about to knuckle under well theres one other fact too johnson said if the usa goes to war with the lizards now we lose and no matter how many drills we hold the lewis and clark is lunch he waited he hoped for healey to argue with him the commandant didnt why on earth are the lizards gearing up for war against the united states reuven russie asked his father over the supper table has everybody in the whole world gone meshuggeh moishe russie said i wouldnt be surprised its the only explanation that makes much sense have you talked with the fleetlord reuvens sister judith asked ive called him several times reuvens father answered most of them he hasnt wanted to talk to me when he has been willing to talk on the phone he hasnt had anything much to say but what could the united states have done to get the race so angry reuven asked with the germans everybody else had plenty of good reasons to hate them but the usa has just sat there and minded its own business whats wrong with that i dont know his father said since he wont really talk to me im having a devil of a time finding out too but i can tell you this straha is back in the races territory and thats not anything i thought id see while i was alive it was also something that meant very little to reuven straha he put the name into a question half a beat before his sisters could moishe russies smile was half amused half wistful you were only a little boy when he defected to the americans reuven he said esther and judith you werent even imagined yet let alone here he was something like the third or fourthhighest ranking male in the conquest fleet he tried some sort of coup against atvar and it didnt work and he fled i dont suppose youre going to ask the fleetlord about the details now reuven said his mother laughed see what your fancy education does for you mother he said indignantly his father made cracks like that all the time his sisters made them whenever they thought they could get away with them for rivka russie to make one too felt like a betrayal but the point his father said the point is that hes left the united states and come to cairo i think hes in cairo he had to know something important or else hed be imprisoned somewhere and hes not and its probably something that has to do with the united states since he lived there so long reuven said very good sherlock that was esther whod been reading a lot of arthur conan doyle in hebrew translation now all you have to do is figure out what he knows reuven looked at his father moishe russie shrugged and said i already told you i dont know maybe well all find out one day before too long im hoping we never find out because that will mean the troubles gone away i hadnt thought of it like that reuven took another bite of beefsteak he raised his wineglass heres to ignorance everyone drank the toast amid laughter reuvens father said thats probably the first time anyone has ever made that toast inside a jewish house aleval itll be the last time too his face clouded aleval we wont need to make that kind of toast again omayn reuven and his mother spoke together after supper reuven asked his father if the united states and the lizards go to war what do we do we here in palestine you mean moishe russie asked and reuven nodded his father sighed about the same thing we did when the race fought the germans sit tight and hope the americans dont manage to land a missile on jerusalem i think that would be less likely in this fight than in the war with the nazis the americans dont particularly hate jews so they dont have any big reason for aiming a missile here and most of their missiles are farther away than the ones the germans fired at us how do you know that reuven asked they may have three submarines sitting right off the coast how would we know we wouldnt not until something either happened or didnt his father said i told you what i thought was likely if you dont like that come up with your own answers i like it fine i hope youre right reuven said actually i hope were all worrying over nothing and that there wont be a war this time his father said omayn when they walked to work the next morning someone had painted new black swastikas on several walls and the phrase allahu akbar by them reuven laughed to keep from cursing havent the arabs noticed that that firms gone out of business who can say moishe russie answered maybe they wish it were still operating or maybe it is still operating but being quiet about it that wouldnt surprise me once some things get loose theyre hard to kill i thought dornberger was supposed to be a relatively civilized man reuven said compared to hitler compared to himmler compared to kaltenbrunner how much praise is that his father asked hes still a german hes still a nazi if he can find some way to make the lizards unhappy dont you think hell use it getting the arabs to erupt is one easy way to do it and if he incites them against us too all the better reuven said his father didnt contradict him he wished moishe russie had once they got to the office yetta showed them their appointments reuven sighed when hed been studying at the moishe russie medical college human physiology and biochemistry had looked like important subjects and theyd looked like fascinating subjects seeing them exemplified in the persons of his patients was much less exciting a lot of the answers he got were ambiguous sometimes he couldnt find any answers at all and even a lot of the ones that were perfectly clear werent very interesting yes sir that boil will respond to antibiotics yes maam that toe is broken no it doesnt matter if we put a cast on it or not itll do the same either way and yes it will hurt for a few weeks he gave a tetanus shot he removed a splinter of metal that had got lodged in a construction workers leg he took the cast off a broken wrist his father had set a few weeks before he swabbed a fouryearolds throat to see if the girl was coming down with a streptococcus infection he injected local anesthetic and stitched up a cut arm every bit of that needed doing he did it well but it wasnt what hed imagined a physicians career was like he was putting a clean dressing on the cut arm when yetta stuck her head into the room and said mrs radofsky just telephoned her daughter is screaming her head off she thinks its an earache can you fit her in a screaming toddler just what i need reuven thought but he nodded one way or another ill manage thats good the receptionist said i asked your father but he said he was too busy and told me to go to you instead yetta was plain to the point of frumpishness but at the moment she looked almost comically amused ill tell her she can bring miriam in to you in an hour if thats all right fine reuven said he almost asked her what was so funny but held off at the last minute because he saw a possible answer she thinks my father is trying to fix me up with a pretty widow he realized that almost started him laughing then he wondered what was so laughable about it with jane gone to canada he wouldnt have minded getting fixed up with anybody as if mrs radofsky cares about you for anything but whether you can make her little girl feel better he thought that didnt bother him that was the way things were supposed to be even back in his examination room he could tell when the widow radofsky brought her daughter into the office the racket miriam was making left no possible doubt reuven was looking at another widow a little old lady named goldblatt whose varicose veins were troubling her gevalt she said that ones not very happy no shes not reuven agreed im going to recommend an elastic bandage on that leg to help keep those veins under control for you i dont think theyre bad enough to need surgery now if they bother you more though come back in and well have another look at them all right doctor thank you mrs goldblatt said reuven hid his smile im learning he thought if hed told her straight out that she was fussing over very little shed have left in a huff as things were she seemed well enough pleased even though all hed done was sugarcoat essentially the same message can you see mrs radofsky and miriam now yetta asked why not reuven raised an eyebrow ive been hearing them or miriam anyhow for a while now the receptionist sniffed no she didnt care for anyones jokes but her own a moment later the young widow carried her daughter into the examination room miriam was still howling at the top of her lungs and was tugging at the lobe of her left ear and trying to stick her finger into it that would have been diagnostic all by itself mrs radofsky gave reuven a wan smile and tried to talk through the din thank you for seeing me on such short notice she woke up like this at four in the morning no wonder her smile was wan reuven grabbed his otoscope well see what we can do miriam didnt want to let him examine her not for beans she didnt she screeched no a twoyearolds favorite word anyway as reuven remembered from his sisters and tried to grab the otoscope and keep it away from her ear can you hold her please reuven asked her mother all right the widow radofsky said even in his brief time in practice reuven had discovered that almost no mother would hold her precious darling tight enough to do a doctor one damn bit of good hed thought about investing in pediatric straitjackets or even manufacturing them and making his fortune from grateful physicians the world around he expected to do half the holding himself this time too but he got a surprise mrs radofsky battled miriam to a standstill reuven got a good look inside a red swollen ear canal shes got it sure enough he said im going to give her a shot of penicillin and im going to prescribe a liquid for her you have an icebox to keep it cold most people did but not everybody to his relief miriams mother nodded she rolled her daughter onto her stomach on the examining table so reuven could give her the shot in the right cheek that produced a new set of screams almost supersonically shrill when they subsided the widow radofsky said thank you very much youre welcome reuven felt like sticking a finger in his ear too she should start getting relief in twentyfour hours if she doesnt bring her back make sure she takes all the liquid its nasty but she needs it i understand mrs radofsky didnt have to shout for miriam finally exhausted hiccuped a couple of times and fell asleep her mother sighed and said life is never as simple as we wish it would be is it she brushed back a lock of dark hair that had come loose no reuven said all you can do is your best miriams mother nodded again then sent him a sharp look is she noticing me and not just the man in the white coat he wondered and hoped she was queek and his interpreter are here comrade general secretary molotovs secretary told him very well pyotr maksimovich i am coming it wasnt very well and molotov knew it hed hated the reich but he missed it now that it was reduced to a battered shadow of itself and the united states was in trouble if the race found an excuse for smashing the usa how long could the ussr last after that no matter what the dialectic said about inevitable socialist victory molotov didnt want to have to find out for himself he hurried into the office reserved for visits from the races ambassador a couple of minutes later his secretary led in queek and the pole who translated his words into russian good day molotov told the human please convey my warm greetings to your principal his words were as warm as a murmansk blizzard but hed observed the forms the pole spoke to the lizard the lizard hissed and popped back at him he conveys similar greetings to you comrade general secretary queeks greetings were probably as friendly as molotovs but the soviet leader couldnt do anything about that he said i thank you for agreeing to see me on such short notice that is my duty queek replied now that i am here i will ask why you have summoned me his interpreter made it sound as if molotov would find himself in trouble if he didnt have a good reason he thought he did if at all possible i want to use my good offices to help the race and the united states come to a peaceful resolution of the dispute that has arisen between them he didnt know why the dispute had arisen which frustrated him no end but that didnt matter queek gestured the interpreter said that means he rejects your offer molotov hadnt expected anything so blunt why he asked fighting to keep astonishment from his voice because this dispute is between the race and the united states queek replied do you truly wish to include your notempire and suffer the consequences of doing so that depends on the circumstances molotov said if the soviet union were to include itself on the side of the united states do you doubt that the race would also suffer certain consequences when the interpreter translated that queek made the boiling and bubbling noises he used to show he was an unhappy lizard the interpreter didnt translate them which might have been just as well after half a minute or so the races ambassador started spluttering less now the pole turned his words into russian you would destroy yourselves if you were mad enough to attempt such a thing possibly even for molotov sounding dispassionate while speaking of his countrys ruin didnt come easy but he managed if however the race attacked first the united states and then the peaceloving peasants and workers of the soviet union our destruction would be even more certain if you think the germans hurt you you had better think very hard on what the united states and the soviet union could do together do you threaten me comrade general secretary queek asked by no means ambassador molotov replied i warn you if you leave the soviet union out of your calculations you make a serious mistake this government cannot be is not and will not be blind to the danger the race poses to the other chief independent human power and thus to all of mankind i assure you that whatever the danger in which the united states finds itself it is a danger that that notempire has abundantly earned queek said i also assure you that it is none of your business if you assure me it is none of my business i have no way to examine your other assurances molotov said therefore i must assume them to be worthless assume whatever you please queek said we are not interested in your efforts to mediate if we ever do seek mediation we shall inquire of you and as for your threats you will find that you cannot intimidate us i have no intention of intimidating you molotov said glad he had the knack of lying with a straight face you will follow your interests and we shall follow ours but i did want to make sure you understood what the soviet union considers to be in its interest the soviet union does not understand what is in its interest not if it courts destruction like the interpreter broke off and went back and forth with queek in the lizards language then he returned to russian the expression people would use is like a moth flying into a flame it is possible that we might be defeated molotov knew it was as near certain as made no difference that the soviet union would be defeated sometimes though a demonstrated willingness to fight made fighting unnecessary switzerland had never become a part of the greater german reich think carefully ambassador on whether you and the race care to pay the price i assure you comrade general secretary that our discussions shall revolve around that very subject queek replied i think we have now said everything that needs saying one of us to the other is that not a truth it is molotov said queek rose so did the interpreter like a welltrained hound molotov thought scornfully perhaps i shall see you again the ambassador said then again perhaps not perhaps this ugly building will cease to exist in the not too distant future it would be no enormous loss if that came to pass i care nothing for your views on architecture molotov said and if this building should cease to exist if many buildings throughout the soviet union should cease to exist the race and the buildings it cherishes would not come through unscathed the lizards tailstump quivered a sign of anger but queek left without making any more cracks which was probably just as well as soon as the door closed behind the races envoy and his interpreter molotov rose from his chair and went into a chamber off to the side of the office there he changed his clothes including socks shoes and underwear the race could make extraordinarily tiny mobile surveillance devices he did not want to take the chance of carrying them through the kremlin marshal zhukov waited in molotovs own office you heard georgi konstantinovich molotov asked oh yes zhukov patted the intercom speaker that had relayed the conversation to him i heard you did about as well as anyone could have comrade general secretary now we wait and see what happens is everything in readiness to defend the rodina molotov asked zhukov nodded strategic rocket forces are ready to defend the motherland admiral gorshkov tells me our submarines are ready our ground forces are dispersed the lizards will not find it easy to smash large armies with single weapons our forces in space will do everything they can and our antimissiles molotov suppressed hope from his voice as efficiently as he had suppressed fear with a big peasant shrug zhukov answered they will also do everything they can how much that is likely to be ive got no idea we may knock some down we will not knock down enough to make any serious difference in the fighting how many of ours will they knock down molotov asked more zhukov said you spoke accurately we can hurt them together with the united states we can hurt them badly they can do to us what they did to the reich i wish you could have learned how this trouble with the usa blew up so fast so do i molotovs smile was moscow winter do you suppose president warren would tell me you never can tell with americans but i wouldnt hold my breath the leader of the red army replied molotov nodded that was also his assessment zhukov cursed i dont want to fight the damned lizards blind i dont want to fight them at all with or without the americans on my side would you rather they came and fought us after beating the americans that looks to be our other choice molotov said you were right thats worse zhukov said but this is not good i wish the lizards would have let you mediate queek did not want mediation molotov said gloomily queek unless i am very much mistaken wanted the americans blood that is not good not good at allzhukov slammed his fist down onto molotovs desk again i think you were right the telephone rang molotov quickly picked it up not least to make sure zhukov wouldnt andrei gromyko was on the other end of the line well the foreign commissar asked one word that said everything necessary molotov gave back one word bad what are we going to do comrade general secretary gromyko sounded worried when gromyko sounded like anything matters were serious if not worse the threat the lizards present makes that of the hitlerites in seem as nothing beside it i am painfully aware of that andrei andreyevich molotov answered i judge that the threat from the race will not decrease if the lizards are allowed to ride roughshod over the united states and then come after us marshal zhukov who is here with me concurs do you disagree no i do not i wish i could gromyko said all our choices are bad some may be worse than others our best hope i believe is persuading the race that another wan of aggression would cost them more than they could hope to gain in return molotov said since that is obviously true i had no trouble making my position the soviet unions position very plain to queek he spoke with more assurance than he felt the phone lines to his office were supposed to be the most secure in the soviet union but the lizards were better at electronics than their soviet counterparts he had no guarantee they were not listening if they were they werent going to hear anything secret different from what hed said to their ambassadors scaly face gromyko understood that of course vyacheslav mikhailovich the foreign commissar said he was good no one human or lizard would have said that he was using a public voice an overly fulsome voice to put undue stress on his words have you any further suggestions molotov asked no gromyko replied i am content to leave everything in your capable hands had molotov been unsure gromyko was content to do that someone else would have held the foreign commissars job gromyko added goodbye and hung up does he agree with you zhukov asked molotov nodded da and you he wanted it out in the open if zhukov didnt agree somebody else would start holding the general secretarys job but the marshal however reluctantly nodded as you say our best hope but it is not a good one i wish i thought it were molotov said now we can only wait rance auerbach spoke french slowly and with a southern accent nothing like the one the people in the south of france used but he read the language pretty well everything he saw in the marseille newspapers made him wish he were back on the other side of the atlantic christ i wonder if theyd let me back in the army if i asked em nice penny summers looked at him from across their room at la residence bompard the hotel lay well to the west of the city center and so had survived the explosivemetal bomb without much damage penny said what the hell were you drinking last night and how much of it did you have the army wouldnt take you back to fight off an invasion of chipmunks let alone lizards never can tell he said back when the race first hit us they took anybody who was breathing and they didnt check that real hard either you arent hardly breathing night now penny retorted which was cruel but not altogether inaccurate i can hear you wheezing all the way over here like her previous comment that one held an unfortunate amount of truth auerbach glared just the same you want to be over here if the lizards try and kick the crap out of the country id sooner be here than there on account of they can kick our ass from here to sunday and you know it as well as i do penny said one more home truth he could have done without putting the best face on it he could he said well go down swinging that wont do us a hell of a lot of good penny walked past him to the window and looked north toward the blue blue waters of the mediterranean the hotel sat on the headland west of the inlet that had prompted greek colonists to land at marseille what seemed a very long time ago by earthly standards turning back penny went on you want to go back go ahead its no skin off my nose you wont see me doing it though rance grunted he was just gassing and he knew it if hed thought the army would take his ruined carcass he would have gone back if he had to swim the atlantic to do it as things were as things were he wanted a drink and he wanted a cigarette the cigarettes hereabouts were nasty items they tasted like a blend of tobacco hemp and horse manure he lit one anyway as much an act of defiance as anything else he looked at his watch its half past ten he said were supposed to see pierre the turd at noon wed better get moving one of these days youre gonna call him that to his face and youll be sorry penny predicted i still say thats what his name sounds like rance took another quick drag on his cigarette then stubbed it out hed sated his craving for nicotine and he didnt like the taste for hell by writing out what he wanted auerbach got the concierge to call him a cab it showed up a few minutes later a battered volkswagen where to the cabby asked he was smoking a cigarette like the one rance had had but hed worked it down to a tiny little butt i would like to go to the refugee center to the north of the city auerbach spoke slowly and as carefully as he could sometimes the locals would understand him sometimes not this time the driver nodded oui monsieur he said and opened the door so penny and rance could get into the back seat auerbach grunted and grimaced as he squeezed himself into the narrow space he ended up knee to knee with penny which was pleasant but not so pleasant as to keep him from wishing he had more room the road north skirted the vieux pont the inlet at the heart of the city it also skirted the worst of the wreckage from the bomb rance eyed the ruins with fascination hed seen plenty of pictures of the kind of damage explosivemetal bombs produced but never the real thing till now everything looked to have been blasted out from a central point which he supposed was exactly what had happened it happened with ordinary bombs too but not on such a scale he wondered how many had died when the bomb went off then he wondered if anybody knew even to the nearest ten thousand but a lot of people remained very much alive too the tent city north of town was enormous penny wrinkled her nose smells like the septic tank just backed up she said its a wonder they dont have disease rance spoke with the authority of a former officer they will before too long if they dont do something about their sanitation pretty damn quick dixhuit francs monsieurthe driven said as he brought the volkswagen to a halt eighteen francs was about three bucks it would have been high for the trip back in the states but not outrageously so auerbach dug in his pocket and found two shiny tenfranc coins they didnt weigh anything to speak of they were stamped from aluminum which struck him as money for cheapskates the driver seemed glad enough to get them though merci beaucoup he told rance then auerbach had to tell him the same thing because the fellow and penny had to work together to extract him from the back seat of the vw rance normally hated standing up which made his ruined leg hold more weight than it really felt like bearing compared to being crammed into that miserable back seat standing up wasnt half bad he took as much of his weight as he could on his stick and his good leg a dumpy little woman a few years younger than penny came up to them you are the americans she asked rances eyes snapped toward her the minute she started to speak if she didnt have a bedroom voice hed never heard one not much to look at but shed be something between the sheets in the dank he had to remind himself he needed to answer yes we are the americans he said in his slow texasflavored parisian french and you im lucie she told him im pierres friend come with me they came even without running water the tent city had better order than rance would have guessed from the smell on his arrival there were latrine trenches off in the distance just too many people and theyve been here too long he thought he knew about that he and penny had been stuck in a refugee camp for a while after the first round of fighting ended kids in short pants ran by making a godawful racket rance almost tripped over a yappy little dog the tent in which lucie and pierre lived was a goodsized affair whose canvas had been bleached by sun and rain ducking through the tent flap wasnt easy for rance either but he managed leaning on the stick when he straightened up again he said oh hello rather foolishly in english because another woman was in the tent with pierre and lucie she was younger than the ginger dealer but they had a family look to them though she was better looking than old pierre the turd ever dreamt of being she surprised him by answering in english hello i am monique dutourd pierres soeur his sister he went back to his own bad french how is it that you speak english i am a professor of roman history she said and then with a flash of bitterness a professor too long without a position i read english and german much better than i speak them her mouth narrowed into a thin line i hope never to speak german again any language can be useful pierre dutourd said first in english and then in the language of the race he went on in the latter tongue is that not a truth rance and penny had spent too much time in the company of lizards over the past few years they both made the races affirmative hand gesture at the same time lucie laughed which raised a couple of goosebumps on rances arms penny gave him a sour look she must have known what the frenchwomans voice was doing to him lucie hefted a green glass bottle wine she asked merci auerbach said and penny nodded rance would have preferred either real booze or beer but this was france so what could you do pierre dutourd raised his glass in salute this is a better meeting than our last one he said amen rance exclaimed and drank he fumbled for words no nazis with rifles no trouble no fear less fear anyhow the ginger dealer said less trouble the lizards the lizards in authority still do not love us with france as she is today this causes certain difficulties but youre getting around them penny said after auerbach translated for her he started to turn that back into french but pierres sister did the job faster and better than he could have yes we are this time pierre dutourd spoke the language of the race do we all understand this speech everyone did but monique and she seemed not particularly unhappy at being excluded good pierre said now i am given to understand you have some of the herb you are interested in selling me truth penny said congratulations on getting it into this notempire dutourd said that is more difficult these days officials are altogether too friendly with the race some of my former suppliers are having troubles which is a pity there are many males and females hereabouts who are longing for a taste i hope basil roundbush is one of those suppliers rance said as a matter of fact he is pierre said you know him he waited for rance to nod then went on he is i believe fixing his troubles now i hope he does not auerbach said and used an emphatic cough ah dutourd raised an eyebrow scenting scandal dealing with penny and me will mean you have less need to deal with him rance said i aim to hunt his business if i can he didnt wait for the french ginger dealer to ask why but went on to explain his runin with roundbush in edmonton and the way the englishman was hounding david goldfarb pierre dutourd listened but didnt seem much impressed business is business to him the son of a bitch auerbach thought but when he mentioned goldfarbs name monique dutourd perked up she and her brother went back and forth in rapidfire french most of it too fast for rance to keep up with he gathered pierre was filling her in on what hed said then she seemed to slow down deliberately to give auerbach a chance to understand her next words i think that if it is possible for you to do without the englishman and his ginger you should anyone who would send a jew and a jew who did not speak even so much as a word of french in among the nazis is not a man who deserves to be trusted if he has the chance to betray you he will take it i have been guarding my back for many years monique pierre said with amused affection i do not need you to tell me how to do it his sister glared at him auerbach was sure hed lost the play but then lucie said it could be monique has reason i have never trusted this roundbush either he is too friendly he is too handsome he thinks too much of himself such men are not to be relied upon and now we have another choice rance had been trying to keep up with a translation for penny but he caught that with a nod to good old pierre the turd he said cest vrai now you have another choice it could be dutourd said auerbach carefully didnt smile he knew a nibble on the hook when he felt one monique dutourd looked up from the letter she was writing she wondered how many applications shed sent out to universities all over france she also wondered how many of those universities still existed at the moment and how many had vanished off the face of the earth in an instant of explosivemetal fine and she wondered how many letters shed sent to universities still extant had got where they were addressed the situation with the mail in newly independent france remained shockingly bad the nazis would never have tolerated such inefficiency of course the nazis would have read a lot of the letters in the mailstream along with delivering them monique dared hope the officials of the republique francaise werent doing the same she also dared hope department chairmen were reading the letters she sent them she had very little on which to base that hope only three or four letters had come back to the tent city outside marseille none of them showed the least interest in acquiring the services of a new romanist because nobody cared about her academic specialty she remained stuck with her brother and lucie she wished she could get away but they were the ones who had the money they had plenty of it they were generous about sharing it with her more generous probably than she would have been were roles reversed but being dependent on a couple of ginger dealers rankled not for the first time monique wished shed studied something useful instead of latin and greek then she could have struck out on her own got work for herself as things were she had to stay here unless she wanted to spend the rest of her days as a shopgirl or a maid of all work pierre glanced over to her and said do you really think i ought to tell the englishman to go peddle his papers he and i have done business for a long time and who can be sure if these americans are reliable youre asking me about your business monique said more than a little astonished youve never asked me about business before except when it had to do with that cochon from the gestapo i knew plenty about him without asking you too her brother said but he did make a nuisance of himself when he connected the two of us a nuisance of himself now monique had to fight to keep from exploding dieter kuhn might have hounded pierre but hed not only hounded monique but also subjected her to a fullscale nazistyle interrogation and then forced his way into her bed as far as she was concerned the one good thing about the explosivemetal bomb that had burst on marseille was that it turned kuhn to radioactive dust a nuisance pierre repeated placidly monique glared at him he ignored the glare his thoughts were fixed firmly on himself on his own affairs you did not answer what i asked about the americans yes i think you should work with them monique answered if you have a choice between someone with a conscience and someone without would you not rather work with the side that has one youre probably right pierre said if i have none myself people with a conscience are easier to take advantage of impossible man monique exclaimed what would our mother and father say if they knew what youd turned into what would they say i like to think theyd say congratulations pierre we never expected that anyone in the family would get rich and now youve gone and done it moniques brother raised an eyebrow getting rich does not seem to be anything youre in severe danger of doing when you were teaching you werent getting much and now you cant even find a job i was doing what i wanted to do monique said if i werent your sister id still be doing what i wanted to do if you werent my sister youd be dead pierre said coldly youd have been living back at your old flat and it was a lot closer to where the bomb went off than my place in the porte daix was next time you feel like calling me nasty names or asking about our parents kindly bear that in mind he was infuriatingly bound to be right that didnt make monique resent him any less on the contrary but it would make her more careful about saying what was on her mind all right even she could hear how grudging she sounded but i have spent a lot of time learning to be a historian ive never spent any time learning the ginger business its all common sense her brother told her common sense and a good ear for whats true and whats a lie and the nerve not to let anyone cheat you people and lizards have to know youll never let anybody cheat you a historian needed the first two traits the third monique wondered how many people pierre and his henchmen had killed hed been willing enough more than willing enough to use his lizard friends to try to arrange dieter kuhns untimely demise it hadnt worked the lizard assassin unable to tell one human from another had gunned down a fish merchant by mistake of course that effort had been in pierres interest as well as moniques she wondered if he ever did anything not in his own interest and she didnt like the way he was eyeing her now in musing tones he said if i go with the americans little sister you could be useful to me you know english after all even if i find the americans dont work out ill go back to the englishman and you could be useful with him too suppose i dont want to be useful monique had never well never this side of dieter kuhn heard a word whose sound she liked less her brother as shed already seen was a relentless pragmatist with a shrug he answered ive carried you for a while now monique dont you think its time you started earning your keep one way on another im trying to do just that she held up the letter she was working on i havent had any luck thats all one way or another i said pierre sighed i admire you for trying to go on doing what you had done truly i do you can even go on trying to do it i have no objection whatsoever and i will congratulate you if you get a position but if you dont his smile was sad and oddly charming if you dont you can work for me i was just thinking you hadnt been cruel enough to say anything like that to me monique replied her voice bitter she snapped her fingers so much for that you dont have to make up your mind right away pierre said but do remember i pulled wires to get you away from the purification police i hoped you might want to show you were grateful monique scornfully tossed her head if you werent my brother youd be using that line to get me to go to bed with you all of a sudden the prospect of being a maid of all work didnt look so bad thank you but no i would not be interested even then ive never had much use for women who argue and talk back all the time pierre replied with wounding dignity monique wondered how well he knew himself lucie was anything but a shrinking violet but that thought flickered in her mind and then was gone she wanted to hit back to wound i believe you there she said the only time youd want them to open their mouths would be to swallow something just like that damned ss man im surprised you didnt jump to put on your own black shirt theyd have paid you well after all and what else is there pierre surprised her with an immediate emphatic answer not being told what to do of course i had a bellyful of orders in the army ive done my best not to have to take them ever since you dont care to take them that could be monique snarled but you dont mind giving them do you no you dont mind that a bit her brother spread his hands in a startlingly philosophical gesture if one does not take orders it is because he can give them nestcepas do you see any other arrangement i had another arrangement till being your sister turned my life upside down monique said i taught my classes and outside of that i studied what i wanted what interested me no one made me do it no one would have been interested in making me do anything people let me alone do you understand what that means do you have any idea what that means it means you were very lucky pierre said if you get another position you will be lucky again but if you are not so lucky what then why then you have to work for a living just like everyone else there is a difference between working for a living and playing the whore monique said maybe you cant understand that but the germans already made me play the whore ill be damned if i let my brother do the same she threw down the letter why not it was bound to be useless anyhow and stormed out of the tent she fled not just the tent but the whole tent city as if it were accursed it might as well have been as far as she was concerned if shed had a little lead tablet and thought inscribing a curse in the name of the gods would have wiped the miserable place from the face of the earth she would have done it in a heartbeat as things were all she could do was storm away marseille was a great racket of bulldozers and jackhammers and saws and ordinary hammers and tools for which she didnt even have names wrecked buildings were coming down new buildings were going up most of those new buildings were supposed to be blocks of flats monique didnt see the tent city shrinking though she had a pretty good idea what that meant somebodys pockets were getting lined she didnt want to look at the buildings looking at them reminded her she wasnt living in one of them that she wouldnt be able to afford to live in one of them they had things she could buy unless pierre cut off all her money what would i do then she wondered could i stand his businessshe doubted it and yet a man smoking a pipe called out a lewd proposition monique rounded on him and in a voice that could be heard all over the square suggested that he ask his mother for the same service he turned very red he turned even redder when people jeered him and cheered her puffing furiously at the pipe he withdrew in disorder nicely done professor dutourd someone behind monique said a boor like that deserves whatever happens to him she whirled the world whirled around her there stood sturmbannfuhrerd e er kuhn in civilian clothes he looked like a frenchman but his accent declared who and what he was in that case you deserved to be blown to the devil she snapped i thought you were i prayed you were he smiled the smile he no doubt thought so charming no such luck im afraid i was sent back to the vaterland two days before the bomb fell here they were going to put me in a panzer unit but the reich surrendered before they could he shrugged cestla vie what are you doing here again monique asked why i am a tourist of course i have a passport and visa to prove it the ss man replied with another of those not quite charming smiles and what are you here to see moniques wave took in ruin and reconstruction there isnt much left to see oh but marseille is still the home of so many wonderful herbs kuhn said blandly christ monique thought hes sf in the ginger business the reich is still in the ginger business hell be looking for pierre and if i start working for pierre hell be looking for me too every time david goldfarb crossed a street he didnt just look both ways he made careful calculations if a car suddenly sped up could it get him or could he scramble up onto the sidewalk and something close to safety nothing like almost getting killed to make one consider such things of course that fellow whod tried to run him down wasnt the first driver in edmonton whod almost killed him just the first one whod meant to david had a lifetime of looking left first before stepping off the curb but canadians like their american cousins drove on the right that was a recipe for attempted suicide goldfarb didnt try to do himself in quite so often as he had after first crossing the atlantic but it still happened in moments of absentmindedness this morning he got to the saskatchewan river widget works unscathed by either wouldbe murderers or drivers he didnt notice till too late hello there hal walsh said as usual the boss was there before any of the people who worked for him he pointed to a russianstyle samovar hed recently installed make yourself some tea get your brains lubricated and go to town as usual goldfarb complained about the samovar why couldnt you leave the honest kettle that damn thing is a heathen invention youre a fine one to talk about heathens pal walsh retorted every now and again he would make cracks about davids judaism things being as they were in britain that had made goldfarb nervous but hal walsh unlike sin oswald mosley and his ilk didnt mean anything nasty by it he gave jack devereaux a hand time about being frenchcanadian and also derided his own anglosaxon and celtic ancestors goldfarb had decided he could live with that he did get himself a cup of tea bloody miracle you set out milk for it he said with this contraption id think youd want us to drink it russianstyle with just sugar my parents do that not me though youre acculturated walsh said goldfarb must have looked blank because his boss explained england was your mother country so you got used to doing things the way englishmen do too right i did goldfarb said and explained how he was in danger of doing himself an injury every time he tried to cross the street walsh laughed then stopped abruptly my brother went to london a couple of years ago and i remember him complaining because he kept looking the wrong way i hadnt thought about your being in the same boat here what boats that asked jack devereaux he made straight for the samovar and got himself a cup of tea he didnt worry that the gleaming gadget was unbritish he wasnt british himself not by blood though he spoke english far more fluently than french david did you take the titanic of course and youre daft if you think i didnt have fun rigging a sail on the iceberg afterwards so i could finish getting over here goldfarb retorted devereaux gave him a quizzical look what all have you got in that teacup he asked and then before david could answer can i have some too we dont need spirits to lift our spirits walsh said or wed damn well better not anyhow he didnt mind people drinking beer with lunch hed drink beer with lunch himself but frowned on anything more than that he led by example too since he worked himself like a slave driven the people who worked for him could hardly complain when he expected a lot from them he tilted back his cup to drain it then said whats on the plate for today im still trying to work the bugs out of that skelkwank gh reader devereaux answered if i can do it well have a faster cheaper gadget than the one the lizards have been using since time out of mind if i cant he shrugged you dont win every time you bet thats true however much you wish you did walsh said what about you david ive got a couple of notions to improve the phonenumber reader goldfarb said but theyre just notions if you know what i mean if i get a chance ill do some drawings and play with the hardware but odds are ill spend a lot of my time giving jack a hand i think hes pretty close to getting where he wants to go as opposed to getting where you want me to go devereaux said with a grin the climates better there in winter than it is here but probably not in summer goldfarb said that would be funny if only it were funny walsh said its not by accident we call our football team the eskimos goldfarb didnt call what the canadians played football at all it was to him one of the most peculiar games imaginable of course the canadians didnt call the game he was used to football either to them it was soccer and they looked down their noses at it he didnt care more of the world agreed with him than with them walsh fixed himself a second cup of tea then said lets get going there were times when david was reminded he was a jumpedup technician not a properly trained engineer this morning gave every sign of being one of those times he got only so far looking at drawings of the phonenumber reader hed devised then muttering he went back to the hardware and started fiddling with it cutandtry often took him further fasten than study he knew that could also be true for real engineers but it seemed more emphatically so for him he wasnt altogether sorry when jack devereaux looked up and said david what about that hand you promised goldfarb applauded him devereaux groaned i suppose i asked for that doesnt mean i had to get it though of course it does goldfarb said but he made a point of hurrying over to see what he could do for rather than to the other engineer the motors that turned the lizards silvery skelkwank gh disks a technology mankind had copied widely all operated at the same speed as far as anyone human knew theyd been operating at that same speed for as long as the race had been using them it worked it was fast enough why change that was the lizards attitude in a nutshell or an eggshell people now people werent so patient if you could make the disks turn faster you could get the information off them faster too seeing that was obvious getting a motor anywhere near as compact and reliable as the ones the lizards used was a different question though expectations for quality had gone up since the race came to earth people didnt come so close to insisting on perfection as the lizards did but breakdowns they would have taken for granted a generation earlier were unacceptable nowadays it runs fine devereaux said but its too goddamn noisy he glared at the motor which was indeed buzzing like an angry hive hmm goldfarb eyed the motor too maybe you could just leave it the way it is and soundproof the case he knew that was a technicians solution not an engineers but he threw it out to see what devereaux would make of it and devereaux beamed out of the mouths of babes he said reverently lets do it lets see if we can do it anyhow what measurements will we need for the case david asked and answered his own question by measuring the motor let me cut some sheet metal we ought to have some sort of insulation around here too thatll give us an idea of whether thisll be practical hed got used to flanging up this that or the other thing in the raf cutting sheet metal to size was as routine as sharpening a pencil but when he was carrying the metal back to the motor his hand slipped he let out a yelp what did you do devereaux asked tried to cut my bloody finger off goldfarb said it was indeed bloody he added im bleeding on the carpet and grabbed for his handkerchief hal walsh hurried over lets have a look at that david he said in commanding tones goldfarb didnt want to take off the handkerchief the blood soaking through told its own story though walsh clicked his tongue between his teeth youre going to need stitches with that theres a new doctors office thats opened up in the building next door and a good thing right now come along with me david didnt argue he couldnt remember the last time hed been so clumsy he didnt want to look at his hand whenever he did he felt woozy and wobbly blood was supposed to stay on the inside not go leaking out all over the place jane archibald md read the sign on the door a lady doctor goldfarb said i hear she studied under the lizards walsh answered she ought to be able to patch you up wouldnt you say what happened here the receptionist asked when walsh brought david into the office then she said never mind come into the examining room with me sir the doctor will be with you right away thanks david said vaguely hardly noticing hed done so he sat down on the chair there he was cursing softly to himself in yiddish when the doctor hurried into the room he stopped in embarrassment all the worse because he hadnt expected the female physician to be so decorative more slowly than he should have he realized this tall blond obviously anglosaxon woman was unlikely to have understood his pungent remarks but her laughter said she did which embarrassed him all the more a moment later she was all business lets have a look at it she said her accent lowerclass british or perhaps australian david undid the makeshift bandage dr archibald examined the wound and nodded briskly yes thatll take a few stitches hold the edges together while i give you a bit of novocaine so you wont feel the other needle so much all right he said and did as she injected him he asked do you really know yiddish how did that happen just bits and pieces mister dr archibald said threading catgut on whatever they used for sutures these days onto a needle goldfarb david looked away he didnt care to see what would happen next david goldfarb she stared at him blue eyes going wide not the david goldfarb whos related to moishe and reuven russie she was so astonished she almost but not quite forgot to start stitching him up and he was so astonished he almost but not quite forgot to notice it stung despite the novocaine my cousins he answered automatically how do you know them i was at the russie medical college with reuven she answered hold still there please i want to put in a couple of more stitches that was spoken in physicians tones then she went back to talking as if to a person i might have married reuven but he wanted to stay in palestine and i couldnt stomach living under the race any more not after what they did to australia her tone changed again there thats done let me bandage you as she wrapped the finger with gauze and adhesive tape goldfarb said i didnt meet you when i was in jerusalem i would have remembered that was probably more than he should have said he realized it too late well naomi didnt need to know about it dr archibald didnt get angry shed probably heard such things from the age of fourteen up its very good to meet you now she said i heard about your troubles in france and getting out of england that youd wound up here in edmonton had slipped my mind youll need to come back in about ten days to have the sutures removed see myrtle out front for an appointment she stuck her head out the door and called to the receptionist no charge for this one myrtle old family friend as david went back to the widget works hal walsh turned to him and said i saw the doctor old family friend you lucky dog david smiled doing his best to look like the ladykiller he didnt come close to being felless hadnt had a holiday in much too long she hadnt done much work after fleeing marseille for the new town in the arabian peninsula but life as a refugee was vastly different from life as a vacationer here in australia too the race had claimed the land for its own even more emphatically than it had in arabia and unlike in arabia here no fanatical big uglies willing even eager to die for their superstitions prowled the landscape and had to be warded against the landscape in the central part of the continent reminded felless eerily of home the rocks and sand and soil were all but identical the plants were similar in type though different in detail many of the crawling creatures reminded members of the race of those of home though a rather distressing number of them were venomous only the furry animals that dominated land life on tosev really told felless she remained on an alien world even those were different from the large beasts on the rest of the planet australia by all indications had long been ecologically isolated the bipedal hopping animals filling the largeherbivore ecological niche hereabouts were so preposterous felless mouth fell open in astonished laughter the first time she turned an eye turret toward one but the creatures were very well adapted to their environment she saw less of that environment than she might have otherwise business administrator keffesh had been even more generous than shed hoped after she arranged the release of the imprisoned big ugly monique dutourd shed brought a lot of ginger to australia and she was enjoying it that required care felless would spend one day in an orgy of tasting the next in her hostel room waiting for her pheromones to subside so she could go out in public without exciting all the males who smelled them into a mating frenzy getting meals sent to the room rather than eating in the refectory cost extra felless authorized the change without the slightest hesitation all the individuals who brought meals to her were females once she noticed the pattern she found that very interesting were the males and females who ran the hostels quietly adapting to the unavoidable presence of ginger on tosev she couldnt have proved it she didnt dare ask about it but the assumption certainly looked reasonable on the days when she was out and about she noticed that ginger did indeed make its presence known in these new towns she couldnt smell the pheromones she emitted in her season they were for males but she saw a couple of matings on the sidewalks and she saw more than a few males hurrying along in unusually erect posture and with the scales of their crests upraised that meant they smelled female pheromones and were looking for a chance to mate how foolish they look she thought back on home she wouldnt have seen males interested in mating unless she was in her season herself then she would have found them attractive not absurd as things were she viewed them with a cool detachment unlike anything shed known on home wonder if this is the attitude tosevite females have toward their males that struck her as an interesting notion it might repay further research when she got back to france might even ask this monique dutourd she thought she owes me favors and i know she was involved in at least one sexual relationship the idea didnt occur to her on a day when shed been tasting ginger but on one when she hadnt and when she was feeling the gloomy aftereffects of overindulgence in the herb she wondered what that meant ginger was supposed to make a female clever maybe it only made a female think she was clever such reflections disappeared when she got a telephone call from ambassador veffani without preamble he said senior researcher i strongly recommend that you return to france at once why superior sir felless asked doing her best to disguise dismay why i shall tell you why veffani sounded thoroughly grim because there is serious danger of war between the race and the notempire known as the united states by the emperor felless was so upset she barely remembered to cast down her eyes after naming her sovereign have all these tosevite notempires gone addled at the same time it could be so veffani answered there are threats that if we fight the united states the notempire called the soviet union will join in on the side of their fellow big uglies that might almost be for the best felless said once we have smashed them both tosev will be ours without possibility of dispute truth the ambassador to france said truth to a point at any rate the question remaining is how much damage can the big uglies do us while we are smashing them estimates are that each of these notempires could by itself hurt us at least as badly as the deutsche did if they fight us together they may be able to do a good deal more than that because we would not be able to concentrate all our military strength against either one of them oh felless stretched out the word however much she wished it didnt that made good logical sense but a new question occurred to her why should i cut short my holiday to return to france will i not be in at least as much danger there as i am here veffani made the negative gesture i do not think so senior researcher australia is part of the territory the race rules and so is a legitimate target for both the usa and the sssr as it was for the reich but france is an independent tosevite notempire by the rules of war on tosev it is not a fair target for them unless it declares itself to be at war against them the government of the francais shows no willingness to do this they are ungrateful after we regained for them the independence they had lost to the deutsche felless asked indignantly they are the most cynical beings i have ever known veffani replied they know we did not free them from the deutsche for their benefit but for our own and our efforts to use big uglies as soldiers against other big uglies have been far less successful than we would have wished let them be independent let them be neutral let their notempire be a safe haven it was not during the fight against the deutsche well that is a truth felless said and then tell me superior sir what is the cause of the latest crisis with the notempire of the united states i thought that except for such peculiarities as snoutcounting it was relatively civilized i know the answer to your question senior researcher but security forbids me from telling you veffani replied negotiations with the usa are still in progress there is some hope that this war may be prevented that will be more difficult if reasons for the crisis become too widely known even we are not immune from being forced to actions we might otherwise not take but will the big uglies of the usa not bellow these reasons to the sky felless asked that notempire is notorious for telling everything that should stay secret not always veffani said the american big uglies concealed the launch of their spaceship to the belt of minor planets in this solar system very well and they have more reason to conceal this believe me they do he used an emphatic cough they would not bellow unless they wanted a war with us in the next instant i am not sure i understand superior sir felless said an understatement because she was annoyed veffani wouldnt trust her with whatever secret he knew but i shall obey and shall arrange to return to marseille as soon as i can you are wise to do so veffani told her now you colonists are beginning to get some notion of the delights we of the conquest fleet faced when we first came to tosev for you though these delights are less a surprise he broke the connection before felless could tell him how utterly mistaken he was everything about tosev had been a horrible surprise to the males and females of the colonization fleet felless remembered waking from cold sleep weightless in orbit around what shed thought would be the new world of the empire to be informed that nothing shed believed on setting out from home was true will go back to marseille she though will go back to marseille after i enjoy myself one more time here she still had more ginger in her luggage than she knew what to do with no that wasnt true she knew exactly what to do with it she set out to taste as much as she could in one day normally a gingertaster rode from exhilaration to depression and back again intent on tasting all she could felless didnt wait for one taste to wear off before enjoying another she stayed strung as tight as the herb would make her when a female she telephoned to arrange an early return to france pointed out a couple of difficulties in her revised schedule felless screamed insults the other female said there is no reason to snap my snout off but felless began she seemed to have the races entire aircraft schedule at the tips of her fingerclaws but when she tried to access the information with the thinking part of her mind she discovered she couldnt yes ginger makes you believe you are smart she reminded herself it does not really make you smarter or not very much it also made her far more vulnerable to frustration than she would have been otherwise here the female proposed another schedule will this do felless examined it yes she said and the other female with every sign of relief vanished from her screen felless took another taste she wasnt sure the departure time would be late enough to let her stop producing pheromones by then with so much ginger coursing through her she didnt care she cared the following day for one thing the depression that followed her binge was the worst shed ever known for another she hadnt stopped pumping out pheromones she mated in the hotel lobby in the motorcar that took her to the airfield and in the terminal waiting to board the aircraft a good holiday the last male said with an emphatic cough and felless answered truth the pleasure of mating was different from that of the herb but it was enough to lift her partway out of the shadows in which shed walked since taking her tongue out of the ginger vial she wondered if she would lay a clutch of eggs if i do i do she thought and then but if i do veffani had better not find out about it the ambassador would not be pleased he might even be angry enough to send her back to the reich fortunately she was able to board the aircraft without stirring up a commotion that could have been dangerous especially if the flight crew had males in it but her fellow passengers paid her no special heed she settled down for the long dull flight to cairo where she would board another aircraft for the return to marseille not so bad she thought she wished the holiday had been longer that would have let her taste more but shed made up for a lot of lost time even so maybe she really was ready to get back to work liu han and liu mei sat side by side in an insanely crowded secondclass car as the train of which it was a part rattled north children squealed babies screamed chickens squawked ducks quacked dogs likelier headed for the stew pot than for the easy life of a pet yelped several young porkers made noises even more appalling than those that came from the human infants the smells were as bad as the racket can we get any fresh air liu mei asked her mother i dont know liu han answered ill try she was sitting by the window she had to use all her strength to get it to rise even a little when it did she wasnt sure she was glad it had the engine was an ancient coalburner and soot started pouring in as the stinks poured out liu mei got a cinder in the eye and rubbed frantically once shed managed to get rid of it she said maybe you ought to close that again ill try liu han repeated she had no luck this time what had gone up refused to come down she sighed we knew this trip wouldnt be any fun when we set out on it we were right too liu mei coughed several people had lit up cigarettes and pipes so they wouldnt have to pay quite so much attention to the pungent atmosphere they were breathing their smoke made the air that much thicker for everyone else one of the babies in the earn or possibly one of the dogs had an unfortunate accident liu han sighed i wouldnt have enjoyed walking back to peking but im not enjoying this either you at least youre going home liu mei leaned toward liu han so she could speak into her ear were going back to begin the revolutionary struggle again the struggle is our home well so it is liu han glanced over at her daughter liu mei could think of the struggle as home she was young liu han was getting close to fifty trapped in this hot smelly packed car she felt every one of her years there were times when she wished she could settle down somewhere quiet and forget about the revolution she generally got over that once shed had a chance to rest for a while but she found it happening more and more often these days the dialectic said the proletarian revolution would succeed for many years that had kept liu han and her comrades working to overthrow the imperialist little scaly devils despite all the defeats theyd suffered it had kept them confident of victory too but now the dialectic made liu han thoughtful in a different way if the revolution would inevitably succeed wouldnt it succeed just as inevitably without her she didnt say anything like that to liu mei she knew it would have horrified her daughter and she supposed that once she got to peking the fire of revolutionary fervor would begin to burn in her own bosom once more it always had still there were times when she felt very tired im getting old she thought her skin was still firm and her hair had only a few threads of silver in it but chinese showed their age less readily than roundeyed devils did shed seen that on her visit to the united states but whether she showed her age or not she felt it this miserable car made everyone feel her age and twenty years older besides brakes squealing the train stopped in a small town a few people left her car more tried to crowd on nobody wanted to make room for anybody else men and women pushed and shouted and cursed liu han had ridden enough trains to know things were always like that hawkers elbowed their ways through the cars selling rice and vegetables and fruit juice and tea they didnt do a whole lot of business most people had the sense to bring their own supplies with them liu han and liu mei certainly had only the naive few riding a train for the first time gave the hawkers any trade a conductor came through too screaming for the hawkers to get off or buy a ticket they were going to get moving the hawkers laughed and jeered they knew to the second when the train would really set out and they also knew the conductors always tried to get rid of them early the last one leaped off just as the train started to roll he stuck out his tongue in derision thatll cost him extra squeeze the next time this train crew comes through here liu han predicted youre probably right her daughter replied but he assented his freedom even so in his small way he is a revolutionary he was more likely to be a badtempered fool but liu han didnt argue with liu mei instead she wrestled with the window again she had no luck it was stuck and looked as if it would stay stuck the smoke that poured in was thick and black because the train wasnt going fast enough to dissipate it liu han coughed and cursed people nearby were coughing too and cursing her things got better as the train picked up speed but they never got very good as far as liu han could tell not very good was about as good as rail travel ever got in china and then less then half an hour later the train slowed to a stop again not at a station but in the middle of the countryside now what a woman behind liu han demanded indignantly have we broken down three or four people asked the same question at the same time of course weve broken down liu han murmured to liu mei the little scaly devils dont care whether trains work well or even if they work at all so they dont bother keeping them up but for once this wasnt something she could blame on the scaly devils a conductor poked his head into the car and shouted we cant go on because bandits have blown up the tracks ahead of us we are going to be here for a while we may have to go back and find a way around the damage that set people yelling and screaming at him and at one another he just kept repeating what hed said the first time most of the unhappy passengers cursed the bandits up one side and down the other people would curse anything that made them late liu mei asked do you suppose the peoples liberation army sabotaged the track it could be liu han said not everyone will have known we were on this train but it could have been the kuomintang too no way to tell the sun beat down on the car because it was standing still it got hotter and hotter people started opening more windows some wouldnt open at all people started breaking them that brought in an angry conductor but he had to flee in the face of the passengers wrath whoever it was probably wanted to make the train derail liu han said that would really have done damage it would have done damage to us she thought derailing trains was a favorite game of the peoples liberation army and of the kuomintang as well it taught people that the rule of the little scaly devils remained insecure it also caused a lot of casualties she and liu mei could have been among them as easily as not and of course a machinegun crew might have been waiting to shoot up the train once it derailed liu han thought that was another game both the peoples liberation army and the kuomintang played so did independent bandit outfits who kept themselves in business by robbery but no one started shooting here after what seemed like forever the train began to inch backwards because it was going in reverse the smoke from the engines stack blew away from the passenger cars not into them the breeze the slow motion stirred up wasnt very strong but it was ever so much better than nothing sweat began to dry on liu hans face she took off her conical straw hat and fanned herself with it people all over the car were doing the same thing they started smiling at one another a couple of babies and a couple of dogs stopped howling it was as pleasant a time on a train as liu han had ever known the train rolled back over a switch then it stopped presumably so a couple of men from the engine could get down and use crowbars to shift the switch and let the train go down the other track after that the train started going forward again and swung onto the route it hadnt used before with the exhaust now blowing back once more the car filled with coal smoke since the passengers had broken a good many windows they couldnt do anything about it the conductor laughed at them you see you stupid turtles its your own fault he said somebody threw a squishy plum at him and hit him right in the face juice dribbled down the brassbuttoned front of his uniform he let out a horrified squawk and retreated in disorder everyone cheered but then somebody not far from liu han said since were going up a track were not supposed to i hope theres no train coming down it toward us that produced exclamations of horror eee liu han said may ten thousand little demons dance in your drawers for even thinking such a thing no train slammed headon into theirs no stretch of tracks on the new line had been blown up thoroughgoing guerrillas often did such things which caused more than double the delay and aggravation of a single strike on the receiving end for once liu han was glad these raiders hadnt been thorough her train was scheduled to get into peking in the early evening even at the best of times even under the little devils railroad schedules in china were more optimistic guesses than statements of fact when things went wrong trying to sleep sitting up on a hard seat with the air full of smoke and other stinks and noise was a daunting prospect liu han thought she dozed a little but she wasnt sure she was sure she watched the sun rise over the farmlands to the east a couple of hours before the train did at last roll into the railroad yard in the southwestern part of peking it took more time crawling up to the station itself liu han minded that less it let her look around the city liu mei was doing the same thing we fought them hard we fought them with everything we had she said and pride rang in her voice so we did liu han agreed wrecked buildings outnumbered those still intact laborers carrying buckets on shoulder poles were everywhere hauling away rubble liu han sighed fighting hard is important but only up to a point more important even so much more important is winning the little scaly devils had won this fight and taken peking back for their own liu han found fresh proof of that at the station along with the other passengers she and her daughter had to walk through a machine that could tell if they were carrying weapons they werent and had no trouble someone else in the car was chinese police running dogs to the imperialist scaly devils hustled him away liu han and liu mei walked out of the station and into the city home liu mei said and liu han had to nod though atvar had promised him his freedom straha found himself more nearly a prisoner in cairo than he had been in los angeles is this how you reward me he asked one of his interrogators a female named zeshpass i hoped to return to the society of the race not to be closed off from it forever and so you will superior sir zeshpass said soothingly but straha was not soothed back in the usa even the big uglies who exploited him had called him shiplord whatever he was here he wasnt a shiplord and he never would be again zeshpass went on as soon as the crisis is resolved a final disposition of your situation will be made that sounded soothing too till straha turned an eye turret toward it what did you just say he demanded whatever it was it did not mean anything of course it did zeshpass sounded irate like any interrogator she took her own omniscience for granted and resented it when others failed to do likewise all right then straha said suppose you explain to me why my case cannot be disposed of now most reluctantly the female said i do not have that information straha laughed at her i do atvar has not yet figured out what to do with me because he has not yet decided whether i am a hero or a nuisance or both at once my opinion is that i am both at once which is bound to make me more annoying to the exalted fleetlord as he was in the habit of doing he laced atvars title with as much scorn as he could her voice stiff with disapproval zeshpass said it is not for me to judge the exalted fleetlords reasons it is not for you either and if no one judges him how will anyone know when he makes a mistake straha inquired he has made enough of them already in my not so humble opinion how is he to be held accountable for them held accountable he is the fleetlord zeshpass sounded as if straha had suddenly started speaking english rather than the language of the race plainly the idea that the fleetlord like any other mortal needed to be questioned and criticized when he made a mistake had never crossed her mind do you know what has happened to you straha asked himself and he did know you have become a snoutcounter at least in part living among the american big uglies for so long has rubbed off on you of course hed had a low opinion of atvars abilities even before fleeing to the united states if he hadnt had a low opinion of atvars ability if he hadnt tried to take command himself he wouldnt have had to flee to the usa but years spent in a land that institutionalized snoutcounting and made it work had left him even less respectful of the races institutions than hed expected we are a stodgy lot he thought discontentedly he may be the fleetlord straha said aloud but he is not the emperor that is a truth zeshpass admitted casting down her eye turrets straha had to remind himself to do the same thing he hadnt realized how far his habits had slipped in exile till he returned to the society of the race zeshpass continued in fact reffet the fleetlord of the colonization fleet has had frequent disagreements with fleetlord atvar i believe that strahas voice was dry as far as he was concerned anyone who didnt disagree with atvar had to have something wrong with him what sort of things have they disagreed about do you happen to know given the chance to gossip zeshpass didnt notice shed gone from interrogator to interrogated i certainly do she said if you can imagine it atvar has proposed to levy soldiers from among the males and females of the colonization fleet to create what would be in effect a permanent soldiers time on tosev has he straha said that struck him as only common sense even atvar however much the returned renegade hated to admit it wasnt stupid all the time he sounded even more thoughtful as he asked and reffet disapproves of this of course he does zeshpass answered we came here to colonize this world not to fight over it i understand that straha said but if the big uglies continue to be ready to fight against us what shall we do once the males of the conquest fleet begin to grow old and die that plainly hadnt occurred to zeshpass after some thought she said i suppose we shall have to finish the conquest before that happens this hatching conflict with the united states gives us the opportunity to take a long stride in that direction truth but only to a point straha said even in lands we have supposedly conquered rebellion continues that must be one of the reasons you refuse to allow me to go out into cairo and see for myself what sort of society the race is building you have also spoken truth superior sir but only to a point zeshpass replied the big uglies under our rule get arms and encouragement from the independent tosevite notempires if there were no more independent notempires how could they continue the struggle against us it was a good question straha could not answer it not at once after some thought of his own he replied that is a possibility i suppose but given what we of the conquest fleet have seen of tosevite stubbornness and perversity i believe it is folly to assume all resistance will die within a generation we shall consider your opinions of course zeshpass said but we are under no obligation to do anything more than consider them i understand that straha sighed by my own actions i made certain i would never again help form the races policy here on tosev he sounded resigned even humble he didnt feel humble or anything close to it he remained convinced he could have done a better job with the conquest fleet than atvar had and if reffet couldnt see the need for soldiers from the colonization fleet he was just another male with fancy body paint and with sand between his eye turrets straha crossed the first and second fingers of his right hand a gesture american big uglies sometimes used when they said something they didnt mean that gesture meant nothing to zeshpass of course to zeshpass big uglies were nuisances annoyances no more despite the war with the deutsche she didnt fully seem to grasp how dangerous they could be and therefore how important they were to study that gesture also summarized strahas feelings about his return to the race the meeker and milder he seemed the sooner his interrogators and those who did lead the race these days would let him get on with his life so he hoped anyhow but zeshpass though naive about tosevites was by no means foolish about matters that had to do with the race she said when you delivered your information superior sir that act helped form our policy i suppose it did straha admitted but that was not why i did it as i have said before i did it because my friend sam yeager had asked me to do it friendship with a big ugly counting for more than policy concerns of the race zeshpass said surely your priorities became distorted during your long years of exile i disagree straha used the negative gesture and added an emphatic cough sam yeager did a great deal for me while i was in exile the actions of the leadership of the race were what drove me into exile naturally yeagers wishes and his wellbeing were and are important to me i shall make a note of that zeshpass said with the air of a magistrate passing sentence on a criminal straha realized hed been too vehement too outspoken too opinionated so much for meek and mild he thought now more like a hunting beast than a confidante zeshpass returned to the questioning so you believe it was legitimate for you to hatch friendships among the big uglies yes i do straha answered of course i do you addled egg after all i believed i would live among them the rest of my life maybe he could steer his way back toward meek and mild after all zeshpass wasnt about to make things easy for him voice sharp as filed fingerclaws she demanded it was for this reason then that you put your individual concerns and the concerns of this big ugly friend of yours above those of the race as a whole the species of my friend is not relevant straha said pushing her away from the major accusation and toward something smaller rabotevs and hallessi are citizens of the empire no less than males and females of the race if the conquest here succeeds in the end the same will be true of big uglies that may well be a truth zeshpass admitted what she plainly would sooner have denied she had to admit it equality of species under the law and in the afterlife was a cornerstone of the empire she tried to rally you said nothing i notice about your rampant and unwarranted individualism there was the dangerous charge especially from the viewpoint of members of the colonization fleet straha said have you noticed that the males of the conquest fleet show more individualism than would have been common back on home i have zeshpass answered everyone from the colonization fleet has noticed this no one from the colonization fleet approves our view is that the males of the colonization fleet have been contaminated by the bizarre ideologies of the tosevites we have done what we needed to do to survive and flourish on a world of individualism run wild straha said that is the races view of course to the big uglies we are hopeless reactionaries i do not see why the views of the local barbarians should carry any special weight zeshpass said primly do you not straha said i would think the answer fairly obvious and shown by the recent war with the deutsche if it was not adequately obvious without that demonstration what the big uglies think about us matters because they can hurt us they can hurt us badly why do you have so much trouble believing that zeshpass said this is not the way things were to be when we got to tosev this is not the way we were told things would be when we got to tosev but this is the way things are straha said if you cannot see that if you cannot adapt to that the colonization effort will face severe difficulties we are the race zeshpass said we shall prevail we have always prevailed we can do it again we can certainly straha agreed whether or not we shall that is a different question if we act as if our triumph is guaranteed that only makes it more difficult the tosevites present the most severe challenge we have ever faced turning our eye turrets away from that challenge acting as if it does not exist will make things worse not better you may be sure the american big uglies whom i know best do not believe their triumph is guaranteed as a result they work unceasingly to subvert us working is one thing succeeding is another zeshpass said i submit to you superior sir that your view of these matters is colored by your having lived among the american tosevites for so long and i submit to you that your view is colored by not having lived among any big uglies and by your ignorance of them straha retorted they glared at each other in perfect mutual loathing time will tell which of us is correct zeshpass said and straha made the affirmative gesture it was some time after midnight when the guard named fred shook sam yeager awake come on pal he said when yeager showed signs of returning to the real world you sleep like a rock shows youve got a clean conscience i wish to god i did believe me sam yawned and rubbed his eyes around the yawn he asked whats going on that wont keep till morning he sounded mushy without his false teeth somebody wants to see you fred answered come on yeah yeager tensed wishing he hadnt made that sound quite so dubious whod want to see him in the middle of the night were the guards waking him up so they could dispose of him more conveniently fred might have read his mind dont do anything stupid yeager he said and his appeared as if by magic in his right hand if i wanted to ice you i could blow your brains out without bothering to wake you up right no fuss no muss no bother but i wasnt blowing smoke up your ass somebody wants to see you and hes waiting in the living room yeager sniffed the odor of freshperked coffee wafted in from the kitchen as much as freds words that convinced him the guard was telling the truth he put in his dentures and slid out of bed asking who is it and can i get out of my pajamas first dont bother about the pjs fred answered as for who come on out front and see for yourself okay sam sighed whoever was out there would be in a uniform or maybe a business suit facing him in blueandwhite striped cotton pajamas would only put yeager at a disadvantage well he was at a big enough disadvantage already his feet slid into slippers lets go attaboy fred made the pistol vanish as smoothly as hed brought it out up the hall yeager went when he walked into the living room he wasnt surprised to see john and charlie already there with them stood another couple of men he hadnt seen before they wore nearly identical offtherack suits and they both looked jumpy and alert despite the hour sam noticed that much about them but nothing more for his eyes went to the man in the rocking chair by the far wall despite pajamas he wanted to come to attention he didnt not quite instead he nodded and spoke as casually as he could hello mr president earl warren returned the nod hello lieutenant colonel yeager he replied officially ill have you know this conversation is not taking place officially im somewhere else you dont need to know where and sound asleep i wish i were he glanced over to one of the strangers in a suit elliott why dont you get yeager here a cup of coffee i expect he could use one i know im glad to have mine sure said the secret service man or so sam assumed him to be you take cream and sugar lieutenant colonel both please about a teaspoon of sugar yeager answered for all the world as if this were an utterly normal conversation elliott went off to the kitchen sit down lieutenant colonel if you please president warren said and sam saw that all the guards had left the armchair across the room from the rocker for him the only reason they were there was to make sure he didnt strangle the president hed asked to see warren not really expecting anyone would pay any attention to him but now warren was here elliott brought him the coffee not a drop had slopped from cup into saucer the secret service man had steady hands thanks sam told him and got a curt nod in return he sipped the coffee it was hot and strong and good president warren let him drink about a third of the cup then said shall we get down to brass tacks okay by me yeager pointed to fred and charlie and john but these fellows have said they dont want to know why theyve been keeping me here should they listen in his guards and the secret service men put their heads together then to his surprise the fellows whod ridden herd on him trooped out of the living room and out of the house he heard the door close behind them president warren said i think jim and elliott should be able to keep me safe yeager nodded they were bound to be armed even if they werent either one of them could have broken him in half with a sigh the president asked well lieutenant colonel whats on your mind sam took another sip of coffee before answering he took a deep breath too now that he had to bring them out the words wanted to stick in his throat he wished the coffee were fortified with something stronger than cream and sugar but he said what he had to say sir why did you order the attack on the colonization fleet both secret service men started elliott muttered something under his breath he and the one named jim stared at the president earl warren sighed again the classic answer is it seemed like a good idea at the time and it did seem like a good idea it was the hardest blow humans have even struck against the race and the lizards never really suspected the united states no one did except you lieutenant colonel are you happy to realize that by being right you may have brought your country down in flames that made sam take another deep anything but happy breath mr president i decided a long time ago that whoever launched missiles at the colonization fleet was a murderer he answered i swear to god i thought it was the nazis or the reds i never imagined the trail would lead back to us but you kept looking didnt you president warren said you couldnt take a hint you just kept poking your nose where it didnt belong a hint sir yeager said in real puzzlement what kind of hint warren sighed again wouldnt you say that the unfortunate things that kept almost happening to you and your family that would have happened if youd been less on your guard were a hint that you were digging in places you shouldnt be we even tried to pass that message to you first through general lemay and then through strahas driver general lemay was only talking about the lewis and clarksam said and i didnt know just what strahas driver was talking about not till i found out what had happened to the colonization fleet anyway and by then it was too late it may be too late for all of us the president said heavily what on earth possessed you to give straha a printout of what youd found when i did find it mr president all of a sudden i understood why id been having all the trouble id been having yeager answered i thought of straha as a lifeinsurance policy if anything happened to me or to my kin the word would still get out i guess it has oh it has all right earl warren glared at him that damned lizard sneaked out of the usa and into cairo and by every sign those documents got there ahead of him and atvar has been threatening war against the united states ever since that is a war you must know we would lose yes sir i do know that sam said ive known it all along i thought you did too the lizards have always said theyd do something dreadful if they ever found out who hit the colonization fleet i figured germany or russia would deserve it i have trouble thinking we dont im sorry sir but thats how it looks to me do you know what one of the races principal demands has been the president asked with an angry toss of the head no sir i have no idea sam replied i havent seen much in the way of news lately is my family all right they could have held him and done god knows what to barbara and jonathan the guards had said they hadnt but still doing that would screw up the experiment with mickey and donald but they probably wouldnt care theyd figure keeping a secret was more important but now president warren nodded your wife and son are fine you have my word on it yeager had always thought his word good now he knew it wasnt or wasnt necessarily before he could do more than realize that warren went on the lizards are insisting that you be released unharmed and that no harm befall your kin it is a condition we intend to meet god bless straha sam thought he lived among big uglies so long he got some notion of how important family members are to us and thank heaven he managed to get that across to the lizards in cairo aloud he made his voice harsh is that the reason im still breathing and my wife and son it is one of the reasons warren answered yeager gave the president reluctant credit for not flinching from the question it is also the only condition we find easy to meet the race is demanding that we either let them incinerate one of our cities with an explosivemetal bomb or make concessions to them that would permanently weaken us not quite to the degree the reich has been diminished but something not far from that yeager winced sure enough the lizards hadnt been kidding and if you tell them no on both those counts its war that is about the size of it lieutenant colonel yeager the president said we have you to thank for it but yeager shook his head no sir you were the one who ordered the launch the race would have found out sooner or later and theyd have been just as furious a hundred years from now as they are right this minute we would be in a stronger position to fight back a hundred years from now warren said maybe sam said but maybe not too who knows whatll be heading this way from home now that the lizards know were not pushovers at any rate we have to deal with what is happening now the president said which is to say with what youve wrought the russians may stand with us the thought that they might has given the lizards pause would they sam knew he sounded surprised after a little thought though it seemed less implausible if we go down they know theyre next and they havent got a prayer of fighting off the lizards by themselves he didnt think the usa and the ussr together could beat the race but theyd sure as hell let the lizards know theyd been in a fight president warrens big head soberly went up and down i believe that is molotovs reasoning yes although you never can tell with russians in all his days sam yeager had never imagined he would sit in judgment on a president of the united states his voice hardly more than a whisper he asked what will you do sir what i have to do earl warren answered what seems best for the united states and for all of humanity thats what ive been doing all along what was intended as a smile lifted only one corner of his mouth thanks to you it didnt work out quite the way i expected sam let out a long sigh no sir i guess not he started to add im sorry but that didnt pass his lips part of him was but a much bigger part wasnt president warren said i shall of course arrange for your release i would be grateful for your public silence and that of any loved ones you may have informed until the present crisis ends i am not going to order it but i would be grateful for it how will i know when that is sam asked the president looked at him looked through him believe me lieutenant colonel you will not be left in any doubt pshing came up to atvar and said exalted fleetlord the ambassador from the notempire of the united states is here to see you atvar made the affirmative gesture i will see him show him in no wait first bring in a chair suitable for a tosevites hindquarters i do not intend to insult him in any trivial way it shall be done exalted fleetlord pshing hurried off he brought in first the chair and then the big ugly named henry cabot lodge i greet you exalted fleetlord the ambassador said and i greet you atvar replied you may sit as far as he was concerned the wild tosevite didnt really deserve the privilege but the fleetlord had grown used to diplomatic niceties since the first round of fighting stopped the usa and the race were theoretically equals and were not at war not yet not offering lodge a chair would have been an insult a small one but an insult nonetheless no atvar did not intend to offer the united states any small insults i am here exalted fleetlord among other reasons to bring you the apology of the government of the united states for the unfortunate incident involving the colonization fleet lodge said i am here to tell you ambassador that no apology is adequate atvar replied no apology can be adequate i am here to tell you that the race will have compensation for what the united states did henry cabot lodges graymaned head bobbed up and down the tosevite equivalent of the affirmative gesture i am prepared to negotiate such compensation if you truly require it if we truly require it atvar sprang to his feet his mouth opened not in a laugh but in a way that suggested his ancestors had been carnivores he held out his hand so his fingerclaws were ready to tear had he been standing erect instead of leaning forward had his crest risen he would have looked ready to fight a mating battle we have said from the moment this outrage occurred that we would require it once we learned who the guilty party was you may be grateful that we have not already embarked on war without limits in the abstract he had to admire the american ambassador the big ugly sat there as calmly as if he hadnt embarked on his tirade when he finished lodge said one reason you have not of course is that we could hunt you badly if you did if the russians join us and we are no more certain about that than you the damage to the race and the lands it rules will be even greater he was all the more infuriating partly because he stayed calm partly because he was without a doubt correct but atvar would not admit that no matter how obvious it was he said regardless of what you can do to us we can do far more to you that was also a manifest truth and we shall to avenge the murder of males and females in cold sleep before they ever had the chance to come down to the surface of tosev unless i can negotiate some other solution that would satisfy you and my government at the same time lodge said you know what our demands are atvar made his voice hard as stone hoping the big ugly would grasp his tone return of the lewis and clark and the new ship from their present location among the minor planets no further expeditions to those planets american orbital forts to have their explosivemetal weapons removed to prevent further unprovoked attacks american groundbased missiles to be reduced in number american submersibleshipbased missiles to be eliminated the races inspectors to go where they please when they please in the united states to make certain these terms are carried out no henry cabot lodge said my instructions are specific on that point these terms are unacceptable to the united states president warren has not given me permission to deal with them even hypothetically you also know the other alternative atvar said to let one of your cities be incinerated as our colonists were incinerated no the american ambassador said again that is also unacceptable when the weak propose something the strong may say it is unacceptable atvar told him when the strong propose something the weak may say only it shall be done who here is strong who is weak i suggest you think carefully on this ambassador if you reject both these demands we shall have war regardless of the damage it may do us it will destroy you do you understand i understand exalted fleetlord lodge said still calmly then i dismiss you atvar said you had better make sure that your notemperor understands unless he complies with the races just demands and they are just demands without the tiniest fragment of doubt we shall visit ruination on his notempire henry cabot lodge rose and bent at the waist not the posture of respect but about as close to it as wild big uglies came i shall convey your words to president warren shall we meet again in two days time atvar glared at him you are using this delay to increase your armed forces readiness to resist us no exalted fleetlord lodge shook his head we have been at maximum readiness for some time the only way we could be more ready would be to start the fight ourselves that i assure you we do not intend to do of course not atvar snarled we would be ready if you did you could not strike a stealthy blow this time lodge bowed again and departed without another word that left the fleetlord feeling vaguely punctured as soon as the tosevite had left pshing came into the office any progress exalted fleetlord he asked none atvar made the negative gesture none whatsoever he sighed we shall be fortunate to avoid another war and this one far worse than that which we fought against the deutsche the american big uglies refuse to give up their clawhold on space and they also naturally refuse to yield up a city to our wrath did you expect them to yield one pshing asked no atvar answered i intended to use that threat to get them out of space and to reduce their weaponry which would let us dominate them henceforward even if they stay nominally independent but they plainly perceive the longterm danger in that course of events if they refuse us however the danger is not longterm but shortterm his telephone hissed pshing hurried out to answer it in the antechamber a moment later he called exalted fleetlord it is fleetlord reffet atvar wanted to speak to the leader of the colonization fleet about as much as he wanted to have an ingrown toeclaw cut free without local anesthetic but realized he had no choice with another sigh he said put him through reffet looked angry that was atvars first thought when he saw his opposite number from the colonization fleet reffet sounded angry too well has that cursed big ugly caved in to our demands yet unfortunately no atvar answered all right then reffet said we just have to blow his stinking notempire stupid name for a piece of land if anybody wants to know what think clean off the surface of tosev those tosevites deserve whatever happens to them after what they did to us a bite in the back that is what it was nothing but a miserable treacherous bite in the back truth atvar agreed if we fight them now however they will without a doubt bite us in the front several times their notempire is far larger and is also more populous than that of the deutsche their military preparedness is not to be despised and if we get heavily involved in fighting them the russkis may indeed bite us in the back and whose fault is that the question from the fleetlord of the colonization fleet was rhetorical he was convinced he knew whose fault it was atvars and no one elses with a sigh how many times had he sighed on or in orbit around tosev atvar answered if you must blame anyone blame the planners who sent a probe to this miserable world sixteen hundred years ago and assumed it would not change in the meanwhile a probe a hundred years before we set out would have warned us and saved us much grief i have already recommended that this be made standard practice in planning any future conquest fleets wonderful reffet said this does us exactly no good now of course i agree atvar said have you any constructive suggestions to make or did you call just to complain at everything i am doing the fleetlord of the colonization fleet glared at him i have already made my suggestion punish these big uglies with every means at our disposal i asked you for constructive suggestions atvar replied that is a destructive suggestion how destructive it turns out to be we will know only after the fighting ends he held up a hand before reffet could speak you will tell me it is more destructive to the big uglies again i agree it had better be anyway but it will hurt us too however much you may wish to scratch sand over it that also remains a truth reffet hissed in frustrated fury will you let these tosevites get off without punishment for their crime then by no means atvar used an emphatic cough i am trying to arrange a punishment for them that will not involve damage to the race if i can do that well and good if i cannot i will take whatever other steps i deem necessary you had better reffet said if you fail here the effort to depose you that straha led will look like a hatchlings game atvar supposed he shouldnt have been surprised at a threat like that somehow he still was having gone through such humiliation once did he really want to face it a second time did he have any choice if he did botch this negotiation with the americans wouldnt he deserve to be overthrown he said i hear you reffet since you admit you have nothing constructive to contribute i bid you good day i admit nothing of the reffet began atvar took savage pleasure in breaking the connection and cutting him off in midsquawk after that he had to deal with minutiae the eternal rebellion in china the equally eternal rebellion in india a new outbreak in the subregion of the southern part of the lessen continental mass called argentina all of those would eventually be solved and none of them even unsolved was more than a nuisance to the race atvar issued directives confident that regardless of whether they were right or wrong the world would go on he had margin for error he had none with the american big uglies and he knew it he had to keep the pressure on them and had to do so in such a way that he resisted the pressure from his own extremists two days later as promised henry cabot lodge returned to his office i have a proposal for you from president warren lodge said and set it forth when hed finished atvar said are you certain you understood him correctly is he certain of what he is doing yes and yes respectively lodge replied he requests one additional item personal foreknowledge not much but a little of the precise timing your intelligence resources will be able to make sure that the united states does not use this for any untoward purpose i had not expected atvar began lodge cut him off does this proposal meet with your approval or not if not i see no way to avoid war atvar had never imagined that a big ugly could squeeze him but he felt squeezed now he stared at lodge the tosevite kept his face very still his impression after pondering was the same as it had been at first scent he would never get a better offer from the americans his left hand shaped the affirmative gesture i accept he said jonathan yeager had never been so glad to sit on the couch in his own front room watching a baseball game having his father sitting there beside him made all the difference in the world sam yeager had his legs crossed he took a swig from a bottle of lucky lager then returned it to its resting place on top of his upper knee it stayed there quite happily the hollow in the bottom of the bottle fit the curve of his knee very well whenever jonathan tried such things he spilled beer or soda on his pants the kansas city batter lashed a double to the gap in leftcenter two runners scored that makes the score blues as the yankees bullpen lets them down again buddy blattner shouted from the set they overthrew the cutoff man jonathans dad said if they hadnt the yankees might have nailed mantle as he rounded second he was thinking triple but he had to put on the brakes barbara yeager said you pick apart ballgames the way i was trained to analyze literature why not jonathans dad said was trained to hit the cutoff man on a throw from the outfield no matter what i didnt have the talent to make the big leagues especially after i tore up my ankle but i always knew what i was doing out there before anybody could say anything more the baseball game disappeared from the tv screen to be replaced by a slide with the words urgent news bulletin whats this jonathan said chet huntleys long somber face replaced the slide it looked even longer and more somber than usual in an assault apparently launched without any warning to us authorities the race has detonated a large explosivemetal bomb above indianapolis indiana he said casualties obviously are as yet unknown but they must be in the tens if not in the hundreds of thousands as the picture cut away from huntley to show a toadstool cloud rising above some city or other it might have been indianapolis or it might have been stock footage jonathan and his parents all said the same thing at the same time oh jesus christ theyve paid us back sam yeager added it was this or get out of space forever and turn oven most of our weapons those were the terms atvar set i didnt think wed do it this way though he emptied his beer in a couple of long convulsive gulps chet huntley reappeared but only to say now were going to eric sevareid in little rock for the administrations response to this unprovoked attack it wasnt unprovoked as jonathan knew only too well and when sevareid came onto the screen his face normally as dead a pan as any newsmans was wet with tears he said ladies and gentlemen president earl warren has just been found dead in a gray house bedroom he appears to have died by his own hand again jonathan and his father and mother said the same thing at the same time oh my god eric sevareid said the presidential press secretary has before him a statement that he will read to the nation we will also be hearing from vice president excuse me from president harold stassen as soon as he can be found and informed of the dual tragedies of the day the vice president excuse me again the president that w take some getting used to is on a fishing trip in his home state of minnesota and now mr hagerty the camera cut away from sevareid and over to the briefing room of the gray house james hagerty blinked under the bright lights he licked his lips a couple of times then said as what seems to have been his final living act president warren wrote by hand the statement i have before me he set it where it would surely be found when he was sought after the destruction of indianapolis he was by that time unfortunately deceased these are then the last words of the president of the united states i never thought hed do this sam yeager said jonathan and his mother both hissed for him to be quiet my fellow citizens by the time you hear these words i will be dead james hagerty read the demands the race has made upon the united states of america have left me in a position where i could not in good conscience accept either of them but where rejecting them would have resulted in the destruction of our great nation hagerty blinked and licked his lips again hes getting all this for the first time too jonathan realized poor bastard the press secretary went on and yet there was justice in the races demands upon us for it was at my order that rocket forces of the united states launched explosivemetaltipped missiles against twelve ships of the colonization fleet not long after it took up earth orbit i and no one else am responsible for that order i still believe it was in the best interest of mankind as a whole but now my role has been discovered and my country and i must pay the price jonathans father cursed and grimaced jonathans mother patted him on the shoulder jonathan himself hardly noticed he was staring transfixed at the television screen fleetlord atvar presented us with a dreadful choice earl warrens press secretary read either withdrawal of our weapons and installations from space and the great reduction of our ground and seabased weapons systems essentially the loss of our independence or the destruction of a great american city eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot if neither of those then war war we could not hope to win hagerty paused to wipe his eyes on the sleeve of his jacket excuse me he said to the millions watching then he resumed i could not i would not sacrifice our future by reducing our installations as the race demanded and i could not lead us into a war where however much we might hurt the foe the united states would surely suffer the fate of the greater german reich that left me with no choice but to sacrifice indianapolis to the vengeance of the race jesus jonathan muttered he wondered what he would have done in warrens shoes the devil and the deep blue sea having made that decision the press secretary continued i also decided that i could not live when the men women and children i had sacrificed were dead i hope i may find forgiveness in the hearts of the living and in the sight of god farewell and may god bless the united states of america james hagerty looked up from the podium as if about to add a few words of his own then he shook his head his eyes overflowed with tears again fighting back a sob he hurried away the camera lingered on the empty podium as if unsure where else to go are you all right dear jonathans mother asked his father for a moment jonathan had no idea what she meant but then he saw that if the blood of the people of indianapolis was on earl warrens hands it was also on the hands of his dad if the lizards hadnt found out whod attacked the colonization fleet they wouldnt have destroyed the city he too looked anxiously toward his father yeah im okay or pretty much so anyhow sam yeagers voice was harsh warren couldnt live after he had to throw indianapolis into the fire okay but what about all the lizards he killed he didnt lose a nights sleep over them and they hadnt done anything to anybody either they couldnt have they were in cold sleep themselves if lizards arent people worth thinking about what are they slowly jonathan nodded truth he said in the lizards language at last the tv screen cut away from the podium with nobody behind it but when it did jonathan wished it hadnt for what it showed were the ruins of indianapolis chet huntleys voice provided commentary these are the outskirts of the city we cannot get closer to the center we are not altogether sure it is safe to come even so close a man walked into the cameras line of sight the right side of his face looked normal the left and his left arm had been dreadfully burned sir called a newsman behind the camera what happened sir i was watering my lawn the man with half a normal face said watering my lawn he repeated i was watering my lawn and the whole goddamn world blew up he swayed like a tree in a high breeze then slowly toppled flash must have got him jonathans dad said if hed been turned the other way it would have been the other side of his face or if hed been looking right at it his voice trailed away jonathan had no trouble figuring out what would have happened then his stomach lurched the camera panned across devastation the telephone rang he sprang up and ran to answer it as much to escape the images on the tv screen as for any other reason hello jonathan it was karen my god jonathan she sounded as ravaged stunned disbelieving as he was yeah he said for want of anything better this is what we were sitting on i know she answered i never imagined it would turn out like this i didnt either im just glad they turned dad loose and he got home okay looking at some tiny private good in the midst of general disaster was a very human trait maybe that thought impelled what came next karen w you marry me dammit she hadnt said yes and she hadnt said no it was the wrong time it couldnt have been a worse time maybe it couldnt have been a better time either though for she answered yes i think we should do that and then before he could say anything else she hung up dazed he walked back into the living room he still didnt get a chance to say anything because his mother told him theyve caught up with vice president president stassen sure enough there was harold stassen with the words thief lake minnesota superimposed on his image he wore a fishermans vest that was all over pockets a floppy hat and an expression as sandbagged as everybody elses jonathan thought it was cruel for a reporter to thrust a microphone in his face and bark in light of the present situation mr president what do you intend to do stassen gave what jonathan thought was about the best answer he could im going to go back to little rock and find out exactly what happened after that with gods help ill try to take this country forward again i have nothing else to say right now in spite of that last sentence the reporter asked mr president were you aware that the united states launched the attack on the colonization fleet no stassen said i was not aware of that not until you told me a moment ago some officers will have some things to answer for i expect to find out which ones you can start with lieutenant general curtis lemay jonathans father said and then thoughtfully rather than in anger i wonder if hell have the decency to kill himself too much to hope for unless im wrong and i wonder just how many know not a lot or the secret wouldnt have stayed secret this long dad mom jonathan said karen just said shed marry me thats good son his father said congratulations his mother added but neither one of them heard him with more than half an ear almost all of their attention was on the tv screen which cut away from the most unpresidential images of the new president to new scenes of the ruin that had without warning overtaken indianapolis jonathan would have been angrier at them if his own eyes hadnt been drawn as by a magnet to the television set i was in orbital patrol when that satellite launched on the ships of the colonization fleet glen johnson said in the galley of the lewis and clark i figured it had to be the nazis or the reds i never imagined the united states would do such a thing now that you know better dr miriam rosen said what do you think of what president warren did falling on his sword you mean johnson said the country would have strung him up if he hadnt but the doctor shook her head which made her dark curly hair flip back and forth in a way that would have been impossible under gravity no thats not what i meant what do you think of his sacrificing a city instead of everything weve done in space before johnson could answer mickey flynn said if the united states survives as an independent power hell go down in history as a tragic hero of sorts if we dont hell be a villain of course johnson ate another mouthful of beans and diced peppers the peppers provided essential vitamins they were also hot enough to make his eyes cross in a way that was a welcome change from the blandness of most of what he ate aboard the spaceship in another more immediate way though it made him drink from his plastic bottle of water before he could speak when he did he said winners write history sure enough flynn had another question what do you think of the fellow who let the lizards know what wed done thats a funny thing johnson said i watched those ships blow up i dont know how many thousands or hundreds of thousands of lizards were in them they never had a chance they never even knew they died because they never woke up out of cold sleep if id known whether the germans or the russians launched on them idve told the race in a redhot minute i wouldnt have felt bad about it id have figured the bad guys were getting what they deserved its different when the shoe is on your own foot dr rosen observed aint it the truth johnsons agreement was wholehearted if ungrammatical if i had to guess flynn began johnson cut him off if i know you mickey that means youve analyzed it seventeen ways from sunday not this time the second pilot said with dignity not enough data as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted if i had to guess id say warren took the race by surprise when he gave them indianapolis instead of everything out here and everything in earth orbit congratulations miriam rosen said secondguessing a dead man from a couple of hundred million miles away isnt just a world record if its not a solar system record its got to be in the running flynn gravely inclined his head which since he floated perpendicular to the doctor made him look absurd thank you kindly im honored to have such a distinguished judge now i shall elucidate that means explain right johnson asked more harassing fire but flynn gave better than he got remarking only a marine would need an explanation of an explanation now if i may go on when johnson licking his wounds didnt rise to that the second pilot did continue on the surface giving up the installations is the easy obvious choice it costs no lives it costs no money in the short term it looks better and the race is convinced we tosevites live in the short term but in the long term it would ruin the united states johnson said it would put us at the lizards mercy exactly flynn nodded again whereas losing indianapolis does us very little harm in the long run unless of course one is unfortunate enough to live in indianapolis the fleetlord probably threw in the destruction of a city as a goad to make us do what he really wanted but when president warren took him up on it he had no choice this side of war but to accept and the united states is and will be a going concern for some time to come thats why i say president warren has a decent chance of being remembered kindly all that makes a good deal of sense dr rosen said what do you think glen the last time you asked me that mickey got up on his soapbox johnson replied at which flynn sent him an injured stare ignoring it johnson found himself nodding but i think it makes sense too warren took a big chance he got caught and he paid the price that hurt the country least going on living after that i guess i can see how he wouldnt have wanted to hed have been impeached and convicted as soon as the story broke dr rosen said i wonder if we would have handed him over to the lizards after that maybe its just as well we dont have to find out probably flynn said johnson couldnt quarrel with that either he said when we did give him to the lizards hed have been covered with tar and feathers he almost screwed up everything hed been building everything weve been building for years and years and yet flynn said in the thoughtful tones he used whenever he was going to go against conventional wisdom and yet i wonder whether that one blow he got in against the colonization fleet before the lizards were expecting anything hurt them more than losing indianapolis hurt us five hundred years from now historians will be arguing about that but will they be our historians or males and females of the race to be or not to be that is the question dr rosen said i wasnt joking miriam mickey flynn said neither was i she answered slowly johnson said by doing what he did warren made sure the lewis and clark and now the columbus would stay out here he made sure we wouldnt lose whatever space stations we build in earth orbit and the weapons weve already got there the race still has to take us seriously thats not the smallest thing in the world twenty years from now fifty years from now its liable to be the biggest thing in the world five hundred years from now its liable to say whos writing the history books he raised his water bottle in salute heres to earl warren i think flynn and dr rosen also drank with much the same hesitation hed shown in proposing the toast the pa system chimed the hour as if he couldnt believe it johnsons eyes went to his wristwatch it said the same thing the chime did he said something too im late walts not going to be very happy with me an understatement i would be proud to claim flynn said i am also late for my rest period to sleep perchance to dream perchance to soak your head johnson said over his shoulder as he pushed off to deposit his dishes in their boxes before heading for the control room he thought he saw flynn and the doctor leaving together by another exit but was in too much of a hurry to escape the chief pilots wrath to be sure so good of you to join me lieutenant colonel stone said in frigid tones when glen did fly into the control room it would have been even better of course had you joined me four minutes and ah twentyseven seconds ago im sorry sir johnson said then he broke a cardinal military rule never offer an excuse to atone for a failure mickey and miriam and i were trying to figure out what the devils going on back on earth and i just didnt pay any attention to the time and for a wonder it worked walter stone leaned forward in his seat and asked any conclusions either earl warren is a hero or a bum but nobodys going to know for sure for the next five hundred years johnson answered that seemed to sum up a lunchs worth of conversation in a sentence he added a comment of his own only god or the spirits of emperors past can tell now anyhow stone grunted laughter and said truth in the lizards language tacking on an emphatic cough for good measure after a couple of seconds of silence he fell back into english he may be a hero for what he did if you look at things that way he may be but ill tell you one thing glen hes the biggest bum since benedict arnold for letting himself get caught if he was going to give those orders every one of them should have been oral if anybody did write anything down he should have burned it the second the launch happened then there wouldnt have been anything for nosy parkers later on am i right or am i wrong oh youre right sir no doubt about it nosy parkers johnsons voice faded stone thought he knew why and laughed at the junior pilot you dont think thats so funny because you were a nosy parker yourself and look what it got you yeah but johnson remained abstracted hed known another nosy parker a fellow named yeager out in california whod been as curious about what the hell was going on with the space station that became the lewis and clark as he was himself and yeager was a hotshot expert on the race too if hed been snooping and if hed found stuff that would have been better off gone who was more likely to run and tell stories to the lizards johnson almost spoke up but he didnt know anything not for sure and so he kept quiet about that instead he said theres almost always a paper trail in that kind of business there shouldnt be but there is well i wont say youre wrong because youre not stone said even so youd think theyd be more careful with something that important were goddamn lucky we didnt have to pay anything more than indianapolis yeah johnson said again its not like we lost an important town the two men eyed each other in perfect understanding they were both from ohio where indianapolis was often known as indiannoplace stone said the one thing i do give warren high marks for is keeping us in space you know the concept of a fleet in being sure johnson nodded weve got enough stuff that they have to pay attention to us whether we do anything or not thats it stone agreed if wed had to give up everything what would we be an oversized new zealand thats what but now we get to go on johnson said it cost us it cost us like hell but were still in business and one of these days he looked out through the glareresistant glass at the seemingly countless stars one of these days like him walter stone spoke the words as if they were a complete sentence i wonder what kind of funeral theyve got planned for warren johnson said a big fancy one or just toss him in a trash can with his feet sticking out me id take the second one and some hobo could steal his shoes stone said but he was the president so odds are theyll do it up brown he paused dammit the last place on earth vyacheslav molotov wanted to be was in little rock arkansas for a state funeral he hated flying but earl warren wasnt going to keep till he could cross the atlantic by ship hed had a measure of revenge by ordering andrei gromyko to come with him to his annoyance the foreign commissar was reacting philosophically rather than with annoyance of his own things could be worse he said as he and molotov met in the soviet embassy before heading for the gathering procession how molotov was irritable enough to let his irritation show he hadnt slept at all on the airplane that brought him to america and even a long night in bed at the embassy left his body uncertain of what time it was supposed to be if this had happened a couple of months ago it would be forty degrees centigrade outside with humidity fit to swim in the foreign commissar answered washington was bad in the summertime little rock is worse bozhemoimolotov said good communists werent supposed to mention god but old habits were hand to break the general secretary went on i am given to understand dornberger came in person to represent the reich and eden from england is tojo here also yes gromyko answered if the lizards wanted to hurt all the leading human states they could throw a missile at little rock hen molotov said losing eden would probably help england and doriot i notice is conspicuous by his absence he collaborated with the germans so long and so well he had no trouble collaborating with the lizards when they became the leading foreigners in france gromyko clucked such cynicism vyacheslav mikhailovich officially the government of the race has sent its condolences to the government of the united states so everything is correct on that score correct molotov turned and twisted trying to help his back recover from sitting in the airliner seat for what felt like a month he wasnt a young man any more he seldom felt his threequarters of a century back in moscow thanks to iron routine one day usually went by much like another but when he was jerked out of his routine he took much longer recovering than he would have twenty years before he had to pause and remember what hed just said before continuing relations are at their most correct just before the shooting starts warren seems to have avoided that gromyko said in a lower voice he added for which we may all be thankful yes molotov nodded emphatically that would have been a pretty choice wouldnt it we could have joined the united states in a losing war against the race or we could have waited for the race to finish devouring the usa and then faced a losing war against the lizards by putting things off and by keeping the usa in the game humanity has gained a chance by gromykos tone he didnt think it a very good chance molotovs private opinion was much the same but he wouldnt have told himself his private opinion if he could have avoided it he kept up a bold front to gromyko moscow seemed on the point of falling first to the germans and then to the lizards but the hammer and sickle still fly above it since that was nothing but the truth the foreign commissar couldnt very well disagree with it before he had the chance the protocol officer came in and said comrades the limousine is waiting to take you to the gray house thank you mikhail sergeyevich molotov had made a point of learning the young mans name and patronymic by all reports he was able even if inclined to put form ahead of substance well if ever there was a protocol officers failing that was it the limousine was a cadillac seeing as much molotov raised an eyebrow gromyko said impossibly expensive to import our own motorcars to all our embassies in the reich we use used a mercedes i dont know what were doing there now did we molotov hadnt concerned himself with the point before he shrugged as he got inside if he was going to worry about it hed worry after he got back to moscow for the time being he would simply relax the automobile was comfortable but he wouldnt let it lull him into a false sense of security to gromyko he said no substantive conversations here who can tell who might be listening well of course comrade general secretary the foreign commissar sounded offended i am not a blushing virgin you know all right andrei andreyevich molotov spoke soothingly better to speak and not need than to need and not speak before gromyko could reply the limousine started to roll the soviet embassy was only a few blocks from the gray house one thing that struck molotov was how small a city little rock really was and how new all the important buildings were before the lizard invasion before it succeeded washington as a national capital it had been nothing to speak of a sleepy provincial town like kaluga or kuibishev well had the nazis or the lizards broken through kuibishev would have had greatness thrust on it too this place seems pleasant enough molotov said about as much praise as he would give any town oh indeed pleasant enough barring summer gromyko said and with air conditioning even that is a smaller problem than it would have been twenty years ago almost silently the car pulled to a stop the foreign commissar pointed there is stassen president stassen now speaking with general dornberger thank you for pointing him out molotov answered if you hadnt i wouldnt have recognized him like dornberger stassen was bald but the american was a younger man probably still on the sunny side of sixty and looked to have been formed in a softer school he might not have had any trouble in his life from the end of the first round of fighting to earl warrens suicide well he would have troubles now the driver opened the door to let out the russian leaders shall i introduce you gromyko asked i speak enough english for that his english was actually quite good though he preferred not to show it off molotov nodded if you would i have never met dornberger either does he speak english i dont know gromyko said ive never had to deal with him but we can find out he and molotov approached the american and german leaders stassen turned away from dornberger and toward them he spoke in english purely conventional gromyko said he thanks you for your presence and says it is a pleasure to meet you tell him the same molotov answered express my condolences and the condolences of the soviet people as gromyko spoke in english molotov extended his hand the new president of the united states shook it his grip firm but brief said nothing about him save that hed shaken a lot of hands before stassen spoke in english gromyko translated again he hopes we can live in peace among ourselves and with the race he says staying strong will help in this good he is not altogether a fool then molotov said translate that last into something friendly and agreeable as the foreign commissar did so the new german fuhrercame up and waited to be noticed he was a poor man waiting for rich men to deign to see him not a familiar position for a german leader these past ninetyfive years when dornberger spoke it was in english he says he is pleased to meet you gromyko reported tell him the same molotov shook hands with the germans too tell him i am happier to meet him now that the reich no longer has missiles aimed at the ussr through gromyko dornberger replied we had those yes but we had more aimed at the race much good they did you molotov said after the reichs misfortunes he didnt have to worry so much about diplomacy dornberger shrugged i did not make the war all i did was fight it as well as i could once the people set above me made it when no people set above me were left alive i ended it as fast as i could that was wise not starting it would have been wiser molotov wished more russian generals showed the disinclination of their german counterparts to meddle in politics zhukov came close but even zhukov though he didnt want the title wanted at least some of the power that went with it now i have to pick up the pieces and gather my nations strength as best i can dornberger said maybe the soviet union can help there as it did after the first world war maybe molotov said i can offer no promises even if the idea is worth exploring the race has espionage far better than the entente powers did after that war he turned away from the german fuhrer who no longer led a great power and back to the american president who still did president stassen i want to be sure you understand how brave president warren was not to leave you at the mercy of the lizards for the sake of a temporary political advantage i do stassen replied i also understand that he has left me at the mercy of the democrats because he gave the lizards indianapolis i do not expect to be reelected in he smiled just for the moment and just a little i envy your system had he thought of it molotov would have envied the american tradition of peaceful succession when beria mounted his coup against him he would not have admitted that no matter what before he could say anything at all an american started calling to the assembled dignitaries their protocol officer gromyko said he is telling us how to line up the ceremony was not so grand as it would have been in the soviet union as it had been when stalin died but it had a spare impressiveness of its own six white horses drew the wagon on which lay the flagdraped casket that held earl warrens remains behind it a nice touch a soldier led a riderless black horse with empty boots reversed in the stirrups president warrens widow his children and their spouses and children walked behind the horse then came the new us president and his family and then the assembled foreign dignitaries with molotov in the first rank behind them marched military bands and units from the american armed forces some on foot some mounted at a slow march the procession went east on capitol street embassy row for more than a mile then turned south toward a barge church molotov cared little for any of that except when his feet began to hurt he took sardonic pleasure in the certainty that walter dornberger who wore nazi jackboots was suffering worse than he what really interested him were the people who crowded the sidewalks to watch the coffin as it rolled by some were silent and respectful others called out as they would not have done in the ussr gromyko murmured in molotovs ear some of them say he should have hit the lizards harder others curse him for striking them at all someone will take the names of those people molotov spoke with great certainty the united states might boast of the freedom of speech it granted its citizens when they criticized the government though he was convinced they would be fair game he endured a religious service in a language he did not understand gromyko didnt bother translating molotov knew what the preacher would be saying warren had been important and was dead one day party functionaries would say the same of molotov not soon he hoped felless was about to taste ginger when the telephone hissed she hissed too in frustration and annoyance after scraping the herb off her palm and back into the vial she touched the accept control and said i greet you ambassador veffanis image appeared in the screen and i greet you senior researcher he replied i hope you are well yes superior sir i thank you felless was glad she hadnt tasted before answering who could guess in what kind of trouble she might have found herself actually the kind was easy enough to guess the degree was a different question altogether and you i am well veffani said i am calling to inform you that you are being placed on detached duty and transferred from marseille to cairo i am being transferred to cairo felless had trouble believing her hearing diaphragms after the unfortunate incident with the males from the staff of the fleetlord of the conquest fleet after they all mated with you yes as did i veffani was at pains to spell out the details felless would sooner have avoided i trust you will not go there full of ginger it would be unfortunate if you did he used an emphatic cough that will not be a difficulty superior sir felless said though it would have been had veffani called a little later i would like to know the reason why i am being summoned to cairo especially in light of the impression the unfortunate incident must have created she wouldnt call it anything else the reason is simple veffani answered fleetlord atvar is forming a commission to examine the reason the american big uglies sacrificed one of their cities to us i should think it would be obvious felless said to keep us from devastating their land with warfare as we devastated the reich veffani made an impatient noise why did they choose to sacrifice a city rather than weaken such space installations as they possess superficially that was the easier choice and the tosevites are nothing if not superficial it was the choice we expected them to make we offered the other primarily at fleetlord reffets urging now that they have accepted it they remain a major power and a major danger to us i see felless made the affirmative gesture to show she did yes that is a worthwhile subject for consideration who will my colleagues be i know of senior researcher ttomalss and security chief diffal both from the conquest fleet veffani answered your inclusion with them and with whoever else will be present is a distinct compliment as you are so recently come to tosev very well felless said for once she could not argue with the ambassador when is the next flight from marseille to cairo check your computer he told her bill the administrative system when you give your own identification number as well it will accept the charges it shall be done she said i thank you for not holding the past against me i had nothing to do with it veffani replied atvar asked for you by name and i was in no position to refuse the fleetlord neither are you his image vanished felless discovered a flight was leaving that afternoon she checked it had seats available as veffani had said she could charge her reservation to the administrative system she was on the aircraft no one shot at it when it landed on any other world of the empire that would have been a given on tosev felless was willing to accept it as something of a triumph no one shot at her armored vehicle as it traveled to shepheards hotel either the big uglies seem to be more accepting of our rule she remarked to the female sitting beside her as the second armored gate closed behind the vehicle so they do the female replied at least until something else gets them bouncing like drops of oil in a hot pan felless didnt answer by everything she could see cynicism that had been unique to the males of the conquest fleet was now infecting the colonists too maybe that would make it easier for the males of the conquest fleet to fit in maybe it just meant the colonists would have a harder time in their efforts to form a stable society on this world ttomalss was waiting for felless when she came into the lobby of the races administrative center i greet you superior female he said you could get a room number and a map from the computer terminal there but this place is like a maze your room is across the corridor from mine if you like i will escort you there i thank you senior researcher that would be kind of you felless answered as they walked through the hallways hallways that struck her as too wide and too tall she asked who besides diffal will be on the commission with us the only other member who has yet been chosen is superior nuisance straha ttomalss said before felless could remark on that he continued that is his own suggested title for himself these days from my experience in working with him i must say it is a good one working with a defector felless started to get angry then she checked herself it may not be such a bad move after all he has lived longer and more intimately with the big uglies than we have your reaction mirrors mine ttomalss said i have been interrogating him as you may know when i heard he would be a part of this commission i was at first horrified but then realized as you did that his insights would prove valuable and so they have he has an empirical knowledge of tosevites few of us could match good enough felless said the next obvious question is can we trust his insights or is he still in some degree loyal to the big uglies who sheltered him for so long ttomalss made the negative gesture he has been interrogated under truthrevealing drugs his comments about the authorities in the united states though less coherent than when he is undrugged are of the same sardonic tenor the only loyalty to a tosevite that he does exhibit is a personal one to sam yeager whom he truly reckons a friend all right we may discount that then felless agreed a pity we do not have such drugs to use on the big uglies we tried some during the first round of fighting ttomalss said they worked imperfectly when they worked at all and because males relied too much on the false results they got with them they turned out to be worse than interrogation with no drugs at all that is unfortunate felless said it often turned out to be very unfortunate for the males involved ttomalss said most of them can explain their misfortune only to spirits of emperors past however he stopped here is your room mine as i told you is across the hall by all means let me know if you need anything i suspect we will be meeting too often to let you taste ginger without complicating your life and everyone elses i do not mean that as criticism merely as a statement of fact and as a warning felless said ttomalss made the affirmative gesture felless sighed i thank you the habit is hard to break it was especially hard to break when she didnt want to break it she asked when will the first meeting be after breakfast tomorrow morning ttomalss answered that will give you a chance to relax and recover from your flight good enough felless said again i thank you for your help she went into the room and closed the door behind her her eye turrets swiveled like the hall the room had been built for tosevites and so struck her as outsized some of the plumbing fixtures were also left over from the days when big uglies had come here but the rest had been modernized and the appointments suited her well enough when she made her way to the refectory she found the food quite good then she noticed the fleetlord of the conquest fleet at a table in one corner of the room in animated discussion with a shiplord whose body paint was almost as complex as his if the fleetlord ate here the food would be good or someone would hear about it in short order breakfast the next morning was good too she used a map of the complex to find the meeting room diffal and ttomalss were already there a male with the body paint of a shuttlecraft pilot came in right behind her ttomalss said senior researcher i present to you the returned defector and former shiplord straha i greet you felless said and i greet you senior researcher straha said easily the paint is the pattern i used to escape the united states i have been ordered not to wear that of my former rank it would upset too many males and females atvar chief among them call me whatever you please a lot of males have called me a lot of things over the years he seemed perversely proud of that let us get down to business ttomalss said we have been assembled here to analyze why an apparently successful leader like earl warren after being discovered in his treachery would sacrifice a city rather than the weaponry we expected him to give up his actions do not show any failure of intelligence on our part diffal said the male from security went on he made the decision on his own consulting no one he offered us no trail of signals to intercept no one here is criticizing you felless said my opinion is simple straha said he never expected to be caught for the attack on the colonization fleet when he was he chose the option that hurt the united states least end of story it cannot be so simple diffal said why not straha asked that is not something drefsab your predecessor would have said drefsab had a gift for thinking like a big ugly i lack it i admit as much diffal said but what did his gift get him it got him killed in a worthless skirmish and nothing more i am still here to do the best i can you are a security male so you see complications everywhere straha jeered complications are everywhere diffal said you said as much to me superior nuisance ttomaiss seemed to enjoy using the title straha had given himself i said ambiguities are everywhere straha said there is a difference perhaps ttomaiss said felless would not have yielded the point so readily she said let us return to the issue we are supposed to grasp with our fingerclaws was warren a male with a complex personality or was he one who could be relied upon to do the obvious thing having met him several times i can state without fear of contradiction that he was one of the most obvious males ever hatched straha said but diffal made the negative gesture he wished to be seen as obvious that is a truth but no male who truly was obvious could have ordered the attack on the colonization fleet and successfully concealed it for so long no male who was obvious could have refused our demand to weaken his notempire and sacrificed a city instead we seek the subtleties under his scales any male who is able to keep a secret to keep his mouth shut always seems a prodigy to someone from security straha said any male who is able to keep a secret should certainly seem a prodigy to you diffal retorted you have value only when your mouth is open straha hissed in fury enough both of you felless shouted too much in fact the only thing this commission is showing is our own foibles not those of the tosevite we are supposed to be investigating she thought she was speaking an obvious truth but the others stared at her as if shed just hatched a miracle of wisdom the way things were going maybe she had by the time the warren commission had been meeting for a few days ttomalss had learned more about the foibles of his colleagues than hed ever wanted to know straha thought he knew everything about everything diffal was convinced nobody knew anything about anything and felless was convinced she could reconcile the other two males no matter how ferociously they disagreed what were they learning about him if anything he inclined toward diffal to imagine that we are going to be certain of the reasons for any big uglys behavior is an exercise in presumption he said one morning when they were more rancorous than usual then what are we doing here straha demanded looking for probabilities felless answered even those are better than complete ignorance and wild speculation securitys speculation is never wild diffal said we are however forced to analyze wildly conflicting data which gives you an excuse when you go wrong as you do so often straha broke in ttomalss felt like biting both of them instead he tried to change the subject let us examine why warren ended his life at the same time as he chose to allow the destruction of the american city my opinion is that this was an impulse reaction one taken on the spur of the moment diffal said big uglies seldom have the foresight for anything more complex here i would agree felless said ttomalss would have agreed too before he could state his agreement out loud straha laughed a tremendous jawgaping laugh the laugh of a male coming from the countryside to the city for the first time with enormous relish he said i happen to know to know i tell you that you are both mistaken and how do you know that diffal did his best to match the exshiplords sarcasm but straha had a crushing rejoinder because i have been in electronic communication with sam yeager who was in personal communication with warren before he killed himself yeager makes it quite plain that warren knew what he was doing knew its cost and was not prepared to live after inflicting that cost on his notempire that is not fairfelless said you knew the answer to the question before it was asked i said so strahas voice was complacent which would you rather do learn the actual truth or sit around debating endlessly till you decide upon what you imagine the truth ought to be by the indignant forward slant of their bodies both felless and diffal would sooner have spent more time in debate a veteran of endless committee meetings and of committee meetings that only seemed endless ttomalss had some sympathy for their point of view but only some he said the truth does seem to be established in this particular interest i suggest that we adjourn for the day so we can approach other questions with our minds refreshed no one objected the commission dissolved itself for the day diffal and felless both left in a hurry straha stayed to gloat facts facts are ugly things senior researcher they pierce the boldest theory through the liver and send it crashing to the ground in some ways superior nuisance you have become very much like an american big ugly ttomalss said i suppose this was inevitable but it does seem to have happened straha made the affirmative gesture i am not particularly surprised i have been observing the americans for a long time and it is a truism that observer and observed affect each other i suppose i have affected them too but rather less they are many and i only one you are not the only expatriate male of the race there though ttomalss said we have examined the expatriates effect on pushing american technology forward but we have not really considered their effect on the society of the notempire as a whole they must have some so they must now straha sounded thoughtful rather than vainglorious as i told you while you were interrogating me you ask interesting questions you could even answer that one i think were you interested in doing so most expatriates unlike me can freely come and go between the usa and territory the race rules but ttomalss said that is not what i want or not most of what i want i would like to grasp the americans view of the influence of the expatriates it strikes me as being more important and it could be that the expatriates are influencing the americans in ways of which neither group is aware those are all truths every one of them straha agreed they are all worth investigating too i am sure i am not sure the americans are doing anything similar themselves that the americans might be doing something similar hadnt crossed ttomaiss mind he said you have considerable respect for those big uglies is that not another truth and for warren their leader yes to both straha said warren was a very great leader unlike the deutsche he found a way to hurt us at relatively low cost to his notempire had his luck been a little better had he not had males in his notempire already influenced by the race he might have hurt us at no cost at all you sound as if you wish he had succeeded ttomaiss remarked to his horror straha thought that over before answering on the whole no his failure after all is what allowed me to return to the society of the race and i must admit i have longed to do so since shortly after my defection and especially since the arrival of the colonization fleet that is the most selfcentered attitude i have ever heard ttomalss said what about the males and females aboard the ships that were destroyed they were in cold sleep and so had no idea whatever that they had died straha said all things considered it is an end to be envied a better one than you or i can expect sophistry nothing but sophistry ttomalss was furious and didnt try to hide it what about the big uglies in and around indianapolis many of whom are still in torment as a result of the strike they are only big uglies straha said with chilling indifference but then he checked himself no senior researcher you have a point there and i have to admit it do you know what the tosevites are apt to say about the males and females who died in the attack on the colonization fleet they are only lizards the last word was in english straha explained it that is the slang term the tosevites use for us just as we call them big uglies when they are not around to hear sometimes looking at them is like looking into a mirror we see ourselves only backwards ttomaiss said and straha made the affirmative gesture ttomaiss went on other times though we see ourselves in a distorting mirror the case of their sexuality comes to mind straha laughed that may be true of how things were back on home with ginger it is not true of how things are here as you know very well prohibitions against the herb ttomalss began are useless straha interrupted in his infinite generosity the exalted fleetlord hinted he might let me continue to use the herb in gratitude for the service i had rendered the race but he would not if i were not a properly obedient male the threat alarmed me at first but i needed about a day and a half to find my own supplier and i am far from the only one in this complex who tastes have you never caught the scent of a females pheromones i have ttomalss admitted i wish i could say i had not but i have whenever a female tastes where males can smell her odds are she will mate straha said whenever a female mates out of season whenever females incite males to mating our sexuality becomes more like the big uglies is that a truth or am i lying and deceiving you that is a truth ttomalss said without a doubt it is also the worst social problem the race is facing on tosev it is only a problem if we insist on calling it one straha said if we do not it becomes interesting even enjoyable that is disgusting ttomalss said with considerable dignity straha laughed at him he didnt care he got to his feet and walked out of the conference chamber as he opened the door he turned an eye turret back toward the exshiplord and added when we talk again i hope we can do so without such revolting comments straha didnt say a word but he kept on laughing ttomalss fumed as he went down the corridor and toward his own chamber a safe haven from strahas depravity he had to bank the fire of his anger to find his way through the winding maze of corridors that made up shepheards hotel it had been a confusing place when the big uglies ran it and the races additions thanks to security concerns often made things worse rather than better when a certain odor reached ttomalss scent receptors he let out a soft hiss and started walking faster and a little more nearly erect he hardly noticed he was doing it till hed reached his own corridor by then the scales of the crest atop his head were standing erect too the sure sign of a male ready to mate and also ready to fight about mating if he had to he wouldnt have called strahas words disgusting then part of his mind realized that but only a small part the door across the hallway from his own stood open the delicious pheromones wafted out from in there ttomalss hurried inside he almost bumped into another male who was leaving go on the other fellow said happily you get no quarrel from me i have already mated felless stood in the middle of the floor shed started to straighten up from the mating posture but the sight of ttomalss erect stance and crest his mating display sent her back down into it even as her tailstump twitched out of the way so his cloaca could join hers she mumbled i did not intend for this to happen what you intended does not matter ttomalss answered the hiss he let out as pleasure shot through him was anything but soft he could have mated with her again but the drive to do so felt less urgent now instead he turned away and went to his own room even as he left felless chamber another excited male was hurrying toward it in his room the door closed behind him he could scarcely smell the pheromones rational thought returned hed never tasted ginger not even once but the herb reached out and touched his life all the same maybe straha hadnt been so far wrong no matter how crudely he put things ttomalss sighed hed wanted to talk with the exshiplord about the dead leader of the united states somehow the conversation had got round to sexuality by way of ginger he remembered straha seemed not at all unhappy about being addicted to it ttomalss would have been ashamed maybe straha had been ashamed once upon a time but tosev eroded shame as it eroded everything else that made the race what it was ttomalss reminded himself not to tell kassquit hed mated with felless again mordechai anielewicz studied the farm from a low rise he might have been an officer working out the best plan of attack in fact that was exactly what he was he turned to the squad of lizards behind him and spoke in their language i thank you for your help in this matter their leader an underofficer named oteisho shrugged an amazingly humanlike shrug we are ordered to assist you you have assisted the race we pay our debts so you do mordechai thought youre better about it than most people aloud he said we had best advance in open order i do not think this gustav kluge will open fire on us but i might be wrong he will be one very sorry deutsch male if he tries oteisho remarked half professional appraisal half anticipation the males of the race whod fought the germans in poland had no love for them oteisho turned and gave orders to the infantrymales in his squad they spread out weapons at the ready oteisho gestured to anielewicz lead us i shall he couldnt say it shall be done not when he was in charge he hoped he wasnt leading them on a wildgoose chase briefly he wondered what lizards chased on home instead of wild geese but then he swung his rifle down off his shoulder and started toward kluges farm people were working in the fields that was to be expected with harvest time on the way what wasnt to be expected was that other people men all of them were standing guard in the fields to make sure none of the workers escaped the guards were armed and looked alert how many farms in germany had used slave labor before this latest round of fighting how many had kept right on doing it even after the reich got smashed into the dust quite a few evidently from the farmers point of view why not germany remained independent of the lizards who was going to tell them they couldnt do that any more i am by god mordechai muttered oteisho turned one eye turret his way when he said nothing more the lizard underofficer relaxed and kept his attention on his males they were veterans anielewicz could see as much by the way they handled themselves even so he wondered if hed brought as much firepower with him as gustav kluge had on the farm kluges men were liable to be veterans too demobilized soldiers looking for work that would keep them fed one of the guards in a civilian shirt and sure enough fieldgray wehrmachttrousers strolled toward anielewicz and the lizards he had a cigarette in a corner of his mouth and an assault rifle slung on his back keeping his hands well away from the weapon he asked the inevitable question was st los were looking for some people anielewicz answered he was careful to speak german not yiddish kluges men wouldnt love him anyhow theyd love him even less if no when they found out he was a jew lots of people are these days the guard leaned forward a little bit the picture of insolence why should we let em go even if you find em if theyve got labor contracts buddy theyre here for the duration and if you dont like that you can take it to court theyre my wife and children anielewicz said tightly bertha miriam david and heinrich are the names he didnt give his surname it would have told too much and who the devil are youthe guard asked the question didnt come out so nastily as it might have the next sentence explained why you must be somebody if youve brought tame lizards along one of the infantrymales turned out to speak some german we are not tame he said move wrong you will see how not tame we are he sounded as if he hoped the guard would make a false move up from the farmhouse came a burly grayhaired man who walked with a cane and a peculiar rolling gait that meant hed lost a leg above the knee the guard turned back to him with something like relief heres herr kluge the boss you can tell him your story he stepped aside and let the farmer do his own talking kluge had some of the coldest gray eyes anielewicz had ever seen who are you and what are you doing coming onto my land with lizard soldiers at your back im looking for my wife and children mordechai replied and gave their names as he had to the guard i dont have any workers by those names kluge spoke with complete confidence but then as a slavemaster he would im going to look anielewicz said if i find them after you tell me theyre not here im going to kill you no one will say a word about it you can take that to the bank or to the pearly gates do you understand me do you believe me a german is either at your throat or at your feet so the saying went mordechai watched the farmer crumble before his eyes kluge had been on top for a generation probably ever since he recovered from the wound that had cost him his leg he wasnt on top any more and he didnt need long to figure it out in a voice gone suddenly hoarse he said who are you anyhow now was the time to drop the mask mordechai smiled a smile that was all pointed teeth who am i he echoed letting himself slide out of german and into yiddish im mordechai anielewicz of lodz thats who i am and if you think i wouldnt shoot you as soon as look at you youre out of your goddamn mind a kikethe guard exclaimed which almost got him killed on the spot instead anielewicz just smiled again yes im a kike and how much do you think i owe the third reich after all this time i can take back a little piece of it right now talk kluge if you ever want to see your frail again if his wife and children werent here that thunderous bluster would do mordechai no good even if kluge had nerve it might not do him any good but the farmer pointed past the big house where his wife and children no doubt lived in comfort despite the disaster that had overwhelmed their nation there in that field of rye putting families together helps me get the most out of them ive found have you mordechai said tonelessly what a swell fellow you are lead me to them if youre lying somebody else will have to swing the whip for you from here on out now get moving and tell your pals with the rifles not to get cute or theyll have themselves one overventilated boss kluge turned and started shouting at the top of his lungs after that anielewiczs one big worry was that a guard would try to take out a few lizards and wouldnt give a damn about what happened to the fellow who paid his salary but it didnt happen at kluges slow ponderous pace they headed down a path toward that field of rye mordechais heart thudded faster and faster before theyd gone very far he started shouting his wifes name and those of his children he didnt have lungs to match those of the german farmer but he didnt have to shout more than a couple of times before heads came up in the field and then four figures three pretty much of a size and one smaller were running through the field toward him the grain kluge said in pained tones he could have died right there anielewicz started to swing the muzzle of his rifle toward him but the jewish fighting leader checked the motion and the german went on you will see they have not been mistreated id better mordechai growled then he started running too his first thought was that his wife and sons and daughter were painfully thin his next was that they were wearing rags after that he stopped thinking for a while he hugged them and kissed them and said as many foolish things as needed saying and listened with delight while they said foolish things too the watching lizards undoubtedly didnt understand at all and then as bits of rationality returned he asked are you all right it could have been worse his wife answered bertha anielewicz nodded to david and heinrich he knew we were jews of course but he still fed us he needed work from us he bought us david said indignantly he bought us for a big pile of bread from the soldiers who had us he looked at mothers teeth first i swear he did she might have been a horse for all he cared gustav kluge came up to them it is as i told you he said to anielewicz as near a direct challenge as made no difference they are here they are well they have not been mistreated i have treated them the same as all the others who work for me even though theyre jews ithungintheair though he hadnt said it mordechai couldnt resist a dig of his own im not sure those last two things are the same im not sure at all but the german farmer plantation owner anielewicz thought remembering gone with the wind hadnt lied too extravagantly take them if they are your kin take themkluge made pushing motions with the hand not gripping his cane as if to say he wanted mordechais family off his farm as fast as they could go oteisho and the other lizards came up too they still kept their weapons aimed at gustav kluge the underofficer asked anielewicz is it well have you found your mate and hatchlings it is very well i thank you mordechai folded himself into the posture of respect yes this is my mate these are my hatchlings heinrich anielewicz had been studying the lizards language in school in lodz back when there was a school back when there was a lodz he too bent into the posture of respect and i thank you superior sir he said that seemed to amuse and please the infantrymales the mouths of three or four of them dropped open in laughter gravely oteisho answered tosevite hatchling you are welcome heinrich returned to polish asking father do you know anything about pancer is he all right to the lizards he explained i have a beffel i named him for a landcruiser in my language that set the troopers laughing again miriam said dont bother your father about that silly animal now but mordechai said its no bother pancers back at my tent as a matter of fact an officer of the race had him i heard him beeping and started asking questions about where the male had got him and that helped lead me here heinrich let out a whoop of triumph that proved nothing was seriously wrong with him you see pancer helped save us again even when he got lost david said where will we live what will we do lodz is gone i dont know mordechai answered ive been in the field since before the fighting started and ive been looking for you since it ended he shook his head he felt dizzy drunk though hed had nothing stronger than water and do you know what else i dont much care were together again thats all that really matters can we go someplace now where theres real food david asked that spoke volumes about what things were like on the farm anielewicz shot gustav kluge another venomous glance but he had to say theres not a whole lot of real food anywhere in germany right this minute well do the best we can were free again his wife said which also spoke volumes she went on next to that nothing else really matters mordechai put one arm around her the other around miriam his sons embraced them truth he said they all added emphatic coughs not for the first time kassquit was feeling neglected and left out of things she knew shed been on the edge of great events but she hadnt been able to get any closer than the edge only belatedly had she learned that jonathan yeagers father was the wild big ugly whod given the race the information it needed to show that his notempire had been responsible for the attack on the colonization fleet she sent sam yeager an electronic message saying congratulations because of you the race was able to take the vengeance it required that is a truth he wrote back but it is a truth with a high price a male who was a fine leader except for his attack on the colonization fleet which was wrong killed himself and a large city in my notempire was destroyed look at the vengeance before you gloat over it calling up video images of the ruins of indianapolis was easy enough the race had broadcast them widely to show males from the conquest fleet and males and females from the colonization fleet that the big uglies attack had indeed been avenged smashed buildings were smashed buildings motorcars half melted into the asphalt on which theyd been driving testified to the power of the explosivemetal bomb that had burst above the town those were the images the race had shown again and again but there were others of tosevites charred dead or half charred and wishing for death that hadnt been broadcast so much kassquit understood why they were sickening even when of another species and of course for her they were not of another species had she been hatched no born there the same thing could have happened to her one moment contented the next with a new sun in the sky it did not repay thinking about in any great detail the males and females in cold sleep had not known what hit them many of the big uglies the ones near the city center couldnt have known either but many had that was a side of revenge the race didnt publicize so widely kassquit observing it could understand why she needed a while before she wrote to sam yeager again did you know such a thing would happen to your notempire she asked when i began searching for answers i thought it would happen to another notempire he answered was convinced the reich or the sssr would deserve it how then could i say my own notempire did not that makes perfect logical sense kassquit wrote am i correct in guessing you are not happy with it even so yes he wrote back a notempire is an extension of ones mate and hatchlings when dreadful things happen to the members of ones own notempire one is more unhappy than he would be if those dreadful things happened in a different notempire he used the conventional symbol for an emphatic cough that made kassquit wonder just how strong an emotion he was feeling the notemperor of the usa had killed himself after permitting the destruction of that city she hoped sam yeager would not feel similarly obliged asking him about it though might touch off the urge and so she refrained and then jonathan yeager wrote to her have to let you know that i am going to enter into a permanent mating arrangement with the female named karen culpepper whom i mentioned from time to time while i was aboard the starship i told you that this might happen i am glad it finally has i hope very much that you will be glad for me too kassquit stared at that for what seemed a very long time at last her fingers moving more on their own than under the guidance of her will she wrote congratulate you she stared at the words wondering how they had got up on the screen at least they replaced the ones jonathan yeager had sent her still not thinking very much still trying not to think very much she sent her message she had read that soldiers could be hurt in the heat of battle sometimes badly hurt and not notice it till later shed always supposed that a reaction unique to the race one big uglies didnt share whenever shed been hurt shed always known about it now she began to understand she knew shed been wounded here wounded to the core somehow though she felt nothing it was as if her entire body had been dipped in refrigerant no not quite her entire body a tear slid from each eye and rolled down her cheeks she hadnt known the tears were there till they fell when those first two did it was as if they released the floodgates tears streamed down her face mucus began flowing from her small blunt snout shed always hated that she stumbled to a tissue dispenser grabbed one and tried drying her face and wiping away the slimy mucus the more she dabbed at herself the more tears fell and the more mucus flowed at last she gave up and let her body do what it would till it finally decided it had had enough that took an amazingly long time when the spasms finally quit wracking her she stooped a little to look at herself in the mirror she gasped in horrified dismay she hadnt really known her soft scaleless skin could become so swollen and discolored around the eyes or that the white part of those eyes could turn so red shed always been ugly compared to males and females of the race but now she looked extraordinarily hideous but jonathan yeager said i was not ugly she thought he said i was sexually attractive to wild tosevites and he proved it by being attracted to me thinking about jonathan yeager set off a new paroxysm of tears and nasal mucus by the time she was through she looked even uglier than she had before and she wouldnt have believed that possible at last the second spasm ended kassquit recoiled from the mirror in disgust she used water to wash her face again and again that did something to reduce the swelling but not enough she supposed her skin would eventually return to normal but how long would it take before i have to go to the refectory again please she thought directing the prayer to spirits of emperors past with ttomalss down on the surface of tosev she was unlikely to have to see anyone till then who sought out a junior a very junior psychologist different from every other citizen of the empire on or around tosev she wished she had someplace to hide even from herself even more she wished she had someplace to hide from jonathan yeagers electronic message it wasnt as if he told any lies in it he didnt he had mentioned that he would probably enter into a permanent mating arrangement once he returned to the surface of tosev kassquit hadnt expected him to do it anywhere near so soon though it is not fair she said aloud jonathan yeager would go on to indulge a normal tosevite sexuality he would mate with this karen culpepper female whenever he wanted for years and years to come he would forget all about her kassquit or if he did remember her it would be only for brief moments of pleasure fury filled her in place of despair what did she have to look forward to in years to come this cubicle her own fingers memories of a brief too brief contact with another of her own kind how long how often could she replay those memories in her mind before they started to wear out or wear thin it is not fair she repeated this time in an altogether different tone of voice anger burned in her she added an emphatic cough had she had jonathan yeager there before her she would have given him a piece of her mind a large jaggededged piece hed come up here taken his sexual pleasure with her and then gone down to the surface of tosev to resume his ordinary life how dared he she wondered if any female big ugly had ever been betrayed in the way she was since the species evolved such intelligence as it had she doubted it jonathan yeager had surely devised a unique way to play on the affections of one who was one who could not help being naive she hurried to the computer to let him know exactly what she thought of him but refrained at the last minute for one thing she didnt want to give him the satisfaction of knowing hed succeeded in wounding her for another she still esteemed his father she didnt want sam yeager reading a nasty message intended for his hatchling what his hatchling did was not his fault he surely never would have done such a thing with or to a female but what did that leave her nothing but sullen acceptance nothing but living on memories that wasnt good enough kassquit snapped her fingers jonathan yeager had taught her to do it she ignored that for now enjoying the small sound for its own sake i can have another male brought up from the surface of tosev can have my own pleasure s a have to talk with ttomalss about that she thought he had better not tell me no either even so she wondered if it would be the same because jonathan yeager was the first he was the one against whom she would measure all later comers and she had given him her affection without reservation she hadnt known to do anything else would she do that again of itself her hand shaped the negative gesture would not be so foolish twice she kicked at the metal floor to her cubicle if she brought a male up for sexual pleasure alone if no affection was involved what could he give her that her fingers could not what except betrayal i have had enough betrayal she said would other male big uglies prove as treacherous as devious as jonathan yeager it wasnt impossible that brought her back to where shed begun alone with only her own hand for company she hadnt minded that too much before meeting jonathan yeager hed shown her something of the spectrum of tosevite sexually related emotions and now he was lavishing them on this karen culpepper female kassquit looked in the mirror again to her relief the blotches and swelling were fading soon they would be gone no one would be able to note any outward signs of distress on her but the distress was there whether visible or not what am i going to do she asked the metal walls she got no more answer there than anywhere else might have done better never to have met wild big uglies in the flesh at all she thought certainly might have done better never to have started a sexual relationship with one of them i could have gone on doing my best to emulate a female of the race i would not have known about some of the emotions accessible to big uglies emotions for which the race has no real equivalents i had no real equivalents only a dim awareness that i felt things ttomalss did not now i understand much more now these areas have opened up in my mind and i cannot use them would it not have been better that they stayed closed she had no real answer for that she could not go back into the eggshell that had held her before but she could not use the new areas enjoy the new areas as long as she was alone even if a new big ugly male came up to the starship even if he was everything jonathan yeager had been and more sooner or later he would go back down to tosev and she would be alone cut off once more what am i going to do she repeated again no answer congratulations johannes drucker told mordechai anielewicz congratulations he repeated to anielewiczs family a wife two boys a girl achingly like his own family though anielewiczs girl was the eldest where his claudia was sandwiched between heinrich and adolf they didnt particularly look like jews or what he imagined jews looking like he suspected german propaganda of exaggerating noses and lips and chins they just looked like people bertha anielewicz mordechais wife was plain till she smiled when she did though she turned very pretty when she was younger shed probably been gorgeous when she smiled i hope you find your wife and children too she told him she spoke yiddish not german the gutturals were harsh and the vowel sounds strange but he understood well enough thanks he said hearing yiddish reminded him how strange it was to be standing outside a red cross shelter another red cross shelter near greifswald talking with five jews before this last war it wouldnt have been strange it would have been impossible unimaginable a lot of things that would have been unimaginable a few months before now seemed commonplace what will you do he asked the anielewiczes trying his best not to be jealous of their good fortune go home mordechai laughed home we havent got one not with lodz blown off the map well find something back in poland i expect right this minute i have no idea what something im sure you will drucker agreed no staying away from jealousy wasnt easy youll help pick up the pieces back there and ill help pick up the pieces here one way or another he didnt want to dwell on that holding on to hope came hard anielewicz set a hand on his shoulder part of him wanted to shake it off but he let it stay the jewish fighting leader said dont quit thats all never quit he could afford to say that he could quit now hed found his needle in a haystack but he wasnt wrong either if he hadnt scoured this corner of prussia he never would have come up with his wife and sons and daughter i know drucker said ill go on i have to what else can i do kill myself like the american president not likely he tried to imagine adolf hitler killing himself if faced by some disaster not likely rang again in his mind the first fuhrer would surely have grabbed some soldiers mauser and kept firing at his foes till he finally fell suicide was the cowards way out heinrich anielewicz like druckers own heinrich named for the heinrich jager theyd both admired was holding his pet beffel the little animal from home swiveled one eye turret toward drucker it opened its mouth beep pancer said almost as if it were a squeeze toy the corners of druckers mouth couldnt help twitching up a few millimeters that really was one of the most preposterously friendly sounds hed ever heard heinrich anielewicz scratched the beffel between the eye turrets and under the chin pancer liked that and said beepagain the boy spoke to it in polish drucker had no idea what he said hed never known more than a handful of words in the language and hed long since forgotten those then heinrich anielewicz switched to yiddish and spoke to him if it hadnt been for pancer you know we might never have been found yes i do know that i was with your father when he heard him drucker answered i didnt know what the noise was but he did you could have knocked me over with a feather mordechai anielewicz said it was luck nothing else but sometimes when you havent got anything else youll take luck you dont just take it if you get it you grab it with both hands drucker said the soldier in him speaking had bertha and miriam anielewicz not been there he might have put it more earthily listen mordechai anielewicz said ive talked to that male named gorppet the one who had pancer he knows im a big ugly he used the language of the race to say that the lizards want to keep happy ive asked him to give you whatever help he can hes an intelligence officer too so whatever they hear he can get his hands on it i hope that does you some good thanks drucker nodded thats damned good of you all things considered all things considered anielewicz savored the phrase theres a lot to consider all right herr oberst theres the reich you fought for but then theres your wife and your children and you got jager loose from the ss you tell me and if you hadnt done that lodz would have gone up in instead of this spring bertha and i would be dead and the first round of fighting might have gone on and ended up wrecking the whole world so i didnt spend a lot of sleepless nights worrying about this one thanks drucker said again that didnt seem to be enough he stuck out his hand anielewicz shook it bertha anielewicz hugged him which took him by surprise no woman had done that since since the last time hed seen kathe before the fighting started up too long god too long roughly he said im going into the camp now good luck they chorused behind him hed seen too many refugee camps by now for this one to hold any surprises tents people in shabby clothes more shabby clothes hanging out as laundry the smell of latrines and unwashed bodies the dull apathetic look of men and women who didnt think things would or could ever get better again in the middle of the camp as in the middle of all these camps stood a tent with a red cross flag flying above it the men and women theyd be mostly women in it would be clean theyd have clean clothes fresh clothes clothes they could change theyd mislike anyone entering their realm who didnt give them their full due as he ducked through the tent flap he heard rhythmic tapping someone in there had a typewriter it wasnt a computer but it was still a surefire sign of superiority in the middle of a refugee camp several women sure enough all of them scrubbed till they gleamed looked up from whatever important things they were doing to give him the onceover by their expressions he didnt pass muster they probably took him for one of the people they were there to help yes one of them said what is it by her tone it couldnt possibly have been as urgent as the forms she was filling out yes she must have taken him for an inmate here i am here to look for my family my wife my sons my daughter drucker katherina kathe heinrich adolf claudia drucker stayed polite and businesslike oh one of those the woman nodded now she knew in which pigeonhole he belonged she pulled out a form from a box on the table behind her and said fill this out fill it out very carefully we will search if we find them in our records you will be notified when will you search when will i be notified drucker asked why dont you search now im here now by all the signs she needed reminding of that a slow flush darkened her cheeks it wasnt embarrassment it was anger we have many important duties to perform here sir she said in a voice like winter on the russian front when we have the opportunity we shall search the records for you that might be twenty years from now it might on the other hand be never please fill out the form the form was important the family it represented that might matter but more likely it wouldnt drucker had seen that attitude before he had a weapon to combat it he took from his wallet a telegram and passed the woman the yellow sheet here i suggest you read this for a moment he thought shed try to crumple it instead he would have prevented that by force if necessary but she did read and her eyes the dull blue and white of cheap china grew bigger and bigger as she read but this is from flensburg she said and all the other red cross women exclaimed when she mentioned the new capital even the typist stopped typing in an awed whisper the woman went on this is from the fuhrer from the fuhrer himself we are to help this man he says they all crowded around to examine and to exclaim over the special telegraph form with the eagle with the swastika in its claws after that johannes drucker found things going much more smoothly instead of being a client and hence an obvious inferior he was a man known to the fuhrer the fu hirer himself drucker thought sourly and hence an obvious superior helga the blueeyed woman barked check the records at once for the herr oberstleutnant drucker kathe heinrich adolf claudia at once druckers eyebrows rose shed been listening she just hadnt wanted to do anything about it to him that made things worse not better lazy sour bitch helga said jawo and went for the file boxes at the run so fast that a lock of her blond hair escaped the pins with which she imprisoned it she grabbed the right one without even looking and riffled through the forms in it then on the off chance something had gone wrong she went through the boxes to either side having done that she looked up at drucker and said im sorry sir but we have here no record of them since he was known to the fuhrer she actually sounded sorry not bored as she might well have otherwise it wasnt as if drucker hadnt heard it before too many times lately though hed added a new string to his bow see if you have anyone who was living on pfordtenstrasse in greifswald maybe a neighbor would know something maybe helga the woman holding the telegram thundered again while helga went to a different set of file boxes drucker got the precious sheet of yellow paper back hed need it to overawe people somewhere else sorting through those boxes took longer after fifteen minutes or so helga looked up i have an andreas bauriedl at pfordtenstrasse by god drucker exclaimed andreas the hatter he lives lived only three doors down from me can you have him fetched here they could they did half an hour later there was skinny little andreas ten years older than drucker hurrying in to shake his hand good to see you hans he exclaimed didnt know youd made it im here drucker answered what about my family do you know anything they gave heinrich a rifle same as they did me and put him in a volkssturm battalion bauriedl answered that was when the lizards were getting close to greifswald you know if you were a man and you were breathing they gave you a rifle and hoped for the best it was pretty bad boys and old men drucker thought everybody else would have already gone into the wehrmacht he asked the question he had to ask do you know what happened to him bauriedl shook his head i couldnt tell you hans he got called in a couple of days before i did and into a different unit im sorry i wish i could tell you more drucker sighed hed learned a little something anyhow what about kathe and the other children they left town right after heinrich went in piled into the vw and took off bauriedl frowned something about uncle lothar uncle ludwig i was coming up the street when she drove by she called out to me in case i saw you id tell you more but they bombed the block a few minutes later they got effi damn them we were in different rooms and he grimaced i went into the volkssturm hoping id get killed too no such luck im sorry drucker hoped he sounded sincere hed heard so many stories like that but excitement burned in him too kathe has he made himself use the present tense an uncle down in neu strelitz i think his name starts with an l ill tell you one thing im going to find out neu strelitz wasnt so far away not when hed already walked from nuremberg but maybe he wouldnt have to walk he had connections now and he intended to use them gorppet was discovering he liked intelligence work it was for males of a mistrustful cast of mind it was also for males who wanted more than just to be given orders he got to think for himself without becoming an object of suspicion he was writing a report on what he suspected to be underground activity among the deutsche when a big ugly came into the tent and said i greet you superior sir i am johannes drucker the friend of mordechai anielewicz and i greet you the tosevite had named himself which gorppet found considerate even after so long on tosev even after his spectacular capture of that maniac of a khomeini he still found that most big uglies looked alike since this drucker had announced who he was gorppet could proceed to the next obvious question and what do you want with me today superior sir does the race have a garrison in the town of neu strelitz i have no idea gorppet answered say the name again so that i can enter it into our computer and find out drucker did as best gorppet could he turned the odd sounds of the deutsch language into the races familiar characters the screen displayed a map of the reich with a town south of greifswald blinking on it that the displayed town was blinking meant the computer system wasnt sure of the identification gorppet pointed at the town with his tongue is this the place you mean johannes drucker leaned forward to get a better look at the monitor his head went up and down in the big uglies affirmative gesture yes superior sir that is the right place very well gorppet spoke to the computer the light indicating neu strelitz stopped blinking gorppet interrogated the data system then turned back to the tosevite no at present we have no males in that town we cannot be everywhere you know that was a truth that worried him the deutsche might well be hatching trouble under the races snout there just werent enough males to watch everything at once but he said nothing of that to drucker no point in giving a former deutsch officer ideas he probably had too many already gorppet did ask why do you wish to know that my mate and two of my hatchlings may be there drucker replied i was hoping that if the race did have males in that place i could there in one of your vehicles travel every so often he would forget about the verb till the end of a sentence a lot of deutsche did that when speaking the language of the race the big uglys sigh was amazingly like that of a male of the race now must i walk wait gorppet thought hard mordechai anielewicz was a tosevite the race needed to keep happy that meant keeping his friend happy too especially where kin were concerned anielewicz himself had been almost insane with joy after recovering his own hatchlings and mate and having a former deutsch officer owing the race a debt of gratitude might not be the worst thing in the world either it might in fact prove very useful gorppet said let me make a telephone call or two and i will see what i can do i thank you drucker said do you mind if i on the ground sit i do not fit well inside this tent sure enough he had to bend his head forward a little to keep from bumping the fabric of the roof an unnatural and uncomfortable posture for a big ugly go ahead gorppet said and made the affirmative gesture as drucker sat gorppet spoke on the telephone had he still been an ordinary infantry officer he was sure the quartermaster he called would have laughed in his face the fellow took an officer from security more seriously gorppet hardly had to raise his voice when the quartermaster broke the connection gorppet turned an eye turret back toward the big ugly there i have arranged it have you drucker asked eagerly so thought i but when you speak rapidly i have trouble following i have indeed gorppet sounded smug hed earned a little smugness go three tents over and one tent up he gestured to show directions within the races encampment and you will find a motorcar waiting for you the driver will take you to this neu strelitz place i thank you the big ugly said again this time with an emphatic cough to show how much you are generous to a male who was your enemy i am not altogether disinterested gorppet said drucker he judged was smart enough to figure that out for himself sure enough the tosevite nodded once more gorppet went on you deutsche and we of the race should try to live together as smoothly as we can now that the war is over that is always easier for the winner than for the loser to say johannes drucker answered still i also think it is a truth and the race fights with honor i cannot deny it i almost killed a starship of yours but your pilot accepted my surrender and did not kill me and now this it is very kind go on you will not want to keep the driver waiting or he will be annoyed gorppet said the driver would undoubtedly be annoyed anyhow at having to take a big ugly somewhere but gorppet didnt mention that he did say i hope you find your mate and your hatchlings so do i drucker said you have no idea how much i do that was bound to be literally true given the different emotional and sexual patterns of tosevites and members of the race drucker got to his feet he bent into an awkward version of the posture of respect then hurried out of the tent hozzanet the male whod recruited gorppet into security came into the tent just after drucker had left making friends with the big uglies he asked his voice dry but then his voice was usually dry as a matter of fact yes superior sir gorppet explained what hed done and why he waited to find out if hozzanet would think hed overstepped but the other male said that is good that is very good in fact the more links we have with the tosevites the better off we are and the easier this occupation will be my thought exactly gorppet said by all the signs the only thing that keeps the deutsche from rising against us is the certainty that they will lose i agree hozzanet said our superiors also agree they take the idea of trouble from the deutsche very seriously indeed you were right and i was right these big uglies are caching weapons against a day of rebellion we recently discovered a double ten of landcruisers along with supplies hidden in the galleries of an abandoned coal mine a good thing we did discover them gorppet exclaimed i missed that report the other interesting question is what have we failed to discover and will we find out only when it is too late yes that is always the interesting question hozzanet shrugged we made this place radioactive once we can always make it radioactive again i do not think the deutsche have managed to conceal any great number of explosivemetal weapons anyhow and they surely have no longrange delivery systems left gorppet said whatever they have they can only use it against us here inside the territory of the reich he laughed a wry laugh how reassuring reassuring for the race hozzanet said not so reassuring for the males here that i can hardly deny he swung an eye turret toward gorppet things could have been worse you know if you had stayed in the infantry then you could have been trying to fight your way up into the notempire called the united states i am just as well pleased we avoided that fight thank you very much gorppet said i do not think we would have had a pleasant time trying to force our way up from the south on a front that got wider the farther we went you see i have been examining the maps that is what you should do that is why they go into the databases hozzanet said but i do not think there would have been so much ground combat on the lesser continental mass as there was here here the deutsche invaded our territory so we had to fight them on the ground against the usa we probably would have used missiles to batter the notempire into submission then picked up the pieces with infantrymales gorppet considered yes that sounds reasonable but they would have used missiles against us too as the deutsche did that would have been unpleasant just as well the war did not happen he expected hozzanet to say truth but the other male hesitated i wonder he said what was hoped of course was that the american big uglies would surrender their space installations when they gave up a city instead that left their capacity for mischief undiminished sooner or later we w have to deal with them i suppose so gorppet sighed this world is doing horrible things to all of us when i went into one of the new towns the colonists ran up i did not fit there at all even though it hatched out of an egg from home i am sick of being a soldier but i have no idea what else i might do with my life and if we of the conquest fleet stop being soldiers what will the colonists do against the big uglies hozzanet sighed too that i am given to understand is under discussion at levels more exalted than our own as i see it the colonists have two choices they can learn to be soldiers or they can learn to live under the rule of the big uglies oh good gorppet said i see no other choices either i was wondering if you did he stood up from the computer monitor shall we head over to the refectory tent my insides are empty mine too hozzanet agreed the refectory was serving azwaca ribs gorppet fell to with a will hed got used to eating tosevite foods before the colonization fleet came hed come to like some of them especially pork but the meats of home were better without a doubt after eating he went back to work the day was drawing to a close when the telephone attachment hissed when he answered it the quartermasters face appeared in the monitor he said the motorcar i sent out with the big ugly has not come back it should have gorppet answered that neu strelitz place is not very far away well it cursed well has not the quartermaster answered i am worried about my driver chinnoss is a good male what have you got to say for yourself something has gone wrong that was all gorppet could think of to say had drucker betrayed him or had someone betrayed druckerwe had better find out what david goldfarb looked up from his work as hal walsh sauntered back into the saskatchewan river widget works after going out for lunch goldfarb scratched his head his boss was a highpressure type if ever there was one up till the past couple of weeks david had never seen him saunter hed moved everywhere as if he needed to get there day before yesterday that dreamy look on his face was new too seeing it made a light bulb come on above goldfarbs head you went out to lunch with my doctor again to his amazement walsh blushed like a schoolgirl well yes as a matter of fact i did he said janes quite something cant argue with you there goldfarb said most sincerely if i were ten fifteen years younger and single id give you a run for your money maybe even if i werent ten fifteen years younger next time i see naomi ill tell her you said that walsh said im allowed to look goldfarb answered im allowed to think im also allowed to keep my hands to myself if i want to keep them on the ends of my arms sounds like a sensible arrangement his boss said oh and speaking of your hands jane asked me to ask you how your fingers doing since she took out the stitches after flexing the digit in question david said its not half bad still a little sore but not half bad he eyed hal walsh i gather she thinks youll have the chance to pass this on to her some time fairly soon sure as the devil walsh blushed again thats right he coughed a couple of times then went on you know cutting that finger may have been the best thing you ever did for me i like that goldfarb said in mock high dudgeon i like that quite a lot here i give you the phonenumber reader and what do i get credit for he grinned for working my finger to the bone thats what he held it up again walsh groaned and held up a different finger they both laughed jack devereaux came into the office just then he saw his boss upraised digit same to you hal he said and used the same gesture you dont even know why you did that walsh said any excuse in a storm devereaux answered the raf was never like this goldfarb said the only time hed known anything even close to such informality in the raf had been in the days when he was working under group captain fred hippie desperately trying to learn all he could about lizard radars and jet engines hed looked back fondly on those days till basil roundbush whod worked with him then came back into his life he hadnt heard anything from roundbush lately or from any of roundbushs canadian associates either nor had anybody tried to kill him lately he approved of that he would have been hard pressed to think of anything he approved of more than not getting killed in fact he would have been happier still had he known roundbush had given up for good unfortunately he knew nothing of the sort and roundbush was not the sort to give up easily but every day without trouble was one more day won hed thought that way during the war first during the battle of britain when nobodyd known if the nazis would invade and then after the lizards came till they did invade with the return of peacetime hed been able to look further ahead again but trouble brought him back to counting the days one at a time walsh said shall we see if we can get something more useful than the odd obscene gesture done today mine wasnt odd devereaux said i did it right by dint of long practice i have no doubt his boss replied goldfarb expected the frenchcanadian engineer to demonstrate the gesture again but devereaux refrained walsh looked faintly disappointed devereaux caught davids eye and winked goldfarb grinned then coughed to give himself an excuse to put a hand in front of his face so hal walsh wouldnt notice eventually they did get down to work david had the feeling it was going to be one of those afternoons where nothing much got accomplished he turned out to be right too hed had a lot of those afternoons in the raf far fewer since coming to canada the reason for that wasnt hard to figure out the british government could afford them a lot more easily than the saskatchewan river widget works could but they did happen now and again he was as always these days wary when he walked home nothing like almost getting killed to make you pay attention to the maniacs on the highway he thought but nobody tried to run him down all the maniacs in the big american cars were maniacal because of their native stupidity not because they wanted to rub out one david goldfarb something smells good he said when he opened the door from the kitchen naomi answered its a roasting chicken itll be ready in about half an hour do you feel like a bottle of beer first cant think of anything id like more he answered she popped the tops off a couple of mooseheads and brought them out to the front room thanks goldfarb said and kissed her the kiss went on for a while when it broke he said well maybe i can think of something id like more what are the children doing right now homework naomi gave him a sidelong look and doled out another word optimist we made it here to edmonton didnt we david said and then in what wasnt quite a non sequitur the children are bound to go to bed sooner or later as big as they were getting that marked him as an optimist too he sat down on the sofa and sipped the beer thats not bad he said it doesnt match what a proper pub would give you right from the barrel but its not bad you can drink it he took another sip as if to prove as much whats new his wife asked ill tell you what my boss is seeing the doctor who sewed up my finger he said shes worth seeing too i will say smiling sweetly naomi put an elbow in his ribs careful there he exclaimed you almost made me spill my beer now i have to figure out whether to say anything about it the next time i write to moishe in jerusalem why wouldnt you say oh naomi said this is the doctor who was going with reuven russie isnt it david nodded thats right she didnt want to stay in a country the lizards ruled and he didnt feel like emigrating and so he shrugged he suspected that had he been close to marrying jane archibald and she told him she wanted to move to siam he would have started learning siamese having already got one elbow in the ribs he didnt tell that to naomi instead of another elbow he got a raised eyebrow theyd been married twenty years sometimes he could get in trouble without saying a word this looked to be one of those times im going to check the chicken she said hed never heard that sound like a threat before but it did now shed just opened the oven door when the telephone rang ill get it david said whoever it is hes messed it up he was bound to be trying to call us at suppertime he picked up the handset hullo hello goldfarb ice and fire ran up davids back it was basil roundbush goldfarb looked to the phonenumber reader it showed the calls origin as the united kingdom but no more than that roundbushs blocking device was still on the job what the devil do you want goldfarb snarled i rang to tell you that you can call off your dogs thats what roundbush answered he sounded ten years older than he had the last time hed blithely threatened goldfarbs destruction or maybe it was just that for once his voice had lost its jauntiness what the hell are you talking about david asked he kept his voice low so as not to alarm naomi that of course was plenty to bring her out of the kitchen to find out what was going on he mouthed roundbushs name her eyes widened i told you call off your dogs the raf officer and ginger dealer said ive got the message believe you me i do i shant be troubling you any more so you need no longer be concerned on that score how do i know i can believe a word of that goldfarb still hadnt the faintest idea what basil roundbush was talking about but he liked the way it sounded letting on that he was ignorant didnt strike him as a good idea because i bloody well dont want to get my sodding head blown off thats how roundbush burst out your little friends have come too close twice and i know theyll manage it properly sooner or later enough is enough in my book were quits if he wasnt telling the truth he should have been a cinema actor goldfarb knew he was good but hadnt thought he was that good well see he said in what he hoped were suitably menacing tones ive said everything im going to say roundbush told him as far as im concerned the quarrel is over dont like it so well when the shoe is on the other foot eh goldfarb asked still trying to find out what the devil was going on a conciliatory basil roundbush was as unlikely an item as a giggling polar bear bloody nazis havent got enough to do now that the reich has gone down the loo roundbush said bitterly i really hadnt thought you of all people would be able to pull those wires but one never can tell these days can one he hung up before david could find another word to say nil naomi demanded as goldfarb slowly hung up the phone too i dont know he answered i really dont know he said he was going to leave me alone and that i should call my dogs off him he said theyd almost killed him twice he said they were nazis too hes meshuggeh naomi exclaimed she added one of the lizards emphatic coughs for good measure i think so too david said he must have fallen foul of the germans somehow and he thinks im behind it and do you know what if he wants to think so its fine by me but what happens if these people whoever they are keep going after roundbush naomi asked wont he blame you and get his friends over here to come after you again he might goldfarb admitted i dont know what i can do about it though whoevers going after that mamzer i havent got anything to do with it he rolled his eyes nazis the only nazis i ever knew were the ones i saw with radar during the fighting what do you think we ought to do naomi asked goldfarb shrugged i dont know what we can do except go on the way weve been going as long as were careful dear basils goons wont have an easy time getting us anyhow one eyebrow climbed toward his hairline and who knows maybe those blokes whoever they are will put paid to him after all i wouldnt shed a tear ill tell you that neither would i naomi said warm mediterranean sunshine poured down from a brilliant blue sky the water was every bit as blue only two shades darker gulls and terns wheeled overhead every so often one of them would plunge into the sea sometimes it would come out with a fish in its beak sometimes more often rance auerbach thought it wouldnt he lit a cigarette it was a french brand and pretty vile but american tobacco even when you could get it was impossibly expensive over here of course american tobacco would have set him coughing too so he couldnt blame that on the frogs he sipped some wine hed never been much for the stuff but french beer tasted like mule piss raising the glass he grinned at penny summers mud in your eye then he turned to sturmbannfuhrerd e er kuhn who was sharing the table at the seaside cafe with them prost they all drank the ss man spoke much better french than either rance or penny in that good french he said i regret that group captain roundbush unfortunately survived another encounter with my friends quelle dommagerance said though he didnt really think it was a pity it will be necessary to try again for again he said wieder because he could come up with the german word but not its french equivalent hed taken french and german both at west point because hed been using his french here in marseille it had less rust on it than his german did but neither was what anybody would call fluent life is strange pennys french like auerbachs relied on cliches she went on in canada we tried to deal with roundbush now we try to kill him strange indeed kuhn said with a smile he probably thought was a real ladykiller the last time we were all in marseille it was part of the reich and it was my duty to arrest the two of you now the republique francaise is reborn and we are all here as simple tourists nobody laughed too loudly that might have drawn more notice than they wanted penny said now we are on the same side we have the same enemies anyhow rance said he didnt want to think of the ss man as being on his side even if that was how things stood the same enemies yes but different reasons dieter kuhn said maybe he wasnt happy about lining up with a couple of americans either we want to make pierre dutourd want to work with us and not with roundbush and his associates while you want to help your friend in canada reasons are not important penny said results are important truth auerbach and kuhn said it at the same time both in the lizards language they gave each other suspicious looks neither of them used an emphatic cough auerbach drank some more wine then asked the german will you tell your superiors in flensburg you work with us to help a jew of course not kuhn answered at once but i do not think they would care much not as things are now i break no secrets in saying that to rebuild the reich needs money we can get money through selling ginger to the lizards if dutourd works with us works through us that helps bring in money and so for now i do not much care about jews getting rid of the englishman and bringing dutourd to heel is more important for the time being as things are now for the time being rance eyed the sturmbannfuhrer as he would have eyed a rattlesnake kuhn and presumably kuhns bosses hadnt given up taking it on the chin hell getting knocked out of the ring had made them change their priorities but auerbach didnt think it had made them change their minds he asked how goes the rebuilding how closely do the lizards watch you merde a ors kuhn exclaimed in fine pseudogallic disgust their eye turrets are everywhere their snouts are everywhere a man cannot go into a p sso rand unbutton his fly without having a lizard see how he is hung too bad rance said about half of him meant it the balance of power between the lizards and mankind had swung toward the race when germany went down in flames the other half of auerbach the part that remembered the days before the lizards came the days when hitlers goons were the worst enemies around hoped the nazis would never get back on their feet maybe a little of that showed on his face or maybe dieter kuhn was a pretty fair needier in his own right deadpan he asked and how is it with indianapolis these days auerbach shrugged all i know is what i read in the newspapers newspapers here say what the lizards want the french are whores kuhn didnt bother keeping his voice down they gave to the reich now they give to the race he rose threw down enough jingly aluminum coins to cover the tab and strode away penny went back to english thats one unhappy fellow even if he hides it pretty good you bet rance agreed ill tell you i like him a hell of a lot better by his lonesome than in front of a bunch of soldiers toting submachine guns amen penny said fervently you know something rance im goddamn tired of having people point guns at me is what i am after lighting another foulsmelling french cigarette auerbach eyed her through the smoke he puffed out you know kid you might have picked the wrong line of work in that case she laughed now why the hell didnt i think of that were not doing too bad here this time around rance saidbetter than i expected we would ill say that instead of laughing again penny pretended to faint that made auerbach laugh which made him start coughing which made him feel as if his chest were coming to pieces penny thumped him on the back it didnt help much she said dont tell me things like that my heart wont stand it dont worry im not going to make a habit of it auerbach filled his glass from the carafe of red wine that sat on the table this is a complicated deal you know weve got to stay on dutourds good side on account of were doing business with him and weve got to stay on kuhns good side on account of were doing business with him too and they dont like each other for beans itd be a lot easier if you didnt have anything to do with that damn nazi penny said we dont need to not as far as moneys concerned oh i know rance answered but i told that roundbush son of a bitch that i was going to tie a tin can to his tail and i damn well meant it he laughed at me nobody laughs at me and gets away with it nobody you hear penny didnt say anything right away she lit a cigarette of her own took a puff made a face and took a sip of wine to help get rid of the taste she studied him through her smoke screen at last words did come from her anybody took a look at you or listened to you for just a little while hed figure you were a wreck hed be right too rance said at once with a certain perverse pride but penny shook her head she drew on the cigarette again goddamn i dont know why i smoke these things except i get so jumpy when i dont she paused where was i oh yeah youre like an old crowbar all covered with rust anybody looks at it he figures he can break it over his knee but its solid iron in the middle you can smash somebodys head in with it as easy as not auerbach grunted he wasnt used to praise even ambiguous praise like that from her and he enjoyed feeling decrepit whenever he failed at something he had a builtin excuse he said hell my own crowbar doesnt work the way its supposed to half the time these days penny snorted then she said youre sandbagging which held an uncomfortable amount of truth you want to head back to the hotel or you want to come shopping with me ill head back to the hotel he said without the least hesitation you go shopping the way a biggame hunter goes on safari that was also a compliment of sorts penny headed off to pit her bad french and her air of midwestern natvete against the merchants of marseille rance took a taxi over to la residence bompard he hadnt been there long before somebody knocked on the door the luger hed acquired wasnt legal but a lot of the things hed been doing in france werent legal who is it he asked his raspy voice sharp with suspicion he wasnt expecting company to his surprise the answer came back in english it is i monique dutourd oh he slid the pistol into a pocket before opening the door hello he said also in english come in make yourself at home thank you she looked around the room then slowly nodded yes this is what it is like to be civilized i remember it has been a while sit down auerbach said can i get you some wine she shook her head he asked what can i do for you then i wish to know her english was slow and precise she had to think between words as he did for french though she spoke a little better why it is that you are friendly with that ss man that dieter kuhn she said several words after that in incandescent french french nothing like what hed studied at west point he didnt know exactly what they meant but the tone was unmistakable why he said because he and i have an enemy who is the same do you remember goldfarb the jew that english ginger dealer sent here when this was still part of the reich he waited for her to nod then went on i am using the nazi to take revenge on the englishman i see she said if it were me i would use the englishman to take revenge on the nazi who made me into his harlot is that a proper english word harlot i understand it yes rance said uncomfortably im sorry miss dutourd but what it looks like to me is a lot of the people in the ginger business are bastards and you have to pick the one who will help you the most at any one time for me right now thats kuhn like i say im sorry you are she groped for a word again forthright rance smiled he couldnt help himself hed never heard anybody actually say forthright before he waved for her to go on and she did in this you are like my brother he makes no apology for what it is that he does either im not sorry to do the lizards a bad turn any way i can rance said turning them into ginger addicts isnt as good as shooting them but it will do i do not love the lizards but i feel about the bodies as you feel about they about them monique dutourd corrected herself and how does your brother feel auerbach wasnt about to waste a chance to gather information on the people with whom he was dealing he got more than he bargained for pierre monique dutourds lip curled in fine contempt as long as he can get his money he does not care whence it comes auerbach hadnt heard whence very often either he got the idea shed learned english from books she added and if he does not get his money when he should then unfortunate things it could be would happen sure as hell that was worth knowing all the same rance might have been happier not hearing it he and penny remained small fish in a tank full of sharks peking was home liu han hadnt been sure not when she first came back to the city but it was to her real astonishment she even found herself glad to be eating noodles more often than rice this is very strange she said to liu mei using her chopsticks to grab a mouthful of buckwheat noodles from their bowl of broth and slurping them up noodles felt like foreign food to me when i first came here theyre good liu mei took noodles for granted why not shed been eating them all her life talking about noodles was safe this little eatery wasnt one where party members gathered the scrawny man at the next table might have been a kuomintang operative the fat fellow on the other side the one who looked as if hed bring in a good sum if rendered into grease might have worked for the little scaly devils that was in fact pretty likely men who worked for the scaly devils made enough to let them eat well hard times liu han said with a sigh her daughter nodded but better days are coming im sure of it saying that was safe too all sides even the little devils thought their triumph meant better times ahead for china liu han raised the bowl of noodles to her face and took another mouthful she hoped that would cover the outrage she might show when thinking of what a triumph by the little scaly devils would mean they finished eating and got up to go theyd already paid this wasnt the sort of place where the proprietor would trust people to leave money on the counter as they went out onto the hutung the alley in front of the little food shop liu han said we finally have enough tea in the city do we liu mei said as men and women all intent on their own affairs hurried past the hutung was in shadow it was so narrow that the sun had to be at just the right angle to slide down into it a man leading a donkey loaded with sacks of millet had people flattening themselves against the walls to either side to let him by liu mei didnt smile she couldnt but her eyes brightened at what her mother said thats good it took us long enough before liu han could answer a fly lit on the end of her nose looking at it crosseyed she fanned her hand in front of her face the fly flew off it was of course only one of thousands millions billions they flourished in peking as they did in peasant villages another would probably land on her somewhere in a minute she said well this is special tea you know not just the ordinary sort it took a long time to pick the very best and bring it up from the south too long liu mei was in one of those moods where she disapproved of everything liu han understood that staying patient wasnt easy not when every day saw the little scaly devils sinking their claws ever deeper into the flesh of china liu mei went on well have to boil the fire up really hot cant make good tea any other way liu han agreed they came out of the alley onto hsia hsieh chieh lower slanting street in the western part of the chinese city not far from the temple of everlasting spring bicycles rickshaws wagons foot traffic motorcars buses trucks lower slanting street was wide enough for all of them because it was and because everyone used it traffic moved at the speed of the slowest more often than not that was an annoyance the little scaly devils in a mechanized fighting vehicle must have thought so they had to crawl along with everyone else scaly devils were impatient creatures they hated having to wait they ran their own lives so waiting was only rarely necessary moving along jammed chinese streets though what choice did they have when liu han said that aloud liu mei said they could just drive over people or start shooting who would stop them who could stop them they are the imperialist occupiers they can do as they please they can yes but they would touch off riots if they did liu han said they are most of them smart enough to know that they dont want us to get stirred up they just want us to be good and to be quiet and to let them rule us and not to cause them any trouble and so theyll sit in traffic just as if they were people but they have the power to start running people over or to start shooting liu mei said they think they have the right to do those things whether they choose to do them or not theres the evil that they think they have the right of course it is liu han agreed i dont suppose people can do anything about having the little scaly devils here on earth with us its too late for that but having them think they have the right to rule us thats a different business we should be free if they cant see that they need reeducating she smiled maybe we could all sit down together over tea no her daughter couldnt smile one more score to lay at the feet of the little devils but liu mei nodded and said i think that would be very good the little scaly devils machine tried to slide into a space just ahead but a man on an oxcart squeezed in first he had to lash the ox to make it move fast enough to get ahead of the armored vehicle as soon as he found himself in front of it he set down the whip and let the ox amble along at its own plodding pace that did infuriate the scaly devils their machine let out a loud horrible hiss as if to cry get out of the way the man on the oxcart might have been deaf for all the good that did them people liu han among them laughed and cheered the fellow on the oxcart took off his broad straw hat and waved it acknowledging the applause if the little scaly devils understood that it probably made them angrier than ever unless they chose to get violent they could do nothing about it then more laughter rose it started a couple of blocks up lower slanting street and quickly spread toward liu han and liu mei liu han stood on tiptoe but couldnt see over the heads of the people around her what is it she asked her daughter who was several inches taller liu mei said its a troop of devilboys cutting up capers and acting like fools disapproval filled her voice the young men and sometimes young women who imitated the little scaly devils and adopted their ways were anathema to the communist party they learned the little devils language they wore tight clothes decorated with markings that looked like body paint some of them even shaved their heads so as to look more like the alien imperialists there were such young people in the united states too but the united states was still free perhaps people there could afford the luxury of fascination with the scaly devils and their ways china couldnt but then liu mei gasped in surprise oh she said these are not ordinary devilboys what are they doing liu han asked irritably i still cant see she stood on tiptoe again it still didnt help annoying her further all her daughter said was wait a bit theyre coming this way youll be able to see for yourself in a minute luckily for liu mei she was right and by the time liu han could see shouts and cheers from the crowd had given her some idea of what was going on then peering over her daughters shoulder and through a gap in the crowd in front of them she did indeed see and like everyone around her she started laughing and cheering herself liu mei had also been right in saying this was no ordinary troop of devilboys instead of slavishly imitating the little scaly devils they burlesqued them they pretended to be a mixed group of males and females all taking ginger and all mating frenetically throw water on them shouted one wouldbe wit near liu han no give them more ginger someone else yelled that got a bigger laugh and then liu han started shouting too tao shengming you come here this instant one of the devilboys looked up in surprise at hearing his name called liu han waved to him she wondered how well he could see her she also wondered whether hed recognize her even if he could see her they hadnt met in more than three years and she didnt think he knew her name whether he knew it or not he hurried over when she called and he did recognize her she could see that in his eyes or maybe he just recognized liu mei who being much closer to his own age and much prettier was likelier to have stuck in his mind no when he spoke it was to liu han hello lady i greet you the last three words were in the language of the race and i greet you she answered in the same tongue then she returned to chinese i am glad to see you came through safe after all the troubles peking has seen since the last time we ran into each other i managed from his tone he was used to managing such things his grin was wry amused older than his years and im glad to see youre all right too you and your pretty daughter yes he remembered liu mei all right he sent that grin her way she looked back as if he were something nasty shed found on the sole of her shoe that only made his grin wider which annoyed liu mei and amused liu han she asked the question that needed asking did you ever go and visit old lin at mas brocade shop if tao shengming had visited old lin hed have been recruited into the communist party if he hadnt it was just as well that he didnt know liu hans name but he nodded his eyes glowed oh yes i did that he said i know more about comradeship now than i ever did before shall i tell you what he lowered his voice mao says about the four characteristics of chinas revolutionary war never mind liu han said so long as you know them he wouldnt unless he was a communist himself or unless hes bait for a trap liu han thought but she shook her head had the little scaly devils known she was coming into peking they would have seized her they wouldnt have bothered with traps taos grin came back oh yes i know them i know all sorts of things i never thought i would know i have many things to blame you for i mean to thank you for he might be a communist but he was still a devilboy too he enjoyed being outrageous the foolish skit that he and his fellows had been performing proved that did you have fun there making the little devils look ridiculous to the masses liu han asked him he nodded of course i did that was the point of the antics good propaganda dont you think very good liu han agreed i will have to do some talking with the central committee that made tao shengmings eyes widen as shed hoped it would but i think you and your devilboys may prove even more useful in the continuing revolutionary struggle how tao was pantingly eager liu han smiled at liu mei why in the matter of the special tea thats come up from the south of course liu han laughed liu mei didnt but she nodded tao shengming looked most intrigued liu han laughed again sure enough she knew how to get devilboy wildness to serve the party there is no justice monique dutourd spoke with great assurance and equally great bitterness her brother was shaving with a straight razor a little soap and a handheld mirror pierre paused with the right side of his face scraped clean and the left still full of lather and whiskers all he said was now tell me something i did not know oh shut up she snarled you dont mind working with that nazi again no matter what he did to me pierre dutourd sighed and raised his chin so he could shave under it some small part of monique hoped hed cut his throat he didnt of course he guided the razor with effortless practiced skill he didnt talk while shaving around his larynx but when he started on his left cheek he said nobody in this business is a saint little sister the nazi was screwing you the englishmen were screwing somebody else that jew the american said nobody is a saint monique rolled her eyes well if i didnt already know that you would prove it merc beaucoup pierre was hard to infuriate which was one of the most infuriating things about him he finished shaving rinsed and dried his razor then washed his face with the water left in the enameled basin he toweled himself dry and examined himself in the mirror only after a selfsatisfied nod did he continue you know that if you grow too unhappy here you are always free to go elsewhere there are times when i would say you were welcome to go elsewhere ha monique thought did hit a nerve there even if he doesnt want to let it show but pierre had hit a nerve too and painfully monique still had nowhere else to go and she knew it she had received a couple of more letters from universities that had survived the fighting nobody seemed to need a roman historian whose university was now nothing but rubble that made a geiger counter click she said you may be sure that when the chance comes i will take it each word might have been chipped from ice meanwhile though you would be wise not to bite the hand that feeds you her brother went on almost as if she hadnt spoken you would also be wise to become useful to someone in some way useful monique made it a swear word arent you glad youre usefuho the lizards of course i am he answered if i werent i would have had to work much harder for most of my life people i dont like would have told me what to do much more than they do now things could have been better yes but they also could have been much worse he was impervious monique stormed out of the tent shed been doing that more and more often these days this time she almost ran into a lizard who was about to come in excusez ro he said in hissing french monique strode past him without a word shed just got to the edge of the tent city when a double handful of lizards hurried past her they were all carrying weapons she was no great expert on the many patterns of body paint the race used but she thought theirs which were all similar to one another had to do with law enforcement uhoh she thought she turned and looked back sure enough they too were heading for the tent shed just left and she couldnt do anything about it they were moving faster than she could she was too far away to scream out a warning to her brother and after this latest blowup she wasnt much inclined to scream out a warning anyway she waited sure enough the lizards emerged with not only the one whod gone before them but also with her brother in custody they marched their prisoners out of the camp marched them right past monique though pierre didnt notice her hustled them into a waiting motorcar with flashing orange lights and drove them away well monique thought what do i do now she hadnt wanted to look for work in a shop that would have been as much as admitting that shed never find another academic position as long as she could live with pierre and lucie shed been able to indulge those hopes when you couldnt indulge your hopes any more what did you do if you had any sense you buckled down and got on with your life with her brother a captive of the race she was going to have to get on with her life if she wanted to keep eating shop girl scullery maid anything this side of selling herself on the street dieter kuhn had made her do something all too close to that never again she vowed to herself better to jump off a cliff and hope she landed on her head everything would be over in a hurry then hitting bottom here realizing shed have to look for work that had nothing to do with her degree might have felt like that it might have but it didnt instead it was oddly liberating all right she couldnt be a professor or at least she couldnt be a professor right now shed be something else then she started out of the camp and toward the rebuilding city of marseille she hadnt gone very far before she ran into lucie coming back from the city unlike her own brother lucie recognized her of course the lizards hadnt just seized lucie either monique was tempted to let her go back to the tent maybe the lizards had left some sort of alarm behind so they could swoop down again when she did return but pierres mistress hadnt given monique a bad time lucie had in fact been easier to get along with than her own brother and so she said be careful the lizards just grabbed pierre oh for the love of god lucie said was that the car i saw going downhill toward town thats right monique nodded pierre and i had another fight id just gone out when a lizard a customer i mean went in and i hadnt gone a whole lot farther before a whole squad of lizard flics came in and grabbed pierre and the lizard customer too lucie said something considerably more pungent than oh for the love of god she went on keffesh was afraid they were shadowing him pierre was a fool to let him come to the tent what are you going to do monique asked lucie grimaced ill need to find somewhere to stay id be an idiot to go back there now then ill have to make some phone calls i need to warn some people and some lizards and i have to ask a few questions if i like the answers i get ill set up in business for myself ive been pierres right hand and a couple of fingers of his left for a long time my connections are as good as his and i daresay im a lot better at being careful than he ever was all that took monique by surprise she didnt know why it should have she knew roman history what did lucie know selling ginger ruefully monique admitted to herself that the demand for ginger dealers seemed to be stronger than that for romanists her brothers mistress might have been thinking along with her what about you monique she asked what will you do look for work monique answered i mean any kind of work not a university position i have to eat and she sighed i suppose ill see what i can do about getting pierre out of jail she noticed lucie hadnt said anything about that pierres mistress also sighed yes i guess we will have to see about that wont we but it wont be easy the lizards officials are death on ginger you need connections to be able to get anywhere with them have you got any i may monique answered which seemed to take lucie by surprise and im sure that you do maybe yes lucie sounded grudging if pierre got out of jail she would have more trouble going into business for herself bleakly monique said one of the connections we both may have is dieter kuhn if we decide we need to use him youll have to be the one who makes the approach i cant do it not even for my brother i dont think well have to worry about that lucie said when the lizards question pierre hell sing hell sing like a nightingale thats about the only thing i can think of that might make them go easy on him dont you think theyd be pleased if he could hand them a nice juicy nazi that might let them squeeze some fresh concessions out of the germans monique eyed her with sudden respect lucie wasnt a fool no she wasnt a fool at all and ginger smuggling was a network that tied the whole world together no wonder pierres mistress was so quick to think in terms of geopolitics if pierre sings monique said slowly hell sing about the americans too but of course lucie said and so what i never did see the point of dealing with them americans her lip curled they deserved to have a city blown up up till now theyve had it easy most of them still do theyre people monique said i dont want to give them to the lizards im sure i dont know why not lucie shrugged have it your way im not going to lose any sleep about them i tell you that or lift a finger for them either they wouldnt do it for me however wide her world view could be lucie still came first in her own eyes monique went on into marseille she didnt dare go back to the tent even to get her bicycle the lizards might return for her too keffesh had seen her with pierre and lucie and shed interpreted for pierre when he talked with the americans in the eyes of the race that was probably more than enough to convict her when she got to the edge of the city she found a public telephone and fed a couple of francs into it she called the hotel where rance auerbach and penny summers were staying the phone rang several times she was on the point of giving up when a man answered alia auerbachs accent was ludicrously bad monique chose english to make sure he wouldnt misunderstand her the lizards have pierre do you know what that means you bet i do he answered which she took for an affirmative it means im in a hell of a lot of trouble merche hung up for good measure monique wiped the telephone clean of fingerprints with her sleeve after she hung up too she assumed the lizards would be listening to auerbachs phone and that they could trace the call back to this one but let them try proving shed been the one who made it and having done one of the things shed needed to do she could get on with taking care of the rest she walked into a dress shop strode up to a man who looked like the manager and asked excuse me but could you use another salesgirl nesseref was glad she could finally take orbit for walks again without worrying much about residual radioactivity the tsiongi was glad too hed used the exercise wheel in her apartment but it hadnt been the same now he could go out see new sights smell new smells and get frustrated all over again when tosevite birds flew away just as he was on the point of catching them he still looked absurdly indignant every time the feathered creatures eluded him he seemed to think they were cheating by fluttering off this world had a much larger variety of flying beasts than home did local predators probably took such escapes for granted as far as orbit was concerned they broke the rules befflem running around without leashes broke the rules too as on home there were regulations in the new towns on tosev against letting befflem run free as on home those regulations werent worth much here befflem were much more inclined to do what they wanted than what the race wanted them to do if theyd had more brains they might have served as models for big uglies had orbit been able to get his mouth and claws on a beffel he would have made short work of it but the befflem seemed smart enough to understand he was on a leash and they werent they would squeak as infuriatingly as they could inviting him to chase them and he would just as he went after birds the leash in nesseref s hand brought him up short every time no she told him for the third time on the walk inside the apartment he knew what the word meant he obeyed it most of the time out in the fresh air he did his best to forget beep said a beffel half a block away once more orbit tried to charge after it once more nesseref wouldnt let him orbit turned an eye turret toward her in what had to be reproach the other turret he kept fixed on the beffel which sat there scratching itself and then said beep again no nesseref repeated as the tsiongi again tried to go after it she used an emphatic cough that meant nothing to orbit even if it gave her some small satisfaction still beeping the beffel trotted off long before orbit got close enough to be dangerous by then nesseref was starting to wonder whether her pet had pulled her arm out of its socket who is getting the exercise here she thought glaring at the tsiongi shortly thereafter neither of them got any exercise orbit sat down on the sidewalk and refused to move his attitude seemed to be if i am not allowed to do what i want i have no intention of doing what you want tsiongyu were proud beasts offend their dignity and you had trouble but nesseref knew tsiongyu and knew how to coax them out of their sulks she reached into a pouch she wore on a belt around her middle and pulled out a treat she tossed it a little in front of orbit sure enough he forgot he was sulking he trotted over and grabbed it after that he was walking again nesseref gave him another treat to keep him moving some tsiongyu eventually figured out that staging sulks every so often would get them more than their share of treats orbit was still young and hadnt acquired such duplicity as tsiongyu went he was a goodtempered beast too and not in the habit of sitting down on the job he tried to catch a couple of birds on the way back to the apartment but no more befflem appeared to torment him for which small favor nesseref cast down her eye turrets and muttered a few words of thanks to spirits of emperors past as it always did the elevator that took her and orbit up to the story on which her apartment stood fascinated the tsiongi orbits eye turrets went every which way before settling on nesseref once more she wondered what was going through his mind perhaps that shed just performed a particularly good conjuring trick once inside the apartment orbit jumped into his wheel and started running as if a beffel as big as a bus were hot on his heels you are a very foolish beast nesseref said severely orbit paid no attention whatever nesseref hadnt expected him to and so wasnt disappointed she went into her bedchamber and checked to see if she had any electronic messages she found none that needed answering right away and a couple that she immediately deleted why males and females shed never met thought she would shift credit to their account for services she didnt want and they seemed unlikely to perform was beyond her she supposed they found customers here and there on the electronic network to her that only proved that a hundred thousand years of civilization werent long enough to produce sophistication into the electronic garbage heap those messages went nesseref had just seen them vanish when the telephone hissed shuttlecraft pilot nesseref i greet you she said crisply wondering if it were a new assignment but the image that appeared on the screen was not a superior with ordens but a big ugly i greet you shuttlecraft pilot he said i know males and females of the race have trouble telling one tosevite from another so i will tell you that i am mordechai anielewicz and i greet you my friend nesseref replied i will tell you that you are the only tosevite likely to call me at my home how are you was your search for your mate and hatchlings successful too late she wished she hadnt said that the answer was too likely to be no if it were no she would have saddened the big ugly friends had no business saddening friends but anielewicz answered yes and used an emphatic cough he went on and do you know what pancer the beffel my hatchling heinrichs pet helped lead me to them did he nesseref exclaimed tell me how and i promise not to tell my tsiongi by the concise way anielewicz gave her the story she guessed hed already told it several times when hed finished she said you were very fortunate truth he agreed i will thank god a word not in the language of the race for the rest of my life he paused you would call this my superstition and thank the spirits of emperors past instead i understand nesseref paused too then offered a cautious comment you tosevites take your superstitions very seriously when we opened shrines to the spirits of emperors past here in poland hardly any tosevites either of your superstition or that of the poles entered them after the latest round of fighting few of those shrines still stood she suspected they would be rebuilt one day but more urgent concerns preoccupied the race mordechai anielewicz laughed loud tosevite laughter how many males and females of the race give reverence to god at tosevite shrines why none of course nesseref said a moment later she added oh i see big uglies kept thinking of themselves as equal and equivalent to members of the race such thought patterns didnt come naturally to nesseref she might reckon mordechai anielewicz a friend but most big uglies were to her nothing but barbarians dangerous barbarians but barbarians even so maybe you do anielewicz said laughing again but i did not call you to discuss superstition i hope i am not troubling you but i called to ask another favor if you would be so kind friends may ask favors of friends nesseref said that is one of the things that defines friendship ask if it is in my power you shall have it i thank you anielewicz added another emphatic cough friends are all i have now except for my mate and hatchlings i believe all my relations died in the bombings of lodz and warsaw i am sorry to hear it nesseref said i understand that among tosevites relations take the place good friends hold among the race she understood that in her mind not her liver but she assumed anielewicz realized as much as i said before ask if i can help you i will very well anielewicz paused then said we are for now staying in a refugee center we lived in lodz and lodz of course is no longer a city can you suggest some officials in pinsk with whom we might talk to help arrange housing real housing for us of course please wait while i check to see who would be most likely to help you quickly she used the computers keyboard to access the races table of organization in pinsk after giving anielewicz three or four names she said if you like wait a day or two before calling them i will speak to them first and let them know who you are and what you need that would be wonderful the tosevite told her many of your administrators are also new in poland replacing males and females who perished in the fighting and who were more familiar with me exactly why i made the suggestion nesseref said let me do that now then fine anielewicz even understood she meant the conversation was over a good many members of the race would have gone right on chattering after such a hint but he broke the connection the first call nesseref made to pinsk was to the officer in charge of liaison between the races military forces and those of the big uglies in poland nowhere else on tosev would the race have had such a liaison officer that it had one here still struck nesseref as unnatural but she made use of the male and he to her relief knew who mordechai anielewicz was yes he said i have received reports of his search for his blood kin from a male in security in the reich everyone seems to be astonished that he succeeded in finding them especially with the deutsche so inimical to those of his superstition i certainly was when he telephoned me just now nesseref said i was also surprised to learn that a male who has done the race so many important services should have to inhabit a refugee center because he is unable to find housing for himself his mate and his hatchlings that is unfortunate the liaison officer agreed i thank you for bringing it to my attention perhaps i should speak to someone in the housing authority i wish you would nesseref said i intended to do the same thing myself but they are likelier to listen to a male from the conquest fleet than to a shuttlecraft pilot without any great connections sometimes i think the bureaucrats especially the ones from the colonization fleet pay no attention to anyone except themselves the liaison officer said but what i can do i shall do i assure you of that i thank you nesseref said i think i will also make those phone calls myself perhaps i can reinforce you i count mordechai anielewicz as a friend and i am pleased to do whatever i can for him well of course if he is a friend replied the male from the conquest fleet i have tosevite friends myself so i understand how you feel oh good i am very glad to hear that nesseref said it gives me hope that in spite of everything we may yet be able to live alongside the big uglies on a longterm basis she hesitated rather defensively she added we may the liaison officer didnt laugh at her she feared that was more likely to mean he was polite though than that he agreed with her reuven moishe russie called from the lizards computerandtelephone unit come here for a minute would you you may be able to give me some help i hope you can anyway i could use some im coming father reuven hurried into the front room whats up he asked and then stopped in surprise when he saw shpaaka one of the leading lizard physicians at the russie medical college looking out of the monitor screen at him he shifted into the language of the race i greet you superior sir and i greet you reuven russie shpaaka answered it is good to see you again even if you decided that your superstition precluded you from finishing your studies with us i thank you it is good to see you too seeing shpaaka reminded reuven how much he missed the medical college something he tried not to think about most of the time trying not to think about it now he asked how can i help his father coughed a couple of times i think i will let shpaaka explain it to you as he had begun to explain it to me very well shpaaka said though by his tone it was anything but very well he looked about as uncomfortable as reuven had ever seen a male of the race its something to do with sex he thought it has to be and sure enough the lizard physician said i called your father reuven russie to discuss a case of perversion that made moishe russie speak up it would be better doctor if you discussed the case itself and let us draw the value judgments if any very well though i find it difficult to be dispassionate here shpaaka said the problem concerns a pair from the colonization fleet a female named ppurrin and a male called waxxa they were best friends back on home and they resumed that close friendship after coming to tosev unfortunately after coming to tosev both of them also became addicted to ginger that most pernicious of all herbs uhoh reuven said to his father do i know whats coming next half of it maybe moishe russie answered thats about how much i guessed shpaaka said may i continue as if theyd talked out of turn during one of his lectures when they looked back toward the monitor he went on as you might imagine the two of them began to mate with each other when ppurrin tasted ginger and due to these repeated matings they have conceived a passion for each other altogether inappropriate for members of the race after all during a proper mating season how is one partner much different from another you understand superior sir that we tosevites feel rather differently about such things reuven did his best not to sound anything but dispassionate himself he didnt use an emphatic cough he didnt burst into laughter either i said the same thing his father remarked of course i understand that shpaaka said impatiently it is exactly why i am consulting with you you see ppurrin and waxxa are so blatant in their perverse behavior that they seek a formal exclusive mating arrangement such as is the custom among your species they want to get married reuven exclaimed he said it first in hebrew which shpaaka didnt follow then he translated it into english a tongue the lizard physician did know fairly well and sure enough shpaaka made the affirmative gesture that is exactly what they want to do can you imagine anything more disgusting before answering him reuven spoke quickly to his father well you were right i didnt think of that then he returned to the language of the race and said superior sir i gather you are not simply punishing them because they use ginger we could do that shpaaka admitted but both of them aside from this sexual perversion perform their jobs very well still sanctioning permanent unions of this sort would surely prove destructive of good order why next thing you know they would probably want to rear their hatchlings themselves and teach them the same sort of revolting behavior this time reuven did laugh he couldnt help it he made himself grow serious again saying we tosevites do not consider any of the behavior you have mentioned to be disgusting you know i would agree it is not disgusting for tosevites shpaaka said we of the race found it disgusting in you when we first learned of it but that was some time ago now we have come to see that it is normal for your kind but we do not want our males and females imitating it any more than you would want your males and females imitating our normal practices some of our males might enjoy your mating seasons while their stamina lasted moishe russie said most of our females i agree would not approve you are being irrelevant shpaaka said severely i had hoped for assistance not mockery and sarcasm except for their drug addiction and perverse attraction to each other ppurrin and waxxa as i say are excellent members of the race why not just ignore what they do in private then reuven asked because they refuse to keep it private shpaaka answered as i told you they have requested formal recognition of their status they are proud of what they do and predict that on account of ginger most males and females of the race on tosev will eventually find permanent exclusive sexual partners missionaries for monogamy moishe russie murmured reuven nodded what if they are right he asked shpaaka his former mentor recoiled in horror in that case the colonists on tosev will become the pariahs of the empire when the truth is learned back on home he answered i think it altogether likely that the spirits of emperors past would turn their backs on this whole world as a result he means it reuven realized the lizards dismissed his religion as a superstition he sometimes did the same with theirs here that would be a mistake he said if you do not wish to punish them and you do wish to silence them why not suggest that they emigrate to one of the independent notempires to the united states perhaps ginger is legal there and of necessity he dropped into english they could get married too that is a good idea moishe russie used an emphatic cough that is a very good idea it would get this couple out from under your scales too shpaaka so they cannot agitate among the colonists any more perhaps shpaaka turned an eye turret toward reuven i thank you reuven russie it is at any rate an idea we had not thought of for ourselves we shall consider it farewell his image disappeared from the screen lizards who want to get married reuven turned to his father now he could laugh as much as he wanted to and he did i never would have believed that theyve made people change a lot since they got to earth moishe russie said theyre just starting to find out how much theyve changed too as far as theyre concerned changing us is fine but they dont like it so well when the shoe is on the other foot nobody does if they could stamp out ginger theyd do it in a minute reuven said if we could stamp out alcohol and opium and a lot of other things a lot of us would do it too his father said weve never managed it i dont think theyll have an easy time getting rid of ginger either youre probably right especially since we use it so much in food reuven answered one of these days though they may try try seriously i mean that will be interesting theres one word for it moishe russie winked if these lizards do get married whod give the bride away before reuven could reply the ordinary telephone rang he went over and picked it up hello dr russie a womans voice one with pain in it this is deborah radofsky im sorry to bother you but i just kicked the wall by accident and im afraid ive broken my toe reuven started to tell her that a doctor couldnt do much for a broken toe no matter what news that always delighted his patients he started to tell her to come to the office in the morning if she really wanted to get it examined instead he heard himself saying remind me of your address and ill come over and have a look at it his father blinked are you sure the widow radofsky asked reuven nodded a useless thing to do over a phone without a video attachment after he gave her assurances she could hear she gave him an address it wasnt more than fifteen minutes walk away jerusalem was an important city but not on account of its size a house call moishe russie asked when reuven hung up i admire your energy but you dont do that very often its mrs radofsky reuven answered she thinks shes broken her toe even if she has you wont be able to give her much help and you know it perfectly well his father said i dont see why you didnt just tell her to come to the office tomorrow morn his voice trailed off as he made the pieces fit together oh mrs radofsky the widow radofsky well go on then after grabbing his doctors bag reuven was glad to get out of the house his father didnt mind his paying a professional call on a nicelooking widow his mother probably wouldnt mind when his father told her either what the twins would say no he didnt want to contemplate that at romantic fifteen they thought he was a fool for not having gone to canada with jane archibald about three days a week he thought he was a fool too he had no trouble finding the widow radofskys little house when he knocked on the door he had to wait a bit before she opened it the way she limped after he came inside showed why sit down he told her let me have a look at that she did in an overstuffed chair under a lamp and held up her right foot she winced when he slid the slipper off it her fourth toe was swollen up to twice its size and purple from base to tip she hissed when he touched it and hissed again and shook her head when he asked her if she could move it i have broken it havent i she said im afraid so reuven answered i can put a splint on it or i can leave it alone itll heal the same either way oh she said unhappily its like that is it im afraid so he repeated and tried to make her think about something besides his inability to help whats your daughter doing shes gone to sleep the widow radofsky answered she wasnt easily distracted why did you bother coming here if you knew you wouldnt be able to do much you could have told me to wait till morning its all right it might have been just a nasty bruise its not but it might have been reuven hesitated then added and i hope you dont mind my saying so i was glad for the chance to see you too were you after a pause of her own she said no i dont mind scooter calling columbus scooter calling columbus g en johnson radioed as he approached the second american constantacceleration spaceship to reach the asteroid belt come in columbus go ahead scooter the radio operator aboard columbus said we have you on our radar youre cleared to approach airlock number two the lights will guide you thanks columbus will do out the lights aboard the spaceship had been guiding him for a little while now hed hardly needed the chatter but the columbus radio operator on duty was a woman with a nice friendly voice he enjoyed listening to her and so talked more than he might have otherwise he had no idea whether he would enjoy looking at her theyd never met in person he knew he enjoyed looking at the columbus thats doing things right he thought the lewis and clark had started out as a space station and had had to be expanded and revised before leaving earth orbit it had reached the vicinity of ceres yes and done what it was supposed to do once it got here but that didnt mean it wasnt the spacegoing equivalent of a garbage scow by contrast the columbus had been designed and built as an interplanetary spacecraft from the inside out it wasnt quite so elegant a piece of engineering as a lizard starship but it was on the right track it was a series of spheres one for the crew then a boom another sphere for the reaction mass then a second boom and finally in lonely splendor the nuclear engine that heated and discharged the mass it was a better job in just about every way than the lewis and clark and the spaceship that came after the columbus would be better still human technology wasnt static the way the races was using eyeballs and the scooters radar johnson killed almost all of his velocity relative to the columbus and drifted forward at a rate better measured in inches per second than in feet he made further minute adjustments with his little maneuvering rockets as he slid into airlock number two which was big enough to accommodate the scooter columbus im all the way inside he reported velocity zero roger that it wasnt the radio operator who answered but the airlock officer a man the outer door slid shut behind the scooter once it had securely closed the inner door slid open the airlock officer said we have pressure for you lieutenant colonel johnson you can open the top and come out for a bit thanks glen said dont mind if i do he had to equalize pressure before the canopy would come off the columbus kept its internal pressure a little higher than either the lewis and clark or the scooter when johnson did emerge he was wearing a grin always good to see an unfamiliar face i believe that the airlock officer said hell its good for me to see you and ive only been stuck aboard this madhouse for a few months you dont know what a madhouse is johnson said loyally slandering his own shipmates well maybe youre right the other fellow admitted you folks even had a stowaway didnt you somebody who wasnt supposed to be aboard i mean we sure did glen johnson would have drawn himself up in pride but didnt see much point in weightlessness as a matter of fact youre looking at him oh the airlock officer said im sorry no offense dont worry about it johnson said easily after all the different things brigadier general healey has called me over the past couple of years youd have a hard time getting me mad he pushed off against the scooter and grabbed the nearest handhold the corridors of the columbus like those of the lewis and clark were designed so that people could impersonate chimpanzees doctor harper should be along any minute now the airlock officer said its all right im not in any big hurry johnson answered we dont have scheduled flights yet thatll have to wait for a while not enough traffic that we have to worry about it either as soon as he gets here ill take him where he needs to go she her the fellow from the columbus said doctor chris harper is definitely of the female persuasion okay better than okay in fact johnson said i figured anybody whos a doctor of electrical engineering was oddson to be a guy even if chris is one of those names that can go either way not sorry to find out im wrong though we brought along as even a mix as we could same as the lewis and clark did the airlock officer replied its not fiftyfifty more like sixtyforty thats better than our blend were closer to two to one johnson said he wondered if the larger number of newly arrived women would change the social rules that had developed aboard the lewis and clark time will tell he thought with profound unoriginality from what the airlock officer had said hed expected dr chris harper to be a beautiful blonde who might have gone into the movies instead of electrical engineering she wasnt she had light brown hair chopped off pretty short and wasnt anywhere near beautiful cute was the word that sprang to johnsons mind again something less than original pleased to meet you he said and stuck out the hand he wasnt using to hold on same to you im sure she said youre supposed to take me to dome isnt that right uhhuh he said theyre just about ready for you there they probably could have gotten things going by themselves but well be able to get twice as much done maybe more than twice as much done with more people doing it thats the idea dr harper said she pointed toward the scooter and what am i supposed to do here get in sit in the back seat and fasten your belt johnson answered fare is seventyfive cents fare box is on the righthand side because of company policy your drivers not allowed to accept tips she snorted and grinned they kept telling us the people who came out on the lewis and clark were a little strange i see they were right before johnson got the chance to deny everything with as much mock indignation as he could the airlock officer pointed at him and said hes the stowaway dr harpers eyes widened you mean there really was one when we heard about that i thought it was like a lefthanded monkey wrench or striped paint something they pulled on the new people she swung her attention back to glen johnson why did you stow away how did you stow away i didnt quite he said i was flying orbital patrol and i came aboard the lewis and clark the space station it still was then when my main engine wouldnt ignite hed arranged the engine trouble himself but hed never told that to anybody and didnt intend to start here i got there just before the ship was going to leave earth orbit and the commandant didnt want anybody who wasnt in on the secret going back down and saying something he shouldnt letting the lizards know what was up so he kept me aboard and i came along for the ride oh she said thats not as exciting as hiding in a washroom or something is it afraid not johnson answered now he pointed to the scooter shall we get going he pushed off from the wall and glided toward the little cockpit dr harper did the same she was good in weightlessness but she still didnt take it quite so much for granted as did the crewfolk of the lewis and clark she scrambled in behind him and strapped herself down he sealed the canopy doublechecked to make sure it was sealed and waved to the airlock officer to show he was ready to go the officer nodded and touched a button the inner door to the lock closed pumps pulled most of the air back into the columbus the outer door opened using tiny burns with his maneuvering jets johnson eased the scooter out of the airlock the outer door closed behind him youre good at this chris harper remarked id better be johnson answered swinging the scooters nose in the direction of dome once hed done that he decided he ought to elaborate a little more i was a fighter pilot when the lizards got here and then like i said i did a lot of orbital patrolling and ive been out here a while now too so ive had more practice at this kind of thing than just about anybody i always enjoy watching somebody who knows what hes doing no matter what it is she said you do it shows glad you think so he said now i have to make extra sure not to let any little rocks bounce off us or anything stupid like that dome had been set up on an asteroid about half a mile across at its thickest point this is the one theyre going to use as a test isnt that right chris harper asked as they drew near the drifting chunk of rock and metal yeah i think so he answered thats why youve come isnt it for a last look to make sure everything goes the way it should thats about the size of it dr harper agreed do you suppose the lizards will notice when we do test everyones assuming they will or at least that theyll notice the beginning he said of course they may stop paying any attention to this asteroid once we shut down the dome and take everybody off were hoping thats what they do but dont bet anything you cant afford to lose on it fair enough she said briskly and then to his surprise tapped him on the shoulder i know you said it was against the rules to tip the driver but ive got something for you if you want it he wondered what she had in mind the cockpit of a scooter wasnt the ideal place for some of the things that leaped into his mind especially not when theyd come so close to the dome well sure he said in tones as neutral as he could make them he might have been wrong after all and he was she said here then and handed him a couple of things they were small enough for both of them to fit in the palm of his hand a roll of lifesavers and a pack of wrigleys spearmint gum they werent her reasonably fair white body but he exclaimed thank you just the same youre welcome dr harper answered my guess was that you people had probably run out of things like that a while ago and youre right too he said as far as teeth and such go were probably better off on account of it but that doesnt mean i wont enjoy the hell out of these cherry lifesavers jesus he was close enough to the asteroid now to let him see all the construction that had gone on alongside of dome he clenched the candy and gum in a way that was what the construction was all about so the usa could go right on making such frivolous things he laughed at himself if you dont sound like something out of a recruiting film what does hydrogen oxygen who needs anything else he said and then as a concession to his passenger a little alien engineering doesnt hurt either thank you so much chris harper said they both laughed stargard was one of the towns of northeastern germany that the wehrmacht and the volkssturm had defended to the last man and the last bullet the lizards hadnt expended an explosivemetal bomb on it theyd smashed it with armor and with strikes from the air and then gone on to larger more important centers of resistance once the reich yielded they hadnt bothered putting a garrison in the town between greifswald and neu strelitz johannes drucker didnt blame the lizards for that in their shoes he wouldnt have garrisoned stargard either what point to it before war rolled through the little city it might have held forty or fifty thousand people about as many as greifswald these days these days he would have been astonished if even a quarter of that number tried to scratch out a living here he knew for a fact that ruins and empty houses far outnumbered inhabited ones all that made stargard a perfect place for holdouts drucker wondered how many other smashedup towns throughout the reich held company to battalionsized units of wehrmacht men or brigands sometimes the line between them wasnt easy to draw who would sometimes sneak out and do what they could against the occupiers of the reich he doubted hed ever find out the answer to that he did know stargard held such a unit and at the moment the holdouts were holding him the lizard whod been driving him down to neu strelitz was no longer among the living had a couple of bullets from the machinegun burst that wrecked the motorcar and killed the driver gone a few centimeters to the left or right of their actual courses drucker wouldnt have been among the living any more either as things were he remained unsure how long hed stay among the living the holdouts kept him in the cellar whose second story had taken a couple of direct hits from a landcruisers cannon it hadnt burned but nobody would want to live up there either with a screech of rusty hinges the cellar door opened two guards came down the stairs one carried a kerosene lamp to shed more light than the candles the holdouts gave drucker the other had an assault rifle he pointed it at druckers midriff come with us he said all right drucker got off the cot where hed been lying the alternative plainly was being shot on the spot where are we going he asked theyd taken him out for questioning a couple of times which had let him see a little of stargard not that there was much worth seeing but the fellow with the lamp had a different answer today to the peoples court thats where theyll give you what you deserve you lousy traitor im not a traitor drucker had been saying the same thing ever since they captured him had the holdouts believed him they would have let him go had they thoroughly disbelieved him they would have shot him when they killed his driver they almost had what do you mean peoples court he asked as he approached the stairs the guards both backed up they werent about to let him get close enough to grab either the rifle or the lantern the one holding the rifle said the peoples court to give out justice for thevolk to give collaborators what they deserve the other fellow added wearily drucker said im not a collaborator either hed been saying that over and over too had he just been saying it it would have done him no good but hed also had in his wallet the telegram from walter dornberger a personal message from the fuhrer had given even the holdouts pause when drucker came out onto the street he was surprised to see it was early morning down in the windowless cellar hed lost track of day and night hed lost track of which day it was too he thought hed been a prisoner for a couple of weeks but he could have been off by several days either way only a few people were out and about so early none of them seemed to find the sight of a man marched along at gunpoint in any way remarkable drucker wondered what would happen if he shouted for help actually he didnt wonder he had a pretty good idea nobody would do anything for him and the youngster with the assault rifle would fill him full of holes he kept quiet in here said the fellow with the lantern in daylight even the murky cloudy daylight of stargard it was useless here had been a tobacconists the plateglass window at the front of the shop had been smashed drucker was morally certain not a gram of tobacco remained inside hed lost the craving up on the lizards starship and had never had it too strongly smoking in the upper stage of an a while in earth orbit was severely impractical but for the shattered window though the tobacconists looked pretty much intact the back room had probably kept the stock that wasnt on display now it held a table and eight or ten chairs that didnt match one another three men sat along one side of the table drucker had seen two of them before theyd interrogated him the third who sat in the middle wore a wehrmacht majors tunic he was young but had a face like a steel trap all sharp edges and angles without humor without mercy drucker wondered why he hadnt served in the ss rather than the army whatever the reason he feared he wouldnt get much of a fair trial here we the volk of the reich bring the accused traitor johannes drucker before the bar of justice here the major said drucker wasnt invited to sit down he sat anyway the guards growled the major glowered but didnt say anything drucker did all ive ever wanted to do was find my family thats not treason i havent done anything that is treason either one of his interrogators said a lizard was doing you a favor why would the lizards do you a favor if you werent a traitor weve been over this before drucker said as patiently as he could they knew who i am because i flew the upper stage of an a they captured me in space and held me till the fighting was over i suppose they were helping me because the fuhrer was my old commandant at peenemunde he was generous enough to send me that wire i heard some of my family might be down in neu strelitz so i asked the lizards for a lift id walked from nuremberg to greifswald if i didnt have to walk again i didnt want to thats all its simple really it wasnt so simple he said not a word about mordechai anielewicz if the holdouts learned hed consorted with a jew he was a dead man by the hardfaced young majors eyes he was liable to be a dead man any which way the officer evidently the leader of this band of holdouts said you were consorting with the enemy no proper citizen of the reich should have anything to do with the lizards under any circumstances drucker glared at him oh for christs sake he said not so patiently any more maybe losing his temper was a mistake but he couldnt help it i started out in the wehrmacht when you were in short pants i was a panzer driver if i hadnt been shooting up lizard landcruisers then you wouldnt be here to call me a traitor now what you did in the past is gone the major snapped his fingers gone like that what you do now with the reich in peril that is what matters and you have not denied that you were captured in the company of a lizard how could i deny it drucker said i was sitting next to him when your men shot him what i do deny is that my sitting next to him makes me disloyal to the reich im as loyal to the fuhreras any man here wheres your telegram from general dornberger herr major that should have been a corker unfortunately drucker saw that it didnt do as much corking as hed hoped it would sure enough the young majors eyes might have come off an ss recruiting poster they were grayblue like ice and every bit as cold he said it is by no means certain that the fuhrer is not a traitor to the reich he yielded to the race too soon and he yielded far too much in the terms for what he calls peace but is in fact only appeasement more royal than the king drucker thought aloud he said if he hadnt yielded every square millimeter of germany would be covered with radioactive glass right now you wouldnt be alive to tell me this nonsense i might still be alive because i was out in space but i wouldnt have gone for a ride with that lizard because i would have known everybody in my family was dead if you support the fuhrers spinelessness you condemn yourself out of your own mouth the holdouts leader replied in a voice as frigid as his eyes drucker felt like pounding his head against the table if you dont follow the policies of your own fuhrer of the reichs fuhrer how can you call yourself soldiers of the reich any more youre not soldiers youre just bandits we are soldiers of the true reich the pure reich the reich we struggle to bring back into being the reich that will have a fuhrer worthy of it not a collaborationist by a slight change in tone the major suggested the reich might not have to look too far to find such a fuhrer and by the faces of the two men whod grilled drucker before they agreed with him as far as drucker was concerned they were all out of their minds of course nine hundred ninetynine people out of a thousand in munich in would have said the same thing about hitler and his handful of followers too but how many wouldbe hitlers had there been in germany then hundreds surely thousands more likely what were the odds this fellow was the genuine article slim very very slim genuine article or not he had the whip hand here and he plainly intended to use it by the power vested in me as an officer of the reich the true reich the uncorrupted reich i now pass sentence on you for treason against that re c he said the sentence will be before he could tell drucker what it would be one of his young bullyboys strode into the tobacconists back room with a package in his hand the major paused drucker wondered why he bothered he wondered why the major bothered with the whole rigmarole in the first place when hed plainly decided to execute drucker in the name of what he called peoples justice his bullyboy sent drucker a curious glance the fellow was seventeen or eighteen with the fuzzy beginnings of a beard druckers hand started to go to his own chin in however long hed been in captivity hed raised a thicker growth than that kid owned the hand froze halfway to his face the kid was staring at him too heinrich drucker whispered at the same time as the bullyboy was saying father drucker sprang out of his chair the hardfaced major and his own impending death sentence utterly forgotten he and his son jumped into each others arms whats going on here the major demanded whats going on here sir heinrich drucker demanded in return i knew wed taken a prisoner but i didnt know who by the look on his face he was ready to fight his commander s face he was ready to fight his commander and everyone else in the world drucker had been the same way at the same age danger in his voice heinrich went on was this a treason trial now that you mention it yes drucker said he had to grab his son to keep him from going for the majors throat perhaps the holdout leader said in the light of this new evidence evidence am i heinrich growled in the light of this new evidence the major repeated perhaps we can justify suspending sentence for the time being perhaps considering what had been about to happen to him drucker didnt even mind the qualifier felless was glad to escape cairo and return to marseille shed never imagined she would think such a thing but it remained a truth nonetheless shed seen for herself that she couldnt get rid of her ginger habit creating another scandal right under the eye turrets of the fleetlord of the conquest fleet would undoubtedly have got her sent to a worse place than marseille that notempire called finland newly under the races influence was supposed to have weather abominable even by tosevite standards she let out a hiss of relief that shed touched off only one small mating frenzy in cairo and that word of it hadnt got back to atvar she had ttomalss to thank for that she didnt like being indebted to the other psychological researcher but knew full well that she was if he wanted something from her one of these days she didnt see how she could keep from giving it to him at least she wasnt gravid or she didnt think she was that took away one worry pertaining to gingerinduced sexuality anyhow and so she peered out of the small windows of her aircraft at the blue water below such a lot of water on this world and waited to land at the field outside marseille once the aircraft had rolled to a halt she got out and arranged transportation to the new consulate building formalities were minimal the francais unlike the deutsche didnt go out of their way to make things difficult for the race they had better not she thought they owe us a great deal more than i owe ttomalss of course by all indications the big uglies worried a great deal less than the race did about their debts all the motorcars outside the terminal building were of tosevite manufacture and had big uglies driving them she got into one and said to the consulate she spoke in her language since she knew no other it shall be done the driver said he opened and closed his hands four times twenty francs francs she knew were what the local big uglies used for money she had some of the little metal disks they differed in value depending on their size and design somewhere on them no doubt were tosevite numerals felless had never bothered learning those but she did know which size was worth ten francs she gave the driver two of those he made the races affirmative gesture i thank you by the time he got her to the consulate felless was by no means sure she thanked him she had seen that many tosevites drove as if they did not care whether they lived or died this francais male seemed to be actively courting death he drove as if his motorcar were a missile and guided it into tiny openings even into imaginary openings defying everyone around him back on home males of some animal species used such challenges to establish territories during the mating season what purpose they served here was beyond felless comprehension she escaped from the motorcar as if escaping prison though she had trouble imagining a prison as dangerous as the trip from the airfield and fled into the consulate after exchanging greetings with some of the males and females there she went back to her own room the chamber shed had at shepheards hotel had been adequate but this was home she felt like having a taste of ginger to celebrate surviving her encounter with the maniacal big ugly but refrained suppertime was coming and she knew she would want to go down to the refectory through some tradition probably older than the unification of home under the empire aircraft never served adequate meals the time for the herb will come she told herself sooner or later she always found a chance to taste when she did go to the refectory she had trouble getting time to eat she was too busy greeting friends and acquaintances and giving them gossip from cairo and about her work with straha everyone paid attention when she talked about that the exshiplord fascinated veterans from the conquest fleet and also males and females from among the colonists hed fascinated felless too his tale of disobedience and defection was far outside the races normal pattern of behavior because felless spent so much time talking she took a while to notice that the food wasnt up to the quality of what shed been eating in cairo she shrugged what could one expect in a provincial place like france she also took a while to notice that one familiar face was missing where is business administrator keffesh she asked the female sitting beside her had you not heard the other female exclaimed in surprise but no you could not have you were in cairo how foolish of me well business administrator keffesh is now prisoner keffesh i am afraid he was caught dealing ginger with a notorious tosevite the herb is such a nuisance she spoke with the smug superiority of one who had never tasted truth the herb is indeed a nuisance felless said in a hollow voice if keffesh was a prisoner hed presumably been interrogated and had presumably confessed and told all he knew in the hope of gaining leniency felless wondered if hed reckoned his dealings with her important enough to mention to the authorities one way or the other she would find out before long either nothing would happen or she would get yet another unpleasant telephone call from ambassador veffani or perhaps veffani wouldnt bother telephoning perhaps he would simply send lawenforcement officials to search her chamber and arrest her if they found any illicit ginger a redundancy if ever there was one but then she made the negative gesture under the table veffani could have ordered her chamber searched while she was in cairo had he done so he would without a doubt have radioed an order for her arrest to the races administrative center since he hadnt maybe keffesh hadnt implicated her after all she could hope he hadnt anyhow she sipped at the fermented fruit juice that accompanied her meal alcohol was a pleasure familiar from home and she didnt mind the taste of this particular tosevite variation on the theme next to ginger though alcohol seemed pretty pallid stuff will taste again she thought fiercely will by the emperor as she cast down her eye turrets the irony of swearing by her sovereign when contemplating the illegal herb struck her she shrugged the emperor didnt know what he was missing it would be many years before he found out if he ever did after learning the news about keffesh getting out of the refectory and back to her chamber felt like escape almost as much as getting out of the wild big uglys motorcar had but that francais male couldnt have pursued her here the telephone that dangerous instrument could and did she flinched when it hissed senior researcher felless she said i greet you as shed feared veffanis image was the one that appeared on her monitor and i greet you senior researcher he replied welcome home i trust your journey from cairo went well i thank you superior sir yes it went well enough felless was delighted to stick to polite commonplaces it went well enough till i landed here at marseille at any rate she had no trouble working up indignation while recounting the antics of her driver and veffani was sympathetic there when hed proved much less so elsewhere this is a problem here and it is a problem in many parts of tosev where we rule directly he said before we came to tosev the big uglies did not even build their motorcars with safety belts they kill one another by the tens of thousands and seem utterly indifferent to the carnage i count myself lucky that i was not among the slain earlier today felless said i am glad you were not veffani said i have had nothing but fine reports of your work in cairo and i take no small pleasure in telling you so that is very good news superior sir felless replied you have no idea how good it is if you did have any such idea you would be telling me something altogether different and you would take no small pleasure in that either it was a very interesting experience and one where i learned a good deal do i understand that your commission concluded the tosevite warren acted as he did from reasons of policy rather than on a whim or out of despair after being discovered in his efforts against us veffani asked that is the consensus yes felless answered thanks to data straha obtained from private tosevite sources no other conclusion seemed possible too bad veffani said i would rather have been able to reckon him a fool but he served his notempire well he was a murderous barbarian and i am glad to know that he is dead and no longer a danger to the race felless said i agree with every word of what you have said veffani answered none of that however in any way contradicts what i said no i suppose not felless paused and thought about the ambassadors tone of voice you admire him superior sir is that not a truth she knew she sounded accusing she enjoyed sounded accusing as a matter of fact shed spent a lot of time listening to veffanis accusations which were usually all too well justified now she could get some of her own back maybe i do veffani admitted have you never admired some particularly skillful opponent in a game of course i have felless made her voice stiff with disapproval but i would hardly call our continuing struggle against the big uglies a game no would you not senior researcher veffani said then what else is it to me it is the largest most complex game ever played and also the game with the highest stakes one can hardly help respecting the big uglies who played it well they play it with our lives felless said angrily well so they do veffani said we play it with their lives too and if you are going to look at methods they have done few things to us that we have not also done to them they save their worst horrors for their own kind and i suppose you will be excusing those next felless said the ambassador made the negative gesture i excuse nothing but neither do i diminish the tosevites and their accomplishments that is a failing too much encountered among the males and females of the colonization fleet the big uglies are barbarians yes they are not fools he used an emphatic cough treat them as fools and you will regret it that rated another emphatic cough i understand superior sir felless said which was a long way from saying that she agreed with maddening patience veffani said experience will eventually teach you the same thing senior researcher felless thought he would say farewell then instead he added experience should also teach you to be wary of which males you choose as your acquaintances good day his image did disappear then felless stared at the monitor even after veffani was gone he knows she shuddered he may not know quite enough to charge me but he knows what do i do now penny summers set hands on hips and glared at rance auerbach across their hotel room she was wearing a beige dress with a flowery print that almost made her disappear into the wallpaper which was also beige and floral she said i didnt know we were setting ourselves up as a charity i reckoned we got into this business to make money not to save the poor and the downtrodden oh we might make some money off this rance answered hed known penny would be angry he hadnt thought shed be quite so angry as she was thats not why youre doing it though she snapped youre doing it because you think that little french gal is cute o o he thought so thats it as a matter of fact he did think monique dutourd was cute but letting penny know that didnt strike him as the smartest idea hed ever had he said yeah and i gave david goldfarb a hand on account of he was just the prettiest thing i ever did see he rolled his eyes and sighed as if he meant it penny did her best to stay mad but she couldnt quite manage god damn you she said affectionately you are a piece of work arent you have to be to keep up with you he said that was flattery but flattery with a good deal of underlying truth he went on besides with pierre the turd in the lizard hoosegow doing our regular sort of business isnt as easy as it used to be we ought to thank god he hasnt ratted on us so well try something different for a while okay and his sister did warn us the lizards caught him penny still didnt look happy i know when im being sweettalked rance auerbach i know when im being conned too and if this aint one of those times then its something else auerbach said thats what ive been trying to tell you if youd only listen to me youve been trying to tell me all kinds of things penny said sourly i havent heard a whole lot of what id call truth but youre bound and determined to try this arent you she waited for rance to nod then nodded herself okay if it works out great if it doesnt or if you start fooling around behind my back theres not going to be any place far enough away for you to hide rance nodded again i like lost causes i must i took you in a while ago didnt i or did you manage to forget about that astonishment spread over her face as she raised a hand to her cheek now youve gone and made me blush and i dont know when the hell the last time i did that was okay rance go do it and well see what happens but you better remember what i said about that french gal too im not likely to forget he said you want to come along and hold my hand i oughta say yes penny answered but youre the one who speaks french and im the one pierres likelier to have fingered to the lizards if he went and fingered anybody go on just be careful thats all i will auerbach wondered how much help hed get from penny if something did go wrong one more thing i dont want to have to find out he thought he met monique dutourd in a little cafe not far from the dress shop where shed found work after her brother was arrested bonjourhe said and then in english are you ready i think so she said i hope so she rose draining the wineglass in front of her then lets go he said allonsy i have the taxi waiting outside the taxi inevitably was a volkswagen rance hated getting into and out of the buggy little holdovers from the reich being knee to knee with monique in the back seat made up for some of that as it had with penny but not enough monique was the one who spoke to the driver the consulate of the race if you please it shall be done he said in the lizards language and got the vw going with a horrible clash of gears getting out of the taxi as usual was even harder for auerbach than getting into it had been he paid off the driver from what hed seen monique wasnt rolling in loot they went into the consulate together a lizard looked up from whatever he or maybe she had been doing and spoke in hissing french oui questce quo vous desirez we want to see the female named felless rance answered in the language of the race he didnt speak it well but judged it would be useful here it got the receptionists attention at any rate i will ask the lizard said give me your names it shall be done rance said as the taxi driver had before him once hed named himself and monique he added i thank you when dealing with lizard officialdom he made a point of being polite you are welcome this lizard said so it must have done some good now please wait after talking on the telephone the lizard swung an eye turret back toward auerbach and monique senior researcher felless will be here shortly i thank you rance said again monique nodded he switched to french for her it could be that this will work it could be she echoed then just for a moment she set a hand on his arm thank you very much for trying no one else has cared at all well see what we can do thats all he said in english if you dont bet you cant win he wasnt sure he could have put that into french she nodded again to show she understood auerbach started to say something more but a lizard came up the hallway from the back part of the consulate the receptionist pointed with his her tongue the newly arrived lizard walked over to him and monique and said i greet you i am felless which of you is which i am auerbach rance said in the lizards language then he introduced monique adding and we greet you he wanted to laugh about felless inability to tell them apart at a glance but he didnt if monique hadnt told him he wouldnt have known felless was a female so why wouldnt it work the other way what is it that you want with me felless asked did she recognize moniques name rance couldnt tell he didnt think she would have heard his before that was probably just as well he said can we find some private space to speak that was probably a warning it was certainly a warning if she had any brains but he didnt see what else he could do he sure didnt want to talk business out here in the foyer felless drew back and hesitated before she spoke she had brains all right she knew something was fishy even if she didnt know what after that momentary hesitation she said very well come with me brusquely she turned away and went down the hallway from which shed come rance and monique followed he didnt know what hed expected that she would take the two humans back to her own quarters perhaps she didnt the room into which she led them was the obvious lizard equivalent of an earthly conference room rance didnt much like the lizards chairs which were too small and shaped for beings without much in the way of buttocks with his bad leg though he liked standing even less he sat so did monique felless for her part paced back and forth when she spoke he thought he heard bitterness in her voice now you will tell me what you want it will be something to do with ginger i do not doubt not directly auerbach said my friend here is a scholar she is grateful that you saved her from the prison of the francais he delivered a running translation for monique mostly in english some in french she is welcome felless said what is the point of this it is not directly connected to ginger you said how is it indirectly connected when the explosivemetal bomb destroyed much of marseille it destroyed moniques university too rance answered now she has no position she wants work in what she knows about not in selling wrappings to other tosevites how nice felless said with polite insincerity but i do not see how that has anything to do with me we hoped you could use your connections and your high rank as a female of the race to help her gain a position somewhere in france auerbach said when a female of the race especially a highranking female of the race speaks tosevites have to pay attention tosevites from all i have seen do not have to do anything felless answered and why should i help her again in any case before answering her rance spoke in english to monique now we see what we see he went back to the language of the race because you helped her before because of business administrator keffesh felless flinched auerbach hid his smile the female said what do you know of business administrator keffesh i know he is in trouble for ginger rance said i know you do not want authorities of the race to know you did favors for him that is felless used a word he didnt know he assumed it meant blackmail she went on why should i do anything like that and how do i know you will not betray me even if i do now rance did smile when she put it like that he knew he had her he said i do not ask for money yef he thought i ask help for a friend nothing more she deserves help she is a good scholar she should have the chance to work at what she was trained to work at and what were you trained to work at rance auerbach felless demanded he smiled again even if she might not understand exactly what the expression meant war he said were you felless said why am i not surprised and if i refuse you you will inform my superiors of my unfortunate connections we do not want to do that rance said we want you to help us but if i do not help you you will do this felless said rance shrugged i hope it is not needed you are a scholar do you not want to help another scholar what sort of scholar is this tosevite female felless asked when auerbach asked monique just how she wanted to answer that she said tell her i studied and want to go on studying the history of the roman empire he translated her words into the language of the race felless sniffed i find it strange that you tosevites should speak of empires you do not really know the meaning of the word there is only one true empire that of the race very interesting rance said but it has nothing to do with what we are talking about here will you help my friend or is it necessary for us to embarrass you embarrass is not the word felless sighed very well i will help as you say this is a relatively small matter she sounded as if she was trying to convince herself of that after auerbach translated that for monique he said what do you think i think it is wonderful if it is true she answered in english i will believe it is true when i see it however if its not true well just have to talk to the lizards authorities rance said also in english then he translated that into the language of the race for felless benefit by the way she winced she didnt think she was particularly benefited rances smile got bigger that wasnt his worry it was all hers to her astonishment monique dutourd found that she enjoyed selling dresses in her academic days shed learned how to deal with people without panicking that served her in good stead now shed also learned to dress reasonably well without spending an arm and a leg on a professors salary she could barely afford to spend fingernail clippings and so she could help other women look as good as they could without helping them to go broke doing it her boss was a fellow named charles boileau after shed been working at the dress shop for a couple of weeks he said i had my doubts about hiring you mademoiselle dutourd i thought you would either be too educated to work with the customers or that you wouldnt be able to learn the business i was wrong both ways and im not too proud to admit it thank you very much monique was pleased and again surprised to admit it to herself im glad you think i fit in boileau nodded i knew you knew what you were doing when you talked madame du cange out of that green dress without insulting her or making her ashamed of her own judgment i had to sir even though the sale we got was for a little less monique said madame du cange is a woman of formidable contours her gesture said what she wouldnt that the customer in question was grossly fat if shed bought that dress she would have looked like nothing so much as an enormous lime with legs her boss was a sobersided man he fought and lost a battle against laughter i wouldnt have put it that way he said but i wont tell you that youre wrong and if she did that monique said earnestly it would have reflected badly on her and it would have reflected badly on us people would have said where did you get that dress she would have told them too she would have thought it a compliment and none of the people she told would have come here ever again it wouldnt have been quite so bad as that i dont think boileau said but your attitude does you credit her attitude turned out to do rather more than that when she got her paycheck at the end of the week it had an extra fifty francs in it that wasnt enough to make her rich it wasnt even enough to make her anything but very dubiously middleclass but every one of those francs was welcome and more than welcome shed found herself a tiny walkup furnished room a couple of blocks from the dress shop it had a hot plate and a sink no stove no toilet no bathtub no telephone the toilet and tub were down at the end of the hall in the whole building only the landlady had a phone and a stove after cooking in the tent monique had no trouble cooking on a hot plate and she discovered she didnt miss a telephone dieter kuhn couldnt call her assuming he was still in marseille lucie couldnt get hold of her either neither could rance auerbach but she could always reach him on a public telephone whenever she needed to she kept waiting for news that felless had managed to persuade a university to give her a position the news didnt come once when she telephoned auerbach asked shall we turn her in now but monique not without regret said no she helped me out of prison i do not wish to betray her unless it is very plain she is betraying us okay auerbach said they were speaking english i still think youre too damn nice for your own good but okay monique had to work out exactly what that meant in french when she did she decided it was a compliment things could be worse she said remembering dieter kuhn she shivered a little yes things could be much worse believe me i know okay rance auerbach said again you know best what you want im just trying to help i know i thank you monique hung up then scratching her head shed seen that auerbach was partial to such gestures hed given david goldfarb a hand even if that meant going to the nazis to put pressure on the englishman who was giving goldfarb a hard time so no wonder the american would squeeze a vulnerable lizard to help her did he have an ulterior motive with most men that added up to did he want to go to bed with her she wouldnt have been surprised but he wasnt obnoxious about it if he did he wasnt making it a quid pro quo as so many men would have kuhn certainly had damn him if she gave him her body he kept his fellow ss goons from interrogating her the worst of that was she still felt shed made the best possible bargain there no matter how she loathed the sturmbann fiihrer maybe she shouldnt have thought of kuhn on the way back to her roominghouse maybe if she hadnt he wouldnt have been sitting on the front steps waiting for her monique stopped so short she might have seen a poisonous snake there as far as she was concerned she had hello sweetheart he said in his germanaccented french how are you today go away she snarled get out i never want to see you again if you dont leave right now im going to scream for the police go ahead kuhn answered im just a tourist and ive got the papers to prove it youre a damned ss man no matter what your papers say monique retorted her mouth twisted in a bitter quirk that was not a smile youve got the little tattoo to prove it i ought to know ive seen it too often his smile was a long way from charming go ahead tell them you were fucking an ss man if you dont i will and then see how much fun you have laughing in his face gave monique almost as much pleasure as shed ever had in bed certainly far more than shed ever had with him go ahead see how much good it does you ive already been to jail for that and i got out again too i proved you made me do it go away right now and dont come back or i will yell for the police youd sooner screw that american the cripple kuhn said scornfully any day she answered at once twice on sundays go away she took a deep breath she really did intend to scream her head off dieter kuhn must have seen that for he got to his feet with the smooth grace of an athlete all right he said ill go sleep with the american sleep with the lizards for all i care but i tell you this the reich isnt done the lizards havent heard the last of us neither have you off he went arrogant as ever monique took hold of the iron banister and sagged against it with relief up till this second round of fighting shed lived her whole adult life in a country under the nazis thumb a country where the gestapo could do whatever it pleased shed lived that way so long shed come to take it for granted now for the first time she saw what living in her own country an independent country meant if she yelled for the police they could arrest kuhn instead of having to knuckle under to him she went up the stairs and into the roominghouse as she walked up to her own room she realized things werent quite so simple the purification squad from her own independent country had arrested her and thrown her into prison too her brother hadnt got her out because her case was good or her cause just hed got her out because hed pulled wires with the lizards france was almost as much obliged to do what they wanted as it had been to do what the germans wanted almost monique murmured the difference was enormous as far as she was concerned for one thing the lizards did formally respect french freedom and for another they werent nazis that alone made all the difference in the world she was sauteeing liver and onions on the hot plate when she realized she ought to be doing more to help get pierre out of the lizards jail hed pulled wires for her after all but she didnt have any wires to pull not really rance auerbach might but he was already pulling them on her behalf how could she ask him to do more the answer unfortunately was plain she couldnt if she bribed him with her body would he help her with pierre angrily she flipped the liver over with a spatula and slammed it down into the pan she never would have started thinking like that if it hadnt been for dieter kuhn and she never would have had to worry about kuhn if she hadnt been pierres sister that struck her as a good reason to let her brother stay right where he was a couple of evenings later she was writing yet another letter of application who could guess whether or not felless would come through when someone knocked on the door she didnt hesitate about answering it as she would have before the nazis had to leave france the only thing she worried about was robbers and robbers she reasoned had to know there were more lucrative targets than an upperfloor room in a cheap boardinghouse when she opened the door she stared in astonishment her brother nodded to her arent you going to ask me if i want to come in pierre dutourd asked come in monique said automatically as automatically she shut the door behind him then a little at a time her wits started to work she asked the first question that popped into them what are you doing here i came to say thank you pierre answered as seriously as shed ever heard him speak im not going to ask you what you had to do to get dieter kuhn to help me get out of that damned cell i probably dont want to know you probably dont want to tell me im sure it wasnt anything you wanted to do i know what kuhn is but you did it anyway even though youve got to think im more a nuisance than a brother so thank you from the bottom of my heart his nod was almost a bow and now moniques stare was one of complete bewilderment but i didnt do anything she blurted he came around here the other day sniffing after me nothing to do with you and i told him to go to hell he has connections even now pierre said he used them i thought it was on account of you if im wrong he shrugged his face a frozen mask now if im wrong i wont trouble you any more that would probably suit you best anyhow au revoir before monique could find anything to say he went out the door he didnt even bother slamming it after him monique sank into one of the two ratty chairs in the room she couldnt believe dieter kuhn had done that to gain her favor he had to have some motive of his own and what it might be seemed pretty obvious the more trouble the lizards had with ginger the less trouble they would be able to give the reich even so she wondered if the sturmbann fiihrer would come around seeking the heros reward if he does she thought he isnt going to get it but the one who came around a few days later was rance auerbach he was waiting outside her dress shop when she left for home moniques heart started to pound she couldnt help it well she demanded he grinned he knew she was impatient he wasnt angry either how does the university of tours sound he asked tours she said it was in the north southwest of paris but still unquestionably the north more an atlantic than a mediterranean town shed sent a letter there shed sent letters everywhere shed got no answer now she had one they want me she whispered theyll take you he answered that wasnt quite the same thing but it would do thank you she said oh thank you she kissed him if hed wanted something more she probably would have gone up to her room with him right that minute but all he did was grin wider than ever dear god in heaven she thought have my life back again now what do i do with it atvar was studying the daily news reports when he came upon something of a new and different sort he called in his adjutant for a look here is something you will not see every day pshing he said what is it exalted fleetlord pshing asked turn an eye turret this way atvar answered photographs necessarily longdistance highly magnified photographs of a major meteoric impact on the worthless fourth planet it looks as if a large explosivemetal bomb had hit there pshing said from what the astronomers say the impact was a good deal more energetic than that atvar said tosevs solar system is an untidy place especially compared to the one in which home orbits pshing said imagine if such a rock had struck tosev instead of the worthless tosev it would have been most unfortunate especially in or near a populated area such bombardment is a fact of life in this solar system atvar said look at any of the bodies here the only one without immediately obvious evidence of these impacts is tosev and that because it is so geologically active the atmosphere must protect this world to some degree pshing said no doubt but one that size would have got through the fleetlord said and as you remarked the results would have been unfortunate indeed pshing made the affirmative gesture and now exalted fleetlord if you will excuse me he went back to his own desk after one last look at the new crater on tosev atvar went on to other matters his staff thought worthy of his notice northern india was facing more and more riots as plants from home spread through the fields there that subregions climate was ideal for their propagation and they were cutting into the big uglies food supplies which in that part of tosev were no better than marginal at the best of times it is of course necessary to make tosev as homelike as possible an ecologist wrote in doing so however we may cause as many casualties among the big uglies from environmental change as we did in the course of the fighting this is unfortunate but appears unavoidable atvar sighed if the conquest did finally succeed he feared historians would not look kindly upon him if he didnt get a sobriquet like atvar the brutal he would be surprised but he didnt know what to do about the tosevites in india past suppressing their riots he couldnt get rid of the plants from home now even if he wanted to they would flourish in that subregion it was reasonably warm and reasonably dry and they had no natural enemies there the local ecosystem would be transformed and not to the tosevites advantage he wondered if he could move some of the big uglies from the affected areas to those where tosevite ecologies remained more or less intact but no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than certain difficulties became obvious the tosevites of northern india might not want to be moved big uglies were reactionary that way wherever he moved them the current inhabitants were all too likely to prove less than welcoming they might not have excess food either tosevite agriculture was at best imperfectly efficient and ecological change would come to many more areas of the planet even if it hadnt yet he sighed again some problems simply had no neat tidy solutions that would have been an unacceptable notion back on home a hundred thousand years of unified imperial history argued that the race could solve anything but the big uglies and their world presented challenges different from and worse than any the race had known since the days of its ancientest history and maybe worse than any it had known then too the fleetlord went on to the next item in the daily briefing it made him hiss in alarm superstitious fanatics from the main continental mass had traveled to the lesser continental mass and mounted an attack on the fortress where that maniac of a khomeini was imprisoned by the emperor atvar exclaimed and let out yet another sigh this one of relief when he discovered the attack had failed would that not have been a disaster khomeini on the loose again there would surely have been uprisings throughout the areas were the muslim superstition predominated including cairo itself atvar had seen enough such disturbances too many in fact commend the males who prevented khomeinis escape he wrote also commend the tosevite constabulary officials who fought side by side with our males and i particularly commend the individual who thought to incarcerate khomeini in a region inhabited by big uglies of a superstition different from his that helped to insure the loyalty of local protective officials next on the agenda was a note that with two spaceships in the belt of minor planets the american tosevites were spreading rapidly and were busy at so many sites that the races surveillance probes could not keep track of everything they were doing shall we let them continue unobserved being more or less sure they can find no way to harm us from such a c sfaacethe head of the surveillance effort asked or shall we expend the resources to continue keeping an eye turret turned in their direction atvar did not hesitate if we need more probes we must send more probes he wrote the americans sacrificed a city in preference to withdrawing from space it follows that they expect to reap some benefit from their continued presence among these minor planets perhaps that benefit will be only economic perhaps it will be military or they think it will we dare not take the chance that they will prove mistaken his tailstump quivered with agitation he could not hide the commission hed appointed to study earl warrens motivation had concluded that the big ugly had known exactly what he was doing and had just had the misfortune from his point of view though not from the races to get caught that was what atvar had least wanted to hear he would much rather have believed the tosevite leader addled that would have made warren less dangerous but the evidence atvar had to admit was on the commissions side he read on and found more complaints from occupation officials in the reich that the deutsche were not turning in their surviving weapons but were doing their best to conceal arms against a possible future uprising that made his tailstump quiver again this time from raw fury still in the grip of that fury he wrote convey to their notemperor that their cities remain hostage to their good behavior if they refuse to turn over weapons as they promised on their surrender one of those cities shall cease to be as abruptly as did indianapolis if that fails to gain their attention another city shall vanish they have already hit us too hard and too often they shall get no further chances an order like that would get him remembered as atvar the brutal too back on home it would have been impossible anyone who tried to issue such an order there would be reckoned a bloodthirsty barbarian and immediately sacked here on tosev atvar didnt even feel guilty not after everything the deutsche had done to the race here on tosev the order was simply common sense only a couple of items remained he hoped theyd prove inconsequential a forlorn hope he knew inconsequential items were dealt with at levels far lower than his for the most part he never found out about them what reached him was what his subordinates for whatever reason felt they couldnt handle themselves sure enough the next report had to do with china not least because of its long border with the sssr and the zealots who shared the independent notempires political doctrines that subregion refused to stay pacified the latest rumors had those zealots plotting another uprising whenever they tried to rise the race crushed them they did not seem to believe they couldnt win every so often they would have another go at it atvar was tempted to order the use of explosivemetal weapons there too with a certain amount of reluctance he refrained that would anger the sssr and hed had enough trouble with the tosevite notempire lately and now the nipponese empire had explosivemetal weapons too and had to be treated more circumspectly conventional means had sufficed to hold the lid on china thus far they would probably keep doing so a while longer before he could check the last item in the days briefing pshing called exalted fleetlord i have fleetlord reffet on the telephone tell him i am shedding my skin and cannot be disturbed atvar said but then having mercy on his adjutant he relented put him through when the fleetlord of the colonization fleet appeared on the monitor he did his best to be polite i greet you reffet what can i do for you today politeness proved wasted without preamble reffet said you are surely the most arrogant highhanded male in the history of the race how dare you how dare you unilaterally order a soldiers time and commence preparations for conscripting members of the colonization fleet into the military as usual you ask the wrong question atvar answered the right question is how could i have waited so long with the fighting against the deutsche with the near conflict against the americans it becomes ever more plain that we are going to have to have the ability to fight for generations to come would you sooner rely on tosevite hirelings to resist the independent notempires well no reffet said but if the answer is no but me no buts atvar said you have delayed and resisted every time i proposed this course we have no more time for delay and resistance we need colonists able to defend themselves that being so i have begun taking the steps necessary to insure that we have them do you have any idea how this will disrupt the economy of the race on tosev reffet demanded fighting is not profitable fighting is the opposite of profitable survival is profitable atvar answered as for the economy no i do not know how badly this will disrupt it losing a war with the big uglies would disrupt it worse i do know that and i know that we can get from our subject tosevites much of what the members of the race who become soldiers would have produced we already get from our subject tosevites and from the wild big uglies too much of what we should be making for ourselves reffet said this has also been destabilizing and demoralizing we did not anticipate industrial competition you know in that case the members of the race who should be producing but are not will now have the chance to give a different kind of service atvar forced good cheer into his voice you see benefits on every side i see a male who has exceeded his authority reffet snarled you see a male doing what needs doing atvar replied i realize this may be a spectacle new to you nevertheless i shall go forward i aim to preserve the race on tosev no matter how much you want to return the whole planet to the big uglies as hed hoped that made reffet break the connection with silence in the office atvar got back to work gorppet turned an eye turret toward hozzanet excuse me superior sir but exactly how much of the greater german reich does the race in fact control ah hozzanet waggled an eye turret of his own ironic approval you are beginning to understand i see how much of the reich do you think we control as much as we can see gorppet answered at once not the thickness of a scale more wherever our eyes or our reconnaissance photographs do not reach i am convinced the deutsche do as they please and what they please is anything that can harm us i should bring more infantrymales into security hozzanet remarked you have no trouble seeing that which appears invisible to many whose body paint is a great deal complex than yours more why am i not surprised gorppet said males of high rank never get out to see for themselves they rely on reports from others and the reports commonly tell them everything is fine and everything usually is fine where we are known to be looking elsewhere i will not answer for elsewhere i think you are wise not to hozzanet replied here is another question for you what is the only thing that keeps the deutsche from rising against us the certainty that we will smash them flat if they try gorppet said smash them flatter i mean i almost wish they would rebel to give us the excuse to do it in this you are not alone hozzanet said in fact for your hearing diaphragms only i will say that there has been some discussion of touching off a deutsch rebellion to give us an excuse to punish these big uglies again and take fuller control over the area but for one difficulty i would like to see us do that gorppet said i know what you are going to say hozzanet told him you are going to say something like where will we get the males to garrison the reich am i right or am i wrong was that what you were going to say or not as a matter of fact it was superior sir gorppet admitted we have enough trouble finding the males to garrison this notempire now where would we come up with more no matter how much we need them to his surprise hozzanet said i may have an answer for you i am given to understand that we may actually start training members of the colonization fleet to fight that would give us the extra soldiers we need so it would gorppet agreed i will however believe it when i see it and not a moment before we should have done it as soon as the colonization fleet got here when we did not do it then my guess was that we never would that the colonists had done such a good job of fussing and complaining that they would never have to start earning their own keep you are a cynical fellow hozzanet spoke with considerable admiration here again i admit you have had some reason to be but i think you are wrong this time after all however much we wish we would we are not going to stay around forever sooner or later the colonists will have to protect themselves against the big uglies if they do not who will do it for them they have not worried about that so far gorppet said why should they worry now something else occurred to him he started to laugh i wish i were an underofficer training them i would enjoy that i think yes plenty of males will be looking for the chance to show the colonists just how ignorant they are of the way things work on tosev hozzanet agreed we shall have no shortage of volunteers for that duty gorppet made the affirmative gesture then another new thought struck him do they intend to teach males and females to be soldiers or just males before it would have mattered only during mating season with ginger though it matters all the time has anyone bothered to think about that i do not know hozzanet said it would not surprise me if our leaders did their best to forget about the herb they would be fools if they did gorppet said of course that may not stop them but i am far from sure that military discipline and mating behavior can stand side by side someone ought to point that out to them truth hozzanet said go ahead me now gorppet made the negative gesture no one would pay any attention to me i am lucky to be an officer at all your skill made you an officer luck had nothing to do with it hozzanet said draft a memorandum i will endorse it and pass it up the line it shall be done superior sir gorppet could say nothing else what he thought was look what your big mouth got you into this time after a moment he did add some members of the race are likely to say that this makes us like the big uglies who also usually exclude their females from combat some members of the race are fools hozzanet replied you will i suspect have observed this for yourself the big uglies are sexually dimorphic to a greater degree than we are and have practiced mechanized warfare only a short time up till recently raw strength was necessary for their combat so it is no wonder their females were commonly excluded that is not an issue for us but control of our sexuality is can you imagine what the deutsche would have done to us after spraying ginger over a battlefield with both males and females on it i can but i would rather not gorppet shuddered at the thought very well superior sir i will emphasize that point when i write he didnt enjoy drafting the memorandum he hadnt had to do such things very often as an infantrymale and then an underofficer the risks of combat were familiar pain mutilation death the risks here were subtler but real nevertheless embarrassment mockery humiliation he was no writer and was painfully aware of his own deficiencies he feared everyone else who saw the memorandum would be painfully aware of them too with some more than some trepidation he showed hozzanet the document once hed finished it the other officer read through the piece without a word gorppet was sure hed produced nothing but a broken egg at last when hozzanet turned one eye turret away from the monitor and toward him he managed to ask well superior sir he sounded miserable fair enough he felt miserable i shall do what i said hozzanet answered i shall endorse it and send it on to our superiors in the hope that it will do some good i think it is very effective very clear very straightforward you make a good case you certainly have convinced me some of the officers set above us of course have trouble seeing past the ends of their own snouts maybe they will ignore this but maybe on the other fork of the tongue it will help them see farther we can but hope eh yes superior sir now gorppet sounded dazed delight coursed through him almost as if hed had a taste of ginger clear straightforward my work i thank you superior sir you are welcome hozzanet said you are very welcome indeed you did the work i am merely approving its quality which should be and i think will be obvious to everyone i thank you gorppet repeated more dazed still this was better than ginger for the pleasure lingered it didnt steal away to be replaced by gloom at least as strong as i said you have earned the praise hozzanet told him i would not be surprised if i were calling you superior sir one of these days that as far as gorppet could see was a preposterous extravagance he didnt say so contradicting hozzanet would have been rude but he didnt take the notion seriously either his longtime service below officers rank had convinced him that surviving was more important than advancing anyhow work went on while he waited for his superiors to respond to the memorandum longtime service below officers rank had convinced him that they would take their own sweet time about it too one afternoon he let out a surprised hiss hozzanet swung an eye turret his way and asked something interesting yes superior sir gorppet answered remember that tosevite male named drucker who was going down to neu strelitz to search for his mate and hatchlings hozzanet made the affirmative gesture i am not likely to forget him that trip cost us a good male and a motorcar cursed deutsch bandits why what about him now he has been positively identified in neu strelitz gorppet said up till now the assumption was that he too perished in the attack even if his body was not found assumptions are commonly worth their weight in ginger hozzanet said which made gorppet laugh the other male went on do you suppose he might tell you the truth about what happened if you went down to neu strelitz and asked him superior sir i do not know gorppet answered some of that i suppose will depend on what did happen and how close his ties to the bandits are even if he owes me certain debts big uglies reckon kinship more important and friendship less so than we do i understand that hozzanet said i ought to on this miserable ball of mud go on do your best it shall be done gorppet said again what other choice had he when he got to neu strelitz he found it to be another small city that had taken considerable damage during the fighting the deutsche were doing their best to put things to rights again they were energetic and hardworking almost alarmingly so there said the informant whose tip had got back to him a yellowhaired tosevite female who went by the name of friedli she spoke the language of the race badly but understandably see you him walking there yes gorppet found one question to ask before going after drucker why do you give him away to us he my mate threatened and betrayed she answered now get him kinship not friendship gorppet thought he skittered down the street after johannes drucker when he caught up he said i greet you the deutsch male stopped and stared down at him gorppet he said and gorppet used the affirmative gesture what are you doing here i came to ask you the same question gorppet said how did you escape the ambush that killed chinnoss have you found your mate and your hatchlings drucker hesitated before answering in that moment of hesitation gorppet became convinced he wouldnt learn anything and he was right the big ugly replied i am sorry but i really cannot tell you what happened that day i was knocked unconscious when the motorcar rolled over so i know nothing i do not believe you gorppet said bluntly i am sorry drucker repeated i was lucky not to be killed that was not luck gorppet said you were not killed because you are not a male of the race johannes drucker shrugged i must go will you excuse me suppose i arrest you instead gorppet demanded his temper kindling you may try the big ugly shrugged again i doubt you will succeed not here in a town without a garrison he was unfortunately almost sure to be correct gorppet sent him a reproachful stare not that any tosevite was likely to recognize it as such he said i thought we were friends you and i drucker surprised him by using the races negative hand gesture you and i are not enemies that is a truth but your folk and mine are not friends and that is also a truth now i must say farewell he walked on down the street gorppet could have gone after him gorppet could have raised his weapon and started shooting instead with a sigh he returned to his vehicle no keeping the deutsche suppressed wouldnt be easy or anything close to it as if i hadnt known as much already he thought bitterly sam yeager wondered why hed been summoned to little rock he hadnt wanted to come to the capital his wife and son hadnt wanted him to go either sticking your head in the lions mouth was the phrase barbara had used but he remained an officer of the us army unless he wanted to resign his commission he had to follow orders and he didnt want to resign it hed worked too hard to get where he was resigning would have been like admitting that everything hed been through was something hed somehow deserved he was damned if hed do that dont rub hed learned that code in the bush leagues dont let the bastards know they hurt you a pitcher whod just stuck a fastball in your ribs might suspect you werent too happy about it but not rubbing was all about not letting the other guys know what you were feeling or that you were feeling anything and so outwardly calm he sat in a waiting room in the gray house reading a newsweek and pretending everything was just routine after a while a flunky came up to him and said the president will see you now lieutenant colonel okay yeager put down the magazine and got to his feet the gray house dignitary led him into the presidents office seeing harold stassen behind the big desk there was a jolt yeager didnt want to show that either he stiffened to attention and saluted reporting as ordered sir sit down lieutenant colonel president stassen said his voice didnt carry nearly the weight of authority earl warrens had but warren was gone dead and buried the king is dead long live the king stassen asked would you care for coffee or anything else no thank you sir sam answered all right the president looked down at what were probably notes i understand you and your family are responsible for raising a couple of lizard hatchlings as though they were human beings thats right mr president hope blossomed in yeager maybe stassen had called him here to talk about mickey and donald they were important no doubt about it if he were here on account of that maybe warren hadnt said anything to anybody about his role in bringing down a presidency and wiping a city off the face of the earth maybe im the only one who knows the whole story sam thought christ i hope i am president stassen said and how are the hatchlings now theyre fine sir sam said theyre toddlers right now you know growing like weeds and learning something new every day they talk a lot more than regular lizard hatchlings the same age would stassen shuffled papers notes sure enough i understand the lizards have a long head start on us in this sort of research thats true but theres nothing we could do about it yeager said they got a hatchling uh a human baby right after the first round of fighting ended we couldnt even think of trying the same sort of experiment till the colonization fleet brought females of the race here of course the president nodded now youve met the girl the lizards are raising as one of their own he waited for sam to nod too then asked what do you think of her sir kassquits pretty screwy im afraid yeager answered i dont know how else to put it considering the way she was brought up i dont suppose thats any big surprise its probably gods own miracle that shes not even crazier than she is does that mean stassen glanced down again does that mean mickey and donald are liable to end up disturbed too from the point of view of the race do you mean sir sam sighed im afraid it does i dont know what to do about that i dont think theres anything to be done about it i feel bad sometimes but its important for us to know just how much like people they can become he sighed again ttomalss the lizard whos raised kassquit probably feels the same way in reverse i see stassen scribbled something on a scratch pad to turn to another matter how seriously do you view the spread of plants and animals from the lizards home planet here on earth did stassen know yeager had been seized while investigating that very thing if he did he didnt show it sam decided to assume he didnt and answered its going to be a problem yes mr president it may not be too big a problem here in the states because i didnt think too many creatures from home will be able to stand the winters in most of the country but in the tropics especially the deserts id bet therell be wholesale replacements the lizards are going to try to make earth over to suit themselves wed probably do the same thing if the shoe were on the other foot i wouldnt be surprised stassen wrote himself another note your opinion closely matches the views of other experts ive consulted im glad to hear it sir sam breathed a little easier this was just business with any luck at all hed be able to get back home and go on raising the lizard hatchlings and rather more than incidentally getting ready for jonathans wedding he shifted in his chair getting ready to stand up is there anything else just one thing more lieutenant colonel the president switched gears how do you feel about your part in everything thats happened over the past few months yeager grunted but did his best to pull his face straight dont rub sir i did what i thought i had to do he said i dont know what else to tell you and you have no trouble living with the loss of indianapolis stassen asked no trouble sam shook his head i wouldnt say that mr president i wouldnt say that at all a day doesnt go by that i dont think about it but the scales balance as far as im concerned do you think president warren lost any sleep over the lizards in the colonization fleet i honestly dont know stassen said until the recent tragic events i had no idea hed had anything to do with them his chuckle was mirthless as you may know the vice president mostly has about as much use as the vermiform appendix if you dont mind my saying so sir you should have known what hed done yeager said the way things are these days a vice president needs to be able to hit the ground running if he finds out hes president all of a sudden and thats happened a couple of times lately well cordell hull wasnt vice president when he took over but you know what i mean i know what you mean the president agreed hull probably had an easier time taking over than i did because he was more involved in making decisions than i was president warren did as he thought best now i have to do the same he started to say something more but checked himself sam had a pretty good idea of what it would have been though everything would have been fine if only you hadnt stuck your big nose into the middle of things it was even true for those who didnt think of the lizards as people earl warren hadnt not down deep where it counted is there anything else sam asked again this time harold stassen shook his head that will be all lieutenant colonel i did want to meet you though i think you understand the reasons for my curiosity yes sir i think so now yeager was the one who didnt say everything he was thinking if it werent for me you wouldnt be president right now hed never dreamt of having that kind of influence on events hed never wanted it either but what you wanted and what you got were two different things hed turned fiftyeight this year for a while there in that house somewhere near the four corners hed wondered if he would ever see another birthday all right then stassen told him you may go thank you mr president but before he left the office sam said may i ask you something sir go ahead the president said but i dont promise to answer i think you understand the reasons for that too nobody will ever trust you with anything truly important again not as long as you live that was what the president meant even if he was too polite to say so sam held his face steady dont rub no matter how much it hurts he tried to speak casually too wasnt that an awfully big meteor that slammed into mars the races computer network had some pretty spectacular pictures from their spacebased telescopes yes ive seen a few of them harold stassen said the astronomers will have a new crater to name from what i understand mars fortunately is pretty much worthless real estate a good thing a rock that size didnt hit earth sam agreed it would have been worse than an explosivemetal bomb from what the lizards say youre probably right or my briefing officers tell me the same thing anyhow stassen said now what was this question you wanted to ask never mind sir sam said youd probably just tell me i was sticking my nose in again where it didnt belong and i dont see much point to that ill keep my mouth shut from the beginning this time that is probably a very good idea the president said good day lieutenant colonel and a safe flight back to los angeles thank you mr president yeager wished stassen hadnt said that now he was going to worry till the airplanes landing gear hit the runway at la international airport the president or people close to him wouldnt make an airliner crash to get rid of one gadfly would they sam didnt want to think so but he knew there were people who wanted to see him dead if something like that happened the lizards would have a lot of sharp questions to ask american authorities if they didnt like the answers they got they were liable to take a spectacular revenge sam didnt care too much about that he wouldnt be around to see it but the thought of such revenge might give second thoughts to anybody who wanted his family to cash his lifeinsurance policy when yeager got back out onto the street he noticed that some of the trees were going from green to yellow and red hed been too worried about the meeting to pay any attention to that when he came to the gray house now the sight made him smile living in california as he did these days he seldom got such strong reminders of the passage from one season to the next he took a deep breath then let it out made it he thought if my plane home doesnt crash i made it anyhow he didnt really believe that would happen had stassen wanted to get rid of him his flight coming into little rock could have crashed too everythings going to be okay sometimes he could make himself believe that for as long as two or three minutes at a time i shall soon be returning to the starship ttomalss said from the monitor kassquit watched him with something less than delight he was as happened all too often these days oblivious to that sounding more cheerful than he had any reasonable business being he went on and then i hope your life can return to something approaching normal after the stressful time you have endured how do you define normal superior sir kassquit asked why as things were before you became involved with big uglies of course ttomalss answered that is your default setting so to speak would not a return to such conditions prove welcome he does not understand kassquit thought and he has no idea how much of my interior life he either misunderstands or misses altogether he was after all a male of the race and she wasnt a female of the race no matter how much of a duplicate of a female of the race hed tried to make her into speaking carefully she replied if i could forget the memories of the time when jonathan yeager was here that might perhaps be possible superior sir as things are however i have learned what it means to be part of a species with a continuously active sexuality this knowledge goes some way toward redefining normality for me and the inside of a fusion reaction is rather warm and walking from tosev to home would take a long time kassquit felt in her belly the size of the understatement shed just given her mentor ttomalss however took it as literal truth without understatement he said i suspect time will create a certain distancing effect your emotions will no longer seem so urgent as they do now that did it kassquit snapped do you not see can you not see that i do not want these emotions to fade i want to preserve them i want to feel others like them they come closer to making life worth living than anything i have ever known aboard this starship oh ttomalss said tonelessly kassquit knew shed wounded him part of her was too angry to care the rest of her remembered the time when hed been far and away the most important individual in her universe it hadnt been very long before it only seemed like forever her hands folded into fists she was at war within herself she feared she would stay that way as long as she lived gathering himself ttomalss said obliging you in this regard will not be easy you know i must tell you that even among tosevites regular sexual relations do not necessarily guarantee happiness the literature and music and moving pictures the tosevites produce demonstrate as much without the shed skin of a doubt i believe it kassquit said please understand that i am not seeking only sexual pleasure i can to some degree supply that for myself but the companionship i enjoyed with jonathan yeager along with the sexual pleasure i miss that very much she sighed however much i might wish to be one i am not and cannot be a female of the race i am to some degree irrevocably a big ugly shed had that thought before shed ever met any wild tosevites too it had horrified and disgusted her then it still did to some degree but she could not deny that she wanted to know more of the feelings shed had when jonathan yeager was aboard the starship with her ttomalss said several tosevite languages have a word for the emotional state you describe jonathan yeager used the tongue called english is that not a truth in english the term is he paused to consult the computer then made the affirmative gesture to show hed found what he wanted the term is love by the nature of things he could have only an intellectual understanding of the emotion he named but he was not a fool he had indeed identified the feeling kassquit craved she made the affirmative gesture too jonathan yeager taught me the word she agreed and as you must know he has informed me that he is entering into a permanent mating arrangement with a wild female big ugly that in effect he loves someone else this has been difficult for me to accept with equanimity there shed topped her own earlier understatement she hadnt thought she could you knew when jonathan yeager came to the starship that his relation with you would be only temporary ttomalss reminded her it was as much an experiment from his perspective as from yours an experiment prolonged because of the fighting that broke out against the deutsche perhaps it would have been better had the experiment not been prolonged yes perhaps it would have kassquit said but i cannot do anything about that except try to adjust as well as i can to the consequences of what did happen learning to experience this intensely pleasurable emotion and then having it taken away has been difficult another fine understatement i have asked you before if you wanted me to find you another tosevite male ttomalss said if you wish me to do so i will do my best to provide you with one who will be pleasing i thank you superior sir but that is still not what i want kassquit said for one thing i have no certainty of matching the pleasure i received from jonathan yeager pleasure both sexual and emotional for another suppose i should that liaison would also necessarily be temporary and i would go into another fit of depression after it ended from what i am given to understand this is rather like the emotional cycle ginger tasters experience perhaps it is i cannot speak there from personal experience and i am glad i cannot ttomalss said i can say that some ginger tasters appear to enjoy the cycle between pleasure and gloom while others wish they could escape it and escape from their use of the herb but what am to do kassquit asked though ttomalss was hardly in a position to be able to tell her he pointed that out your two choices are to remain as you are and to regret the one sexual and emotional relationship you had or to embark on another and then come to regret that too i would be the first to admit that neither of these strikes me as ideal they both strike me as disastrous kassquits fingerclaws were short and wide and blunt they bit into the soft flesh of her palms even so and yet superior sir i see no others either we shall do what we can for you kassquit on that you have my word ttomalss said kassquit wondered how much his word would be worth and whether it would be worth anything but she did believe he would try he went on soon i shall see you in person i look forward to it for now farewell farewell kassquit echoed and ttomalss image vanished from the monitor she looked around her cubicle and sighed again for most of her life this little space had been her refuge against the males and later the females of the race whod scorned her now it seemed much more like a trap what could she do here by herself what could she do anywhere here by herself and how among the males and females of the race could she ever feel as if she werent by herself her hand shaped the negative gesture it was impossible after shaping that gesture she scratched her head it felt rough and a little itchy she should have shaved it the day before but she hadnt felt like taking the trouble the next time she washed though she would have to do it why bother she wondered the answer leaped into her mind as soon as the thought formed to look more as if i were a member of the race kassquit walked over to the builtin mirror in the cubicle as always she had to stoop a little to see herself in it it was made for a member of the race not a big ugly she looked at her flat vertical shortsnouted softskinned eyeturretless face with the fleshy sound receptors to either side what difference would hair make she said aloud try as she would shed never look like a member of the race then a new thought occurred to her rabotevs and hallessi do not look like members of the race either but they are citizens of the empire i am a tosevite citizen of the empire if i want i can look like a tosevite wild big uglies except the ones like jonathan yeager who also imitated the race let their hair grow even jonathan yeager had shaved only the hair on his scalp and face not that on the rest of his body and from what he had said most females even among those who imitated the race let the hair on their scalps grow that female with whom he will be mating that karen cu i pepper probably has hair kassquit thought at first that struck her as a good argument for shaving but then she hesitated perhaps hair increased sexual attractiveness in the same way that among the race a males upraised scaly crest helped prompt a female to mate with him am a big ugly i cannot help being a big ugly even after this world becomes part of the empire tosevite citizens of the empire will probably go right on letting their hair grow why should i not do the same i cannot be a female of the race but i can be a tosevite female who is a citizen of the empire in fact i cannot be anything else she ran a hand over her scalp wondering how long the hair would take to grow to a respectable length then she let that hand slide down between her legs she would grow hair there too and under her arms as well she wondered whether she ought to keep shaving those areas even if she left her scalp alone then she shrugged jonathan yeager hadnt shaved around his private parts or under his arms either she decided to let the hair grow if she decided she didnt like it she could always get rid of it later the hair on her scalp quickly became noticeable after shed ignored the razor only a few days the researcher named tessrek spoke to her in the refectory are you trying to look like a wild big ugly if so you are succeeding hed never liked her not even when she was a hatchling she didnt like him either not even a little she answered why should i not look like a tosevite superior sir as you never tire of pointing out it is what i am high time you admit as much too instead of trying to act like a photocopy of a member of the race he said but warily shed already proved she could hold her own in a war of wits civilization does not depend on shape or appearance she said now civilization depends on culture you certainly prove that i thank you he said before realizing she didnt mean it as a compliment a couple of males at the table with him were quicker on the uptake their laughter told tessrek hed made a fool of himself he sprang to his feet and angrily skittered away kassquit ran her hand over her now fuzzy scalp it itched a little so did her underarms and private parts even so she thought she might learn to enjoy having hair when jonathan yeagers father got off the telephone he was laughing fit to burst whats funny dad jonathan asked weve got ourselves something brand new thats what his father answered were going to accept a couple of lizards and i do mean a couple in every sense of the word who arent just political refugees theyre sexual refugees too sexual outlaws you might even say outlaws that intrigued jonathan as his dad must have known it would why what have they done he tried to imagine what sort of sex crime a lizard no two lizards could commit imagination unfortunately failed him grinning sam yeager said theyve fallen in love and they want to get married and so the lizards are throwing them right out of their territory and letting us worry about em theyd tar em and feather em and ride em out of town on a rail too except they think feathers are just about as strange and unnatural as falling in love jonathan didnt think falling in love was unnatural he enjoyed it but it hadnt occurred to him that lizards might do the same how on earth did that happen he asked before his father could answer he held up a hand its got something to do with ginger doesnt it it would have to sure enough his father nodded the female lizard and her male friend would mate whenever she tasted ginger and she tasted a lot after a while from what i heard over the phone just now they were best friends before she got the habit they decided they wanted to stay together all the time and boy did they get in trouble when they told their local mayor or whomever it was they told what they wanted i bet they would jonathan exclaimed he tried to look at things from the point of view of a lizard official having done so he whistled softly its a wonder they didnt lock em in jail and throw away the key truth his father said in the language of the race and added an emphatic cough maybe they figured this pair would be a bad influence even in jail i dont know anything about that what i do know is the race let em ask for asylum here in the united states and weve granted it they expect to settle in california as a matter of fact weve probably got the biggest expatriate community in the country either los angeles or phoenix jonathan said his father laughed again not a whole lot of them move to boston or minneapolis he agreed they dont much fancy the weather in places like those i grew up not all that far from minneapolis i dont much fancy the weather there either having lived most of his life in los angeles jonathan had trouble imagining the sort of weather minneapolis got he didnt waste his time trying instead he asked may i tell karen about this shell think its funny too sure go ahead his dad answered he walked across the kitchen and set a hand on jonathans shoulder and thanks for asking before you talked with her too this one isnt classified but it couldve been i know better than to run my mouth dad jonathan said righteously after a moment though he admitted i did tell her about what youd found out but only after those goons grabbed you looking back i dont suppose i was doing her any big favor no i dont think you were either his father said but you were trying to make sure people didnt get away with what theyd done to the race and incidentally you were trying to save my neck so i guess ill forgive you okay jonathan walked over to the phone im going to call her now if thats okay with you the people she works withll think thats funny too because of his time up on the space station he still had a couple of quarters left at ucla after karen graduated shed landed a job at a firm that adapted lizard technology to human uses jonathan dialed her work number when she answered she didnt go borogove engineering karen culpepper speaking the way she had the day before what she did say was hello jonathan how are you today im fine he answered automatically then he blinked howd you know it was me i didnt say anything weve just got a new gadget were sublicensing it from a company up in canada she answered it reads phone numbers for calls you get and displays them on a screen thats hot jonathan said somebody had a real good idea there anyway the reason i called he repeated the story hed heard from his father when he finished karen gurgled laughter oh i do like that she said thats funny jonathan i wonder what the race will think of us from now on the united states of america the place where they can dump their perverts yeah jonathan laughed too but not for long you know that might not be so good if they start looking at us that way its liable to make them start looking down their snouts at us too maybe you ought to say something about that to your dad karen said i think i will he answered you still want to go to helen yus for dinner tonight sure karen said its friday so we can do something afterwards too we dont have to get up in the morning come get me around half past six okay thatll let me hop in the shower after i get home okay see you at sixthirty bye he hung up and turned to his father dad i know what youre going to want from me sam yeager pulled his wallet out of his hip pocket twenty bucks do the job thanks thatd be great jonathan took the bill and stuck it in his own pocket but that wasnt the only thing i had in mind his father laughed at him thats a line youre supposed to use with karen not with me jonathans ears burned sometimes his dad could be very crude sam yeager went on ill bite whats so important besides money something karen said jonathan answered and explained her reaction to what the race might think about america sheltering the two lizards who wanted to get married that is interesting his father said but were a free country and we keep getting freer a little bit at a time if we can start giving our own negroes a fair shake i expect well be able to find room for a few lizards who do strange things the race already thinks were too free for our own good all right jonathan said if youre not going to worry about it i wont either i expect youve got other things on your mind right now anyway his dad said jonathan did his best to look innocent his father laughed some more so his best probably wasnt very good he pulled up in front of karens house at sixthirty on the dot since they were engaged he could even give her a quick kiss in front of her parents when they got to helen yus on rosecrans near western only a couple of spaces in the lot were empty jonathan grabbed one yus was one of the oldest and most popular chinese restaurants in gardena actually just outside the city limits they ate eggflower soup and sweetandsour pork ribs and chow mein and crunchy noodles and drank tea something neither of them did outside a chinese restaurant after a while karen said i wonder what liu mei would think of the food here shed probably say it was good jonathan replied i dont know how chinese shed think it was that question had occurred to him before hed sensibly kept his mouth shut about it when liu mei visited the states with her mother hed had something of a crush on her karen had known it too and hadnt been very happy about it but now that shed asked the question he could safely answer it after fortune cookies and almond cookies jonathan paid for dinner they went out to the car his arm slipped around karens waist she leaned against him what time is it she asked jonathan looked at his watch a little past eight he answered next show at the drivein starts at we can do that if you feel like it sure karen said so jonathan drove east on rosecrans to vermont and then south past artesia to the drivein it wasnt very crowded the movie a thriller about the ginger trade set in marseille before it had gone up in radioactive fire had been there for a couple of weeks and would be closing soon jonathan didnt mind he found a spot well away from most of the other cars under a light pole with a dead lamp karen snickered how much of the movie are we going to watch she asked i dont know he answered well find out shall i go get some cokes sure she said dont bother with candy or popcorn though not for me anyway im pretty full okay me too be right back jonathan got out of the car and went over to the concession stand when he returned to the car with the sodas he found karen sitting in the back seat his hopes rose they probably wouldnt see a whole lot of the film he slid in beside her here he handed her one of the cokes wed better be careful not to spill these later she looked at him i dont know what youre talking about she said which made both of them laugh so hard they almost spilled the cokes then they did pay some attention to the first few minutes of the movie but even then they were paying a lot more attention to each other jonathan put his arm around karen she snuggled against him he never did figure out which of them started the first kiss whichever one it was the kiss went on and on karen put a hand on the back of his neck to pull him to her he rubbed her breasts through the fabric of her blouse she made a noise deep in her throat almost a growl thus encouraged he undid two buttons of the blouse and reached inside the cup of her bra her flesh was soft and smooth and warm before very long her blouse and bra were off now that they were engaged there didnt seem to be much point to the stopandstart games theyd played while they were dating she rubbed him too through his chinos he hoped he wouldnt explode he slid his hand under her skirt to the joining of her legs oh god jonathan she whispered as he stroked her ive got a rubber in my wallet he said she hesitated they still hadnt gone all the way but then she lay back on the seat jonathan tried to get her panties off get his trousers down far enough and put on the rubber all at the same time at last he managed all three i love you he gasped as he clumsily poised himself over her the rubber helped without it he was sure he would have come as soon as he started as he had with kassquit he discovered this was karens first time since it wasnt his he had a better notion of what to do than hed had up in the starship karen still winced when he pierced her even with the rubber he didnt last long after gasping his way to delight he asked are you okay was it okay it hurt she answered i know its supposed to get better right now i like your hand and your mouth more is that all right she sounded anxious i guess so jonathan answered he liked her hand and especially her mouth at least as well too but this had a finality to it that nothing else could match he kissed her i love you i love you too karen said give me my top back will you inside a couple of minutes they were fully dressed again just in time for the big car chase jonathan couldnt think of a movie hed enjoyed more ttomalss wondered whether all the time hed spent raising kassquit had been for nothing every time he looked at her his liver twinged inside him her hair grew longer every day making her resemble a wild big ugly more and more her spirit seemed more like a wild big uglys every day too in something close to despair he railed at her will you also wash off your body paint and put on wrappings no i see no need for that kassquit answered with maddening calm but if i am a tosevite citizen of the empire should i not follow tosevite usages where they do no harm i do not think a head of hair is very harmful in any direct sense probably not ttomalss admitted but your growing it seems a slap in the snout at the race which has spent so much effort to nurture you and to acculturate you you have made me a creature a tool a thing to be used kassquit said it has taken me a long time probably too long to realize i can be more than that if i am a citizen of the empire i should have as much freedom as any other citizen if i choose to be eccentric i may she ran a hand over her dark hairy scalp if you choose to make yourself ugly you mean ttomalss said but kassquit made the negative gesture for tosevites and especially for tosevite females hair seems to contribute to attractiveness i should prefer to be judged by the standards of my own biological species there i have had enough of being thought a repulsively ugly imitation of a female of the race believe me superior sir i have had more than enough of that she used an emphatic cough ttomalss flinched he knew some of the things tessrek and other males had said while he was rearing kassquit hed never really thought about the effect that hearing such things might have on a young individual isolated from everyone around her because of her appearance and biology there were probably a lot of things hed never thought about while rearing kassquit some of them were coming up out of the shadows to bite him now slowly he said punishing me for errors i made in the past serves no useful purpose i can see i am not punishing you that is not my intention at all kassquit said i am however asserting my own individuality any citizen of the empire may do as much that is a truth ttomalss said another truth however is that most citizens of the empire suppress a good deal of their individuality the better to fit into the society of which they are but small parts kassquit ran a hand over her hair again and then along her smooth scaleless upright body even as she bent into the posture of respect she spoke with poisonous politeness exactly how superior sir am i supposed to suppress my individuality you cannot change me into a female of the race you do not know how many times i have wished you could since i cannot be a female of the race how can i do better than to be the best tosevite female i can possibly be her argument was painfully cogent but ttomalss had an argument of his own you are not culturally prepared to be a tosevite female of course i am not kassquit said you were the one who told me i was the first tosevite citizen of the empire do you now disavow those words because i have learned to see that i am truly a tosevite and cannot imitate the race in every imaginable way at the moment you seem to be doing your best not to imitate the race in any imaginable way ttomalss didnt try to hide his bitterness i have spent my whole life imitating the race kassquit said am i not entitled to spend some little while discovering what the biological part of my individuality means and how i can best adjust to its demands of course you are ttomalss answered wishing he could say no but i do wish you would not throw yourself into this voyage of discovery with such painful intensity it will do you no good no doubt you were the proper judge of such things when i was a hatchling kassquit said now that i am an adult however i will plot my course as i think best not in accordance with anyone elses views even if that course proves a disastrous mistake ttomalss asked kassquit made the affirmative gesture even if that course proves a disastrous mistake you of course superior sir have never made a single mistake in all the days since you broke out of your eggshell at the moment ttomalss was thinking the most disastrous mistake hed ever made was deciding to rear a tosevite hatchling hed thought that before when the terrifying chinese female named liu han kidnapped him as vengeance for his trying to raise her hatchling as hed succeeded in raising kassquit but even his success here was proving full of thorns hed never expected every male every female makes mistakes he said wise ones however do not make unnecessary mistakes which are which is for me to judge superior sir kassquit said and now if you will excuse me she didnt wait to find out if he would excuse her she just turned and strode out of his chamber had the door been the type common on tosev she would have slammed it as things were she could only leave in a huff with a sigh ttomalss got down to the rest of his work to everything that had accumulated while he was down in cairo working with the other members of the commission on earl warren he studied a report of tosevite attendance at shrines dedicated to the spirits of emperors past since establishing those shrines had been his idea reports naturally came to him he would have liked to see the numbers larger than they were few big uglies in the regions where their native superstitions were particularly powerful sought to modify those superstitions that was unfortunate because those were the areas where ttomalss had most hoped to change tosevite behavior and beliefs patience ttomalss said to himself patience was the foundation upon which the race had built its success but it seemed to be more a virtue on home than here on tosev ttomalss hissed in surprise on noticing that the shrines with the highest attendance were not on territory the race ruled at all but in the notempire of the united states he wondered what that meant and wondered all the more so because the americans had gone to the extreme of immolating their own city to keep the race from gaining influence over them further investigation of this apparent paradox may well prove worthwhile he wrote then he noticed that atvar had arranged to send the two perverts who had caused so much scandal to the united states the amencans would apparently put up with anything no matter how bizarre the telephone hissed senior researcher ttomalss he said i greet you and i greet you the image that appeared on the monitor belonged to tessnek whod been an itch under ttomalss scales every since he started trying to raise tosevite hatchlings with him i have to put up with anything too ttomalss thought tessnek went on are you aware of the latest disgusting behavior on the part of your pet big ugly she is not my pet ttomalss said however much kassquit disheartened him tessrek was the last male before whom he would show that she is a citizen of the empire as i am and as you are she certainly boasts of being one tessrek said but her behavior hardly makes the boast anything in which she or the empire can take pride by which i suppose you mean that you tried baiting her again and found yourself unhappy at the outcome ttomalss said you really should learn tessrek this has happened before and it will keep right on happening as long as you refuse to recognize that she is an adult and an intelligent being he himself was none too eager to recognize kassquit as an adult but he wouldnt admit that to tessrek either tessnek hissed scornfully i am not referring to the big uglys usual rudeness i am resigned to that he was lying as ttomalss knew for the sake of moral advantage before ttomalss could call him on it he continued i am referring to the disgusting growth of hair she is cultivating on top of her head it truly does sicken me i want to turn my eye turrets away every time i see her you have never complained about the hair wild big uglies grow ttomalss replied so i think you are singling her out for undue unfair attention but those other big uglies are as you point out wild tessnek said both you and kassquit have been prating that she is a proper citizen of the empire proper citizens of the empire do not grow hair i know of no law or regulation forbidding citizens of the empire from growing hair ttomalss swung both eye turrets toward tessrek and spoke in judicious tones as a matter of fact you might try it yourself it could do wonders for your appearance tessrek hissed again this time in real fury ttomalss broke the connection in the middle of the hiss with any luck tessrek wouldnt bother him for some time ttomalss mouth fell open in a laugh he hadnt enjoyed himself so much since since mating with felless he thought but then he made the negative gesture the pleasures of mating were altogether distinct from other sorts he went back to work with a lighter liver a moment later though he too hissed in chagrin and dismay hed bounced kassquits arguments off tessneks snout they made a surprisingly good case when he used them against a male hed long disliked of course when kassquit used those arguments against him hed thought them absurd what did that mean he was scientist enough to see one possibility hed rejected out of hand before by the emperor he thought and cast down his eye turrets what if she is right once conquered the rabotevs and the hallessi had soon abandoned almost all of their own cultural baggage and been assimilated into the larger more complex more sophisticated culture that was the empire and their cases had always been the races models for what would happen on tosev but what if the model was wrong in terms of biology the big uglies were fan more different from the race than either the rabotevs on the hallessi and in terms of culture they were far closer to the race than the rabotevs on the hallessi had been both those factors argued that they would acculturate more slowly and to a lesser degree than either of the other species the race had conquered even if tosev was finally conquered in full tosevites might go right on letting their hair grow and wearing wrappings they might keep speaking their own languages and practicing their own superstitions that would make life to say nothing of administration more difficult for the race ttomalss wondered if in their own history the big uglies had known any situations analogous to this one he knew less than he should have about tosevite history so did the race as a whole it hadnt seemed germane but maybe it was wonder how i can get in touch with a tosevite historian he thought maybe pel less will know a way down there on the surface of tosev no pshing told straha when he tried to call atvar the fleetlond is busy with important matters and has given orders that he cannot be disturbed am i no longer an important matter then straha demanded angrily were it not for me you would still have no idea which tosevite notempire struck at the colonization fleet i am sorry sup atvans adjutant checked himself strahas rank remained a point of ambiguity he wasnt a shiplond any more not to anyone but himself what was he nobody quite knew not enough for pshing to call him superior sir evidently i am sorry pshing repeated the fleetlond has given me explicit orders and i cannot disobey them straha wondered if he were the only male of the race on tosev whod ever imagined disobeying orders after a moments thought he realized he wasnt there had been mutinies during the first round of fighting only a handful but they did happen by all hed been able to find out few of them had had happy aftermaths for the mutineers had his own defection had a happy aftermath for him he was still trying to figure that out it could have been worse he did know that he could have defected to the sssr for instance he shuddered at the thought he might have done it he hadnt known any better then and now if you will excuse me pshing said and broke the connection straha wondered what would happen if he tried to walk into atvars office despite being unwelcome by far the most likely result would be his expulsion he sighed much as he enjoyed irritating the fleetlond here he would get more irritation than he gave out was freer in the united states he thought for a moment the idea of redefecting crossed his mind but he made the negative gesture after the destruction of indianapolis the americans would not welcome him on the other fork of the tongue the race didnt welcome him either he was still straha the traitor as far as males and females here in cairo were concerned what he knew was useful he himself they wished they could take his knowledge and leave him alone they might as well have been americans he made the negative gesture again in that regard the race was worse than the americans because his own kind were more selfrighteous and sanctimonious and he realized he had more of a taste for freedom for doing what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it than had been true before he defected to the united states who would have believed it he thought the big uglies ideology has painted itself on me that wasnt true to any enormous extent he still thought the american reporter who would have printed his opinion that the united states had been responsible for attacking the colonization fleet was addled the male had had no business doing any such thing and then the exshiplords mouth fell open in a startled laugh when hed offered the reporter that opinion hed thought of it as nothing but a joke a way to get under the tosevites scales no under his skin was the english idiom because big uglies had no scales but hed told the fellow the truth after all so what he thought even if it was the truth it had no business appearing in a newspaper maybe i am not so enamored of freedom as i thought but he made the negative gesture once more compared to the americans he was a reactionary compared to his own kind he was a radical and a worse radical than hed been before fleeing to the usa and there were plenty of males and by now very likely some females too who were a good deal more radical than he the expatriate community in the united states was flourishing some males were even prepared to look kindly on snoutcounting and to propose institutionalizing it for the race as well that still struck straha as laughable that members of the race could hold such ideas though was bemusing everyone talked about the ways in which the race was influencing tosev and the tosevites and with good reason the races influence on the planet and its folk was profound and the races influence on the tosevites had been envisioned since the first probe sent to this world found it habitable no one at least no one among the race seemed much interested in talking about ways in which tosev and the tosevites were exerting influence in the other direction nobody had expected the big uglies to own any ideas worth investigating the probe sent to this world hadnt shown everything worth showing or rather tosev and the tosevites had changed far faster than anyone back on home had imagined possible the leading civilizations here were formidable intellectually as well as technologically and tosev itself was influencing the race a goodsized jar of ginger sat on the floor by strahas sleeping mat he went over and had a taste how many males how many females indulged themselves so whenever they found the chance he could freely do so a small mercy from atvar who did not seem inclined to grant any large ones for the race as a whole though and especially for females ginger nemained illegal with harsh penalties levied against those caught using it but males and females kept right on tasting mating season as a brief separate time was a thing of the past the colonists were still new to tosev they hadnt fully adjusted to the change yet a lot of them kept trying to pretend it hadnt happened but how would things look in a couple of generations straha had heard the scandalous story of the two perverts whod become as sexually addicted to each other as they were physically addicted to the herb all things considered straha supposed atvar had been wise to exile them to the usa where the big uglies reckoned such infatuations normal but atvar has all the imagination of a mud puddle straha said he was sure his chamber was monitored but didnt care his opinion of the fleetlond was about as far removed from secret as it could be atvar no doubt believed the two perverts an aberration maybe they were straha wouldnt have bet on it to him they seemed far more likely to be the shape of things to come the telephone hissed former shiplord and current nuisance straha speaking straha said i greet you and i greet you atvans image appeared in the monitor you have named yourself well for which i more or less thank you with ginger making every nerve twang straha didnt much care what he said pshing tells me you tried to call atvan said i was occupied i am no longer what do you want if it is anything reasonable i will try to get it for you that is more than you have said for some time straha replied what i chiefly want to know is whether you have finally extracted all the yolk from my egg if you have i would like to live somewhere other than shepheards hotel your debriefing appears to be complete yes atvar answered but what will you do if you are turned loose on the members of the race here on tosev how will you support yourself the position of shiplord came with pay the position of nuisance while otherwise eminent does not in genuine curiosity straha asked where did you learn such sarcasm you did not speak so when i was a shiplord dealing with fleetlord reffet may have something to do with it atvar told him dealing with big uglies may have something to do with it too in different ways they drive a sensible male mad that assumed he was sensible straha made no such assumption but he kept quiet about the assumptions he did make atvar held his fate in his fingerclaws all he said was you are not quite the male you were no one who comes to tosev escapes unchanged atvar said but you have not answered my question have you any plans for making a living if you are allowed entry into the greater society of the race as a matter of fact i have straha said i was thinking of drafting my memoirs and living off the proceeds of publication i am i gather notorious i ought to be able to exploit that for the sake of profit no one who comes to tosev escapes unchanged atvar repeated when you were a shiplord you would never have debased yourself so perhaps not straha said but then again who knows i have had unique experiences why should others not be interested in learning of them because they were illegal atvar suggested because they were shameful because your descriptions of them may be libelous all those things should attract interest to my story straha said cheerfully no one would care to read the memoirs of a clerk who did nothing but sit in front of a monitor his whole life long no one will read your memoirs if they are libelous atvar said you are not in the united states any more you know exalted fleetlord i do not need to be libelous to be interesting straha said i will be the judge of that when my aides and i see the manuscript you produce atvar said had straha been a big ugly he would have smiled you and your aides will not be the only ones judging it i am sure fleetlord reffet and many of the colonists would be fascinated to learn all the details of what happened before they got here and as i say i doubt i would need to distort the truth in any way to keep them entertained and their tongues wagging he waited to see how atvar would take that he despised reffet almost as much as atvar did but if he could use the fleetlord of the colonization fleet as a lever against the fleetlord of the conquest fleet he would not only do it he would enjoy doing it and sure enough atvar said you mean you will go out of your way to embarrass me and hope reffet will like the result enough to let you go ahead and publish it that is not at all what i said exalted fleetlord straha protested although it was exactly what hed meant suppose i let you get away with that atvar said suppose i pretend not to notice whatever you may have to say about me will you include in your memoirs passages indicating the need for a longterm soldiers time here on tosev to help stop the endless grumbling from the colonists the race after all is more important than either one of us straha hadnt expected that either yes atvar had changed over the years to some degree that made him harder to dislike but only to some degree straha made the affirmative gesture i think we have a bargain imagine my delight atvar broke the connection no he wasnt so hard to dislike after all as reuven and moishe russie were walking from their home to the office they now shared reuvens father asked him and how is mrs radofskys toe these days his tone was a little too elaborately casual to be quite convincing it seems to be coming along very well reuven answered listening to himself he found he also sounded a little too elaborately casual to be quite convincing im glad to hear it moishe russie said and what is your opinion of those parts of mrs radofsky located north of her fractured toe my medical opinion is that the rest of mrs radofsky is quite healthy reuven replied his father smiled i dont believe i asked for your medical opinion well its what youre going to get reuven said which made moishe russie laugh out loud after a few more paces reuven added i think shes a very nice person her daughter is a sweet little girl yes thats always a good sign moishe russie agreed a good sign of what reuven asked that someone is a nice person his father said nice people commonly have nice children he gave his own son a sidelong glance there are exceptions every now and then of course yes i suppose an obnoxious father could have a nice son reuven said blandly his father laughed again and thumped him on the back they were both still chuckling as they went into the office yetta the receptionist had got there ahead of both of them she sent them disapproving looks whats waiting for us today yetta moishe russie asked he and reuven already had a pretty good idea of their scheduled appointments but yetta got fussy if they didnt respect what she saw as her prerogative sometimes as now she got fussy anyhow neither one of you has enough to keep you busy she complained i dont know how you expect to pay the bills if you dont have more patients were doing all right reuven said which was true and more than true well you wont keep doing all right unless more people come down sick yetta snapped reuven looked at his father his father was looking at him that made it harder for both of them to keep from laughing somehow they managed they went past the disapproving yetta and into their own offices neither of them had an appointment scheduled till ten oclock an hour and a half away reuven caught up on paperwork a neverending struggle and was working his way through a lizard medical journal when his father called him whats up reuven asked i hear ppurrin and waxxa really have gone to the united states moishe russie answered have they reuven said well thats one problem solved for old atvar then and some credit for us because we came up with the idea for him credit for us yes his father said a problem solved i dont know i wouldnt bet on it though for the time being i think atvar thinks he wont have to worry about it any more what do you mean reuven said the americans will let those lizards stay they may be perverts to the race but not to us im sure the americans will let them stay yes his father nodded thats not the problem or not as i see it anyhow reuven scratched his head what is then im sorry father but im not following you at all nomoishe russie grinned all right lets put it like this do you think ppurrin and waxxa will be the only pair of what the lizards call perverts that theyll have a lot of lizards taste ginger oh reuven said and then in an altogether different tone of voice oh he gave his father an admiring look you think those two are just the tip of the iceberg dont you dont you his father returned the colonists havent been here very long after all and this is already starting to happen what will things be like when youre my age what will things be like when your children are my age most times reuven would have pointed out with some heat that he had no children at present today though he nodded thoughtfully theyll have to change a lot of things to adjust to that wont they i mean if they really do start forming permanent mated pairs start falling in love and getting married moishe russie said and reuven nodded accepting the correction his father went on it will be as hard for them to get used to the idea of pairs settling down together as it would be for us to get used to the idea of being promiscuous all the time he wagged a finger at his son and wipe that dirty grin off your face who me reuven said as innocently as he could i dont know what youre talking about thats pretty funny moishe russie said now tell me another one no reuven shook his head he cautiously looked out the door then lowered his voice anyhow who do you think i am yetta or somebody his father rolled his eyes she does her work well as for the rest he shrugged and then in a near whisper went on we might get somebody whos a pain in the neck and doesnt do her job well i can put up with bad jokes i suppose so reuven pulled his mind back to the business at hand do you really think well see a day when the lizards start pairing off by the thousands instead of just one couple at a time that would make this world different from all the others in the empire in some very important ways i know moishe russie said im not sure the race has really figured all of that out yet and it will be years before the other planets in the empire find out what ginger is doing here even if it does what i think it will its always going to be years between stars as far as radio goes and even more years between them as far as travel the race is more patient than we are i dont think we could have built an empire that would hang together in spite of all the delays in giving orders and getting things done youre bound to be right about that reuven said somebody who was governor on one planet would decide he wanted to be king or president or whatever he called himself and hed stop taking orders and set up his own government or else start a civil war thats how we are his father agreed the lizards here know it too i wonder what they think of us back on home so do i reuven said whatever it is its bound to be ten years out of date i know moishe russie laughed and by the time home answers its twenty years out of date atvar is just now finding out what the emperor thinks of the truce he made with us big uglies and what does the emperor think reuven asked has atvar said he was going to use his fathers connections with the race for all they were worth he hasnt said much his father answered i gather the emperor knows atvars the man uh the lizard on the spot and so he has to do what he thinks best its a good thing the emperor didnt order him to go back to war with all of us and you had best believe thats a truth hed been speaking hebrew but threw in an emphatic cough even so do you really think he would have done it if the emperor had told him to reuven asked that unpleasant possibility hadnt crossed his mind but his father nodded if the emperor told atvar to stick a skewer through earth and throw it on the fire hed do it i dont think we can even imagine how well the lizards obey the emperor i suppose not reuven knew the males of the race with whom hed dealt over the years didnt understand what made him tick he was willing to believe it worked both ways the front door opened hello mr krause yetta said she raised her voice dr russie mr krause is here hes mine reuvens father said in a soft aside he added if hed lose twenty kilos and stop drinking and smoking hed add twenty years to his life reuven said he probably thinks theyd be twenty boring years he got up and went back to his own office while his father was still scratching his head over that if mr krause was here his own first patient would come through the door pretty soon too before yetta announced that first patients arrival reuven picked up the telephone and made a call after the phone rang a couple of times somebody on the other end of the line a woman picked it up hello mrs radofsky reuven said no shes at work this is her sister the woman answered whos calling please in the background miriam prattled something the sister was undoubtedly looking after her this is dr russie reuven answered im calling to find out how her broken toe is doing he wondered if the sister would simply tell him and hang up instead she said oh thank you very much dr russie let me give you her number she did reuven wrote it down after he said his goodbyes he called it gold lion furniture a woman said this time reuven recognized mrs radofskys voice he named himself and then asked hows your toe doing these days its still sore the widow radofsky answered but its getting better its not as swollen as it was and it doesnt hurt as much as it did either im glad to hear it he said for all the world as if he as opposed to the passage of time had had something to do with her recovery thank you very much for calling she said im sure most doctors wouldnt have done it for their patients reuven was sure he wouldnt have done it for most of his patients too he also had a pretty good notion the widow radofsky was sure of that even so he nervously drummed his fingers on his desk before asking would you ah like to go out to supper with me one of these evenings to celebrate feeling better silence on the other end of the line he braced himself for rejection if she said no if she still had her dead husband and nobody else in her heart how could he blame her he couldnt for that matter if she just wasnt interested in him for a multitude of other reasons how could he blame her again he couldnt but at last she said thank you i think i would like that call me at home why dont you and well make the arrangements all right he said yetta chose that moment to bawl out his name his first patient had made an appearance after all reuven said his goodbyes and hung up he was smiling the patient had waited just long enough marshal zhukov had or could have more power than vyacheslav molotov molotov knew it too but because of his party office he exercised a certain moral authority over the marshal as long as zhukov chose to acknowledge it which he did molotov took advantage of that now he said i assume our support for the peoples liberation army will be altogether clandestine georgi konstantinovich it had better be at any rate if it isnt comrade general secretary it will be at least as big a surprise to me as it is to you zhukov answered that was no doubt intended for a joke as usual molotov disapproved of jokes all they were good for in his jaundiced opinion was clouding the issue he did not want this issue clouded he wanted no ambiguity whatsoever here if we are detected comrade marshal very unfortunate things will spring from it consider the reich consider the united states i do consider them i consider them every day zhukov said as far as the peoples liberation army knows our aid has not been detected as far as the gru knows it has not been detected as far as the nkvd knows it has not been detected we are as secure as we can possibly be his lip curled when he condescended to name the nkvd at all the partys espionage and security service as opposed to the red armys had fallen on hard times since berias botched coup that was partly at molotovs insistence partly at zhukovs the nkvd spied on the red army as well as the rest of the world it had needed purging of berias henchmen and had got it even so molotov wished he had the nkvd running at a higher level of efficiency than it possessed right now the gru was a good service but its first loyalty lay with the army not with the party with zhukov not with him and he wanted more than one perspective on his course of action having to rely on the gru alone left him feeling like a oneeyed man he said nothing of that to zhukov of course it would have roused the marshals suspicions and zhukov had plenty even when they werent roused he would have thought molotov was trying to rebuild an independent political position he would have been right too aloud molotov was mild as he had to be let us hope the assessments are correct then given the german arms we have been able to supply to the peoples liberation army do you think they stand any serious chance of throwing off the races yoke in china probably not but they can make enormous nuisances of themselves and when was mao ever good for any more than that zhukov answered proving molotov did not have the exclusive franchise for cynicism among the soviet leaders besides even if the chinese do seem on the brink of expelling the lizards the race has explosivemetal bombs and the peoples liberation army doesnt not from us anyhowmolotov agreed but life gets more difficult and more complicated now that the japanese do have them zhukov nodded they had imperialist designs on china before the lizards showed up they havent forgotten either they still think of it as their rightful sphere of influence that is part of it georgi konstantinovich but only part molotov was glad the marshal did leave him control over foreign policy zhukov was a long way from stupid but he didnt always see the subtleties the rest is the race may also hesitate longer before using explosivemetal weapons now that they have to take the japanese more seriously maybe zhukov didnt sound convinced the lizards didnt give a fart about what we thought when they pounded the nazis flat were going to be worrying about fallout in the baltics and byelorussia and the western ukraine for years to come not all of that fallout is from the lizards bombs molotov said some of it comes from the ones the germans used on poland doesnt matter marshal zhukov insisted the point is the same either way theyll do what they think needs doing and theyll worry about everything else later if the rebels in china look like winning their cities will start going up in smoke he waved his hand do svidanya mao molotov considered maybe hed looked for subtleties and missed a piece of the big picture it could be he admitted there are times i wouldnt miss him believe you me there are zhukov said hes as arrogant as stalin ever was but stalin did plenty to earn the right maos nothing but a jumpedup bandit chief and a lot of the jumping up is only in his own mind more than the foolish joke earlier that did tempt molotov to smile it also made him look nervously around the office he noticed zhukov doing the same thing were both afraid losef vissarrionovich is listening he said hes been dead twelve years and more zhukov said but if anybody could still be listening after all that time hes the one that is the truth molotov agreed very well then do your best to get still more weapons to the chinese if they are going to annoy the lizards we want them to do it on a grand scale the more attention the race pays to china the less it will be able to pay to anything else including us and the less attention the race pays to us the better we shall like it zhukov nodded he saw the desirability of that as plainly as molotov did after another nod he got to his feet all right comrade general secretary well continue on the course weve set a grin spread over his broad peasant features and with any luck at all the nazis will get the blame yes that would break my heart molotov said which made zhukov laugh out loud the marshals salute was unusually sincere he did a smart aboutturn and left the general secretarys office molotov scratched his chin little by little he was or thought he was regaining some of the authority hed had to yield to marshal zhukov after the red army crushed berias abortive coup he hadnt really tried to exert it he could have been wrong one of these days though he might have to try he wouldnt live forever he didnt want his successor as beholden to the army as he was of course what he wanted might end up having nothing to do with the way things turned out his secretary stuck his head into the office your next appointment is here comrade general secretary he said its i know who it is pyotr maksimovich molotov snapped i do keep track of these things you know send him in yes comrade general secretary his secretary retreated in a hurry which was what molotov had in mind david nussboym came into the office good day comrade general secretary good day david aronovich molotov answered automatically then even his legendary impassivity cracked sit down take it easy here i will get you some tea as he rose to do that he added how are you feeling i have been better nussboym allowed he sounded as battered as he looked the last time molotov had seen him when hed given nussboym permission to go into poland the jewish nkvd man had been thin and bald and nondescript he was thinner now skeletally lean and he was balder he had not a hair on his head not even an eyebrow or an eyelash no lizard could have had less hair than he did and he was no longer nondescript either with his skin a pasty yellowish white anyone who saw him would remember him for a long time though possibly wishing he wouldnt here molotov gave him the tea into which hed dumped a lot of sugar would you care for a sweet roll too no thank you vyacheslav mikhaibovich nussboym shook his head even so small a motion seemed to take all his strength im afraid i still havent got much in the way of an appetite his rhythmic polish accent gave his russian the appearance of a vitality lacking in truth i had heard you were suffering from radiation sickness molotov said returning to his desk after the unusual show of solicitude but i had no idea nussboyms shrug looked effortful too by everything the doctors tell me i ought to be dead from the dose of radiation i took he shrugged again im still here i intend to be here a while longer they say im a lot likelier now to get cancer later on but i cant do anything about that either who knows maybe ill beat the odds one more time i hope so molotov said on the whole sincerely nussboym hadnt had to get him out of the cell where beria had imprisoned him but hed done it afterwards the nkvd man had been reasonable in the rewards hed requested and so molotov did wish him well he was useful after all thank you nussboym said in the meantime i serve the soviet union good molotov nodded approval spoken like an old bolshevik stalin of course had purged most of the old bolsheviks the men whod made the russian revolution at need molotov could always purge nussboym knowing that was reassuring the general secretary went on speak to me of the situation in poland you will or you had better have more uptodate information than i can give nussboym replied ive spent most of the past few months on my back with needles and tubes sticking into me molotov had always been a scrawny even a weedy little man which might well have helped keep him safe during stalins tenure for losef vissarionovich hadnt been any too big either despite looking anything but robust though hed always been healthy the idea of going into a hospital of entrusting his physical wellbeing to a physician he could not fully control gave him the cold chills doing his best not to think about that he said you were on the spot for some time and you survived the fighting which a good many of our operatives did not and of course you are a native of poland your impressions of what is going on there then will be of particular value to me you are too kind comrade general secretary david nussboym murmured seeming genuinely moved from what i saw the jews are solidly behind the race which understands that and exploits it a good many poles favor independence but they too all except for a few fascist madmen or progressive communists prefer the lizards to either the reich or the soviet union that accorded well with everything molotov had already heard he asked how much do you think the extensive damage poland suffered as a result of the fighting will make poles and jews resent the race there i fear i cannot tell you much nussboym gave the soviet leader a bony grin i suffered my own extensive damage too early in the fighting to have an opinion if you like though i will go back to investigate i will think about that molotov said first though you plainly need more recovery time had the nkvd man argued with him he would have sent nussboym back to poland right away no tool was better than one that actively wanted to be used but david nussboym didnt argue that left molotov a trifle disappointed though he showed it no more than he showed anything else mordechai anielewicz lifted a glass of plum brandy in salute lc a rhe said and then added and to life as a whole family o rayahis wife said his sons and daughter raised their glasses even heinrich had a shot glass worth of slivovitz tonight mordechai drank so did bertha and their children heinrich hadnt drunk plum brandy more than once or twice before then hed taken tiny sips tonight imitating his father he knocked back the whole shot at once he spluttered and choked a little and turned very red am i poisonedhe wheezed no mordechai did his best not to laugh believe me you have to drink a lot more slivovitz than that to get properly poisoned mordechai bertha anielewicz said reprovingly but anielewicz only grinned at his wife and at heinrich whose color was returning to normal besides if you do drink too much you dont usually know how poisoned you are till the next morning you havent had nearly enough to need to worry about that his wife sent him another reproachful look he pretended not to see it theyd been married long enough that he could get away with such things every now and then the look his wife sent him for ignoring the first one warned him he couldnt get away with such things any too often his daughter miriam was old enough to make the more regular acquaintance of slivovitz but shed had the good sense not to get greedy with what hed given her now she raised her glass which still held a good deal of the plum brandy and heres to przemysl for taking us in everybody drank to that everybody except heinrich who had nothing left to drink the town in southern poland not far from the slovakian border hadnt been hit too hard in the fighting and it kept its goodsized jewish community back in the ss had been on the point of shipping the jews to an extermination camp but local wehrmacht officials hadnt let it happen the jews were doing important labor for them and then the lizards had driven the nazis out of poland and przemysls jews survived thinking of wehrmacht men whod been if not decent then at least pragmatic made mordechai also think of johannes drucker he said i wonder if the german space pilot ever found his kin i hope so his wife said after all his wife and children are part jewish too no matter how little they like it that was david mordechais older son he wasnt the worst of fellows anielewicz said ive known plenty of germans worse believe me he used an emphatic cough his own family helped remind him what being a human being meant david was at fifteen convinced everything came in one of two colors black or white what he said here though probably held a lot of truth bertha anielewicz said hell go his way well go ours and with any luck at all well never have anything to do with each other again odds are good anyhow that also probably held a lot of truth before mordechai could say so pancer walked up to him and said beep the beffel stretched up toward him extending its forelegs as far as they would go that hed learned meant it want to be scratched he obliged the beffel might have been hatched on home but it got on better with humans than the lizards did we should have drunk a toast to pancer heinrich said if it werent for him we wouldnt all be here now mordechai lifted the bottle of slivovitz here son do you want another drink you can have one heinrich hastily shook his head anielewiczs grin covered his relief he would have given the boy one more shot of brandy but he was just as well pleased that heinrich didnt want it ill tell you what id drink a toast to miriam said with a toss of the head and thats a bigger flat this isnt so bad mordechai said next to what things were like in warsaw before the lizards came this is paradise and in lodzhis wife agreed their children didnt know how things had been back in the nazicreated ghettos that also was all to the good miriam didnt see the benefits of ignorance im tired of sleeping on a cot here in the front room she said and tossed her head again were all sleeping on cots mordechai pointed out your brothers are in one bedroom your mother and i in the other and you have this room here the only other places for you to sleep are under the shower or on the kitchen table i know that miriam said impatiently its why we need a bigger flat it doesnt matter so much bertha anielewicz said everything we used to have went up in smoke i wish it hadnt id be lying if i said anything different but well get by as long as weve got each other miriam started to say something then visibly thought better of it anielewicz wondered what it would have been maybe he was better off not knowing but his wife didnt need to wonder she knew she wagged a finger at her daughter you were going to say weve got altogether too much of each other werent you but thats not so either just remember what things were like in the barracks at that nazis farm next to that this is paradise too we didnt have any choice there though miriam said we dont have any choice here either not now bertha anielewicz said but be patient for a little while and we will if your father hadnt tracked us down we never would have had any choices there and if pancer hadnt beeped when he did so father heard him he might never have tracked us down heinrich scratched his pet the scaly little animal wiggled sinuously miriam rolled her eyes if you were a goy youd say that beffel ought to be canonized pancer deserves it more than some saints i can think of heinrich retorted enough of that mordechai anielewicz said sharply the goyim can afford to make jokes about us they outnumber us ten to one we cant afford to make jokes about them even with the lizards to lean on its too dangerous his children looked ready to argue about that too they were less aware of how dangerous being a small minority could prove than he was but before the argument could get going the telephone rang bertha was closest to it ill get it she said and did a moment later she held the handset out to anielewicz for you a member of the race nesseref he asked and his wife shrugged he took the telephone i greet you he said in the lizards language and i greet you the lizard replied i am odottoss liaison officer between the races military and your tosevite forces here in poland we have spoken before truth anielewicz agreed shuttlecraft pilot nesseref was kind enough to give me your name i thank you for the assistance you were able to give my mate and my hatchlings and me you are welcome odottoss replied you and your fighters have served the race well it is only fair that you should have some recompense for that service again i thank you and now superior sir what can i do for you he did not for a moment believe the male of the race had called merely to throw bouquets at him and he was right for odottoss inquired do you know the whereabouts of the explosivemetal bomb you jews have claimed to have since the end of the first round of fighting at the moment i do not know that no mordechai admitted since the recent fighting against the reich i have been concerned with other things till now no one has mentioned any problems with this explosivemetal bomb i do not know that there are any odottoss said but i do not know that there are none either as best the race has been able to determine the bomb is not where we formerly thought it was have you ordered its transfer have i personally no anielewicz said but that does not mean other jewish fighters may not have given such an order for that matter we never wanted the race to know where we keep it i understand your reasons for that odottoss said you will understand i hope our reasons for seeking this knowledge i suppose so anielewicz tried not to sound grudging but it wasnt easy very well then the lizard said if this bomb has been moved clandestinely you will also understand our concern about where it is now and to what use it may be put clandestinely moving the explosivemetal bomb wasnt easy mordechai wondered how well odottoss understood that the device weighed about ten tonnes the germans had just been learning how to make such bombs in theyd got better since but even that old primitive weapon would be devastating if it went off anielewicz wasnt sure it could detonate he also wasnt sure it couldnt he realized there were too many things about which he wasnt sure i shall do my best to find out what is going on here superior sir he said and then you will report to me odottoss asked i may not give you much detail mordechai said if i find nothing much has gone wrong but that the bomb was moved for security reasons during the fighting i would just as soon have its whereabouts stay secret from the race i understand odottoss replied i do not approve mind you but i understand arrangements in poland have been so irregular for so long one more irregularity probably will not hurt much but i would appreciate learning that the bomb is safe and is in responsible hands that is a bargain anielewicz said if i learn that i will tell you farewell after he hung up bertha asked what was that all about you speak the lizards language a lot better than i do once mordechai had explained she said you dont know where the bomb is either its not a good thing to lose i know mordechai started to reach for the phone then checked himself id better not call from here if the lizards know where i am i have to assume theyre tapping the line why make things easy for them he needed several days before he could get hold of yitzkhak one of the jews up in glowno whod had charge of the bomb on a line he reckoned secure they spent a couple of minutes congratulating each other on being alive then yitzkhak said i suppose youre calling about the package even on a secure line he didnt want to come right out and talk about an explosivemetal bomb mordechai didnt blame him yes as a matter of fact i am he answered somebodys worried that it might get delivered to the wrong address the posts gone to pot lately and everybody knows it well thats true actually im afraid it could happen yitzkhak was precise to the point of fussiness if he said he was afraid he meant it the people who took charge of it during the confusion are pretty careless and they may try to deliver it themselves oy that was about the worst news moishe could imagine who had got hold of the bomb during the fighting had some of david nussboyms nkvd henchmen spirited it off toward russia or would some jewish hotheads try to give the greater german reich one last kick while it was down mordechai phrased the question somewhat differently has it headed east or west west i think yitzkhak answered oy anielewicz repeated if a bomb went off in germany now would the nazis reckon themselves betrayed and try to retaliate did they have anything left with which they could retaliate he suspected they would and could with a sigh he said i suppose we have to try to get it back he paused dammit tao shengming came up to liu han and liu mei with his shaved head gleaming and with an impudent grin on his face i greet you superior female the devilboy said in the language of the little scaly devils give me an order whatsoever you may request it shall be done liu han stuck to chinese suppose i order you not to be so absurd but she shook her head no that would be foolish no good officer gives an order knowing it will be disobeyed tao bowed as if shed paid him a great compliment you give me too much credit he said still in the scaly devils tongue all i aim to be is the biggest nuisance possible do you mean to the little devils or to the peoples liberation army liu hans voice was dry why both of course tao shengming answered life would be boring if we all did exactly what we were supposed to all the time that is a truth liu mei said a little unpredictability is an asset she also used the little devils language as if to show solidarity with tao shengming liu han thought her daughters response entirely predictable liu mei was fond of the devilboy liu han wondered what if anything would come of that nothing at all would come of it if tao didnt pay more attention to what came out of his mouth before he opened it if you do not precisely obey the orders of your superiors you will find yourself purged as an unreliable she warned him that would be unfortunate i would certainly think so tao shengming said he had trouble taking anything seriously even the chinese communist party liu mei might have been fond of him but she was a dedicated revolutionary you must obey the dictates of the party tao she said seriously it is our only hope against the unbridled imperialism of the little scaly devils he drew himself up as if affronted i did not come to your roominghouse to argue politics he said i came to find out how things were going and what i could do to help them go do you think no one will tell you when the time comes liu han demanded do you think you will be left on the sidewalk standing around when the revolutionary struggle begins anew well no he admitted using chinese for the first time perhaps out of embarrassment but i am not a mahjongg tile to be played by somebody else i am my own person and i want to know what i am doing and why liu mei spoke to her mother he sounds more like an american than a proper chinese that held some truth liu han chose not to acknowledge it she said he sounds like a foolish young man who thinks he is more important than he is she didnt want to anger tao shengming too much so she tempered that by adding he is important to a degree though and he will i assure you he will learn what hes supposed to know when hes supposed to know it unabashed tao said but i want to know more and i want to know sooner i will tell you what you need to know not what you want to know liu han said what you need to know is soon we will rise against the little scaly devils when we do you and your fellow devilboys will help lure them to destruction they will trust you more than they would trust other human beings you will make them pay for their mistake yes tao shengming said and used an emphatic cough his eyes glowed with anticipation liu han anticipated that most of the devilboys assigned to mislead the little scaly devils would pay the price for their deception she said nothing about that if tao shengming didnt see it for himself he would perform better as a result of his ignorance when she thought about such tactics she sometimes knew brief shame but it was only brief because she remained convinced the struggle against the imperialist little devils was more important than any individuals fate i need to tell you one other thing tao said some of the scaly devils are beginning to suspect that something may be going on they are talking about making moves of some kind my fellow devilboys and i do not know as much about that as we would like because they quiet down around us they know a lot of us speak their language and they do not want us overhearing that is not good liu mei said no its not liu han agreed the knife has two edges the little devils trust the devilboys because they know the devilboys imitate their ways but they also know the devilboys understand what they say we need to send out more ordinary chinese who know their language and hope the scaly devils will be indiscreet around them you will know the people who can arrange that i hope you will know those people anyway tao shengming said ive tried to tell some people with higher rank than mine but they dont take me seriously after all im only a devilboy im funnylooking and i have strange ideas and if you dont believe me just ask anybody from the peoples liberation army he didnt try to hide his bitterness what he did do a moment later was swagger around like a pompous general who was round in the belly and empty in the head liu mei laughed and clapped her hands liu han laughed too she couldnt help herself she tried to put reproof in her voice as she said i am from the peoples liberation army tao and so are you she tried to put reproof in her voice yes but she heard herself failing were with the peoples liberation army yes but were not old men who havent had a new thought since the last emperor ruled china tao answered with the ready scorn of the young liu mei nodded emphatically why not she was young too liu han wasnt so young any more as her body and sometimes her spirit kept reminding her but she knew the kind of people tao shengming meant she hoped she wasnt one of those people im on the central committee she said i can make people listen to me she lowered her voice besides things will start to happen before very long taos face lit up that was the kind of news he wanted to hear liu han did have the rank to get taos message noted she hoped that would do the cause some good one thing it did was get the date for the start of the operation moved forward again that made liu mei clap her hands once more she wanted action liu han wanted action too but not at the cost of striking before the peoples liberation army was ready success was a longshot even if they struck when the peoples liberation army was ready everyone on the central committee understood that no one seemed willing to admit it not out loud when the second world war started in europe back in the dim dark days before the little scaly devils came the germans had staged a border incident to give themselves an excuse to go to war against poland the germans were fascists of course but mao admired the stratagem it turned the wehrmacht loose exactly when its leaders wanted it to move borrowing from the germans book mao arranged for an incident in the railroad yards in the southwestern part of peking liu han wasnt far away when she heard the first gunshots ring out after sudden provocation from the devilboys turned unbearable she spoke one word into a radio now then she shut it off and took herself elsewhere lest the little devils trace the transmission that one word was the signal for riots to break out around the railroad yards too in carefully chosen places as the planners in the peoples liberation army had been sure they would chinese policemen tools of the imperialist scaly devils came rushing from all over peking to quell those secondary riots and they rushed straight into withering machinegun fire those emplacements had been sited and manned for a couple of days and covered the likely routes of approach the chinese police reeled back in dismay watching from a thirdstory window liu han hugged herself with glee the scaly devils running dogs werent soldiers and couldnt hope to hold their own in a fight against soldiers now that theyd discovered they couldnt hope to put down the rioters what would they do call in the little devils themselves of course liu han thought and hugged herself again as usual the little scaly devils wasted no time in responding they were soldiers and formidable soldiers at that three of their mechanized fighting vehicles machines identical to the one in which liu han her daughter and nieh hoting had left the prison camp rattled past her guided toward the trouble and toward ruination by a couple of devilboys but they didnt rattle very far barricades had already started going up when the machines tried to bull them aside the obstacles proved to have surprisingly solid cores chinese rushed out from houses and storefronts to heave bottles of burning gasoline at the mechanized fighting vehicles liu han had never learned why those were called molotov cocktails but they were two of the vehicles quickly caught fire the third one sprayed death all around with its light cannon and with the scaly devils shooting from the firing ports set into the sides of the machine fighters fell one after another at last though the third vehicle started burning too and the little devils inside had to bail out or be roasted they lasted only moments outside their armored shell columns of smoke began rising into the sky all over peking liu han nodded in sober satisfaction as she watched them sprout now the little scaly devils would really know they had an insurrection on their hands what would they do next now that their mechanized fighting vehicles were having trouble send in the landcruisers of course liu han thought landcruisers were the bludgeon theyd used to retake peking after the last progressive uprising sure enough here came a pair of them with infantrymales skittering along beside them spraying gunfire to keep wouldbe flingers of molotov cocktails from getting close enough to harm them some of the little devils fighting on foot went down the rest stayed with the landcruisers they were brave liu han wished she could have denied them that virtue and many others but the landcruisers got a surprise not long after they rolled past the burntout hulks of the mechanized fighting vehicles and shouldered aside the barricades that had stalled the lesser machines spewing tails of fire antilandcruiser missiles manufactured by the reich slammed into their relatively thin side armor they brewed up flame belching from their turrets see how you like that liu han shouted the russians wouldnt give rockets they made themselves but they were willing to supply plenty of these and when a helicopter thuttered by overhead another missile swatted it out of the sky liu han whooped again if the little scaly devils thought they were going to keep china forever if they thought they could get away with ruling over a people who yearned to rule themselves some reeducation for them was in order the peoples liberation army would provide it i give you the option of declining this flight shuttlecraft pilot the female in the monitor told nesseref missiles have been fired at shuttlecraft attempting to land in the subregion known as china shuttlecraft have been damaged two i am sorry to report have been destroyed nesseref wondered how much truth that held if the dispatcher admitted two shuttlecraft destroyed how many more had gone down in flaming ruin nevertheless she said superior female i will accept the mission i have seen the aftermath of fighting here in poland we must maintain control of the areas of tosev where we presently rule i thank you for your display of public spirit the dispatcher said many from the colonization fleet in particular have seemed reluctant to accept any personal risk in maintaining our position on tosev i find that unfortunate nesseref said it lends truth to the disparaging comments certain males of the conquest fleet have been known to make about us colonists tosev is now our world too exactly so the other female made the affirmative gesture then turned one eye turret toward a monitor other than the one in which she was speaking with nesseref report to your shuttlecraft port at once the male you are transporting to china will be waiting there for you it shall be done nesseref said and broke the connection she didnt leave her apartment quite at once first she made sure orbit had enough food and water to last him till her expected return and for some little while after that too behave yourself while i am gone she told the tsiongi he yawned in lordly disdain as if to say she had no business telling him what to do she couldnt wait for the regularly scheduled transport to the shuttlecraft port that meant she had to hire a big ugly to drive her there in her experience tosevites in motorcars were more dangerous than members of the race in shuttlecraft but she survived the journey and gave her driver enough of the metal disks the locals used as currency to keep him happy one of the males in charge of maintaining shuttlecraft hurried up to her he pointed to the machine waiting on the concrete you are fully fueled and your oxygen supply is also full we have thoroughly checked the shuttlecraft i assure you everything is as it should be i thank you for your care as always nesseref would make her own checks before she let her fingerclaw press the launch control she asked is my passenger ready he had better be seeing how urgently i was sent here here he comes now the technician answered pointing with his tongue toward the blockhouse by the broad concrete expanse of the landing area and sure enough another male hurried up to the technician and nesseref i greet you superior sir nesseref told him for his body paint was a good deal more ornate than hers and i greet you shuttlecraft pilot he answered i am relhost i have considerable experience in fighting big uglies both in fullscale combat against organized forces and in battle against irregulars i am given to understand the situation in china combines elements of both combat modes all right superior sir nesseref didnt need to know anything about relhosts expertise she assumed he had it if not he wouldnt have been sent to china she started for the shuttlecraft relhost followed she climbed the mounting ladder and took her place in the pilots seat relhost strapped himself into the passengers seat with a familiarity that showed hed flown in a shuttlecraft a good many times before must we give the sssr notice that we will be flying over its territory relhost asked i am afraid so superior sir nesseref answered permission is routine but the big uglies are touchy about being informed of our flights and we are required to treat their independent notempires as if they were our equals i understand reihost said with a sigh but the sssr shares an ideology with the chinese big uglies the rebels will thus learn of our flight as soon as we launch if they do not already know of it they may well be waiting for us on our arrival nothing to be done about that superior sir nesseref said she radioed the blockhouse are we cleared for launch you are shuttlecraft pilot came the reply nesserefs eye turrets swiveled checking all the gauges one last time everything was as it should have been she would have been astonished were it otherwise but she did not want astonishment of that sort her fingerclaw stabbed at the launch control the motor roared to life beneath her acceleration shoved her back in her seat it was of course only a suborbital hop perhaps a quarter of the way around tosev after the motor cut off precisely on schedule they had a brief stretch of weightlessness before nesseref would have to begin preparations for landing relhost sighed now to see what new horrible tricks the big uglies have devised to drive us mad i commanded the attack on chicago over on the lesser continental mass back during the first winter of the fighting the conditions were terrible and the american big uglies struck hard at our flanks they threw us back it was then that we really knew what a desperate struggle we would have before we could make this world our own we still have not made it our own nesseref was perhaps less diplomatic than she might have been no we have not rethost agreed but whatever else we do we cannot allow a rebellious area to break away from our control that would be an open invitation to tosevites all over the planet to try to break away from us that is probably a truth nesseref corrected herself before her highranking passenger could correct her no that is certainly a truth a tosevite voice came from the radio receiver shuttlecraft of the race this is akmolinsk control your trajectory is acceptable you are warned not to maneuver over the territory of the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union or we shall be forced to respond vigorously to your aggression acknowledged akmolinsk control nesseref said and then turned off the transmitter with quite unnecessary violence to relhost she added i grow very tired of the arrogance the big uglies display as do we all shuttlecraft pilot the officer answered and they display less than they feel in akmolinsk our name is cursed as it is over much of the planet they truly do believe they are our equals as you said reeducating them will require generations like their preposterous superstitions their political ideologies have taken deep root among them sooner or later though we shall succeed may it be so nesseref said and now superior sir if you will excuse me she examined the plot of the actual trajectory as measured against the planned one and authorized the computer to make the small burns necessary to bring the one into conformity with the other we should be landing soon as if to confirm that a member of the race came on the radio shuttlecraft we have you on radar trajectory for the shuttlecraft port outside peking is acceptable how nice nesseref said acid in her voice the big uglies in the sssr told me exactly the same thing be glad they did answered the controller at the shuttlecraft port they can be most difficult even dangerous if your trajectory varies in any way from that which is planned you will no doubt know this for yourself but speaking of dangerous i will tell you something the big uglies in the sssr did not be extremely alert in your descent tosevite rebels are active in the area and are equipped with missiles homing on radar and on the heat emissions of your engine as you brake for landing and what do i do if they launch one of these missiles at me nesseref asked you do the best you can shuttlecraft pilot the controller answered in that case you discover how good a pilot you truly are and how well you have studied and practiced the manual overrides shuttlecraft computers are not programmed to operate on the assumption that something is trying to shoot them down here on tosev they should be nesseref said indignantly as may be shuttlecraft pilot the controller said perhaps they will be at some time in the future for the present good luck out relhost waggled an eye turret in an ironic way good luck shuttlecraft pilot i thank you so very much superior sir nesseref said her own eye turrets went to the manual controls of course shed put in endless simulator practice with them but how seriously had she taken it how well could she fly the shuttlecraft on her own and if something happened to her who would take care of orbit mordechai anielewicz perhaps no he had a beffel the two animals wouldnt get along nesseref hoped she wouldnt have to find out the answers to any of her questions but even as the computer activated the braking rocket for final descent into the shuttlecraft port she kept an anxious eye turret on the radar screen and so the controllers shout of alarm in the radio was not a warning only a distraction i can see it she snarled now shut up her fingerclaw stabbed the manual override control she didnt adjust the burn right away but eyed the radar and the displays around it for data on the missiles performance that was alarmingly good whatever she was going to do she didnt have long to do it relhost said i suggest shuttlecraft pilot that you do not waste time you shut up too nesseref hissed a moment later absently adding superior sir she would have only one chance she saw as much if she maneuvered too soon that cursed missile would follow and knock her down if she maneuvered too late she wouldnt get the chance to maneuver at all she checked her fuel gauge she would worry about that later too now now her fingerclaw hit the motor control giving her maximum thrust and in effect relaunching her the missile had only begun to pull up when it burst a little below the shuttlecraft shrapnel fragments pattered off her ship some of them didnt patter off some pierced it alarm lights came on nesseref gave control back to the computer she hoped she had enough fuel to brake again if she didnt the big uglies whod launched the missile would win even if they hadnt disabled her she also hoped with all her liver that they had no more missiles to launch shed been lucky once she thought shed been lucky she doubted she could manage it twice well done relhost said i hope so nesseref answered fuel alarms werent hissing at top volume so maybe she would be able to get down in one piece she went on you had better help suppress these rebels superior sir otherwise i will be very disappointed in you she granted herself the luxury of an emphatic cough when david goldfarb came into the office of the saskatchewan river widget works ltd he found hal walsh there before him that was nothing out of the ordinary he often thought walsh lived at the office the music blaring out of a skelkwankd sk player was a different matter it was a song by a quartet of shavenheaded young englishmen who called themselves perhaps from their appearance the beetles as far as david was concerned they made noise not music his boss most of a generation younger loved it so did a lot of people walshs age the beetles were in goldfarbs biased opinion much more popular than they had any business being walsh was singing along at the top of his lungs when goldfarb walked in since walsh couldnt carry a tune in a pail he didnt improve the music if that was what it was he did have the grace to stop and even to look a little shamefaced better yet at least from davids point of view he turned down the player good morning he said in the relative quiet thus obtained good morning goldfarb answered if walsh wanted to play beetles music at top volume goldfarb knew he couldnt do much about it except look for another job he didnt care to do that and his boss didnt usually go out of his way to make the office miserable for him i just wanted you to know im the happiest fellow in the world right now hal walsh said i asked jane to marry me last night and she said she would congratulations no wonder youre singing if thats what you want to call it david stuck out his hand walsh pumped it goldfarb went onthats wonderful news really terrific think so his boss said tacking on a lizard style emphatic cough and just think if you hadnt cut your finger i probably never would have met her lifes funny that way goldfarb agreed you never can tell how something that seems little will end up changing everything if youd missed a phone call you ended up getting or hadnt got out of your motorcar five minutes before a drunk smashed it to scrap metal i know walsh nodded vigorously it almost tempts you to wonder if bigger things work the same way what if the french had won on the plains of abraham or if the lizards hadnt come or any of a dozen more things that occur to me in the blink of an eye i hadnt thought about it like that david said the mere idea made him open his eyes very wide thinking about changes in your life was one thing you could see where if things had happened differently or if youd chosen differently what happened next went wouldnt have stayed the same either but trying to imagine the same phenomenon on a larger level trying to imagine the whole world changing because something had happened differently he shook his head too big an idea for me to get my brain around so early in the morning you should read more science fiction hal walsh said actually thats not the worst thing for somebody in our line of work to do anyhow it goes a long way toward helping people think lefthanded if you know what i mean the more adaptable your mind is the better the chance you have of coming up with something new and strange while youre working with lizard electronics i suppose theres something to that goldfarb admitted i used to read the american magazine called astounding back before the lizards came but it stopped getting across the atlantic then and i lost the habit they still print it walsh said you can find it in the magazine counter at any drugstore here that was an americanism david had taken a while to get used to because he was so accustomed to chemists the new word struck him as faintly sinister his boss went on the issues from back before the war would be worth a pretty penny if youve still got any of them not likely goldfarb answered where are the snows of yesteryear here in edmonton theyre liable to still be stacked up in the odd places waiting to get shoveled away walsh answered still though i do take your point the door opened in strolled jack devereaux he was never late but he never looked as if he hurried either hello all he said and went to get himself a cup of tea whats on the agenda for today cut and try david goldfarb said a lot of bad language when things dont go the way we want nothing too much out of the ordinary he noticed hal walsh taking a deep breath and with malice aforethought forestalled him oh and hals getting married like i said nothing important that won him the glare hed hoped he would get from his boss it also won him a raised eyebrow from devereaux really the other engineer asked hal walsh yes really walsh said still giving david a sour look i asked jane and she was rash enough to tell me she would that sounded as if he was doing some forestalling of his own well thats the best news ive heard this morning the frenchcanadian engineer said of course up till now i hadnt heard much in the way of news this morning so i dont know exactly what that proves thank you so much walsh said ill remember you in my nightmares still helpfully slanderous goldfarb said hes been blaming me and you too because i cut my finger on that sheet metal when i was giving you a hand if i hadnt done that he wouldnt have had to take me to the doctor and shed still be a happy woman today he supposed he would one of these days have to let moishe russie know reuvens former lady friend would be tying the knot he wondered how reuven would take that his second cousin once removed hadnt wanted to stay with dr jane archibald as far as david was concerned that meant very poor eyesight on his younger cousins part but he couldnt do anything about it he wondered if reuven had found anyone else after dr archibald left palestine maybe moishe would tell him meanwhile he had plenty of work here he and devereaux were still refining the design of that speedy new skelkwank gh disk player he had a side project of his own too one that was nothing but a few sketchy notes at the moment but that he hoped would prove important one of these days hal walsh knew he was working on something there but didnt yet know what it was walsh made a good boss he didnt insist on finding out every last detail of what was in his employees minds goldfarb hoped his notion would reward the younger mans confidence in him between the disk player and his own idea with time out for lunch and for odd bits of banter through the day his hours at the saskatchewan river widget works went by so fast he was startled when he realized he could go home he was also startled to see how dark it had got by the time he went outside and how chilly the breeze from the northwest was autumn was here winter wouldnt wait very lone and winter in edmonton hed already seen had more in common with siberia than with anything the british isles knew by that name naomi greeted him with a kiss when he got home youve got a letter here from london she said have i he said from whom i dont know his wife answered not a handwriting i recognize here see for yourself she handed him the envelope he didnt recognize the handwriting either though it had a tantalizing familiarity lets find out he said and tore open the envelope his voice had gone grim so had naomis face she had to be thinking the same thing he was wondering what basil roundbush had to say to him oh they both exclaimed at the same time naomi amplified that you havent heard from jerome jones for a while so i havent goldfarb agreed better him than some other people id just as soon not name much better his wife agreed wed still be in northern ireland if it werent for his help and i always thought he was rather a nice chap from what i remember of him during the first round of fighting did you david asked in a peculiar toneless way yes i did naomi stuck out her tongue at him not like that though she made as if to poke him in the ribs what does the letter say ive been waiting since the postman brought it curiosity killed the cat goldfarb said at which his wife did poke him in the ribs he threw his hands in the air give over i surrender here ill read it dear david he says i trust this finds you and your lovely wife and family well and flourishing no wonder i liked him naomi remarked yes he always did have a smooth line a lot of girls fell for it david said which got him a dirty look he held up the letter and went on i am doing as well as can be expected for one with such a dissolute past you may perhaps be interested to learn that a certain unfriend of yours has had his own unsavoury past or something of the sort catch up with him so it would appear at any rate he looked up from the page his wife made little pushing motions dont stop she said for gods sake go on i love it when you talk to me like that david said which made naomi give him a good push exactly what hed had in mind oh he went on the letter i thought you meant something else he glanced down at it where was i oh yes a certain often a very certain by all indications group captain roundbush is in hospital and not expected to pull through the brakes to his bentley having failed whilst he was negotiating a curve at a high turn of speed signs are that his brakes were encouraged to fail a highly professional job someone from scotland yard writes on a report that just chanced to cross my desk i wish i could say i was sorry naomi said at last so do i goldfarb agreed but i cant because im not theres a bit more here not everyone is altogether displeased at this development because his faction had close ties to the reich and the reich being more radioactive than not these days is no longer seen as our stalwart bulwark against the lizards what our stalwart bulwark against the lizards shall be now i have no idea but seeing roundbush hoisted by his own hookedcross petard doubtless pleases you more as ever jerome goldfarb kissed his wife and do you know what sweetheart hes right he kissed her again kassquit stooped slightly to look at herself in the mirror she made the affirmative gesture maybe the wild tosevites werent so daft to let their hair grow after all she liked the way it framed her face true it did make her look less like a female of the race but she worried less about that than she had before she started meeting wild big uglies she no longer saw any point to denying her biological heritage it was part of her no matter how much she still sometimes regretted that she looked down at herself she was also growing hair under her arms and at the joining of her legs that last patch still perplexed her in longago days had such little tufts of hair helped tosevites semiintelligent ancestors find one anothers reproductive organs animals both on home and here on tosev often used such displays maybe this was another one kassquit couldnt think of any other purpose the hair might serve the telephone hissed distracting her junior researcher kassquit speaking she said i greet you she sometimes startled callers who knew she was an expert on big uglies but were unaware she was of tosevite descent herself but this time the startlement went the other way the image that appeared in her monitor was that of a big ugly and not just any big ugly and i greet you superior female jonathan yeager said formally then he twisted his face into the tosevite expression of amiability and went on hello kassquit how are you it is good to see you again her own face showed little by the nature of things it couldnt show much considering how she felt that was probably just as well her voice however was another matter she made it as cold as she could what do you want i wanted to say hello he answered i wanted to say it face to face i fear i made you unhappy when i told you i was going to enter into a permanent mating arrangement to gef married we say in english with karen culpepper i arranged this call from the races consulate here in los angeles to apologize to you sudden hope leaped in her to apologize for entering into this arrangement with the tosevite female no jonathan yeager answered i am not sorry about that but i am sorry if i did make you unhappy i hope you will believe me when i say i did not intend to he paused then pointed at her from the screen you have let your hair grow since i was up in the starship with you yes kassquit made the affirmative gesture she forgot well almost forgot to be angry at him as she asked what do you think the opinions of members of the race about her appearance meant little to her they had no proper standards of comparison jonathan yeager on the other fork of the tongue did i like it he said now and used an emphatic cough hair does usually seem to add to the attractiveness of a female even though you were attractive before but not so attractive as to keep you from seeking a permanent mating arrangement with this other female kassquit could not and did not bother to hide her bitterness the american big ugly who had been her mating partner sighed i have known karen culpepper for many years we grew to maturity together we come from the same culture kassquit of course hadnt grown to maturity with anybody she had no idea what doing so would mean she suspected she was missing something because of that but she couldnt do anything about it for that matter she sometimes suspected that the way shed been raised left her missing all sorts of social and emotional development most big uglies took for granted but she couldnt do anything about that either she said would you have found it impossible to stay up here and spend all your time with me she hadnt asked him that while he was aboard the starship she hadnt known how much his leaving would hurt till hed gone and then it was too late i am afraid i would he answered would you have found it impossible to come down to tosev and spend all your time here i do not know she said how can i know i have never experienced the surface of tosev she sighed but i do understand the comparison you are making it could be that you are speaking a truth i thank you for that jonathan yeager said you were i think always honest with me and i did try to be honest with you maybe he had back then though she hadnt understood everything hed meant not down in her liver she hadnt did she now how could she be sure she couldnt and knew it but she understood more now than she had then she was sure of that with another sigh she said you will do as you will do and i shall do as i shall do that is all i can tell you right now it is a truth the american big ugly said nodding as his kind did to agree i wish you well kassquit please believe that and i wish you well she replied that was more true than otherwise the most she would say about it she took a deep breath have we anything more to say to each other i do not think so jonathan yeager said neither do i kassquit broke the connection jonathan yeagers image vanished from her monitor she sat staring at the screen waiting for a storm of tears to come they didnt not weeping seemed somehow worse than weeping would have after a moment she realized why she had finally accepted that jonathan yeager wouldnt be coming back have to go on she thought whatever i do it will have to be in that context if i seek another wild big ugly for sexual pleasure i shall have to respond to him not to my memories of jonathan yeager she wondered how she could do that she wondered if she could do it of course you can you have to you just figured that out for yourself have you already started to forget she probably had emotional issues arising from sexual matters were far more complex and far more intense than any shed known before jonathan yeager came into her life that she feared was also part of her biological heritage shed done her best to pretend that heritage didnt exist now she ran a hand across her hairy scalp she was beginning to accept it she wondered if that would result in any improvement all she could do was see what happened next what happened next was that the telephone hissed again junior researcher kassquit speaking she said again seating herself in front of the monitor i greet you and i greet you kassquit ttomalss said how are you today oh hello superior sir kassquit did a token job of assuming the position of respect no more was needed while she was sitting down ttomalss might have asked the question as a polite commonplace but she gave it serious consideration before answering all things considered i am pretty well i am glad to hear it ttomalss said i was listening to your conversation with jonathan yeager i think you handled it with an emotional maturity to which many wild big uglies could only hope to aspire i thank you kassquit said then once the words were out of her mouth she wasnt so sure she thanked him after all this time she spoke with considerable care superior sir i understand why you monitored my life so closely when i was a hatchling and an adolescent i was after all an experimental subject but have i not proved your experiment largely successful there are times when i think you have her mentor answered then again there are other times when i think i may have failed despite my best efforts when i see you imitating wild tosevites i do wonder whether environment plays any role at all in shaping an individuals personality i am a tosevite it cannot be helped kassquit said with a shrug i am having to come to terms with that myself but have we not established that i am also a citizen of the empire and able to provide important and useful services for the race in fact can i not provide some of those services precisely because i am at the same time a citizen of the empire and a big ugly she waited anxiously to hear how he would respond to that and felt like cheering when he made the affirmative gesture truth hatches from every word you speak he replied i cannot tell you how delighted i am to discover how seriously you take your obligations as a citizen of the empire of course i take them seriously kassquit said unlike a good many members of the race if i may speak from what i have seen i take them seriously because i do not take them for granted that is well said ttomalss told her he used an emphatic cough your words could be an example and an inspiration for many males and females of the race again superior sir i thank you kassquit said and i am also pleased to have the privileges that come with citizenship in the empire she waited once more ttomalss said and well you might be say what you will for the wild big uglies but you are part of an older larger wiser more sophisticated society than any of theirs i agree superior sir kassquit couldnt smile so that her face knew about it as a wild big ugly could but she was smiling inside and would you not agree superior sir that one of the privileges of citizenship is freedom from being arbitrarily spied upon ttomaiss opened his mouth closed it and then tried again you are not an ordinary citizen of the empire you know am i less than ordinary kassquit asked if i am how am i a citizen at all no you are not less than ordinary ttomaiss said before he could add anything to that kassquit pounced then why do you have the right to continue to listen to my conversations because you are different from an ordinary citizen of the empire ttomaiss answered you can hardly deny that difference i do not deny it she said but i do think the time is coming if it has not already come when it will not outweigh my need to be able to lead my life as i see fit not as you reckon best for me here you are trying to wound me again ttomalss said by no means kassquit used the negative gesture you are the male who raised me you have taught me most of what i know but i have hatched from the egg of immaturity now if i am a citizen if i am an adult i have the right to some life of my own but think of the data the race would lose ttomalss exclaimed in dismay am i important to you as an individual or because of the data you can gain from me even as kassquit asked the question she wondered if she wanted to hear the answer both ttomalss replied and she reflected that he could have said something considerably worse but even that wasnt good enough not any more superior sir she said unless we can reach an understanding i am going to take a citizens privilege and seek to gain my privacy or more of it through legal means and should i learn i am in truth more nearly experimental animal than citizen i shall have other choices to make is that not a truth she ended the conversation before ttomalss could tell her whether he thought it was a truth or not i think were in business glen johnson said by god i really do think were in business we got away with it clean as a whistle congratulations mickey flynn said youve just squeezed maximum mileage from a series of one case oh ye of little faith johnson said i have a great deal of faith faith in the capacity of things to go wrong at the worst possible moment flynn replied always remember oreilly insisted that murphy was an optimist he usually is johnson agreed usually but not always flynn shrugged if you think youre going to make me give way to unbridled optimism you can think again either that or you can put on a bridle and go horse around somewhere else with a snort more than a little horselike johnson said i wonder what will happen when the lizards do find out that depends mickey flynn said gravely thank you so much johnson tacked on not an emphatic cough but another snort and on what pray tell does it depend o sage of the age vocative case the other pilot said in something like wonder i havent heard a vocative case a real living breathing vocative case since i escaped my last latin class lo these many years ago johnson had never heard of the vocative case but he was damned if he would admit it flynn went on well it could depend on a lot of different things really i never would have guessed hush flynn brushed aside his sarcasm like an adult brushing off a fiveyearold he started ticking points off on his fingers first off it depends on how soon the race does figure out whats going on okay that makes sense johnson nodded if they work that out day after tomorrow they have a better chance of doing something about it than if they work it out year after next exactly flynn beamed you can see after all now johnson ignored him persisting in his own train of thought and things will be different depending on whether they find out on their own or if we have to rub their snouts in it this is also true flynn agreed if the latter they will probably be trying to rub our noses in things at the same time that creates the need for a lot of facewashing or else a mudbath i mean a bloodbath see for example the late not particularly lamented greater german reich johnson shivered though the temperature in the lewis and clark never changed he felt as if a goose had walked over his grave what happened to the hermann goring could have happened to us this past summer too the lizards made damn sure the nazis werent going to get themselves a toehold in the asteroid belt it didnt happen to us because it happened to indianapolis mickey flynn said thanksgiving is coming before long do we give thanks for that or not damned if i know johnson said but ill tell you something i heard dont know whether its true but ill pass it along anyhow speak flynn urged give forth ive heard glen johnson said in low conspiratorial tones ive heard that the christopher columbus has some turkeys in the deep freeze to cook up for a proper thanksgiving turkey his gaze went reverently heavenward which gave him nothing but a glimpse of the light fixtures and aluminum paneling on the ceiling of the lewis and clarks control room do you remember what it tastes like i think i do i think i do too but i wouldnt mind testing my hypothesis experimentally flynn raised an eyebrow at johnson if youd known youd spend the rest of your days eating beans and beets and barley you wouldnt have been so eager to stow away would you i didnt intend to stow away god damn it johnson said for about the five hundredth time all i wanted to do was get my upper stage repaired and go home and our beloved commandant hijacked me he stuck to his story like glue anyone would think hed had some reason to be concerned about security flynn said a preposterous notion on the face of it i wasnt going to tell anybody for christs sake that was also part of johnsons story and might even have been true brigadier general healey in his infinite wisdom thought otherwise flynn replied who am i a mere mortal to imagine that the commandant could ever be mistaken who are you one irishman to give another one a hard time johnson shot back shows what you know flynn said quarreling among ourselves is the irish national sport of course we have been known to put it by every now and again mind when a sassenach comes along he fixed johnson with a mild and speculative gaze then sighed and weve also been known not to put it by when a sassenach comes along if it werent for that i suspect the history of ireland would have been a good deal happier a good deal more irish too and less english johnson didnt know much about the history of ireland or for that matter the history of england he knew the history of the united states from the patriotic lessons drilled into him in high school and from reading in military history since he said the irish arent the only ones to quarrel among themselves my greatgrandfathers wore blue you listen to some of the folks here from texas or the carolinas and youll think the civil war ended week before last my greatgrandfathers wore blue too flynn said the army was the only place that would give them anything close to a fair shake in those days but over the past hundred years americas been a dull place every time weve fought its been against somebody else before johnson could answer that the intercom started blaring his name lieutenant colonel johnson lieutenant colonel glen johnson report to the commandants office immediately there you see he said unstrapping himself healeys been spying on us again he thought he was joking but he wasnt quite sure after swinging his way through the corridors of the lewis and clark and gliding past brigadier general healeys adjutant he caught himself on the chair across from the commandants desk saluted and said reporting as ordered sir yes healeys bulldog countenance seldom looked as if it approved of anything so far as johnson could remember the commandant had never looked as if he approved of him healey went on have you ever heard of an officer named sam yeager yes sir johnson answered hes the fellow who pretty much wrote the book on the lizards isnt he thats the man brigadier general healey nodded he leaned forward and glowered at johnson did you ever meet him no sir johnson answered whats this about if you dont mind my asking his own bump of curiosity itched hed never met yeager no but hed spoken with him on the phone yeager was another loose cannon a man with a yen to know johnson had sometimes wondered if the lizard expert had tried finding out whod attacked the ships of the colonization fleet he said zero zip zilch about that to healey that man is a troublemaker the commandant said youre a troublemaker too birds of a feather if you know what i mean sir thats not birds of a feather johnson said thats a wildgoose chase is it healey said i wonder what would you have done lieutenant colonel if youd found out that we were the ones whod attacked the lizards colonization fleet i cant tell you sir because i really dont know johnson replied thats the wrong answer brigadier general healey growled spearing him with the perpetually angry gaze the right answer is sir i wouldnt have said a goddamn thing not till hell froze over what if id found out the russians or the germans did it sir johnson asked wouldnt i sing out then thats different the commandant said before johnson could ask how it was different healey spelled it out thats them this is us whoever spilled the beans to the race has got indianapolis blood on his hands and president warrens blood too if i knew who it was hed been out in weightlessness a long time he could probably never go back to gravity again if he could he would without a doubt be permanently weakened somehow none of that seemed to matter much if he caught the beanspiller he would do horrible things to him sir johnson said slowly are you telling me you think this yeager was the one who told the lizards wed done it that fit in with his own speculations unpleasantly well and healey had access to a lot more secret information than he did i dont know the commandant answered his voice a furious frustrated rumble i just dont know goddammit nobody knows or if anybody does hes not talking but plenty of people want to find out you can bet your bottom dollar on that yeagers a loose cannon i know that for a fact he was trying to find out about this place for instance i know that for a fact too was he johnson knew damn well yeager was or had been he wondered if lieutenant general curtis lemay had raked yeager over the coals too he could hardly ask but he thought he got his answer anyhow for brigadier general healey went on whoever ran off at the mouth he didnt just cost the presidents neck either a lot of good officers are sitting on the sidelines now they might have known this or that and they kept quiet the way they were supposed to and what kind of thanks did they get for it ill tell you what healey said savagely they got the bums rush thats what it isnt right yes sir johnson said and then greatly daring sir did you know anything about what was going on brigadier general healeys face was a closed door you are dismissed lieutenant colonel he said and bent to the papers secured to his desk by rubber bands after saluting johnson pushed off from the chair and glided out of the commandants office he was thinking hard healey had done his best to put him together with sam yeager and to get him to say he thought yeager was the one whod let the lizards know the usa had attacked their starships johnson shook his head ill be damned if ill say that he muttered he wouldnt have said it even if he thought it true not without certain proof he wouldnt he knew one thing though he wouldnt have wanted to be in sam yeagers shoes not for all the tea in china sam yeager brushed his wifes lips with his own and headed for the door see you tonight hon he said dont know why they want me downtown today but they do have fun with mickey and donald barbara rolled her eyes i expect i will they dont pay so much attention to me as they do to you im bigger sam said that probably counts for something ive got a deeper voice too that would count for something with people im not sure how much it matters to the lizards maybe we ought to try to find out dont you think we ought to treat them as kids first and guinea pigs second barbara asked part of me does yeager admitted the other parts the one thats seen kassquit it doesnt matter whether we say were treating them as kids or as guinea pigs theyll end up guinea pigs they cant help it we dont know enough to raise them the way the race would im not sure the lizards really raise them at all when theyre this young his wife said they just try to keep them from eating one another you may be right sam said whether you are or not though ive still got to go downtown i know his wife answered be careful i will i always am sam patted the on his hip its part of my uniform and i wear it there arent all that many people who know about what went on and are dangerous at least i hope there arent but im not taking any chances any which way before barbara could answer he closed the door and went out to the car driving into the middle of los angeles during the morning rush hour reminded him of why he didnt like to do it very often fighting his way to a parking space once he got off the freeway hammered the lesson home and crowding into an elevator to go up to the offices where he worked when he couldnt stay at home added a final unwelcome exclamation point just being here was enough to give him the willies this was where lieutenant general lemay had chewed him out for getting too curious about the space station that became the lewis and clark had lemay known what all else he was curious about the lieutenant general would have chewed him out a lot harder sam grimaced and walked a little straighter he was still here while curtis lemay didnt work for the us army any more there was a small cadre of highranking officers formerly highranking officers who didnt work for the us army any more none of them had ever said a word in the papers about why they didnt work for the army any more yeager suspected something truly drastic would happen to them if they did try to go to the papers he wondered if harold stassen had succeeded in rooting out everybody involved in the attack on the colonization fleet he supposed it was possible but had his doubts nonetheless stassen had probably done just enough to keep the lizards from screaming too loud and not a lot more good morning yeager said colonel edwin webster sams superior good morning sir sam saluted he cast a longing glance toward the coffee pot but asked whats up duty came first webster saw the glance pour yourself some joe if you want it yeager he said worlds not going to end because you take the time to drink a cup thanks yeager grabbed one of the plasticfoam cups that were steadily ousting waxed cardboard he adulterated the coffee with cream and sugar then came back to colonel webster after blowing on the coffee and taking a sip he said ready when you are sir come on into my office webster told him and yeager dutifully followed him back there his superior went on weve had a devil of a lot more reports of animals and plants from home in the southwest and south the past couple of months i know thats what you were working on when you went on detached duty there this summer so it seemed logical to call you in to have a look at them detached duty yeager echoed in a hollow voice yeah he eyed colonel webster hed been detached from his duty all right detached from it by a couple of fellows speaking in the name of the government of the united states and carrying pistols to back their play hed gone to desert center after that he might have fallen off the edge of the world detached duty was a cover story that could fit almost anything did webster know more than he was letting on if he did sam couldnt see it on his face you start looking for people who know more than theyre letting on and youll start hearing voices pretty soon he thought theyll come after you with a net and put you in a rubber room of course if you dont worry at all about what happens to you youre liable to disappear again and this time odds are you wont come back something you wanted to say about your duty webster asked uh no sir sam answered i was just thinking i was glad to get back to california okay his superior said crisply come on ive got the reports waiting for you this is a real problem maybe youll be able to figure out what to do about it if you can thatll put you a long jump ahead of everybody else im not sure theres anything we can do about it sir yeager said at least if you mean in terms of stopping these beasts we may have to see if we can make them useful to us instead sometimes god gives you lemons if he does youd better learn to like lemonade could be webster didnt sound convinced so far nobody has any idea how to do even that much well azwaca and zisuili can be pretty tasty sam said the lizards eat em no reason we couldnt theyre ugly as sin colonel webster observed so are pigs sir yeager answered i grew up on a farm nobody who ever took care of livestock thinks its beautiful and the people who dont take care of it dont usually give a damn what it looks like all theyll see is the meat in the butcher case not the animals it came from old mcdonald had a farm eeieeioh webster sang in a surprisingly melodious baritone and on that farm he had some azwaca eeieeioh with a hisshiss here and a hisshiss there sam stared at the bird colonel as if hed never seen him before in his life you okay sir he asked quizzically how the devil should i know webster answered do the kind of work we do and theres something wrong with you if you dont start going a little squirrelly after a while or are you going to tell me im wrong i wouldnt think of it yeager said you want to point me at those reports now i sure will colonel webster said for the time being what i want you to do is flip through em fast cover as much ground as you can in the next couple of hours then come back to my office and well talk some more okay i can do that sam said he didnt have an office here though by his rank he would have been entitled to one what he had was a sheetmetal desk in one corner of a room filled mostly by clerks and typists it wasnt even exclusively his he shared it with a couple of other itinerant officers and his key opened only two drawers for obvious reasons hed never put anything he worried about anyone else seeing inside that meager space there you go colonel webster pointed to the pile of papers in the plywood in basket at the back right corner of the desk skim those and head back to me at oh half past ten go ahead and set aside any you think youll need to look at more later on but im going to want a broad overview from you then right yeager saluted then sat down in the swivel chair behind the desk webster headed back to his office sam got to work he nodded to himself as he grabbed the report on top of the stack at least his boss knew exactly what he wanted sam hated few things more than vague orders he hadnt had much to do with the spread of plants and animals from home since getting kidnapped from desert center now every report he read made his eyebrows rise higher zisuili were eating the desert bare in arizona plants from home had been spotted outside amarillo texas barren places throughout the southwest were getting more barren these creatures are worse than goats somebody had written that made sam purse his lips and blow out an almost silent whistle he knew how bad goats were nobody whod ever kept them could doubt that imagining beasts more destructive than they were wasnt easy but the photos accompanying some of the reports at least raised the possibility that that writer knew what he was talking about and then there were the befflem theyd got farther from the mexican border and raised more kinds of hell than all the races meat animals put together they killed cats they killed some dogs too they raided henhouses they stole from garbage cans they bit people they ran very fast for creatures with such stumpy legs and their armored carcasses made them tough to harm what will be interesting sam said when he returned to colonel websters office will be seeing how all these animals and the plants that are spreading too come through the winter my guess is that cold weather will limit the northern range for most of them but its only a guess there will be places where they can thrive yearround though webster said this is one of them he tapped his desk as if expecting a herd of ssefenji to come trampling across it yes sir i think so sam agreed unless im wrong well have to learn to live with them as best we can what do we do if their plants start crowding out our crops webster asked sir i havent got any good answers for that yeager said i dont think anyone else does either maybe the pesticide people will come up with something that kills plants from home but leaves our stuff alone something like thats liable to be our best chance colonel webster eyed him with more than a little respect i happen to know that thats being worked on right now i dont know when results will come or even if theyll come but it is being worked on stands to reason sam said but do you know what i think the real trouble spot could be he waited for webster to shake his head then went on befflem theyre liable to be as much of a nuisance as rats and wild cats put together and they dont seem to have any natural enemies here cold weather like you said webster suggested sam shrugged maybe but ive looked at a couple of reports there that talk about finding them in dens with nests so maybe cold wont bother them as much as it would some other beasts from home webster scrawled a note im glad i called you in yeager i dont think anybody else has mentioned that he paused scratching his head the lizards keep befflem for pets dont they maybe we could do the same we keep cats for pets too or they keep us for pets one yeager answered that doesnt mean they arent a nuisance plenty of places he managed a lopsided grin of course as far as the lizards are concerned were nothing but nuisances ourselves so i dont think well get much sympathy from them too goddamn bad webster said sams grin got wider he nodded no johannes drucker shook his head i dont think we can go back to greifswald theres a goodsized lizard garrison there and that male called gorppet knows me much too well wed be under a microscope if we tried too bad both of his sons and his daughter spoke at the same time but his wife nodded id just as soon stay here in neu strelitz or else go someplace where nobody has any idea at all who we are and start over there too many people back in greifswald know why they took me away for a while drucker watched his older son that heinrich had joined the band of holdouts in stargard had probably saved druckers own neck the major who commanded them had changed his mind about shooting him but those holdouts were at least as fanatical about party ideology as any men if they ever found out heinrich druckers mother was or might have been a quarter jewish very visibly heinrich figured that out for himself he walked over and put a hand on his mothers shoulder all right he said well go somewhere its safe for you letting out a small silent sigh of relief didnt show and sigh drucker did the nazis made heroes of children who turned in their parents he hadnt thought heinrich would fall for such nonsense but you couldnt be sure till things actually started happening claudia turned to him and asked father if you cant fly into space any more what will you do for a living that was a good question it was in fact the good question drucker wished he had a better answer for it as things were he said i dont know something will turn up something always does if youre willing to work i can be a mechanic i suppose i can make an engine sit up and do as its told a mechanic claudia didnt sound very happy at that the social difference between a wehrmacht officers daughter and a mechanics could be measured only in lightyears honest work is honest work drucker insisted and mechanics make pretty good money claudia looked anything but convinced before he could say anything else somebody knocked on the front door to kathes uncle lothars house the druckers crowded it to the bursting point but lothar a widower didnt seem to mind he was kathes fathers brother and didnt let on that he knew anything about the possibility of jewish blood on the other side of her family tree nobody talked about that where uncle lothar could overhear better safe than sorry summed up everyones attitude he came into the back bedroom now with a frown on his face a big rawboned man in his sixties still physically strong but like so many others badly at sea in this new diminished reich nodding to drucker he said hans theres a soldier out front wants to speak to you a soldier suspicion roughened druckers voice what kind of soldier wehrmacht or waffenss he wasnt at all sure he wanted to meet an ss man without an assault rifle in his hands but kathes uncle answered a wehrmacht lieutenant just barely old enough to shave ill see him drucker said with a sigh i wonder what hell make of me he wore one of lothars old shirts which was too big on him and denim trousers that had seen better days he hadnt shaved this morning sure as the devil that wetbehindtheears lieutenant didnt look as if he believed his eyes you are colonel johannes drucker he seemed to have to remind himself to come to attention and salute drucker returned the salute though he wasnt at all sure he remained in the wehrmacht himself thats right sonny he answered no doubt further scandalizing the lieutenant what can i do for you today visibly holding in his anger the young officer spoke with exquisite politeness sir i am ordered to bring you to a secure telephone line and connect you to the fuhrerm flensburg every line of his body screamed that he hadnt the faintest idea why walter dornberger would want to speak with such a derelict a secure phone line drucker said and the lieutenant nodded secure from the lizards he persisted and the kid nodded again drucker hadnt known such lines survived anywhere in the reich let alone in sleepy neu strelitz maybe he wouldnt have to be a mechanic after all ill come hed expected to be taken either to the telephone exchange or to the burgomeisters hall instead the lieutenant led him to a fire station where men playing draughts looked up without much curiosity as he walked by the secure telephone looked like an ordinary instrument but another wehrmacht officer was in charge of it he gave drucker a fishy stare too when the lieutenant confirmed druckers identity the other officer made the call it took a couple of minutes to go through when it did the officer thrust the handset at drucker and said go ahead johannes drucker speakingdrucker said feeling like an idiot hello hans good to hear from you that was walter dornbergers voice all right hello sir as soon as drucker spoke he knew he should have called dornberger mern fiihrer now that the former commander at peenemunde had the job how seriously did he take it would he be offended if he didnt get the respect he thought he deserved drucker plowed ahead trying to hide his gaffe what can i do for you i thought i was retired nobody whos still breathing is retired dornberger answered if youre breathing you can still serve the reich thats why i was so glad to hear youd turned up in neu strelitz i can use you by god how drucker asked in real confusion the lizards wont let us get back into space unless he paused then shook his head with radar watching every square centimeter of the reich clandestine launches were impossible werent they hoping he was wrong he waited for the new fiihrers reply thats true they wont dornberger said which nipped his hope before it was truly born the fiihrerwent on but that doesnt mean i dont need you closer to home im going to order you here to flensburg hans youve got no idea what a small cadre i have of men i can really trust sir druckers voice trailed away dornberger had him by the short hairs and he knew it of course the reichs new leader could trust him dornberger knew why the gestapo had seized kathe if drucker gave him any trouble the blackshirts could always grab her again ill have a car there for you for all of you in a couple of days dornberger said he didnt mention the sword hed hung over druckers head why would he smoother not to smoother by far the fiihrer continued youll be doing important work here dont kid yourself for a moment about that and youll have the rank to go with it too major general sounds about right at least for starters major general now druckers voice was a disbelieving squeak the young lieutenant whod brought him to the fire station stared at him he didnt look as if he believed it either but walter dornberger repeated for starters well see how you shape in the job when you get here i hope to see you soon and your whole family he hung up the line went dead sir the lieutenant spoke with considerably more respect than hed given drucker up till then sir shall i escort you back to your house no never mind drucker walked back to his wifes uncles in something of a daze he didnt know what hed thought dornberger would have to say to him whatever it was it didnt come close to matching the real conversation when he went into the house the children kathe and her uncle lothar all pounced on him the children exclaimed in pride and delight when he gave them the news lothar slapped him on the back kathe congratulated him too but he saw the worry in her eyes she knew the grip dornberger had on him through her he shrugged he couldnt do anything about it but hope things would work out all right he wished he could think of something else but what else was there the motorcar that came for them was an immense mercedes limousine people up and down the street stared as they piled into it drucker hoped it wouldnt tempt some ambitious band of holdouts into trying a hijacking it purred away from neu strelitz in almost ghostly silence a few hours later they were in flensburg in schleswigholstein hard by the danish border its like another world kathe breathed as the motorcar pulled to a stop in front of the flensborghus the hotel where the reich was putting them up till they found permanent lodgings and so it was a world that hadnt seen war in the reich that made it almost unique it was the main reason walter dornberger had chosen the town at the west end of the flensburger forde an arm of the baltic projecting into the neck of land that led up to denmark some of the people at the hotel spoke more danish than german the monogram of frederick iv of denmark stood above the gate hed built the flensborghus as an orphanage in a major generals uniform waited in the room to which the bellboy led drucker he put it on with a growing feeling of unreality after hed adjusted the highpeaked cap to the proper jaunty angle heinrichs arm shot out in salute you look very handsome kathe said loyally if her heart wasnt in the words how could he blame her the next morning a lieutenant who might have been brother to the one back in neu strelitz took him to the fiihrer walter dornberger was working out of another hotel not far from the downtown maritime museum a servant brought drucker pickled herring and lager beer after hed eaten and drunk he asked what will you have me doing sir weve got to rebuild dornberger said we have to conceal as much as we can from the lizards and we have to take full control of the country put down the outlaw bands or at least bring them under government control until weve done all those things were hideously vulnerable im going to put you to work at concealment the more weapons we can keep from turning over to the lizards the better what have we got left drucker asked explosivemetal bombs poison gas dornberger just smiled and said nothing drucker found another question what do i do if the lizards find some of it give it up of course walter dornberger answered we cant afford to do anything else not yet we cant one of these days though if the lizards are patient we have to be patient too drucker said just so dornberger beamed at him you will do very well here i think by god maybe i will drucker thought well well gorppet looked up from a listing of new appointments by the deutsch government this may be interesting what have you found hozzanet asked remember that male named johannes drucker with whom i had some dealings because he was associated with anielewicz gorppet waited for his superior to make the affirmative gesture then went on he has turned up in flensburg with a promotion of two grades that is interesting hozzanet agreed what is he doing there to earn such a sudden sharp advance his title translated is commandant of recovery services gorppet replied after checking the monitor that is so vague it could mean anything i always mistrust vague titles hozzanet said they usually mean the big uglies are trying to hide something we already know the deutsche are trying to hide as much as they can from us gorppet said really i never would have noticed hozzanet said the race didnt have an ironic cough to set beside the emphatic and the interrogative had it possessed such a cough hozzanet would have used one then here however we are in an unusual position because this drucker speaks our language fairly well and has interacted with us in ways that are not hostile gorppet persisted we have some hope of getting him to see reason and cooperate with us really hozzanet repeated still sounding anything but convinced is this drucker not the male who refused to tell you anything whatsoever about how the male who drove him to ah neu strelitz ended up dead something less than halfway there well yes gorppet said but that was an individual matter this one pertains to the survival of his notempire if he sees he will endanger the reich by refusing to cooperate i think he will tell us at least some of what we need to know my opinion is that you are far too optimistic if not utterly addled hozzanet said but i can see you do not intend to listen to me go ahead then call this drucker i will warn you of one thing though accept none of his denials without proof distrust them even with thorough proof you may believe otherwise if you like superior sir but i really must assure you that i did not hatch from my eggshell yesterday gorppet said stiffly i do know that big uglies will lie whenever it suits their interest to do so and sometimes i think just for the sport of it and his voice trailed off he didnt go on with whatever hed been on the point of saying whatever it was in fact he forgot all about it he started to laugh instead and what is so funny hozzanet asked give me something to make me laugh too if you would be so kind i could use a good laugh by the emperor he cast down his eye turrets so did gorppet who then answered it shall be done superior sir it just occurred to me i believe i have the proper tool for persuading this particular tosevite to listen to me and to do my bidding or some of it tell me hozzanet urged such a claim is usually all the better for proof i do not think this likely to prove an exception to the rule i agree superior sir gorppet said consider though when we first met drucker in whose company was he in whose friendly company was he why that of mordechai anielewicz he pronounced the tosevite name with care and who is mordechai anielewicz a leader of the members of the jewish superstition in the subregion called poland the ideology of druckers superiors requires permanent hatred for members of the jewish superstition if those superiors were to learn from us that he had violated their fundamental rule he waited for hozzanets judgment if hed missed something obvious the other male would take sardonic pleasure in letting him know about it but hozzanet bent into the posture of respect a very sizable compliment when from superior to inferior that is good that is quite good he said and added an emphatic cough by all means make your telephone call we may realize considerable profit from it blackmail is liable to prove more effective than friendship this is tosev after all i thank you superior sir gorppet said he had no trouble telephoning flensburg the race often needed to do so to tell deutsch officials what to do even though he spoke none of the local big uglies language he was quickly connected to johannes drucker plenty of deutsche especially those involved with communication could use the language of the race the line was voiceonly but he didnt mind that he was not good at interpreting tosevite facial expressions i greet you superior sir drucker said once the connection went through how may i help you he doubtless meant how may i hinder you big uglies were not immune to polite hypocrisy gorppet said i congratulate you on your promotion and i believe i should also congratulate you on recovering your mate and hatchlings is that not a truth yes that is a truth the tosevite replied no harm in admitting it now i hope they are all well gorppet said yes drucker said again i thank you for asking i suppose you want them to stay well gorppet said you must after searching so long and hard to find them this time drucker paused before answering gorppet had not thought him a fool when he did speak again what he said was i do not care for the way this conversation is going what is your point my point is that i hope i will not have to tell anyone about your recent friendship with mordechai anielewicz gorppet replied i believe that would be unfortunate for all concerned do you not agree silence stretched a good deal longer now at last drucker said in the language of the race i cannot call you all the vile names i am thinking in my own language i wish i could what do you want from me in exchange for your silence he caught on quickly all right gorppet said is it not a truth that your government seeks to conceal weapons that should have been surrendered to the race i have no idea what you are talking about the big ugly said no that will probably mean i shall have to make some other telephone calls gorppet said drucker spoke in his own language gorppet didnt understand a word but it sounded impassioned then drucker returned to the language of the race you will want me to betray my own notempire that is very hard for me to do the choice is yours gorppet said another long silence you will hear from me from time to time drucker said breaking it you will not hear from me very often or i would give myself away i understand gorppet said i think we may have a bargain do not forget your obligation or the bargain will come undone i warn you now i do not intend to warn you again i understand drucker said and broke the connection with what struck gorppet as altogether unnecessary violence but that was neither here nor there turning to hozzanet gorppet said i believe he is recruited the true test of course will be in what he reveals if he fails us he shrugged if he fails us he will pay the price he will deserve it too hozzanet said before gorppet could reply his telephone hissed it was another voiceonly connection with a tosevite on the other end i greet you the big ugly said mordechai anielewicz speaking here and i greet you gorppet said in some surprise i was just talking about you as a matter of fact how may i help you you need to know something has gone missing the jewish leader answered do i gorppet thought for a moment in that case i probably also need to know what has gone missing is that not a truth yes anielewicz said that is a truth he used an emphatic cough when the big ugly didnt say anything more gorppet realized he would have to prompt him he did will you tell me what has gone missing or did you put this telephone call through to tantalize me mordechai anielewicz sighed a sound much like that a male of the race might have made i will tell you you will have heard i suppose that the jews of poland possess an explosivemetal bomb captured from the deutsche years ago at the end of the first round of fighting i have heard this yes gorppet replied i do not know whether it is a truth or not but i have heard it his tailstump lashed in sudden alarm wait are you telling me i am telling you that we do indeed possess this bomb anielewicz said or rather i am telling you that we did possess it at the moment we do not by we here i mean the organized group of jewish fighters who have held it for all these years gorppets head started to ache do you mean to say than an explosivemetal bomb has been stolen that got hozzanets complete and horrified attention if you do not have it who does that seemed a good question with which to start there is no sign of violence in the place where it was kept the tosevite replied this leads me to believe some of my fellow jews have taken it and not poles or russians or deutsche i see gorppet said and what would jewish hijackers be likely to do with an explosivemetal bomb he answered that for himself they would be likely to bring it here into the reich and try to use it against the deutsche against whom they have strong motivation for seeking vengeance that is also my belief mordechai anielewicz said if the deutsche still have any explosivemetal weapons of their own hidden away they might be provoked into using them against you and against us in poland if such a bomb destroyed one of their cities without warning so they might gorppet said unhappily i am sorry for the inconvenience the big ugly said i do not know for a fact that the bomb can still burst but i do not know for a fact that it cannot either we have tried to maintain it over the years it is large and heavy in my measure it weighs about ten tonnes he translated that into the races units gorppet thought he must have made a mistake are you sure he asked that seems an impossibly large weight but anielewicz answered yes i am sure tosevite technology with these weapons was primitive in those days we have improved since that is our way you will recall yes i do recall gorppet said tonelessly a hopeful thought occurred to him you tosevites have many different languages would jews in the reich give themselves away by how they speak no anielewicz said i am sorry but no yiddish our tongue is close to the deutsch language as is and many jews are fluent in that language itself splendid gorppet turned an eye turret toward hozzanet by the spirits of emperors past superior sir what do we do now they let someone wander off with an explosivemetal bomb atvar spoke in tones of extravagant disbelief extravagant disbelief was exactly what he felt even for big uglies that struck him as excessive they do not know who they do not know when they do not know where they do not know how it must have happened during the fighting in poland exalted fleetlord pshing replied things were chaotic then you must admit whose side are you on atvar snarled i would not mind so much if another deutsch city vanished from the map but i fear the deutsch big uglies could still retaliate against us no matter what they claim i find it unlikely that they have surrendered all of their explosivemetal weapons another round of fighting would leave the deutsche extinct his adjutant remarked i wish they were extinct now atvar said but they have been damaged enough not to be dangerous at the moment and the one set of reasonably reliable tosevite allies we have had the jews of poland have turned on us they did not mean to do so pshing said i do not care what they meant to do the fleetlord was in a perfect fury of temper they are letting their own private trivial feuds influence the policy of the race that is intolerable intolerable do you hear me pshing yes exalted fleetlord pshing answered but what will you do what can we do that was a different sort of question it painfully reminded the fleetlord that the intolerable was all too often commonplace on tosev and that the races policies here had to pay far more notice to the big uglies whims and superstitions than anyone would have imagined possible before the conquest fleet set out from home we have to try to get the bomb back atvar answered that much is obvious but if we fail there we also have to convince the deutsche that we did not detonate it that will be difficult his adjutant said it also may not help much the deutsche dislike the jews as much as the jews dislike them both those points unfortunately are truths atvar said and the notemperor of the deutsche is sure to blame us for anything the jews do the big ugly named dornberger would have reason to do so too but the fleetlord chose not to dwell on that will you warn the deutsche this bomb may be on their territory pshing asked i gather from the reports that the weapon is anything but inconspicuous until we have more definite information i believe i will keep quiet the fleetlord answered one more truth is that i would not be altogether dismayed to see the deutsche punished further so long as they fail to avenge themselves on us it is not as if they fail to deserve it the variable being whether we can escape their vengeance in the aftermath pshing said yes the variable atvar agreed that was a nice bloodless way to ponder whether thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of members of the race might become radioactive dust on account of the reckless actions of a handful of headstrong big uglies he sighed no male since the unification of the empire had had worries even remotely like his he skimmed the report again the occupiers were doing what they could in secret to help the jews find their missing bomb how much was that how secret was it the report didnt say the fleetlord took that as a bad sign and then the telephone hissed if that is fleetlord reffet tell him i just jumped out the window atvar said to pshing tell him i have joined the muslim superstition and am at prayer so i cannot be disturbed tell him anything i do not wish to talk to him now it shall be done exalted fleetlord pshing said and went off to do it atvar was one of the few members of the race prominent enough to have another individual to block nuisances from him most males and females had to make do with electronics he let out a selfsatisfied hiss enjoying the privilege but it turned out not to be the fleetlord of the colonization fleet pshings image appeared on atvars monitor exalted fleetlord it is senior science officer tsalas atvars adjutant said he maintains that the matter about which he would speak to you is of some urgency shall i put him through yes by all means atvar replied tsalas is not one to start laying eggs out of mating season he winced after speaking that slang expression for getting excited over nothing was perfectly good back on home but how much meaning would it have here on tosev in a few generations if he couldnt suppress the ginger trade pshing vanished from the screen to be replaced by an elderly studiouslooking male i greet you exalted fleetlord tsalas said and i greet you senior science officer atvar replied my adjutant tells me something urgent has come up what is it he wondered if he really wanted to know urgent matters on tosev spelled trouble more often than not but tsalas made the affirmative gesture atvar braced himself for the worst it didnt come at least not right away the science officer said you will have been advised of the large meteoric impact on tosev not long ago oh yes atvar used the affirmative gesture too this solar system by everything i have been able to gather is much more untidy than that of home it seems a fitting place to have hatched the big uglies tsalas laughed that no doubt holds a good deal of truth exalted fleetlord but there are data to suggest that this impact was not altogether the result of chance i do not understand atvar said what else could it have been none of our probes out in the belt of minor planets between tosev and tosev noticed anything out of the ordinary among the american big uglies working there the science officer said but a new probe traveling toward that belt had its forward camera operating and caught this his face vanished to be replaced by a view of space and stars off to the right of the screen a new star not very bright suddenly came to life after atvar watched it for a little while he saw that it was moving against the stars in the background that is a rocket motor he exclaimed the display winked out tsalas reappeared truth exalted fleetlord he said that is a rocket motor and one of considerable power or the probe would not have noticed it at such a long distance i sped up the video for you to help you grasp its nature more quickly but what motor is it the fleetlord asked it cannot belong to either of the two american spaceships now in the belt of minor planets or the probes already there would have seen this burn what are the big uglies doing i am not certain tsalas replied no one is certain no one not an american tosevite at any rate but it seems likely that the motor accelerated a goodsized chunk of rock from its normal orbit among the minor planets and toward the more inward regions of this solar system it seems likely in fact that our outbound probe happened to catch the launch of this chunk of rock toward its eventual collision with tosev but tosev is an utterly worthless world atvar said why would anyone even big uglies be so addled as to bombard it with meteors perhaps tsalas said gently to give them practice in hitting other more inherently valuable targets that needed a moment to sink in when it did atvar let out a hiss of unadulterated horror you are telling me that they could bombard us here on tosev from out in the belt of minor planets he said i believe so yes exalted fleetlord tsalas sounded no happier than atvar felt i apologize for not bringing this to your notice sooner connecting several apparently unrelated pieces of data took longer than it should have on the other fork of the tongue perhaps we should count ourselves lucky that the connection was made at all the american tosevites plainly intended to keep it secret from us yes plainly atvar said and we shall have to see about that too indeed we shall i thank you senior science officer i believe you may well have done the race a great service he listened with some small part of one hearing diaphragm to tsalas thanks then broke the connection and shouted pshing his adjutant rushed into the office what is it exalted fleetlord summon the american ambassador to me this instant this instant do you hear atvar said i do not care what that big ugly is doing i do not care if he is eating i do not care if he is mating i do not care if he is standing in front of a mirror and watching his hair grow i want him here at once no delay no excuse is to be tolerated do you understand me yes exalted fleetlord it shall be done exalted fleetlord pshing fled henry cabot lodge arrived quite promptly even if not so soon as atvar might have wished i greet you exalted fleetlord he said his accent thick but understandable what can i do for you today i gather from your adjutant that the business is urgent whatever it may be you might say so atvar answered yes you might say so how does the united states dare to prepare to bombard tosev from the belt of minor planets between tosev and tosev he wondered if lodge would have the nerve to deny the charge but the big ugly said we are a free and independent notempire we are entitled to take whatever steps we choose to protect ourselves so long as we are not at war with the race we do not have to make an accounting of our actions to you do you recall how close you came to being at war with the race not long ago the fleetlord demanded yes and i also recall the price we paid to avoid it henry cabot lodge replied it was just that we should pay it then for we were in the wrong but we are not in the wrong here exalted fleetlord and you have no right to protest our legitimate research in space lodge was never a male to bluster and threaten but he sounded determined here even atvar no great expert on tosevite intonation could tell as much he said regardless of whatever installations you devise out there ambassador the race remains able to destroy your notempire many times over i understand that the big ugly said steadily we are now able to treat with you on more fully equal terms however and that unfortunately was a big ugly unpalatable truth we could wreck this entire planet if necessary to keep you tosevites from escaping your solar system atvar had had that thought before now suddenly it seemed much more urgent and also much harder to do could he give such an order slaying all the colonists along with the big uglies he wondered he or his successors would have to be the ones to do it if anyone did by the time he sent a query home and waited for a reply at the laggard speed of light that reply would come far far too late to do any good not even the emperors had borne such responsibility not since before the days when home was unified henry cabot lodge said that is madness and you know it perfectly well truth it is madness atvar agreed but tosev is a world of madness so who knows whether a mad answer might not be the best to that the american big ugly had not a single word to say bombs burst in peking shaking the ground at the central committee meeting liu han turned to nieh hoting and said we are making them work much harder this time truth the peoples liberation army general answered in the language of the little scaly devils he went back to chinese thanks to the missiles we got from the soviet union they cannot use their landcruisers or their helicopters or even their aircraft so freely as they would like mao glanced across the table at them we have held peking now since the uprising began we hold a good many cities here in the north and the countryside surrounding them nieh nodded from there to the soviet border the scaly devils appear only at great peril to their lives if molotov wanted to he could legitimately recognize us as the government of liberated china mao said but will he do it he scowled and shook his head he does not dare the dusty little worm for fear of angering the little devils stalin was ten times the man he is stalin knew no fear to liu han nieh murmured anyone who isnt afraid of the little scaly devils has tiles loose on his roof well of course she whispered back you know how mao is molotov hasnt given him everything he wanted so of course hes going to rant about it he isnt satisfied till things go exactly as he saw them in his mind that makes him a great leader nieh said to which she nodded he added it can also make him very tiresome and liu han nodded again mao took no notice of the byplay mao took as little notice as he could of anything that didnt involve himself he went right on talking when liu han started paying attention to him again he was saying might be better off demanding recognition from the little scaly devils than from the soviet union heads bobbed up and down along the table chou enlai said i think there is some hope they may give this to us we have shown them we are determined and we are not to be trifled with if we send them an embassy i think they will listen they had better listen or theyll be sorry thats right thats just right mao said of course he thought anyone who agreed with him was right he continued theyre already sorry we can send them an embassy under flag of truce if they heed us well and good if they dont were no worse off his forefinger shot out comrade liu han you have dickered with the scaly devils before havent you uh yes comrade liu han said taken aback good mao beamed at her his face round as the full moon thats settled then well send you through our line you know what you are to demand of them our independence of course she answered thats right he nodded yes indeed no more imperialists in our country weve seen too many first the roundeyed devils then the japanese then the little scaly devils no more not if were strong enough to hold our own against them what if they refuse us that liu han asked then the fight goes on of course mao said but she shook her head im sorry comrade what i meant was what if they offer us something less than full independence but more than nothing what if they offer us say some small area to rule on our own or if they offer us some voice in affairs but not real freedom refer such things back to me mao told her they will be checking with their superiors too i have no doubt of that all right liu han nodded what mao said made good sense though she wondered whether the little scaly devils would have anything at all to say to a representative of the peoples liberation army she gave a mental shrug the peoples liberation army would contact the imperialist oppressors if they wanted to talk after that they would she spent the next couple of days discussing possibilities with mao and with chou enlai then word came back that the little devils would treat with her she got into a motorcar with a white flag tied to the radio aerial the driver took her out of battered peking and down to the scaly devils shuttlecraft port voice cheerful he said this road is supposed to be cleared of mines if it isnt im going to be very unhappy with you liu han said which made the fellow laugh a mechanized fighting vehicle like the one that had taken her out of the little scaly devils prison camp blocked the road an amplified voice blared from it in the scaly devils language and then in chinese let the negotiator come forward alone liu han got out of the motorcar and walked to the fighting vehicle clamshell doors at the rear of the vehicle opened she got in three little scaly devils glared at her they all carried rifles i greet you she said in their language we will take you to our negotiator one of them answered no politeness only business that was the last they said till the fighting vehicle halted a couple of hours later liu han had no idea just where she was her surroundings when she left the vehicle did nothing to enlighten her she found herself in the middle of one of the little devils encampments full of drab tents a scaly devil was waiting for her you are the female liu han he asked as if anyone else were likely to have emerged from the machine when she admitted it he said come with me and led her to one of the tents i am relhost said the scaly devil waiting inside my rank is general i greet you and i greet you liu han answered returning courtesy for courtesy she gave her own name though he already knew it you are not fond of us we are not fond of you these are obvious truths relhost said liu han nodded the little devil made his kinds gesture of agreement to show he knew what that meant he continued your side and mine have made agreements even so maybe we can do it again i hope so that is why we asked to talk liu han said we have liberated a large stretch of china from your imperialistic grasp relhosts shrug was amazingly like a mans for the time being he said he didnt reckon imperialistic an insult to him it was more likely to be a compliment i expect we shall retake all the territory you have stolen from us he paused one of his eye turrets swung toward a small portable stove in a corner of the tent and to the aluminum pot bubbling on it would you care for some tea no thank you liu han shook her head i did not come here to drink tea i came here to discuss the fight with you i think you are wrong i think we can keep what we have taken i think we can take more it is usual in a hard fight for both sides to think they are winning relhost observed one of them proves to be wrong here i think the race thinks you will prove to be wrong plainly we disagree about that liu han said we can hold we will hold and we can bleed you white that was how liu han thought of the phrase anyhow its literal meaning was we can crack all your eggs you have cost us a certain amount relhost admitted and then tempered that by adding but not so much as you think and i am certain that we have hurt you a great deal more that was true gruesomely true liu han had no intention whatsoever of admitting it instead she said we can afford to lose far more than you can she also knew that was true it was an underpinning of maos strategy what do you propose then relhost asked an end to the fighting you recognize our independence in the land we control now and we promise not to try to gain any more liu han said no absolutely not relhost used the little scaly devils hand gesture that was the equivalent of a human headshake you spoke of cracking eggs your promises are not worth cracked eggshells we have seen that too many times by now we will not be fooled again he appended an emphatic cough liu han knew the peoples liberation armys promise would be written on the wind too she wouldnt admit that either she said we have shown we can take and rule broad stretches of territory we do not hold others where we can still disrupt you you might do better to give up this land you cannot hold it we can we shall the scaly devil used another emphatic cough you think we are not ready for a long fight i am here to tell you that we will fight for as long as it proves necessary if we yield here to you now we would have to yield elsewhere to other tosevites later it would mean the ruination of the empire on this world that shall not be you understand that you would lose face liu han thought you understand this one stone would start an avalanche very often the little scaly devils were naive about the way people worked not here worse luck here they understood only too well liu han wished they hadnt she said another bargain may be possible i am listening relhost answered you have seen that we are going to be a power in the land for a long time to come liu han said give us a share in ruling china it is possible that you might control foreign affairs but we can share in administering the land but relhost said no again he said it with as little hesitation as hed used before he went on you want us to admit you have some legitimate right to be part of the government of china we will never do that this land is ours and we intend to keep it then the fight will go on liu han warned truth relhost said the fight will go on it will go on and we will win it you would do better to accept that now and to live within the empire you could become valued partners in it partners liu han asked sardonically partners are equals you have just said we cannot be equals valued subjects then relhost sounded cross that she had pointed out the contradiction we should not be subjects in our own land liu han said we will not be subjects in our own land that is why the fight goes on that is why it will go on we shall win it the little scaly devil said maybe he was right liu han still had faith in the historical dialectic but less than shed had when she was younger and the scaly devils had their own ideology of historical inevitability to sustain them they believed in what they were doing every bit as much as the peoples liberation army believed in its mission i will send you back to your own side under safeconduct said the little scaly devil who was a general the war will continue we will never agree to your independence we will never agree to your autonomy you will never defeat us liu han wondered not for the first time whether she would live long enough to find out if she was right queek the races ambassador to the soviet union was in a worse temper than usual here comrade general secretary he said to vyacheslav molotov through his polish interpreter who as usual seemed to be enjoying himself i insist that you examine these photographs molotov put on his reading glasses and looked at them i see a number of explosions he said so what this caravan was intercepted from the air just on the chinese side of the border with the ussr queek said these explosions you are generous enough to notice prove that it was carrying munitions very large quantities of munitions so what molotov repeated the chinese are in rebellion against you why is it surprising that they should use large quantities of munitions by everything we have seen the chinese are incapable of manufacturing many of these munitions for themselves queek said this leads us to the conclusion that the soviet union is supplying them you have no proof of that whatever molotov said i deny it as i have denied it whenever you have made that accusation these photographs prove the lizard began nothing molotov broke in if they were taken on the chinese side your side of the border they prove nothing about what my country is doing where else would the bandits and rebels in china have come up with such advanced weapons the lizards ambassador said they cannot make these weapons for themselves the caravan carrying the weapons was intercepted near the ussrs border do you seriously expect the race to believe even for a moment that the soviet union had nothing to do with them were any of these weapons of soviet manufacture molotov asked a little apprehensively because there was always the chance that the red army in its zeal to arm the peoples liberation army might have ignored his orders against such a blunder and added soviet weapons to those obtained from the re c but queek said no they were made by the germans and americans molotov was confident his relief didnt show nothing showed unless he wanted it to and he never wanted it to and as a matter of fact the ussr hadnt supplied the chinese with many american weapons lately nice to know we really are innocent of something he thought it makes my protestations all the more convincing he said in that case you would do better to talk with the germans and americans dont you think instead of making these outrageous false charges against the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union we do not necessarily view them as false queek said the race understands that it is far from impossible to obtain weapons from the nation that manufactured them and then to pass them on to bandits who support your ideology on the basis of this presumption you have made these provocative charges against the soviet union molotov said in view of the unsettled state of the world this past year do you not think you would be wise to avoid provocation do you not think you would be wiser to keep from provoking us the lizard returned as i have repeatedly told you i deny that we have done any such thing and it is plain that you have no proof whatever of any guilt on our part molotov said had the race had any such proof life would have grown more interesting than he really cared to deal with he went on you might also inquire of the japanese who had their own imperialist ambitions in china before the race came to earth we are doing so queek answered but they deny any part in supporting these bandits who as they accurately point out are ideologically aligned with the ussr not with japan they might well support them anyhow merely for the sake of giving you troublemolotov answered has this concept never occurred to you before we came to tosev it probably would not have queek said you tosevites have taught us several interesting lessons on the uses of duplicity if we are less trusting now than we were just after we arrived you have only yourselves to blame that no doubt held a lot of truth but it had nothing to do with the business at hand you had proof against the germans molotov said the best proof of all they attacked you you had proof against the americans because of the defector with proof war becomes justified to threaten war without proof is foolhardy i insist that you convey my strongest possible protest to the fleetlord i demand a formal apology from the race for making these unfounded and unwarranted accusations against the soviet union we have done nothing to deserve them he sounded vehement even passionate queek spoke in the lizards language the interpreter sounded downcast as he translated i shall convey your insistence and your demand to the fleetlord i cannot predict how he will respond an apology of course would cost atvar nothing but pride sometimes that mattered very much to the lizards sometimes it seemed not to matter at all they were less predictable than people that way but then queek went on it may be that we have no proof of the kind you describe comrade general secretary regardless of your protests and your bluster however you must never forget that we do have a great deal of circumstantial evidence linking the ussr to these weapons if the evidence ever becomes more than circumstantial the soviet union will pay a heavy price and it will be all the heavier to punish you for your deceit as you must know the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union are prepared to defend themselves against imperialist aggression from any enemies molotov answered once more suppressing a nasty stab of fear we taught both the nazis and the race as much a generation ago our means of defense now are more formidable than they were then and just as we were prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with the united states you may reasonably expect that the usa will also stand shoulder to shoulder with us he had no idea whether the lizards could reasonably expect any such thing harold stassen would act in what he reckoned his nations selfinterest and molotov had no good grip on that he also had no notion whether stassen would be reelected in political writers in the united states seemed dubious about his prospects but queek couldnt readily disprove his claim and it seemed to rock the lizard it rocked him in fact a good deal more than molotov had thought it would queek said you have told us to mind our own business in our dealings with you now i tell you to mind your own business in respect to our dealings with the united states you would be wise to heed and obey well well molotov thought yes that was a more interesting response than hed looked for he wondered what had happened between the lizards and the americans to prompt it no new crisis had come to the notice of the gru or the nkvd the nkvd of course was not what it had been damn beria anyhow molotov thought as he did whenever that unpalatable truth forced itself to his attention aloud he said i was not speaking of your dealings with the united states but of my own countrys i have no control over how you and the americans deal between yourselves any more than you have control over how we and the americans deal between ourselves he yielded a little ground there or seemed to without committing himself to anything queek said i have told you everything the fleetlord instructed me to convey for your benefit i shall repeat the gist do not meddle in china or you will regret it since we have not meddled in china i do not see why you are telling us not to do so molotov replied you have never been able to prove otherwise you remain under very strong suspicion queek got to his feet and so did his interpreter the pole looked unhappy he had come in hoping to see molotov discomfited but had not got what he wanted instead his own principal was downcast while leaving as queek stalked toward the door he added sometimes strong enough suspicion is as good as truth the soviet union ran on exactly the same principle nevertheless molotov affected outrage snapping it had better not be if you attack us on the basis of suspicion a great many innocent human beings and members of the race will die as a direct result of your error he waited to see what queek would say to that the lizard said nothing at all he left the office his interpreter trailing along like the running dog he was when molotov rose from his chair sweat dripped from his armpits he was good perhaps better than any man alive at simulating imperturbability no one could gauge what he thought or whether he worried but he knew he knew all too well a crew of cleaners started vacuuming the office where hed met with queek and the hallway the lizard and his interpreter had used coming to and going from that office molotov went back to the office he used for all business other than that involving the race andrei gromyko and marshal zhukov were sipping tea there how did it go the foreign commissar asked well enough andrei andreyevich molotov answered he savored the sound of the words then nodded yes well enough perhaps even better than well enough queek came in full of accusations groundless ones of course zhukov put in yes of course georgi konstantinovich molotov agreed despite the best soviet security precautions the race might still be listening here as i say he came in breathing fire but i made him realize he had no proof whatever for his false claims and that he had no business making threats without proof thats good vyacheslav mikhailovich thats very good zhukov said you do know your business no two ways about it i am glad you think so molotov said if zhukov didnt think so he would be out of a job and probably dead he raised a forefinger one thing i noted the lizards are unusually concerned with the united states at the moment do you have any idea why comrade marshal no comrade general secretary zhukov scribbled a note to himself i shall try to find out though good by all means do so molotov said and zhukov nodded in what was without a doubt obedience zhukov could unmake molotov the red army was if he chose to wield it the most powerful instrument in the ussr but he seemed increasingly content to follow the lead of the party and especially of its general secretary molotov smiled but only inside where it didnt show hed been through a lot he was convinced hed been through more than any one man deserved to suffer but hed prevailed so far and now against all odds he thought he could bring the red army and its commander to heel again he tapped a pencil a couple of times on his desk s a triumph yet he thought in spite of everything i shall and the communist party of the soviet union with me you want to make the acquaintance of a tosevite historian felless said why would you seek to meet such an individual i do not necessarily have to meet the big ugly ttomaiss replied but i would like to confer with a historian yes the race faces many more difficulties in assimilating this world to the empire than we anticipated felless let out a derisive hiss that has become painfully obvious it was so obvious in fact that she wondered why ttomaiss chose to belabor the point he proceeded to answer her because of large differences in biology and relatively small differences in cultural sophistication i think the big uglies will cling to their ways far more tenaciously than either the rabotevs or hallessi did if you like i can go into detail please do felless said intrigued now this was her specialty too and when ttomaiss had finished she found herself impressed almost against her will you make an interesting case she admitted but why do you seek a tosevite historian i am interested in instances of acculturation and assimilation in the past on tosev ttomaiss replied the more i understand about such matters from the perspective of the big uglies the better my chances the better the races chances of successfully planning for the full incorporation of this world into the empire and so do you know or know of any tosevite historians as a matter of fact i do felless answered i even know one who is in my debt shed got monique dutourd a position true that shed done so as a result of blackmail was something she kept to herself she went on this tosevite females one drawback is that she does not speak the language of the race but only francais language is often a problem in working with big uglies ttomalss said i suspect you will be able to find me a translator please do get in touch with this historian superior female if you would be so kind very well felless said with poor grace she wasnt so sure she wanted to deal with the big ugly again but duty was more important than anything except possibly ginger it may take some little while she is no longer in marseille ttomalss made the affirmative gesture i understand when you have the time however i would appreciate it he was so grateful and reasonable felless found no way to refuse him that annoyed her too arranging a call to tours wasnt easy especially since she needed an interpreter she made sure she chose one who she knew tasted ginger dickering with the tosevite was liable to involve topics that would horrify a prim and proper male or female topics ambassador veffani for instance should never hear about even with a fellow taster felless knew she was taking a chance the call went through to monique dutourds university office at a time when she was likely to be in and sure enough she said alia the standard francais telephone greeting i greet you felless said in return and the interpreter translated her words into francais senior researcher felless here do you remember me yes very well the big ugly came straight to the point and what is it that you want with me your expertise as a historian felless answered you are joking monique dutourd said surely you must be joking not at all felless said a colleague of mine wishes to discuss tosevite history with you he is turning an eye turret toward analogies between the present situation with respect to the race and you tosevites and possible past situations in your history i do not know if there are truly comparable situations neither does he would you be willing to explore this matter with him it could be the female tosevite replied it could even be that it would be interesting is it that your colleague speaks francais unfortunately no felless said thinking it wasnt unfortunate at all but only natural what a pity monique dutourd said i do not speak your language either if we are to talk of the romans we shall need an interpreter as you and i have here as an aside felless asked the male who spoke francais who are these romans he shrugged some big uglies or other i suppose he would not be the ideal translator for ttomalss felless could see that so could monique dutourd she said it might be better if the interpreter were a tosevite someone who was himself at least somewhat familiar with the folk and events about which he was translating yes that does seem sensible felless agreed monique dutourd seemed intelligent fora big ugly felless added to herself she asked do you have anyone in particular in mind to translate for you then as a matter of fact i do the tosevite female answered felless interpreter had to resort to circumlocution for a bit after that the tosevite male she has in mind is the fellow hatchling of the male and female who engendered her the big uglies can describe this relationship in one word though we cannot she assures me that he is fluent in our language as fluent as a tosevite can be big uglies stress kinship as we stress friendship felless said and the male with her made the affirmative gesture she went on ask her if she thinks this male tosevite would be willing to do the work of translating and what sort of pay both she and he would expect for working with ttomalss i am sure pierre would be willing monique dutourd replied there is a certain difficulty however the race presently has him imprisoned for smuggling ginger if you can do anything to get him released i would be grateful i would not mind seeing pierre dutourd released myself felless translator remarked i have bought a good deal of the herb from him and it is harder to find now not impossible but harder truth felless said but can we get him released for this project cannot the male said you may have better connections than i do tell monique dutourd i will try to arrange her kinsmales release felless said with more than a little trepidation tell her i can guarantee nothing for i am not sure how far my influence will reach ask her if she would consider discussing these matters with ttomaiss even if i cannot arrange this other big uglys release she had no great hope for that she knew only too well that the tosevites took an affront against their kinsfolk as an affront against themselves but to her surprise monique dutourd replied yes i would be willing though i am grateful for your making the effort to help him i will do what i can felless said hoping the tosevite female could not hear her relief i hope you will also seek other possible interpreters it shall be done the big ugly said in the language of the race that was one phrase a great many tosevites knew even if they knew no more after getting off the phone with monique dutourd felless thought hard about ignoring her promise having anything public to do with ginger was all too likely to get her in trouble with the races authorities but she wouldnt have minded seeing pierre dutourd free either and so despite misgivings she telephoned ambassador veffani he was as suspicious as shed known he would be you want to set that rogue free to cause trouble for the race again he demanded how much ginger will he give you in exchange for this freedom i have not spoken with him at all superior sir how could i felless tried to make herself the very image of righteousness his name was mentioned as a possible interpreter by a tosevite historian whom i contacted at the request of senior researcher ttomalss you are welcome to confirm that with ttomalss if you like believe me i shall veffani said how is it that a notorious ginger smuggler came up in a conversation with a tosevite scholar i find this hard to believe find it however you please superior sir felless answered the scholar and the smuggler happen to share a mother and father you know how big uglies are in matters relating to kinship veffani let out an unhappy hiss i do indeed it is that sort of difficulty is it and i suppose the tosevite scholar will have nothing to do with us unless we release the tosevite criminal monique dutourd hadnt said anything of the sort felless didnt care to lie outright to veffani but she did want to accomplish her own goals as well as ttomalss you know how big uglies are she repeated and let the ambassador draw his own conclusions so i do veffani said with a sigh well perhaps we can arrange to release him long enough to do the necessary work and then return him to prison he caught himself before felless could say anything no the odds are it would not work let me speak with ttomalss and find out just how important his work is if he makes the request for this translator i can release the big ugly with a better conscience i thank you superior sir said felless who hadnt expected to gain even that much from the ambassador i am not nearly sure you are welcome veffani answered as i say i shall consult with ttomalss he has the respect and admiration of the fleetlord and he has never been known to taste ginger he broke the connection felless glared at the monitor no ttomalss didnt taste that hadnt kept him from mating with her when she tasted not tasting hadnt kept veffani from mating with her when she tasted either when females tasted they would emit pheromones and males would mate with them that of course was the problem with the herb she wondered how the two gingeraddicted members of the race whod sought an exclusive mating contract with each other were doing among the tosevite barbarians of the united states she didnt approve of what they had done big uglies were supposed to take on the customs and usages of the race not the other way round no she didnt approve but even so ginger she thought without the herb the race would have had a much easier time on tosev easier yes but not nearly so enjoyable the urge for a taste surged up within her she tried to resist but not very hard and hadnt that been the way shed dealt with ginger ever since her first taste she hurried to the desk took out the vial poured some of the powdered herb into her palm and let her tongue dart out delight shot through her so did a feeling of brilliance of omnipotence shed learned the hard way it was only a feeling not reality the first thing she had to do with that supposed brilliance was figure out a reason for staying here inside her chamber till she wasnt emitting pheromones any more if she failed there she would have males mating with her and she would have endless trouble from ambassador veffani she didnt care no she did care but not enough to keep her from tasting never enough to keep her from tasting what could she do while she was stuck in here research tosevite history she thought why not it has suddenly become relevant and i can claim it is something i truly need to know who are or were these romans anyway she began seeing what if anything the races data stores could tell her when the telephone rang mordechai anielewicz hoped it would be the landlord with whom hed spoken a couple of days before there was a sellers market for flats in przemysl these days as there was throughout poland but he did have hopes of moving into a bigger place which he knew his family sorely needed he hurried to the phone and answered with an eager hello but it wasnt the landlord who was a big bluff fellow named szymanski instead he heard the hisses and pops of a lizards voice do i speak to mordechai anielewicz the leader of those who follow the jewish superstition in poland you do anielewicz replied in the language of the race and may i ask to whom i speak now he had trouble telling one lizards voice from anothers you may indeed mordechai anielewicz the lizard replied i am gorppet whom you met outside greifswald and with whom you have spoken since i greet you and i greet you mordechai said this will have something to do with the missing explosivemetal bomb unless i miss my guess truth it will gorppet agreed i would like you to do me a favor that i believe will make its recovery more likely i will be glad to do so anielewicz answered as long as it is nothing that endangers any of my fellow jews except for the ones who have taken the bomb i do not believe that will be a problem gorppet said go ahead then mordechai said i shall have to be the final judge of that though i warn you now to avoid misunderstandings later i understand the lizard said you may perhaps be interested to learn that we have recruited your acquaintance the deutsch officer named johannes drucker to provide us with information and work with us from his new post in flensburg have you mordechai said how did you manage that he had trouble imagining drucker working with the race but one possible way to get the rocket pilots cooperation crossed his mind did you threaten to tell his superiors that he and i worked together for a little while without trying to slaughter each other that is exactly what we did as a matter of fact gorppet answered you must be well schooled in duplicity to have figured it out so quickly maybe mordechai admired gorppet for thinking of it not many lizards would have however that may be what do you want me to do we informed the deutsche that this bomb might be on the territory of their notempire i have learned from johannes drucker that the deutsch constabulary believe it to have been hidden not far from the city of breslau you are familiar with the city of breslau gorppet said yes i am familiar with it anielewicz answered that is i know of it i have never been inside it the deutsche touched off an explosivemetal bomb near there during the first round of fighting indeed and the race detonated one on the city during the more recent combat gorppet said breslau itself is not presently inhabited or inhabitable but the surrounding towns and villages remain densely populated if the bomb were to explode it would do severe damage it might cause new fighting much of which would involve poland that struck anielewicz as probable too unpleasantly so i ask you again what do you want me to do we of the race have moved combat teams into the area gorppet replied the deutsche have also moved combat teams into the area but no one is eager to try to retake the bomb failure would be expensive truth mordechai used an emphatic cough to show how big a truth it was he went on there are enough tosevites with the bomb that you cannot wait for them all to sleep at the same time that appears to be the case yes gorppet said and so we were hoping you might go to this town near breslau and try to persuade the fellow members of your superstition to surrender and to return the bomb we are willing to promise them safe conduct and freedom from punishment and we shall enforce this on the deutsche why do you suppose these jews will listen to me mordechai asked if they were the sort who would listen to me they would never have taken the bomb into the reich in the first place if they will not listen to you to whom will they listen the lizard asked in return suggest a name we would be grateful for that try as he would anielewicz couldnt come up with any names maybe he said hopefully they have not set off the bomb because they cannot because it will not detonate any more no one has seemed eager to experiment along those lines gorppet said will you come to the environs of breslau if you choose to do so both the race and the deutsche will obey your orders i will come anielewicz said good gorppet answered pack whatever you need pack quickly transportation will be laid on farewell he hung up what are you doing bertha anielewicz exclaimed when mordechai started throwing clothes into the cheap cardboard suitcase that was the only one they owned he explained as he went on packing that made his wife exclaim again louder than ever i know he said what choice have i got he hoped she would come up with one for him she didnt all she said was youre doing this for the germans he shook his head im doing this to keep the war from hitting poland again if that helps the germans he shrugged what can you do somebody knocked on the door bertha opened it a man spoke in polish im here for mordechai anielewicz im coming he said and grabbed the suitcase he kissed his wife on the way out then followed the man downstairs to a beatup motorcar they got in the car zoomed off to a park a helicopter waited there rotors spinning he scrambled into it he didnt fit well it was made by and for lizards the helicopter roared off to an airstrip a few kilometers outside of przemysl a jet aircraft sat on the runway its motors were already running as soon as anielewicz boarded and sat down in one of the uncomfortable seats the airplane took off half an hour later he was on the outskirts of breslau a male came up to him while he was still wondering if hed remembered to bring a toothbrush i am gorppet the lizard said i greet you and i greet you mordechai answered what are you doing here if i may ask are you an expert on explosivemetal bombs me gorppet made the negative gesture hardly but my superiors have decided i am an expert on johannes drucker and mordechai anielewicz that is the expertise that brought me here to meet you am i not a lucky male very lucky anielewicz agreed he didnt know how to say cynic in the language of the race but thought gorppets picture could have illustrated the dictionary definition where near breslau do you think the bomb is hidden somewhere in the town called kanth where no one has bothered to tell me yet gorppet replied a cynic sure enough in this strange environment it could be anywhere and that is a truth altogether too much water on this world the vicinity of breslau didnt seem so strange to anielewicz the city had sprawled on both sides of the oder and over the numerous islands in the river dozens of bridges had spanned the oder these days breslau itself was wreckage and nothing else but thanks to the explosivemetal bomb that had burst above the city considering what the germans had visited on poland and anywhere else their bombs could reach mordechai had a certain amount of trouble feeling sympathetic he pointed ahead this little town here kanth hardly seems to have many hiding places for a bomb easy enough to hide a bomb gorppet answered harder to hide that we are looking for it and there as the race would have said was another truth the lizards had set up a command post outside of kanth the germans had set up another one if there were jews holed up in there with ten tonnes worth of explosivemetal bomb they could hardly doubt theyd been noticed what exactly do you want me to do mordechai asked go in there and ask them to come out without blowing up the town as i told you on the telephone we and the deutsche will obey your orders here gorppet replied these are your followers the presumption is that you will best know how to deal with them anielewicz wondered how good that presumption was any followers of his who really followed him wouldnt have absconded with the explosivemetal bomb in the first place but he had no better notions and so he said we had both better find out where your leaders believe the bomb to be it shall be done superior sir gorppet said for all the world as if mordechai were a lizard of higher rank come with me then we can both learn inside one of the tents the lizards had set up a monitor displayed a map of kanth the map was in german and must have been copied from a nazi document a red square blinked on and off on one street near the edge of town anielewicz pointed to it is that the place yes that is the place answered a lizard whose body paint was similar to gorppets but somewhat more ornate he went on i am hozzanet you are the male named anielewicz at mordechais nod hozzanet went on what can we do to assist you in dealing with these individuals get me a bicycle mordechai answered i do not want to walk all that way it shall be done hozzanet said and done it was he had no idea where the lizards came up with the bicycle for all he knew they borrowed it from the nazis but they got it his legs ached when he started pedaling the neverfailing legacy of german nerve gas more than twenty years before why am i doing this he wondered why am i risking my neck to save a bunch of germans who hate me that was the question his wife had asked it seemed more urgent now but the answer still came all too clearly because this band of idiots is liable to make the nazis visit more harm on people i dont hate on people i love people in kanth stared at him as he rolled through the quiet almost empty streets they knew something was going on but they had no idea what if they started fleeing what would the men with the bomb do probably try to set it off so they could kill folk other than themselves anielewicz had played the role of a terrorist he knew how such folk thought here was the street here was the house on the lefthand side it had an attached garage that had probably been a stable before the turn of the century it could easily have held the bomb nobody had trimmed the grass in front of the house for a long time but that was far from unique on the street with fall edging toward winter most of the grass had gone grayish yellow mordechai leaned the bicycle against a beech tree with a couple of bullet holes in the trunk as he walked up to the door he felt eyes on him from inside what a fool i am for coming here he thought and knocked on the tarnished brass knocker the door opened the man who stood there aimed a submachine gun at anielewiczs belly all right you damned traitor he growled in yiddish get your tukhus inside right now mordechai went in the door slammed shut behind him ttomalss did not like using a soundonly telephone but the race didnt yet have a consulate in tours from which he could have had a proper discussion with the tosevite historian felless had found for him making the best of things he said i greet you professor dutourd a male big ugly turned his words into francais a female big ugly answered presumably in the same tongue the male big ugly spoke in the language of the race and she greets you at least the historian and the interpreter were on the same circuit as far as tosevite telephone technology went that was no small achievement ttomalss said professor dutourd i gather the romans whom you study are an important imperial folk among the tosevites more backandforth between the big uglies yes that is a truth monique dutourd answered through the interpreter that interpreter ttomalss had been given to understand was a notorious ginger dealer but he was also a kinsmale to the historian knowing from painful personal experience how intimate tosevite ties of kinship could be ttomalss had prevailed upon ambassador veffani to allow his release he hoped he was doing the right thing he did not want to have to deal with a hostile historian that would make learning what he needed to know all the more difficult i gather also that these romans ruled many different kinds of tosevites some of them from cultures very different from their own ttomalss said if he turned out to be wrong there he would have to ask felless to find him another historian but monique dutourd said yes that is also a truth good ttomalss knew he sounded relieved he wondered if the tosevite interpreter noticed the very idea of different cultures had been alien to him before he came to tosev that of home had been homogeneous since not long after the race unified the planet the rabotevs and the hallessi had quickly adopted their conquerors ways he could find more differences crossing a river on this world than he could in crossing lightyears of space between worlds in the empire what is it you wish to know about the romans and these other cultures monique dutourd asked i want to learn how the romans succeeded in incorporating them into their empire and into their culture ttomalss answered ah i see the tosevite historian said this is relevant to your present situation is that not a truth either she or her interpreter let out a couple of yips of barking tosevite laughter through him she went on there are those among us who say history is not relevant to anything i am glad to find the race disagrees plenty of males and females of the race ttomalss knew would not only have agreed but would have added emphatic coughs to their agreement he did not mention that to the big uglies on the other end of the telephone line instead he said yes i certainly think it is relevant i am glad to find that you do too whatever you can tell me will be of value to the race in that case perhaps you will understand that i wonder whether i ought to tell you anything at all monique dutourd said if you do not someone else will ttomalss did his best to sound indifferent or we will eventually gain the information from your books whatever else we may be doing we are not discussing secret matters here after a pause the tosevite female said yes that is so very well you have reason i will discuss these things with you i thank you ttomalss did his best to treat her as he would have treated a savant of his own kind she said first of all incorporation into the roman empire assumes roman military victories i do not think we need to talk about those ttomalss found himself making the affirmative gesture which did no good on a phone link without vision i would agree with you he said our military technology is very different from that of the romans and so is yours nowadays and the race will be arguing about why that is so for generations to come he thought never had his species been presented with such a rude surprise all right then monique dutourd said once a subregion was conquered the romans gave local autonomy to towns and areas that were not in rebellion against them they did harshly stamp out rebellions where those arose that is a sensible policy ttomalss said in large measure we follow it here the trouble with following it was that big uglies who were put in positions of authority often used that authority for themselves and against the race ttomalss wondered if the romans had had similar problems with very few exceptions monique dutourd went on the romans allowed the males and females of the conquered subregions to practice whatever superstitions they chose to follow that is also a sensible policy ttomalss said why did they make exceptions on account of superstitions they thought dangerous to their empire the tosevite historian replied i can think of two examples one was the superstition of the druids which had its center here in what is now france the romans feared that these druids who were the leaders of the superstition would also lead the local inhabitants into rebellion against them and the other ttomalss asked when monique dutourd did not name it at once the other superior sir was called christianity she replied you may perhaps have heard of it yes he said automatically before realizing she was being ironic then he asked but why did they try to suppress it and why did they fail this is the largest tosevite superstition at the present time they tried to suppress it because the christians refused to acknowledge any other spiritual forces monique dutourd said and because the christians refused to give reverence to the spirits of the roman emperors really ttomalss said in surprise in that they are much like the followers of the muslim superstition today with respect to the spirits of emperors past emperors of the race of course yes both christianity and islam are offshoots of the jewish superstition which disapproves of giving reverence to anything but the one supreme supernatural authority monique dutourd said ah ttomalss scribbled a note to himself he hoped and assumed the race already knew that but he hadnt known it himself he asked why are the muslims so much more fanatically opposed to the race at present than the christians to get a proper answer to that you would need to ask someone who knows more about islam than i do the tosevite historian answered her reply won ttomalss respect he had seen a great many individuals both members of the race and big uglies who because they were experts in one area were convinced they were also experts in other usually unrelated areas when he said as much monique dutourd started to laugh and what do you find funny he asked his dignity affronted i am sorry superior sir she said but i find it strange that you are making an argument like the one a famous tosevite savant named socrates used when he was on trial for his life almost twentyfour hundred years ago am i ttomalss wondered who this socrates was did his argument succeed no monique dutourd answered he was put to death oh how unfortunate ttomalss found a different question did you use your years or mine there mine she said so he mentally doubled the figure she added at that time the romans were only a small and unimportant group they later conquered the greeks one of whose subgroups the athenians executed socrates the greeks were culturally more advanced than the romans but could not unify politically the romans conquered them and learned much from them afterwards i see ttomalss said ancientest history back on home was full of stories like that some true others legendary with scholars disagreeing over which was which he asked what benefits did the romans give to keep conquered subregions from rebelling security from outside invasion monique dutourd answered security from feuds with their neighbors also within roman territory local selfgovernment as i said before a large area unified culturally and also unified economically i see ttomalss repeated these are of course advantages you tosevites would receive on becoming subjects of the empire ah subjects the tosevite historian said one thing the romans did that made them unusual among our empires was to grant full citizenship to more and more groups that had formerly been subjects you could expect the same from us ttomalss said why already there is one tosevite with full citizenship in the empire how interesting monique dutourd replied why only one who is he she ttomalss corrected that is a complicated story it has to do with the unusual circumstances of her hatching he said not a word about the continuing dispute with kassquit over whether he kept the right to monitor her activities if she was a full citizen of the empire that was also complicated and none of monique dutourds business instead ttomalss asked if these romans were such successful rulers of their empire why did it fail scholars have been arguing over that ever since it happened the tosevite female answered there is no one answer there were diseases that reduced the population the economy suffered as a result of this rulers grew more harsh and their bureaucracy grew more stifling and there were foreign invasions most importantly from the deutsche who lived to the north of the roman empire the deutsche ttomalss exclaimed in surprise the same deutsche whom the race knows only too well their ancestors rather monique dutourd said yes of course ttomalss said impatiently how interesting that strikes me as an example of true historical continuity i have not seen many on tosev they are here monique dutourd said if you have not seen them it is because you have not looked for them or perhaps you have not known where to look yes i suppose that could be ttomalss admitted would you be willing to teach me more tosevite history it could be the female big ugly said there would be the question of payment of course of course ttomalss said i am sure we can come to some sort of equitable arrangement about that payment might not necessarily involve money monique dutourd said or not money alone i would want my kinsmale fully pardoned now that i am cooperating with the race regardless of his unpleasant and unsavory dealings ttomalss said yes regardless of them ttomalss noted that the tosevite female did not deny them she wanted the ginger smuggler forgiven in spite of them he sighed kinship not friendship he thought that showed historical continuity among the big uglies sure enough he sighed he could wish he did wish it didnt monique dutourd wished she hadnt come to tours with fall heading toward winter the city did not show itself to her at best advantage she was a child of the warm mediterranean winter in marseille was almost always mild with snow a rarity not here sure enough the atlantic drove tours climate and frost came to the city early and often after caesars conquest of gaul roman colonists in ancient caesarodunum would have been as appalled at the weather as she was now the climate at the university was also a good deal less than warm monique knew she wouldnt have gained a position had felless not pulled wires for her by all the signs every colleague in the history department knew as much too her welcome ranged from unenthusiastic to downright hostile let me teach she told her department chairman a whitehaired fellow named michel casson whod been at the university since recovering from a wound hed received defending verdun in let me publish ill show you that i belong in this place you will have the opportunity casson replied peering at her through reading glasses that magnified his eyes tremendously we cannot prevent you from having the opportunity it is to be hoped that you will not damage the reputation of the university too badly by what you do with it ears burning monique left his office in a hurry that she might prove an asset to the university had plainly never entered his mind her nails bit into her palms show you by god she thought having lost all her notes for the paper on the cult of isis in gallia narbonensis that had occupied her before marseille went up in nuclear fire she was doing her best to reconstruct it despite a research library that wasnt nearly so good as the snooty professors and librarians believed back in marseille having to deal with her brother and the unwelcome attentions of dieter kuhn had made her neglect the monograph here in tours kuhn was gone from her life for which she heartily thanked the lord the virgin and all the saints instead though she had to deal with the lizard named ttomalss he wanted nothing from her in bed he even paid but guiding him through roman history stole time from the paper no less than submitting to the germans less intellectual pursuits had done and she still had to deal with pierre technically she supposed he was a paroled prisoner she tried not to have anything to do with him when he wasnt translating for ttomalss she sometimes wished she hadnt got him out of the races prison to interpret for her her life would have been simpler if shed left him there to rot but he is my brother blood was thicker than water she wondered if pierre would go to a tenth the trouble for her that shed gone through for him she had her doubts pierre was for pierre first last and always one day after theyd got off the telephone with ttomalss he said its a pity that lizard is such a straight arrow if he werent i could have a fine new ginger network going already do you mean you dont have one monique asked with what she hoped was withering sarcasm predictably her brother refused to wither of course i do he said i meant a new one one that reached right up into his starship that would be worth arranging if only i could dont you ever think of anything but ginger and lizards she demanded ginger is what i do for a living pierre said imperturbably the lizards are my customers dont you ever think of anything else but those old romans whove been dead forever occasionally monique answered acid in her voice every now and then for instance i have to think about how to get you out of prison or whatever other trouble you wind up in on account of ginger her brother didnt even have the grace to look shamefaced took you long enough this time too he grumbled i thought i was going to rot in that damned cell forever i got you out of the french jail faster than you sprang me had he not added that last reminding her he had helped her now and again she thought she would have tried to hit him over the head with an ashtray as things were she said i never would have been carted off to jail if it werent for dieter kuhn and he wouldnt have cared about me at all if it werent for you one way or another she was going to pin the blame on pierre he said would you rather have them take me back to jail what have i got to do with that monique said youre selling ginger again you dont bother hiding it from me you hardly bother hiding it from anybody of course the lizards will notice theyre not stupid do you think theyre not watching you sooner or later youll annoy them enough that theyll scoop you up and throw you into another cell i probably wont be able to get you out then either somebody will pierre spoke with maddening confidence thats what connections are for the more people you know the more people youve got to do you a good turn when you really need one and the more people youve got to betray you when they need something from the lizards or the cs pierre stared at her in some surprise whered you learn to think like that monique laughed at him and people say that studying history never does anybody any good she exclaimed and swept out of the room before he could come up with an answer somewhere south of the city of tours the franks had hurled the previously invincible arabs back in defeat more than twelve hundred years before monique knew that but she had no interest in finding the battlefield for one thing nobody knew exactly where it was for another she had no motorcar to go gallivanting over the landscape and for a third that battlefield didnt much interest her it was several hundred years too modern that amused her when she happened to mention it to ttomalss it amused him too this is a difference in viewpoint between the race and human beings he said through her brother to us a difference of a few hundred years would not matter much thats strange monique said i would think that a chronological framework was important for your historians as well as for ours well yes ttomalss said but everything that happened before the days of the empire was a very long time ago for us what real difference if something happened years ago or i pick the numbers at random you understand in an aside pierre added when lizards talk about years cut everything they say in half they count two for every one of ours more or less thanks i think i already knew that monique answered it was still daunting she tried to imagine keeping more than fifty thousand years of history straight maybe ttomalss had a point after all even here on earth with only a tenth as much history to worry about people specialized she concentrated on roman history the faculty at the university of tours also boasted a historian of preroman greece one who studied medieval western europe one who specialized in the history of the byzantine empire and so on even so she said knowing the relative order in which things happened is important otherwise you cannot speak of causation in any meaningful sense causation her brother gave her a dirty look how the devil am i supposed to say that in the lizards language figure it out monique told him if ttomalss decides youre not doing a good job hell ask for a new interpreter and i wont be able to do a thing about it pierres expression grew even more forbidding but he must have managed to get the meaning across for ttomalss answered yes you are right about that sequence and relative chronology must be preserved absolute chronology may be less important monique wouldnt have said that but she had less absolute chronology to keep in mind and she found herself enjoying the giveandtake of the discussion with ttomalss the lizard didnt think like a human being and why should he she thought but he was a long way from stupid he had trouble understanding how people worked as individuals though he tried hard at that too when he dealt with groups he did better i thank you he said one day i am learning a great deal from you you are both intelligent and well organized these traits are less common among tosevites than i might wish after pierre translated that he added a twoword commentary of his own teachers pet monique stuck out her tongue at her brother she said tell ttomalss that i thank him and i think hes very kind that was flattery but flattery with a core of truth it was also flattery with a core of worry what exactly was he learning from her besides roman history something that would help the lizards rule their part of earth more effectively did that make her a traitor to mankind dont be silly she said to herself most people dont think roman history matters to us these days so how could it be important to the lizards she relaxed for a while after that crossed her mind but then she thought if the lizards think its important maybe it is when the telephone rang in her flat she hurried to answer it shed dreaded the phone in marseille it was too likely to be dieter kuhn here though she hadnt had any trouble alia hello professor even if rance auerbach hadnt been speaking english she would have known his wrecked rasping voice at once he went on how are things going for you up there things are very well thank you thank you very much monique replied she also used english and was glad for the chance to practice it auerbach was a ginger dealer too but somehow that bothered her less in him than it did in her brother she said is it that i could ask you something sure go ahead he told her and she poured out the substance of her conversations with ttomalss and her worries about what the race was learning when shed finished auerbach said the world would be a better place if everybodys troubles were so small thank you monique said again this time in french a breathy sigh of gratitude she felt as if he were a priest whod just given her absolution and a very light penance after a particularly sordid confession you have no idea how much you relieved me there i want to be able to see myself in a mirror without flinching that produced a long silence at last auerbach spoke in english again yeah dont we all monique suddenly wondered if she were the only one whose conscience bothered her yes colonel webster jonathan yeagers father was saying into the telephone i think well be all right if we keep cool we have to stay firm out there but we cant get pushy about it or well make them nervous my professional opinion is everybodyd be sorry if that happened he listened for a moment then said okay sir ill put it in writing for you too and hung up more trouble about the motors on the rocks in the asteroid belt jonathan asked his dad nodded you betcha they cant blame me for that one so theyre asking my advice instead sam yeagers chuckle sounded sour to jonathan hell son i didnt even know this was going on though ive got to tell you ive had suspicions ever since that big meteor slammed into mars have you jonathan raised an eyebrow you never said anything about it to me or to mom either that i know of nope his father shook his head not much point to talking about suspicions when you dont know for sure last time i was back in little rock i did ask president stassen about it did you that his father was in a position to ask questions of the president of the united states still sometimes bemused jonathan what did he tell you not much his father looked grim i didnt really expect him to he was probably afraid id go running to the lizards with whatever i heard thats nonsense but its nonsense im going to be stuck with for the rest of my life thats not fair jonathan exclaimed with the ready outrage of youth probably not but im stuck with it as i said his dad shrugged i could go on and talk about what sort of lesson that should be for you and that you should always keep an eye on your reputation no matter what but if i did that youd probably look around for something to hit me over the head with yeah probably jonathan agreed youre not too bad as far as lectures go but thanks a lot his father broke in thanks a hell of a lot jonathan grinned at him any old time dad but the grin had trouble staying on his face what are the lizards going to do out there in the asteroid belt if they try doing anything will we fight them its like i told ed webster if we dont do anything to get em twitchy i think we can ride out the storm his father answered but i also think they have to think wed fight if they did try anything out there a lot of the time you end up not having to fight if you show youre ready to in a pinch if we did fight the race wed lose wouldnt we jonathan asked now sure we would same as we would have last summer his father replied but thats not the point or its only part of the point the other part is how bad wed hurt em if we went down swinging they dont like what the nazis did to them and wed do more and worse he sighed if that outbound probe of theirs hadnt spotted our rocket lighting up we could have built a much stronger position out in the asteroid belt before the race caught on a strong position in the asteroid belt was something less than important to jonathan do you think therell be a war or not he asked the whole idea of fighting the race seems like such a waste of everything worthwhile to me i know it does his father said slowly it seems that way to a lot of kids in your generation ill tell you something though when the lizards first came to earth they shot up the train i was riding on and i volunteered for the army as soon as i made it into a town where theyd take me so did mutt daniels my manager and he was about as old then as i am now they took both of us too they didnt even blink thats how things were back in those days jonathan knew that was how things had been back in those days he tried to imagine it tried and felt himself failing stumbling a little he said but the race isnt so bad really you know thats true dad i know its true nowsam yeager said i didnt know it then nobody knew it then all we knew was that the lizards came out of nowhere and started beating the crap out of us and if we and the reds and the nazis and the british and the japs hadnt fought like mad bastards the lizards wouldve conquered the whole world and you and your pals wouldnt be looking at them from the outside and thinking how hot they are youd be looking at em up from under and no way to get out from under em okay okay jonathan hadnt expected a speech maybe his dad hadnt expected to make one either because he looked a little surprised at himself jonathan went on i understand what youre saying honest things do seem different to me though i cant pretend they dont i know they do his fathers laugh was rueful you take the race and spaceships and explosivemetal bombs and computing machines for granted theyre part of the landscape to you youre not an old fogy who remembers the days before they got here no not me jonathan shook his head the old days like dad said he thought and then the bad old days people didnt know much back then now his father was the one who said okay you cant help being young any more than i can help being not so damn younghe ran a hand through his hair which really was getting thin on top but even if he wasnt so young even if he was going bald his eyes could still get a wicked twinkle in them of course if it werent for the lizards you wouldnt be here at all because i never would have met your mother if they hadnt come i know youve told me that before i dont like thinking about it jonathan didnt like thinking about that at all imagining his own existence as depending on a quirk of fate was uncomfortable uncomfortable hell it was downright terrifying as far as he could tell hed always been here and always would be here anything that shook such foundations was not to be trusted what do you like thinking about his father asked slyly your wedding maybe or your wedding night dadreproach rang in jonathans voice his father was an old man he had no business thinking about stuff like that just wait till you have kids his father warned him youll tell them about what it might have taken to make sure they werent born and they wont want to listen to you either i hope i dont go and do stuff like that jonathan said maybe ill remember how much i hated it when you did it to me his dad laughed at him which only annoyed him more than ever sam yeager said maybe but dont bet anything much on it or youll be sorry i didnt like it when my father did it to me but thats not stopping me once you get to a certain age and see your kid acting a certain way well you just naturally start acting a certain way yourself do you jonathan said darkly he wanted to think hed be different when he turned into an old man but would he how could he tell now a lot of years lay between him and his fathers age and he was in no hurry to pass through them yeah you do his father said however much you think you wont till you get there he grinned at jonathan again this time less pleasantly jonathan scowled his father could outguess him better than the other way round that struck jonathan as most unfair too once upon a time his dad had been young and he still sometimes sort of remembered what it was like but jonathan hadnt got old yet so how was he supposed to think along with his father he gave ground now if you say so i damn well do his dad said how are you coming along with figuring out how to tie a bow tie jonathan threw his hands in the air in almost theatrical despair i dont think ill ever get it so it looks right with a fancy tux that made his father laugh it wasnt anything i had to worry about when i married your mother i was in uniform and she was wearing blue jeans that great metropolis of chugwater wyoming jonathan chorused along with his father if hed heard about the tobaccochewing justice of the peace whod married his folks once hed heard about him a hundred times the fellow had been postmaster and sheriff too not having to worry about a tux did give the story a slightly different slant but only slightly his fathers eyes went far away things havent worked so bad for barbara and me though he said more than half to himself no not so bad at all for a couple of seconds he neither looked nor sounded like an old man not even to jonathan he might have been looking forward to a wedding himself not back on the one hed had a long time ago chugwater wyoming this time jonathan spoke the ridiculous name in a different tone of voice it must be pretty hot to be able to remember getting married in a funny place like that i mean a church is probably prettier and all but everybody gets married in a church it was one of those crazy wartime things his father answered nobody knew whether the lizards could take chicago so they pulled all the physicists and the typists your mom was one and the lizard pows and the interpreter me and sent everybody to denver where it was supposed to be safer we almost got killed just when we were setting out a lizard killercraft shot up our ship that was the first time he broke off the first time what jonathan asked never mind nothing his dad turned red jonathan scratched his head wondering what that was all about if he didnt know better he would have sworn he shook his head nobody was ever comfortable thinking about his father and mother doing that especially before they got married sam yeager went on isnt there something useful you could be doing instead of standing around here jawing with me by his tone he didnt want jonathan thinking about that either like what jonathan didnt feel like doing anything useful either mickey and donald are all taken care of that was the chore he most often had to worry about not that he didnt enjoy dealing with the two little lizards though not so little now he did but he didnt want to get herded off to take care of them that made him feel as if he were still little himself i dont know his father said shall i think of something never mind jonathan decamped from the kitchen pausing only to grab a coke from the refrigerator he gambled that his dad wouldnt have time to come up with anything particularly nasty yardwork qualified in his opinion before he did that and he won his gamble back in the safety of his own room he took a big swig at the soda and started studying his assignment in the history of the race he had exams coming one more semester after this one and then i can start making a living with the lizards just like karen he thought and thanks to his dad he had some of the best connections in the whole world friendship counted for an awful lot with the race and his father had more friends among the lizards than any human being this side of kassquit poor kassquit he thought much as the race fascinated him he wouldnt have wanted to get to know it the way she had thinking about her made him sad and horny both at once he couldnt help remembering what theyd spent so much time doing up on the starship thinking about doing that with kassquit made him think about doing it with karen and their wedding and their wedding night what with all that he got very little real studying done but he had a good time anyhow rance auerbach stared out the hotel window at the waters of the mediterranean even now with fall sliding toward winter they remained improbably warm and improbably blue oh the gulf of mexico pulled the same trick but marseille was at the same latitude as boston more or less it seemed like cheating we ought to get a blizzard he said penny summers shook her head no thanks i saw too goddamn many blizzards when i was growing up i dont want any more well i dont either rance admitted but weather this good this late in the year just doesnt feel right he coughed then wheezed out a curse under his breath coughing hurt it always had ever since he got shot up it always would up till the day they buried him that or something close to it was on his mind these days maybe im just antsy damned if i know whats to be antsy about penny asked were doing great a lot better now that they dropped on good old pierre plenty of business plenty of customers yeah auerbach lit a cigarette that would probably make him cough some more but he didnt care no that wasnt right he did care but not enough to make him quit maybe its just that things are going too good i keep waiting for the knock on the door at three in the morning penny shook her head not this time if they didnt grab us when they got pierre the turd they arent gonna do it you and me sweetie were home free now rance eyed her with more than a little alarm whenever you start thinking like that you get careless remember what happened when we took that little trip down into mexico i dont want anything like that happening again they owe us for a lot more now than they did back then you worry too much penny said everythings gonna be fine you wait and see you dont worry enough rance returned you go around acting like the lizards and the frenchmen cant see us youre going to find out youre wrong then youll be sorry and so will i im not the one whos been taking chances lately penny said youre the fellow who blackmailed that lizard into finding good old pierres sister a job of course that was just out of the goodness of your heart yeah sure it was lay off me on account of that will you please auerbach said wearily i never messed around with her and you cant say i did no matter how much you want to pin it on me if i could id be gone penny answered i dont stay where im not wanted believe you me i dont she glared at him but even if you didnt do anything i could tell you wanted to oh for christs sake rance rolled his eyes he knew that was overacting but he needed to overact a little because penny wasnt wrong picking his words with care and hoping that care didnt show he said shes not ugly but shes not anything special i dont know what youre all up in arms about cut the crap rance penny said crisply im not blind and im not stupid either i said you didnt do anything but i know how a man looks at a woman and i know how a man acts around a woman hes sweet on too youre not the sort of guy who charges out and does big favors for just anybody that held enough truth to hurt if rance looked at it closely he limped over to an ashtray and stubbed out the cigarette returning the glare pennyd given him he answered yeah thats why i threw you out on your can when you called me up out of a clear blue sky you know how i paid you back buster she tugged at her skirt as if about to pull it off some other gal could do it the same way after what monique dutourd went through with that damn nazi i dont think she pays in that coin auerbach said though he would have been interested in finding out whether he was wrong and weve been round this barn before babe like i said i sicced the germans on that goddamn roundbush because i wanted a piece of david goldfarbs ass when hed used that line before hed made penny laugh not this time she said you sicced the nazis on roundbush because he pissed you off thats the long and short of it that also held some truth but only some stubbornly he said i did it because i dont like to see anybody getting a raw deal that goes for goldfarb and it goes for the french gal too yeah a knight in shining armor penny snarled i already told you once i didnt throw you out when you called me on the phone auerbach rasped ill tell you something else too im getting goddamn sick of you ragging on me all the time you dont like it leave me half the cash and get your own room and run your own business and leave me the hell alone i ought to she said go ahead rance told her go right ahead we split up once before did you think we were going to last forever this time he was spoiling for a fight he could feel it thatll give you the excuse you need to hop on the next train for tours and your little professor wont itpenny blazed rance laughed in her face i knew you were gonna say that god damn it to hell i knew you would but theres something you dont get sweetheart if im by myself i dont go to tours if im by myself i go to the airport and hop on the first plane i can catch thats heading for the states penny laughed too every bit as nastily as he had and you last about three days before the guys whose hired goons you plugged find out youre back and fill you full of holes for payback he shook his head i dont think so once im home i can fade into the woodwork again i did it for years before you barged in and livened things up i figure i can do it again without much trouble go back to fort worth and finish drinking yourself to death quarterlimit poker with the boys at the american legion hall penny didnt hide her scorn you reckon you can stand the excitement it wasnt so bad he answered before penny could say something else nasty the telephone on the nightstand rang she was standing a lot closer to it than rance was so she picked it up u athat tried to be french but ended up sounding a lot more like kansas she listened for a minute or so then said un moment sil vous plaitand held the phone out to auerbach talk to this guy will you i cant make out more than about every other word what that meant was she had no idea what the frenchman was saying she spoke some french but shed always had a devil of a time understanding it when spoken rance limped over and took the phone from her alia his own accent wasnt great but he managed hello auerbach said the frog on the other end of the line the shipment is early for a wonder you want to pick it up tonight instead of friday now rance said un momenthe held his hand over the mouthpiece and spoke to penny in english want to get the stuff tonight sure she said at once are we still in business you need me or somebody who can really talk some anyway auerbach answered she made a face at him he went back to french cest bon all right the ginger dealer said usual time usual place but tonight the line went dead auerbach hung up the phone and folded his arms across his chest like i said you want to walk out on me go right ahead well see which one of us lasts longer as a solo act oh screw you she said and then half laughing and half still angry she proceeded to do exactly that she clawed him and bit his shoulder hard enough to draw blood as he bucked above her he was trying to hurt her at least as much as he was trying to please her afterwards panting and sweaty she asked him where you gonna get a lay like that from your professor shes not my professor dammit he said if you listened as well as you screw youd know that i dont want to listen penny said the more you listen the more lies you hear ive already heard too many but after that she did stop putting him through the wringer about monique dutourd for which he was more than duly grateful they got dressed and went downstairs to grab a taxi we want to go to rue des flotsbleu in the anse de la fausse monnaie rance said in french to the driver of the battered vw in english he remarked just like marseille to have a district named for counterfeit money then he had to squeeze into the cabs cramped back seat one more reason to hate the goddamn nazis he muttered as his leg complained the anse de la fausse monnaie lay on the southern side of the headland whose northern side helped shape marseilles vieux port being well to the west of the center of the city it hadnt suffered badly from the explosivemetal bomb the locals hardly thought of themselves as citizens of marseille at all they hadnt been till the germans built roads connecting their little settlement to the main part of the city as soon as auerbach paid off the cabby the fellow drove away faster than a volkswagen had any business going rance didnt care for that he doesnt much want to be around here does he he said next question is what does he know that we dont the hotel couldnt have been more than a mile and a half away but was effectively in a different world and with rances bad leg a far distant one penny as usual refused to worry weve been here before well do fine this time too she said and headed off toward the tavern that was their target sighing wishing he were carrying a submachine gun auerbach followed inside fishermen and hookers looked up from their booze the barkeep had seen the two new arrivals before though when he jerked a thumb at the staircase and said room eight everybody relaxed even if the newcomers didnt look as if they belonged they were known expected and therefore not immediately dangerous rances leg complained about the stairs too but he couldnt do anything about that by the moans and lowthumpings coming from behind the thin doors upstairs most of those rooms werent being used for ginger deals but for a much older kind of transaction rance knocked on the door with the tarnished brass auerbach asked the frenchman whod telephoned who else he said in english he didnt think the frog knew any but that didnt matter his ruined voice identified him as surely as a passport photo the door opened a blinding light shone in his face another one speared penny the room was full of lizards they all pointed automatic rifles at the americans rances imagined submachine gun wouldnt have done him a damn bit of good you are under arrest for trafficking in ginger one of the lizards shouted in his own language we shall lock you up and eat the key a human would have spoken of throwing away the key as auerbach raised his hands over his head he wasnt inclined to quibble about differences in slang hed always known this day might come he found himself less frightened less furious than hed imagined he would or could be if it did turning his head toward penny he said i told you so oh shut up she answered but he still thought he got the last word nesseref always checked her telephone for messages when she got home after walking orbit as often as not the messages she did get were advertisements some delivered by real members of the race reading from scripts some altogether electronic she deleted both sorts without the least hesitation nobody was ever going to convince her that she could set foot on the road to riches by responding to a phone call from someone far likelier to be out for his profit than her own today though she had one of a different sort a wearylooking males visage appeared on her monitor i am gorppet of security he said i am calling from kanth near breslau in the greater german reich we are both acquaintances of the big ugly named mordechai anielewicz please return my call at your convenience i thank you his recorded image disappeared what sort of trouble has anielewicz found now nesseref wondered gorppets phone code was part of the message she let the computer reply wondering if she would have to record a message for him in turn but she got him smallunit group leader gorppet speaking he announced i greet you and i greet you shuttlecraft pilot nesseref returning your call ah i thank you for being so prompt gorppet said mordechai anielewicz is not just an acquaintance to me nesseref said as you will probably know he is a friend from your call i presume that he is now a friend in trouble how can i help him he is indeed a friend in trouble gorppet made the affirmative gesture he is being held hostage by several males of the jewish superstition here in kanth they may well kill him it is even possible they have killed him already wait nesseref exclaimed you must be mistaken anielewicz belongs to this superstition himself i spoke truth gorppet said you do know that these jews in poland have an explosivemetal bomb i know anielewicz claimed to have one nesseref replied i never knew whether that was a truth or only a fiction intended to impress me it is unfortunately a truth gorppet told her and jews it seems are no more immune to factional squabbles than any other big uglies a faction that wanted to damage the deutsche to the greatest possible degree seized control of the bomb during the late fighting and moved it to this vicinity i see nesseref saw only too well and liked none of what she saw what will the deutsche do if such a bomb bursts among them what can they do no one precisely knows except for their own highranking officers gorppet said no one is eager to find out we are operating on the assumption that they have more weapons than they surrendered to us all evidence strongly points that way that is why anielewicz agreed to try to persuade these jews to give themselves up to help the race to help the deutsche nesseref said that is extraordinarily generous of him she used an emphatic cough gorppets voice was dry i doubt those were his main motivations i think he was more concerned lest poland his homeland receive the brunt of whatever counterattack the deutsche might make ah yes that does make a certain amount of sense nesseref agreed but you have not answered the first question i asked you how can i help him i have not thought of any direct way gorppet said still you know him well and you know big uglies well in general especially for a female from the colonization fleet would you be willing to enter the reich and become part of the team that is seeking to regain control over this bomb provided my superiors approve i would be happy to nesseref said i have taken the liberty of making those arrangements before speaking to you gorppet said i will send transportation for you shortly have you will you nesseref couldnt decide whether to be grateful or annoyed how very efficient she grudgingly gave the male the benefit of the doubt he proved as good as his word nesseref had just got orbits food and water ready for her own absence when an official motorcar pulled up in front of her apartment building the driver telephoned from the motorcar as if to leave her in no possible doubt i await you shuttlecraft pilot coming nesseref hurried to the elevator waited impatiently for it to arrive and then rode down to the lobby when she went out to the motorcar she asked the driver will you take me to this town by breslau no superior female he said and drove her out of the new town to where a helicopter waited on the yellowish dying grass of a meadow she did not care for helicopters reckoning them unsafe but she boarded this one with no more than a minimal qualm it sprang into the air and flew off toward the west when it landed it came down not far from the wrecked and radioactive deutsch city at an encampment almost as large as the nearby tosevite town of kanth at first nesseref was surprised to discover that the encampment contained deutsch tosevites as well as members of the race then she realized that made good logical sense the deutsche after all were the ones most intimately concerned with the explosivemetal bomb yes it is a considerable embarrassment for us gorppet said when she was escorted to his tent the jews after all are big uglies who are supposed to be under our control for them to act so emphatically against our interest makes us look like fools to the deutsche and to other big uglies nesseref remarked and to other big uglies the male from security agreed the problem the jews pose the deutsche is at present the most urgent however these jews refuse to release anielewicz nesseref asked gorppet made the affirmative gesture he went to them they seized him and he has not been seen since we cannot prove he is still alive but we presume he is or the big uglies with the bomb would likely have tried to detonate it i see nesseref said as she had when he telephoned her you have a lot of optimistic speculation resting on very little evidence or so it seems to me that may well be so gorppet said has anyone found a way to extract anielewicz from his predicament nesseref asked now gorppet used the negative gesture not without unacceptable risk of having the bomb go off he replied that would be unfortunate nesseref said truth and especially for anielewicz yes gorppets voice was dry consideration is also being given to a bombardment so sharp and intense it would kill everyone in the house before anyone could trigger the bomb that would be wonderful if it worked nesseref said how likely is it to work do you think if either we or the deutsche thought it likely it would have been attempted by now the male replied that no one has attempted it shows how risky it is that it remains under consideration shows how seriously both we and the deutsche view this situation i understand nesseref said have you come to any better notion of how i may help rescue anielewicz and keep the bomb from going off unfortunately no the male from security told her but since you know him well i was hoping you might have insights and ideas that have not occurred to me another male came in his body paint was slightly more elaborate than gorppets to him gorppet said superior sir here is shuttlecraft pilot nesseref shuttlecraft pilot i present to you hozzanet my superior i greet you nesseref said and i greet you hozzanet replied welcome to the waiting room shuttlecraft pilot we hope we are far enough away to escape the worst effects of blast and radiation we also hope we do not have to try to find out experimentally i can see that you might nesseref swung an eye turret from hozzanet to gorppet and back again are all security males as cynical as the two of you probably hozzanet answered it is a useful part of our professional baggage believing the males and females and big uglies we are in charge of investigating would only trap us in a net of lies from your point of view i suppose that makes sense nesseref said you must have endless trouble with such unreliable and evershifting circumstances i am glad i deal with the physical universe with constants rather than variables a couple of other males in the body paint of security pushed their way into the tent nesseref paid them no special notice till one of them asked smallunit group leader gorppet when gorppet made the affirmative gesture both males drew pistols and aimed them at him the one whod spoken before said you are under arrest on suspicion of dealing in ginger and violent assault on the race in the subregion known as south africa your tosevite accomplices have been captured in the notempire of france and have made full confessions nesseref stared in astonishment gorppet said i deny everything he sounded convincing but hed just shown he like hozzanet believed in very little he would sound convincing regardless of whether he spoke truth hozzanet spoke to the males with the pistols we are in an emergency situation here for the good of the race i ask that you allow my subordinate to stay free till it is resolved if it is resolved satisfactorily he will probably have earned a pardon if not he shrugged we are all liable to be dead the security male whod been quiet till then said we have no authority to bargain with you or with him then you had better get some hozzanet was as ready to bend the rules as a big ugly go on i give my pledge in the emperors name that he will not flee after whispering to each other the security males made the affirmative gesture on your snout be it one of them said he left his partner stayed i thank you superior sir gorppet said quietly i warned you when i recruited you for security that we would not tolerate largescale ginger operations hozzanet said but you have a chance to redeem yourself even there if that bomb does not burst if it does spirits of emperors past will judge us nesseref said and cast down her eye turrets that is a truth hozzanet agreed and they will judge harshly they have never heard of ginger what you need to do nesseref said is to get into communication with anielewicz and help him persuade his fellow jews not to detonate the explosivemetal bomb if not she found herself puzzled and dismayed she had never thought she would have any great use for a ginger dealer but gorppet plainly worked hard on his actual duties when he was not involved with the herb and he didnt seem to use it as some males did as a tool to get females to mate with him now he made the affirmative gesture that is a truth superior female it is what i need to do or you if you think the big ugly more likely to heed a friend than an acquaintance but do you have any idea how to accomplish it without inciting the other jewish tosevites to set off the bomb wishing she could do anything else but nesseref used the negative gesture prevod was an excellent writer straha would never have asked her to collaborate with him had he not liked some of her work hed seen and as he saw from the prose the two of them produced together his memoirs would be an eggsmasher to set tongues wagging for years if they were ever published hed always expected atvar to prove an obstacle to publication he hadnt expected the same problem from his coauthor but shiplord you cannot say that prevod exclaimed not for the first time when straha outlined another of the quarrels that had led to his barely unsuccessful effort to overthrow atvar as fleetlord of the conquest fleet and why not straha demanded he liked it that she was polite enough to call him shiplord even though he was no longer entitled to wear the body paint showing him to be the third most powerful male in the conquest fleet it is a truth i never stopped warning him that his half measures would lead to trouble he continued them and they did indeed lead to trouble have you got documentary evidence to support this prevod asked i am sure such evidence exists straha said i did not offer this advice in secret but in meetings of the highranking officers of the fleet those records would have been preserved can we gain access to them prevod asked or are they concealed from general view under secrecy regulations the latter i would suspect straha said atvar would not be eager to have his ineptitude displayed for everyone to see he hesitated when he went on his tone was grudging and i admit even now we might not want the big uglies to learn how divided and uncertain we were in those days they might think that malady still afflicted us and acid returned to his voice with atvar still in command they might be right prevod sighed without the documentation shiplord how can i hope to include this incident in the book straha sighed too i am not writing a history text here you know footnotes are not mandatory he studied prevod she was young and bright and highly skilled with words when he engaged her hed thought that would be enough hed thought it would be more than enough in fact what he thought now was maybe i was wrong swinging an eye turret her way he asked have you ever felt inclined to challenge authority why no shiplord she sounded astonished that he should put such a question to her those senior to me are generally senior for good reason they know more than i do and have more experience should i not learn from them rather than trying to substitute my inferior judgment for theirs that was the response a female of the race should have given it was the response the large majority of males and females would have given straha knew as much but hearing it now frustrated him no end if those in authority make a mistake should you not point it out if you fail to point it out will they not go on making it and probably making other mistakes as well their own superiors are the ones who should correct them prevod replied that is not an appropriate role for an inferior who was atvars superior straha asked he made mistakes he made them in huge lots who was to point them out to him he had no superiors here he still has none and he is probably still making mistakes in my opinion rehashing a past that cannot be changed will not gain you many readers prevod said you would create a far more entertaining and exciting book by concentrating on the foibles of the big uglies and on your return to the race with the information about which group of tosevites attacked the colonization fleet do remember most of those who read the book will have come here as members of the colonization fleet not the conquest fleet i understand that straha said you want this to be an entertaining and exciting memoir then not an important one if no one reads it how can it be an important memoir prevod said by the emperor how i want a taste of ginger straha thought by the emperor how i need a taste of ginger he refrained though it wasnt easy he knew he would have a harder time putting up with prevod if he did taste picking his words with care he said one of the socalled foibles you mention was an honesty so thoroughgoing the male who possessed it gave me information that would harm his own notempire and his own species because he judged that the right thing to do how many males and females of the race could hope to match him but perhaps that would not amuse my readers enough to be entertaining he intended his words for sarcasm but prevod took them literally saying many would think well of the big ugly under those circumstances having a sympathetic tosevite appear might make for an interesting novelty we both use the language of the race straha said but i wonder if we speak the same tongue maybe i should go on in english he spoke the last sentence in the tosevite language he hadnt used it since fleeing the united states what did you just say now prevod sounded interested when he told her she went on did you have to learn that tosevite tongue were the big uglies too ignorant to learn ours you really ought to know better straha said some of them not only speak it but write it quite well that was when he realized hed lost his temper for he added about as well as you do in fact prevods tailstump quivered in anger she said that is ridiculous is it yes straha had lost his temper he wrote an electronic message to sam yeager under the name of maargyees that yeager used to fool the races computer network am trying to persuade a certain a very certain female that you are literate in our language luck was with him for a reply came back almost at once am sorry shiplord but i cannot write it any more than i can speak it i see straha wrote back and why not because i am only a big ugly of course sam yeager returned how can anyone without a tailstump have any brains that is where the race keeps them is it not i often wonder if we keep them anywhere straha wrote well in that case you are wasted as a male of the race his tosevite friend answered you really ought to turn into a big ugly strahas mouth fell open in startled laughter he swung an eye turret away from the monitor and back toward prevod do you see what i mean the writers tailstump was twitching more than ever if you care for his writing so much shiplord now she used the title as one of reproach not respect he could hear the difference in her voice maybe you ought to get him to compose your memoirs with you do you know straha said slowly that is not the worst idea i have ever heard of course most of the worst ideas i have ever heard have come straight from atvars mouth he meant the joke to soften what hed said just before it didnt do the job prevod sprang to her feet whomever you use to help you write your memoirs i shall not be that female she said as far as i can see the race was right to keep you far away you fit in better with the tosevite barbarians than you do with us she punctuated that with an emphatic cough and before straha could say anything she stormed out of his chamber in shepheards hotel and slammed the door behind her oh dear straha said aloud then he started to laugh he went back to the computer and wrote are you still there sam yeager no i am not here yeager replied expect to be back pretty soon though that was on the face of it absurd no male of the race would have thought to write any such selfcontradictory sentences and yet as an answer to a rhetorical question why wasnt no as good as yes straha returned to the keyboard and wrote how would you like to help me put my memoirs together what happened to the writer you were working w f the tosevite asked you did straha answered this time the only symbol sam yeager sent was the one the race used as a written equivalent of an interrogative cough it is unfortunately a truth straha told him made an invidious comparison between her writing ability and yours and for some reason or of er s e took offense i now find myself without a collaborator are you interested in becoming one you know the story i aim to tell you should you have interrogated me about a good deal of it the big ugly didnt reply for some little while when he did he wrote sorry for the delay i had to find out what invidious meant you must be joking shiplord by no means straha wrote and used the symbol for an emphatic cough well if you are not you ought to be sam yeager wrote back do not write your language well enough for males and females of the race to want to read my words they would be able to tell i am a big ugly your computers figured out that i was because i sound as if i am writing english computers do not read readers read straha insisted your way of writing is interesting and unusual whatever makes it so i thank you shiplord sam yeager replied thank you very much you have paid me a great compliment but i cannot do this and your chances of getting your memoir published go up if you have a member of the race writing with you and go down with me you cannot say that is not a truth if any tosevite is a hero among the race you are that male straha wrote your name would help the memoir not hurt it maybe but maybe not too his friend responded and having my name on your memoir would not help me here in the united states i may be a hero to the race but many americans still think i am a traitor straha hadnt considered that he realized he should have very well then he wrote farewell for now farewell sam yeager wrote back barbara has just called me to supper good luck finding another male or female to work with good luck straha said mournfully i will need more than luck i will need a miracle several miracles very likely and i do not believe in miracles i have been in exile too long to believe in miracles hed been an exile from the race and now he was an exile among the race he hadnt been at home in the united states and he didnt feel at home now that hed managed to return to the society the race was building on tosev probably would not feel at home if i went into cold sleep and flew back to home if he didnt fit in among the race here how would the smug and stifling society back on the homeworld seem to him he went over to the ginger jar atvar had let him have he took a big taste as euphoria filled him he patted the jar with an affectionate hand with ginger if nowhere else he found himself at home david goldfarb took a last long look at the notes hed been fooling with for the past few months the time for fooling was over now he had to get to work he wasnt going to refine his concept any further on paper he would have to see what he got when he turned scribbles and sketches into something real part of him was nervous heartpoundingly nervous when he started working for real instead of on paper he might turn out not to be able to make anything worth having but the rest of him the larger part was eager hed learned electronics or what people knew of electronics before the lizards came by tinkering he still sometimes felt he thought better with his hands than with his head he got up from his table im going out for a bit he told hal walsh i need to pick up a couple of things we havent got here his boss nodded okay bring the receipts back too and ill reimburse you thanks goldfarb said im not sure youll want to when you see what ive got but he shrugged im not sure i like the sound of that walsh said but he was grinning jack devereaux looked up from the circuit he was soldering im almost sure i dont he said which made walsh laugh goldfarb was grinning as he put on his overcoat hal was a pretty good chap to work for no doubt about it his grin slipped when he went outside edmonton in late november was raw and blustery with the wind feeling as if there were nothing at all between the north pole and the street down which he was walking people seemed to take it in stride david didnt think he ever would the british isles lay this far north too but the gulf stream moderated their climate nothing goldfarb had seen moderated the climate here fortunately the shop he wanted was only a couple of blocks from the saskatchewan river widget works he bought what he needed and went back to the widget works with his purchases in a big paper sack before he headed back though he made sure he took the receipt out of the sack and stuck it in his pocket if things went the way he hoped hal walsh would pay him back if they didnt his boss would laugh at him he shook his head hal wouldnt laugh not everything worked out and walsh was smart enough to understand as much but if this didnt work it would fail rather more spectacularly than other failed projects at the widget works and goldfarb suspected jack devereaux would never let him forget about it even if his boss did devereaux and walsh both looked up when david came in carrying the big sack doughnuts devereaux asked hopefully that would be a lot of doughnuts hal walsh observed devereaux nodded as if to say that the prospect of a lot of doughnuts didnt bother him a bit sorry blokes goldfarb upended the sack on his work table four large fuzzy teddy bears spilled out one spilled a little too far and ended on the floor he picked it up and put it with the others in interested tones devereaux asked are those for your second childhood or for your childrens first with a spot of luck neither goldfarb replied as if to prove as much he seized an exacto knife and slit one of the bears from neck to crotch he started pulling out stuffing and tossing it in the wastebasket devereaux made horrified noises goldfarb looked up from his work with what he hoped was a suitably demented grin didnt know you were working alongside the ripper jack devereaux made more horrified noises this time at the pun rather than at the carnage david was inflicting on the defenseless toy hal walsh inquired what are you doing besides getting this place ankledeep in fluff i hope im playing dr frankenstein goldfarb answered whereupon jack devereaux lurched stifflegged around the office in one of the worst boris karloff impressions david had ever seen refusing to let the other engineer get his goat or even his bear he nodded thats right jack without the little motors and the little batteries the lizards have shown us how to make to say nothing of their compact circuits i never could have imagined this as things are youve had the chance to go crazy in a whole different way devereaux said david shrugged maybe im going to try to find out dr frankenstein walsh eyed him the boss was nobodys fool by god youre going to make an animated teddy bear arent you im going to try goldfarb answered they used to do this kind of thing with gears and clockwork but i got to thinking that electronics are a lot more flexible jack devereauxs eyes lit up thats a damn good idea david i dont know if you can make it walk on two legs but something that moves its arms moves its eyes and still stays cute as all getout we or somebody could sell a lot of those with another nod goldfarb said im thinking the same thing and something that talks too those sound chips are cheap to make and maybe he snapped his fingers in delight at coming up with an idea not in his notes sure as hell working with his hands was inspirational we could hide a little infrared sensor right on the things nose so nobody would need to actually flip a switch to turn it on the more i hear of this the better i like it walsh said i really do we get the design patent then license it for manufacture and we might rake in a very nice piece of change a very nice piece of change indeed we need a name for em though whatll we call em fluffies he batted at a wisp of teddybear stuffing floating in the air hows that sound fluffies he cocked his head to one side considering the flavor of the name not fluffies goldfarb said furries davids right jack devereaux nodded vigorously the fluffs on the inside where it wont show the furs right out there in plain sight after a moments thought walsh nodded too okay furries it is weve got a name weve got an idea now lets make it real he beamed at goldfarb how would you like to be driving a cadillac by this time next year i dont like driving anything here david answered it still feels like im on the wrong side of the bloody road but if i have to drive anything a cadillac wouldnt be bad this side of a tank i couldnt very well get any more iron around me this is putting the car before the horse or before the furry i should say devereaux pointed out like hal said we need a real one so we can see if weve got anything worth having if you hadnt interrupted me at my surgery id be on the way there already goldfarb went over to the parts bin that ran along one wall of the office and started rummaging through them though he didnt know it his face wore an enormous smile tinkering made him happy yes indeed once he had the idea and the parts the furry presented no enormous technical challenges the biggest was getting all the components into its belly and still retaining enough stuffing to keep it huggable a teddy bear that wasnt soft he reasoned would lose half its appeal now what are you doing devereaux asked a little later brain surgery exacto in hand david nodded you might say so occurred to me this fellow might have big blinking eyes instead of the glass buttons he came with but if hes going to get them ive got to open up his head he used the knife to slice up hollow plastic balls and colored them with the pens in his shirt pocket they required another little motor this one inside the head jack devereaux clicked his tongue between his teeth at the result if i saw anything with eyes like that id run like hell its a prototype dammit goldfarb snapped it lets me know what i can do and what i cant the next one will be prettier he installed the infrared sensor in the furrys nose and some sound chips and a little speaker behind the mouth when he aimed an infrared beam at the revamped teddy bear it spoke in muddy tones here piss off hmm hal walsh said we may have to work on that just a bit everybody laughed then walsh asked do you suppose you can make it move its lips while it talks the same way it moves its eyes hadnt thought of that goldfarb answered i can try by the time were done with the bloody thing itll do everything but make tea he paused but maybe thats not so bad the more it can do the longer junior will take to get bored with it some more tinkering provided the furry with plastic lips carved from another ball they didnt move in a very lifelike way but they moved walsh nodded thats better or busier anyhow i think hes ugly as sin myself jack devereaux said david eyed him some people might say the same about you old chap the furrys a first try hell improve he didnt spell out the implications devereaux made a horrible face at him just the same mutilate another teddy bear would you david hal walsh said see if you can do a neater job on this one im going to get on the phone and talk with a couple of manufacturers i know and with an advertising agent too with something like this we want to make the biggest splash we possibly can right goldfarb said and got to work somewhat belatedly it occurred to him that he might have made more money had he developed this project on his own not under the auspices of the saskatchewan river widget works he shrugged as he slit open the belly of a second plush bear walsh hadnt had to hire him and had backed him up during his troubles with basil roundbush his boss deserved recompense for that and if the furries did even a quarter as well as the men of the widget works dreamt they would thered probably be plenty of money to go around walsh said i just called jane too she can come by and record some prettier phrases than the one you used there fair enough david answered jane archibalds voice wasnt so smashing as her looks but it was an improvement over his lower middle class east end london accent he was just affixing the second set of plastic lips when hal walshs fiancee came in the men from the widget works put both prototype furries through their paces janes eyes went wide every little girl in the world will want one she breathed and then if you have them saying things in a mans voice and maybe if they were different colors you could sell a lot to boys too i think i like that goldfarb said and scribbled a note the toy jobber who came to the widget works the next day also liked it he stared in astonished fascination at the second prototype furry by then the first one was safely out of sight oh yes he said once hed seen it put through its paces oh yes indeed i think well be able to move a great many of these provided the manufacturing costs arent too high here hal walsh handed him a sheet of paper this is my best estimate most of the parts are right off the shelf oh my the jobber said after glancing over it well i can see its going to be a great deal a very great deal of pleasure doing business with you gents david here gets the credit for this one walsh said he was sure enough a good man to work for he patted the furry on the head david gets the credit and with a little bit of luck we all rake in the cash reuven russie wondered when hed last been so nervous knocking on a door it had been a while he knew that when hed come here to look at the widow radofskys toe that had been business now he was coming to look at all of her and that was anything but how long had he been standing here long enough to start worrying hed been worrying since before he left home and the helpful advice from his twin sisters hadnt made things any better or easier had anybody inside here heard him should he knock again he was just about to when the door opened hello reuven mrs radofsky said hello deborah he answered at least as tentatively hed had to check the office records to find out her first name hello miriam he added to the widow radofskys daughter who clung to her mothers skirt miriam didnt answer she probably didnt like him much he was the fellow who gave her medicines that tasted nasty and shots this is my sister sarah deborah radofsky said nodding back toward a slightly younger woman who looked a lot like her shell watch miriam while were out hello reuven said weve spoken on the phone i think yes thats right doctor the widow radofskys sister said have a good time the two of you come here miriam reluctantly miriam came deborah radofsky stepped out onto the sidewalk shall we go yes lets reuven answered he cast about for what to say next and did find something how is your toe doing its getting better she replied its not quite right yet but it is getting better they walked on for a few paces the night was clear and cool it was also peaceful the muslims in jerusalem and in the near east generally had been calm of late for which reuven was very glad mrs radofsky also seemed to be looking for something more to say at last she asked where are we going for supper i had samuels in mind reuven replied have you been there the foods always pretty good yes i have she nodded but not since her voice trailed off not since my husband was alive that had to be what she wasnt saying would you rather go somewhere else reuven asked if eating there would make you unhappy no its all right the widow radofsky shook her head it wasnt a special place or anything like that its just that i havent been out to eat anywhere much since he died things have been tight especially with miriam reuven nodded samuels was only about four blocks away nothing in jerusalem was very far from anything else they had no trouble getting a table reuven ordered braised short ribs deborah radofsky chose stuffed cabbage he ordered a carafe of wine too after a glance at her to make sure she didnt mind the wine came before the food reuven raised his glass lchaim lchaim deborah echoed they both drank she set her glass down on the white linen of the tablecloth after a moment she said do you mind if i ask you something go ahead he answered her smile flickered as if uncertain whether to catch fire she said youre the son of an important man a famous man even youre a doctor yourself why havent you been married for years ah reuven had expected something like that if perhaps not quite so blunt but he liked her better for the bluntness not worse he said up till i left the medical college i was very busy too busy to think a whole lot about such things i was seeing somebody at the college for a while but she emigrated to canada as soon as she finished and i didnt want to leave palestine i have a cousin in the same town she moved to he says shes getting married soon oh the widow radofsky weighed his words how do you feel about that i hope shes happy reuven answered much more sincerely than not shes always done what she wanted to do and i dont think this will be any different he looked up here comes supper even if he didnt wish jane any ill whatsoever he didnt feel altogether comfortable talking about her with deborah radofsky she dug into her stuffed cabbage too for a while they were both too busy eating to talk then she found another disconcerting question how do you like taking out one of your patients fine so far he said giving back a deadpan stare hed learned from his father she didnt quite know what to make of that he could see as much after a sip of wine she asked do you do it often this makes once reuven said dead pan still he threw back a question of his own how do you like going out with your doctor this is the first time ive been out with anyone since joseph died mrs radofsky said i would be lying if i said it didnt feel a little strange it doesnt feel any more strange because youre my doctor if thats what you mean all right now reuven tried on a smile it fit his face better than hed thought it would i like your little girl that made deborah radofsky smile too im glad someone at the furniture store asked me to go out with him a few weeks ago but he changed his mind when he found out i have a child she stabbed the next bite of stuffed cabbage as if it were her coworker thats foolishness reuven said life isnt neat and simple all the time i used to think it was a lot simpler back when i was still going to the medical college the more real practice i see though the more complicated things look life is never simple the widow radofsky spoke with great conviction you find that out the minute you have a baby and then joseph went off to work one morning and the riots started and he didnt come home and two days after that we had a funeral no life is never simple what did he do reuven asked quietly he was a lathe operator she answered he was a good one too he worked hard and he was going places his boss thought so too and then he wasnt any more she emptied her wineglass in a hurry when reuven held up the carafe she nodded he filled her glass again then poured some more wine for himself too as they finished supper he asked would you like to go see that new film well new here anyhow about gingersmuggling in marseille im more interested than i would be otherwise because my cousin the one whos in canada now got forced into dealing ginger there when he was in the raf vey iz mir deborah radofsky exclaimed how did that happen his superior was in the business in a big way and david was a jew which meant he had a hard time saying no unless he wanted worse things to happen to him reuven answered of course the nazis arrested him and its hard to get a whole lot worse off than that my father got the race to pull strings to get him out lucky for him your father could she said and then after a moment marseilles one of the places that got bombed isnt it reuven nodded the film was made before the fighting obviously otherwise thered be nothing but ruins its supposed to have some spectacular car chases too ill come deborah radofsky said miriam wont give sarah too hard a time shell go to sleep and my sister can look at the television or find something to read oh good whether it was too much trouble for her sister would have been reuvens next question the theater wasnt far either it was the one reuven and jane archibald had come to on the night they first made love he glanced over at the widow radofsky he didnt think theyd be sharing a bed tonight he shrugged hed known jane a long time before they became lovers he wasnt going to worry about hurrying things here youve got about fifteen minutes to wait before this show lets out the tickerseller told him as he laid down his money thats not bad deborah radofsky said reuven nodded they went into the lobby reuven got them both some garbanzo beans fried in olive oil and glasses of cocacola they were just wiping their hands when people started coming out of the film reuven heard arabic hebrew yiddish and something that might have been either russian or polish the film would be subtitled in the first two languages the dialogue he knew was mostly in english and then to his surprise a couple of lizards came out they were chattering away in their own tongue what were they sayingmrs radofsky asked they were wondering how much of the story was true and how much was made up reuven answered what im wondering is whether they were from security or if they were ginger smugglers themselves one or the other id bet i wish id got a better look at their body paint if they were in security wouldnt they be smart to wear body paint that said they werent she remarked mm youre probably right reuven said come on lets go in and grab the best seats we can the film wasnt one for the ages but it wasnt bad either and the chase scenes were at least as spectacular as advertised reuven had no trouble following the english it was the most widely used human language at the moishe russie medical college he saw the widow radofskys eyes drifting down to the bottom of the screen to read the hebrew subtitles after the last explosion after the policeman hero collared the villains the lights came up reuven and deborah radofsky rose and headed for the exit theyd just got out into the lobby again when he took her hand he wondered what shed do what shed say she gave him a brief startled look then squeezed his hand a little as if to let him know it was all right i hope you had a good time he said as they neared her house i did if she sounded a little surprised at herself he could pretend he didnt notice and he might have been wrong hoping he was he asked would you like to do it again before too long yes id like that a lot i think the widow radofsky said she smiled up at him as they got to her front door good reuven said so would i he embraced her not too tightly and brushed his lips across hers then he stepped back waiting to see what shed do about that to his relief she was still smiling she took keys from her handbag and opened the door good night reuven she said good night deborah he answered and turned to go he hoped shed call him back to come inside with her she didnt she closed the door he heard the latch click with a shrug he headed home hed had a good time too maybe it would be even better when they went out again in the encampment outside the little town of kanth gorppet waited and worried every day that went by without the explosivemetal bombs going off was something of a triumph but no guarantee the accursed thing wouldnt detonate the next day or for that matter the next instant and one of the things he worried about was that the encampment might not be far enough outside kanth if the bomb went up he was too likely to go up with it can we do nothing to rout out these tosevitesnesseref asked him can we do nothing to make them release my friend gorppet had asked her to come to kanth precisely because she was mordechai anielewiczs friend now he wondered if that didnt make her more annoyance than asset trying to keep sarcasm out of his voice he said i am open to suggestions shuttlecraft pilot have we yet tried negotiating with these jewish big uglies the female said before gorppet could speak she answered her own question we have not that is a truth gorppet agreed the next sign of willingness they show for negotiations will be the first perhaps we should not wait for them to show signs perhaps we should seek negotiations ourselves nesseref waggled an eye turret at him perhaps you should seek negotiations yourself you can afford failure here even less than the race can with deliberate rudeness gorppet turned both eye turrets away from her unfortunately that he was rude didnt mean she was wrong if the race succeeded here and especially if the race succeeded because of his efforts hozzanet might have enough pull to set that in the balance against his ginger dealings down in south africa if not if not he was going to spend the rest of his days in some very unpleasant places nesseref said maybe you could use that deutsch big ugly that drucker as a gobetween i know he is acquainted with anielewicz and tosevites know one another better than we can hope to know them no gorppet not only used the negative gesture he added an emphatic cough remember the big uglies with the bomb are jews they would be more inclined to listen to one of us than to a deutsch male ah well no doubt you are right in that case maybe one of us ought to go and talk with them nesseref said as things stand i do not see how that could hurt do you not gorppet said in hollow tones he could see all too well how it might hurt bullets knives blunt instruments whatever other tools for torture tosevite ingenuity always too fertile in such areas might devise but nesseref also had a point something needed doing the longer the race and the deutsche waited the more things that could go wrong even more to the point as far as gorppet was concerned the longer the race waited the more likely the disciplinarians were to seize him and take him away concluding he was not helping in the present situation and so without enthusiasm but also without anything he saw as choice he approached hozzanet the next morning and said superior sir if you need someone to approach the house where the tosevite terrorists are staying i volunteer for the duty i am not sure we need anything of the sort hozzanet replied anyone we offer to these big uglies would likely be seized as a hostage as mordechai anielewicz was i understand that superior sir gorppet said i am willing to take the chance you will understand why i am willing to take the chance more than any other male of the race here at the moment i am expendable no male is expendable hozzanet said do you hope that you will be a hero if you succeed where few males would even have tried and that that will be weighed against your present difficulties yes superior sir that is exactly what i hope gorppet answered well it could be that you are right hozzanet admitted of course it could also be that the big uglies will torment you or kill you in which case you will gain nothing and lose that which is irreplaceable believe me superior sir i understand this is a gamble gorppet said it is i repeat one i am willing to make i cannot give you permission for such a rash act myself hozzanet said i shall have to consult with my superiors gorppet made the affirmative gesture go ahead superior sir i hope they decide quickly would you not agree that we may not have much time hozzanet didnt say whether he agreed or disagreed he just waved gorppet away and began making telephone calls later that day he summoned gorppet back into his presence not sounding particularly happy he spoke formally very well smallunit group leader you are authorized to pursue negotiations with the big uglies at whatever level of intimacy proves necessary he twisted an eye turret in a particular way try not to get killed while you are doing all this i thank you superior sir gorppet said it shall be done wait hozzanet told him it shall not be done quite yet we are going to make you a little more useful first and so when gorppet approached the house in kanth from which mordechai anielewicz hadnt returned he wore several small listening devices glued to his scales they were covered with false skin to make them as difficult as possible for the big uglies to detect of course he thought as he walked up to the house they could just shoot me now in which case my superiors back at the encampment will hear nothing useful but no shots rang out he looked for a speaker by the door with which he could announce himself the house boasted no such amenity few tosevite houses did lacking anything better to do he knocked on the door the big uglies inside had to know he was there they could surely see he carried no weapon why wouldnt they let him in if nothing else he gave them another hostage they wouldnt know that a good many members of the race everybody who particularly hated ginger wouldnt be sorry to see him dead but no one came to the door would he have to leave emptyhanded he didnt intend to do any such thing he knocked again i come in peace he called in his own language he could have said the same thing in arabic but no one in this part of tosev used that tongue he knew none of the languages the deutsche and the jews spoke at last the door did open though not very wide a big ugly gestured with an assault rifle come inside gorppet obeyed hed come here to do nothing less the door slammed shut behind him i greet you he said as if hed come on a friendly visit do you understand my language no not a word the big ugly answered in the language of the race it could have been funny had the tosevite not been carrying that rifle and had he not been so plainly ready to use it as things were gorppet said i thank you for letting me come in here with a shrug the tosevite said you came to this house we can hold you here you cannot give us any trouble as you still hold mordechai anielewicz gorppet pronounced the name so alien to him with great care he did not want to be misunderstood and he was not with a nod the jewish big ugly answered yes we hold him that is a truth but you will have nothing to do with him nothing do you understand me you two shall not plot together i know you are our enemies i have fought side by side with males of your superstition and gorppet began it is not a superstition the tosevite snapped it is truth we disagree gorppet said wondering if that would get him shot the next instant but as i say i have fought side by side with jewish tosevites against the deutsche mordechai anielewicz has led you how can you say that we are your enemies because it is a truth the big ugly said now you of the race and the deutsche work together against us you do not want us to have the vengeance we deserve we do not want another round of fighting under any circumstances gorppet said what good could it do go down these stairs the jewish tosevite said gorppet went the big ugly stayed far enough behind him that he couldnt hope to whirl and seize the rifle he didnt intend to try any such thing but his captor couldnt know that and took no chances the big ugly resumed destroying the deutsche is worthwhile for its own sake if you set off this bomb you will not only be destroying the deutsche gorppet said do you not see that you also put the race at risk and your fellow jews in poland destroying the deutsche is all that matters to us the tosevite said implacably he pointed to a door go in there gorppet opened the door the chamber inside was small and dark before going in he said you would also destroy yourselves of course of course his captor agreed with chilling calm do you know the story of masada no gorppet made the negative gesture who is masada masada is not a person masada is was a place a fortress the big ugly answerednineteen hundred years ago we jews rose up against the romans who oppressed us they had more soldiers they beat us masada was our last fortress they put soldiers around it they demanded that we surrender and gorppet asked as he was obviously intended to do a melancholy pride in his voice that gorppet could not mistake the jew said all the soldiers in masada almost a thousand of them killed themselves instead of giving up to the romans we can do that again here we are proud to do that again here gorppet had seen plenty of muslim tosevites willing to die if in dying they could carry out their goal of harming the race big uglies who did not care whether they lived or died were the greatest problem the race faced because they were so hard to defend against gorppet said if you harm your own males and females more than you harm the deutsche what have you accomplished harm to the deutsche the tosevite said revenge for all they have done to us we need nothing more he was impervious to reason that was the most frightening thing about him gorppet tried again nonetheless but harm will also come to those you care about we shall punish the deutsche yes the big ugly was impenetrable he gestured with his rifle go inside you will not listen to me gorppet protested i did not ask you to come here i did not say i would listen to you if you did why should i listen to you you will only tell me lies the tosevite gestured with the rifle barrel again go inside i tell you or you will never go anywhere again despair in his liver gorppet went the big ugly closed the door the lock clicked gorppet found himself in almost total blackness only the tiniest bit of light leaked under the bottom of the door he had to explore by touch he found nothing but a pad that might do for a sleeping mat and a metal pot he presumed he was to use for his excrement should have let myself go to prison he thought anything would be better than this oddly johannes drucker hadnt hated the lizards while fighting two wars against them hed been a professional theyd been professionals both sides had just been doing their jobs had the lizards felt otherwise they would have killed him after his attack on their starship now though he hated them hed hated gunther grillparzer for trying to blackmail him too hed been able to do something about grillparzer who he heartily hoped was dead and he hated the lizards for blackmailing him the trouble was he couldnt do anything about them he peered through zeiss binoculars at the house in kanth where the jews had holed up with the explosivemetal bomb an artillery shell or a conventional bomb from a divebomber might kill all of them before they could detonate the weapon theyd stolen if it did the crisis would be over might if those words didnt carry a lot of punch not till you measured them against the risk if the shells if the bombs didnt do the trick in that case kanth and a good deal of the surrounding countryside would go up in radioactive fire the jews would have a measure of revenge on the reich and who could guess what would happen next he even understood why the jews holed up in kanth wanted their revenge before the gestapo hauled kathe away he didnt think he would have he hadnt seen jews as people till then only as enemies of the reich but considering what he felt toward the goddamn blackshirts why shouldnt they feel the same way only more so sure as hell germany had given them reason enough and mordechai anielewicz hadnt been anything but a husband and father trying to find his family the same as drucker himself had been doing christ each of them had even named a son after the same man yes jews were people no matter what the ss said but drucker hated anielewicz anyhow not for himself but because through the jew the lizards had been able to ensnare him if they told his superiors what they knew he wouldnt be able to protect kathe any more he also hated gorppet and hoped the jews had cut the miserable lizards throat for all he knew they might have gorppet had gone into that house but he hadnt come out any more than anielewicz had despite his loathing of the race drucker found himself having to work through and with the lizards he couldnt very well approach that house in kanth himself not in his fancy new major generals uniform that would be all the jewish terrorists needed theyd set off their bomb just for the fun of blowing up a highranking nazi hell in their shoes he would have done the same thing since he couldnt approach the jews he went into the tent where gorppets superior a male named hozzanet was still working another lizard was talking with hozzanet one whose style of body paint he recognized i greet you shuttlecraft pilot he said talking with that one was bound to be more interesting than talking with the male from security the lizard to whom hed spoken swung a startled eye turret in his direction and asked how is it that you know what my body paint means i have also flown in space as pilot of the upper stage of an a drucker answered i tried to destroy one of your starships but i did not quite succeed since he did not think he had met the pilot before he also gave his name to his surprise the lizard said oh i remember you i was the shuttlecraft pilot who flew you back to nuremberg after you were released from captivity i am nesseref are you drucker said and knew that sounded foolish as soon as it came out of his mouth we have a saying in my language small world is it not so it would seem nesseref said it is small enough i am given to understand that we share mordechai anielewicz as a friend as an acquaintance at any rate drucker said though he wondered why he bothered splitting hairs his acquaintanceship with the jew was close enough to let the lizards squeeze him because of it if that didnt make it friendship it came close enough he asked and how did you become acquainted with anielewicz my home is in poland the lizard answered he no she drucker recalled went on we met quite by chance but found we liked each other that is how any friendship between two individuals begins is it not a truth i suppose so drucker said the question now is what can we do to help him stop the terrorists from setting off that bomb truth nesseref said and hozzanet echoed her the male from security went on i know that your government now perceives we were not responsible for allowing the terrorists to enter the reich with this bomb we did not give it to them in fact as you will recall it is of deutsch manufacture but drucker shook his head walter dornberger had given him specific instructions on this point the jews are your puppets you let them keep the bomb for all those years if they use it against us we shall hold you responsible for that act of war against the reich you would fight us again hozzanet demanded you truly would in view of what happened the last time i can only tell you what my fiihrer tells me drucker answered we are an independent notempire even now and you may not treat us as if we were of no account if you fight us again you shall be of no account hozzanet said can you not see that whatever you try to do to us we shall do to you tenfold back during the second world war before the lizards came the germans had always said they would punish their foes ten times harder than they were hurt hearing that phrase aimed at the reich made drucker wince especially since he knew the lizards could so readily carry out their threat nevertheless he spoke as hed been ordered to speak but we will also hurt you again you know we can how soon will you be weaker than the americans and the russians he knew a good deal about lizards he didnt watch hozzanets face he watched the tip of the lizards stumpy little tail sure enough it quivered that meant hozzanet was upset the male made a good game effort not to show it though saying first the reich does not have the power to do that to us second regardless of any other concerns none of you deutsche would be here to learn the answer to that question dornberger had foretold that he would say something like that the former engineer and commandant at peenemunde was shaping as an effective fiihrer as effective as he could be in a crippled reich just as in a wellplanned chess opening drucker had the next move waiting do you think we are unprepared to sacrifice ourselves now so that tosevites triumph in the end hozzanets tailstump quivered again but the lizard said to be perfectly frank yes that is exactly what i think you big uglies are very seldom able to think or plan for the long term why should this occasion be any different he had a point drucker did his best not to acknowledge it saying precisely because we have so little to lose any individuals life is a lot to lose nesseref put in no one can lose anything more important that was sensible drucker somehow wasnt surprised anyone who flew into space had to have good sense otherwise you ended up dead before you got the chance to gain much experience hozzanet said let me see if i understand something the reich is interested in attacking this house in kanth to attempt to put the jewish tosevites out of action before they can detonate the bomb that is a truth drucker agreed but if you try this attack and fail so that the bomb detonates you will blame the race the lizard persisted that is also a truth drucker said how can both these things be true at once hozzanet demanded how can you blame us if your assault fails because we should not even have to consider the possibility of making an assault drucker answered because these tosevites had no business having a bomb in the first place let alone smuggling it into the reich that they had it and that they could smuggle it are both the fault of the race whose fault is it that these tosevites hate the reich so much hozzanet said whose fault is it that poland was attacked which created the chaos that let them move the bomb both these things are the fault of the reich he was probably right about that no he was certainly right about that but drucker said i have stated the fuhrers views on the matter so you have hozzanet said sourly the races view is that they are foolish and irresponsible the races view is also that if you will blame us for the failure you shall not be allowed to make the attempt i protest in the name of my government drucker said protest all you please hozzanet replied i tell you this thing shall not be done he added an emphatic cough i tell you also that if your government launches combat aircraft we shall do everything in our power to shoot them down before they can attack kanth what you are saying then is that the reich is depending on a male of the race and a jew to save it from this explosivemetal bomb drucker said before either lizard could speak he held up a hand to show he hadnt finished i have seen that not everything my government has said about the jews is true but anielewicz has reason to hate us not to wish us well when gorppet called him anielewicz could have let these other jewish tosevites detonate their bomb and punish the reichhozzanet said he did not he came here to try to stop them you should remember that by the nature of things hozzanet couldnt know about the parable that spoke of the pharisee who passed on the other side of the road and the good samaritan who stopped to help a man in need even without knowing it though he got the message across and just in case he hadnt nesseref drove it home these other jews the ones with the bomb hate the reich more than mordechai anielewicz does if that were not true he would not have come here at all drucker suspected anielewicz worried more about further damage to poland than about damage to the reich in anielewiczs place he suspected he would have felt the same way but that didnt make the lizards wrong with a stiff nod drucker said i shall report your words to the fuhrer he went back to the german encampment alongside that of the race and telephoned walter dornberger after hed given his old commander the meat of the conversation with the two lizards dornberger let out a long sigh what youre telling me hans the fiihrersaid is that we have to rely on this jew theres more irony in that than i really want to stomach i understand sir i feel the same way pretty much drucker replied but i dont think anielewicz will leave kanth alive without getting those terrorists to give up their bomb the lizards seem sure hell do everything he can he didnt want to let dornberger know he knew the jew well enough to have his own opinion but will it be enough dornberger demanded right now sir we can only hope drucker said he also suspected he hoped even more urgently than the ft rerdid walter dornberger after all was back in flensburg he wouldnt turn to radioactive dust if something went wrong here in kanth but i will drucker thought dammit i will there were mordechai anielewicz thought nine jews holed up with the explosivemetal bomb that was enough to let them have plenty of guards for him for any other captives they might have and for the bomb itself in the end though the probably nine boiled down to only one the jews leader a fellow named benjamin rubin mordechai knew that if he could reach rubin everything else would follow but could he reach him for a long time rubin hadnt even wanted to talk to him nobodyd wanted to talk to him he counted himself lucky that the jews hadnt just shot him and tossed his body out on the porch as a warning to anyone else rash enough to think about talking to them at first hed thought they were going to do exactly that nobody called him anything but traitor till hed been there for several days finally that made him lose his temper i fought the nazis before most of you mamzrim were born he snapped at one of the triggerhappy young jews who reluctantly came in pairs to bring him food i killed otto skorzeny and kept him from blowing up lodz with the bomb youre sitting on now and you call me a traitor ge kak afen yam that could have got him shot too instead it got him what hed hoped it might a chance to talk with benjamin rubin he didnt know rubin well the fellow hadnt been any kind of bigwig till he hijacked the bomb but he was now one of the toughs who followed him led mordechai into his presence as if into that of a rabbi renowned for his holiness rubin didnt look like a rabbi he looked like a doctor he was thin and pale and precise about as far removed as possible from the ruffians he led so you want to convince me im wrong do you he said and folded his arms across his chest go ahead im waiting i dont think i need to convince you anielewicz said i think you see it too the way it looks to me you just dont want to admit it to yourself benjamin rubin scowled youd better come to the point in a hurry or ill decide you havent got one fair enough mordechai hoped he sounded more cheerful than he felt he was doing his best suppose you blow up kanth what have you got a few thousand germans at the outside i wouldnt bet on even that many though theyre sneaking away every chance they get hardly seems worthwhile for an explosivemetal bomb we were heading for dresden rubin said petulantly the truck kept breaking down thats how we ended up here too bad now anielewicz did his best to simulate sympathy but you could do things in and to dresden you cant even think about here maybe but weve still got the bomb and we can still do plenty with it even if its not so much as we hoped rubin nodded as if reassuring himself i can die happy knowing what ive done to the damned nazis and what will the damned nazis do once youre dead mordechai asked theyll hit back with whatever theyve got left thats what how many jews in poland are going to die on account of your stupidity none replied the jewish leader whod stolen the bomb not a single one the germans know what will happen to them if they try anything like that again anielewicz laughed in his face rubin looked astounded none of his henchmen would have done anything so rude maybe having henchmen hed forgotten there were people who didnt think so well of him mordechai said youre here youre willing to die to take revenge on the nazis you think there wont be plenty of nazis willing to die to take revenge on a pack of kikes he used the slur deliberately to rock rubin back on his heels the other jew said theyd never have the nerve that only made mordechai laugh some more you can call the nazis all sorts of things rubin i do every day but youre an even bigger idiot than i think you are if you think they dont know how to die well dying well is half of what fascism is all about for gods sake and how do you know so much about it youve been in bed with them thats how rubin said yes and thats a load of shit too mordechai said anybody whos not blind can see as much one of the bully boys whod brought him in to benjamin rubin tapped him on the shoulder when he turned the fellow hit him in the belly and then in the face he folded up and sank to the floor he tasted blood in his mouth but none of his teeth seemed broken when he ran his tongue over them somehow that mattered very much to him if by some accident he came through this alive he didnt care to spend any time sitting in a dentists chair slowly painfully he got to his feet what he wanted to do was kill the bastard whod slugged him but he couldnt not when said bastards pal was pointing a rifle at his chest that being so he didnt even waste time glaring at the bully boys instead he turned back toward rubin if you dont want to listen to me you dont have to if you want your bully boys here to pound on me they can do that thats what i bought when i came through the door but it doesnt mean im not telling you the truth even so maybe you call it that rubin said i dont i call it a pack of lies and foolishness id sooner go out like samson in the temple ive noticed mordechai answered hed also noticed that unlike samson rubin and his pals hadnt killed themselves as soon as they got in trouble he didnt say anything about that not wanting to goad them into anything instead he went on youre like samson one way you dont worry about whatll happen to the rest of the jews once youre gone theyll get by benjamin rubin said they always have and well punish the nazis for all theyve done to us anielewicz sighed you keep saying that i keep telling you to look out the windows here you just wont do them all that much harm rubin glowered at him i dont have to listen to this i dont have to and i dont intend to he nodded to his henchmen take him away come on pal said the fellow whod slugged anielewicz you heard the boss get moving with a rifle pointed at him mordechai had no choice the boss he thought as they led him away why dont they just call him the fuhrer its only one step up he didnt say that he judged it too likely to get him killed when the bully boys got him back to the basement room where they kept him on ice they slammed the door behind him with needless violence maybe they hoped the bang would make him jump it did a little but they didnt have the satisfaction of seeing as much nobody could have seen much in that room it had no lamps and no windows he got colossally bored when they parked him there he didnt know how long at a time they left him in cold storage he did know or thought he knew that he spent inordinate stretches of time asleep he had nothing better to do no matter how much he slept though he always felt logy not wellrested he tried the door every so often when he was awake it never yielded had he been the hero of an adventure novel or film he would have been able to pick the lock either that or to break down the door without making a sound being only an ordinary fellow he remained stuck where the terrorists had stowed him a couple of times he heard them speaking the language of the race and a lizard answering them they didnt mention to him who the lizard was he hoped it wasnt nesseref enough that he was in trouble without dragging his friend in with him he also hoped it wasnt gorppet if the male from security hadnt taken in heinrichs beffel he never would have found his family again he owed the lizard too much to want him endangered but he didnt know he never got the chance to find out the terrorists efficiently kept him and the lizard whoever it was from having anything to do with each other in their place he would have done the same that didnt keep him from wishing theyd proved less professional and then it couldnt have been more than a couple of hours after hed reluctantly admired their professionalism they all started screaming at one another it was like listening to a horrible family row but everybody in this family packed an assault rifle and the explosive metal bomb sat only a few meters away a family row here could have extravagantly lethal consequences at last silence fell nobodyd shot anybody not so far as mordechai could tell but he hadnt the faintest idea what had happened he hadnt been able to make out the words or why theyd started screaming at one another in the first place either all he could do was sit there in the darkness and wonder and wait instead of waiting he fell asleep he didnt think hed been asleep very long when the door flew open one of the bully boys shined a flashlight in his face another one growled come on youre going to see the boss am i anielewicz yawned and rose and did as he was told he was still yawning when the two toughs escorted him into benjamin rubins presence rubin didnt beat around the bush is it true that if we surrender we can surrender to the lizards and not the damned nazis and theres supposed to be a safeconduct out of here and a pardon afterwards is that true or isnt it yes its true mordechai answered more than a little dazed does it matter it matters rubin said bleakly on those terms we give up he took a pistol off his belt and handed it to anielewicz here this is yours now two more of his followers brought in the lizard mordechai had heard it wasnt nesseref he would have recognized her body paint i greet you he said are you gorppet when the lizard made the affirmative gesture anielewicz went on they are surrendering to the race in exchange for safeconduct and pardon will you go make the arrangements for picking them up and getting them out of the reich it shall be done gorppet answered and you have no idea how glad i am that it shall be done oh i might anielewicz said one of the jews who followed rubin led the lizard toward the front door it opened then closed again rubin said im counting on the race to keep its promises its a good bet mordechai said theyre better about things like that than we are he raised an eyebrow what made you change your mind at last what do you think benjamin rubin said bitterly we tried to touch off the damned bomb and it wouldnt work he looked as if he hated anielewicz these past twenty years i thought you were taking care of it so did i mordechai said but do you know what ive never been so happy in all my life to find out i was wrong well there is one crisis solved atvar spoke in considerable relief solved without casualties too i might add that is such a pleasant novelty i would not mind seeing it occur more often i understand exalted fleetlord pshing said i hope such proves to be the case so do i atvar used an emphatic cough so much time on tosev however had turned him from an optimist to a realist if not to an outright cynic i would not bet anything i could not afford to lose given the present sorry situation on too much of tosev and indeed throughout too much of this solar system my larger bet would too likely prove doomed to disappointment his adjutant made the affirmative gesture i understand he repeated shall we now proceed to the rest of the daily report i suppose so atvar replied i am sure i will not like it nearly so well as the news from the reich next on the agenda was the latest news on the fighting in china atvar promptly proved himself right he didnt like it nearly so well as hed liked the news from the reich from somewhere or other the chinese rebels had come up with revoltingly large quantities of deutsch antilandcruiser rockets and antiaircraft missiles the fleetlord had a strong suspicion where somewhere orof erwas the sssr with a long land border with china seemed a far more likely candidate than the distant shattered reich but he couldnt prove anything there the races best efforts to do so notwithstanding and the sssr unfortunately was able to do too much damage to make welcome a confrontation without secure proof of wrongdoing molotov the sssrs notemperor had made his willingness to fight very clear one thing atvar said after reading the latest digest of action reports from china fleetlord reffet can no longer object to recruiting members of the colonization fleet to help defend the race a few more campaigns like the one now under way there and we will not have enough males from the conquest fleet left to give us an armed force of the size and strength we require on this world as a matter of fact exalted fleetlord fleetlord reffet is still objecting pshing said if you will see item five of the agenda i shall do no such thing not now atvar said reffet is welcome to hiss and cough and snarl as much as he likes he has no authority to do anything more if he tries to do anything more than object if for example he tries to obstruct he will learn at first hand just how significant military power can be he relished the thought of sending a couple of squads of battlehardened infantrymales to seize reffet and force him to see reason when it was aimed at him from the barrel of a rifle if the fleetlord of the colonization fleet provoked him enough he just might do it so he told himself at any rate would he ever really have the nerve maybe not but thinking about it was sweet he needed a few sweet thoughts for the next agenda item was no more satisfactory than the one pertaining to china the american big uglies were going right ahead with their plan to turn small asteroids into missiles aimed at tosev probes had found several new distant rocks to which theyd fitted motors and analysts were warning in loud and strident tones that they were sure they hadnt found them all spirits of emperors past turn their backs on the americans atvar muttered he swung an eye turret toward pshing our analysts believe the americans will resist with force if we try to destroy these installations even if no big uglies are presently aboard them what is your view exalted fleetlord it might have been better had we not threatened them with war if they attacked our automated probes out in the asteroid belt his adjutant replied now they can reverse that precedent and hit us in the snout with it no doubt you are right about that atvar said unhappily but i am more concerned with practical aspects than with legalistic ones here if we ignore the precedent and resort to force will they respond in kind by every indication from henry cabot lodge they will pshing said do we wish to ignore the express statements of their ambassador can we afford to ignore those statements if we ignore them and find we were mistaken how expensive and how embarrassing will that prove those are all good questions atvar admittedthey are in fact the very questions i have been asking myself i wish i liked the answers i find for them better than i do and i also understand that pshing said the more technically capable the big uglies become the more difficult in other ways they also become and the more unpredictably difficult too atvar swung both eye turrets toward the monitor why are so many american and canadian manufacturing companies suddenly ordering large quantities of a particular small servomotor from us to what nefarious purpose will they put the device i saw that item exalted fleetlord and checked with our security personnel pshing said the stated reason is this motor will be the central unit in a toy for tosevite hatchlings yes that is the stated reason atvar bore down heavily on the word but what true reason lurks behind it here i believe none pshing spoke to the monitor which yielded atvar a view of a goggleeyed fuzzy object that looked like a cross between a big ugly and some of the large wild beasts of tosev this thing is called i believe a hairy by the excitement with which the tosevites speak of it it is already remarkably popular and seems on the way to becoming more so madness atvar said with great conviction utter madness and an utter waste of good servomotors too better they should go to fripperies than to devices that truly would trouble us pshing said well that is a truth and i can hardly deny it atvar looked at the next item on the agenda it involved talking with reffet about recruiting males and females from the colonization fleet reffet is a nuisance and i can hardly deny that either go call him pshing perhaps the shock will make him fall over dead i can hope as much at any rate it shall be done exalted fleetlord atvars adjutant said and went off to do it reffet remained among those breathing atvar had known his untimely demise was too much to hope for i greet you atvar said when his opposite numbers image appeared in the monitor hed given up trying to be friendly to reffet perhaps he could still manage businesslike have you seen the latest casualty figures from my males trying to put down the chinese revolt they are unfortunate yes reffet answered this planet should never have cost so much to pacify if you know how to make the big uglies ignorant perhaps you will tell me atvar said since we must deal with them as they are though perhaps you will draw the obvious conclusion and stop obstructing what needs to be done more earnestly than atvar had expected reffet said do you not yet grasp how alien this world is to me indeed to all the colonization fleet do you think we imagined independent tosevite notempires spacefaring big uglies armed with explosivemetal bombs when we set out from home do you think we imagined how disrupted our carefully planned economy would become when we discovered that the tosevites were already doing so much of the manufacturing we had expected to have to do ourselves do you think we dreamt of the staggering effect ginger would have on our whole society can you truthfully say you looked for any of these things before going into cold sleep i looked for not a one of them i have never claimed otherwise atvar replied but what i and what the conquest fleet as a whole have tried to do is adapt to these things not pretend they do not exist that pretense is what we see too often from the colonization fleet and what infuriates and addles us how long did you take before you began to adapt reffet asked if you tell me you did it all at once i shall not believe you no we did not do it all at once atvar said relieved to find reffet so reasonable but because we were so outnumbered we could not pretend that the big uglies are in fact what we wish they were an attitude we have seen too often among you colonists sooner or later we shall grow old and die off sooner or later you will have to defend yourselves such is life on tosev like it or not until such time as this planet is fully assimilated into the empire if that day ever comes we shall have to maintain our strength because the wild big uglies assuredly will maintain theirs reffet sighed it could be that you are right i do not say that it is but it could be but if it is this world will be a longlasting anomaly within the empire with a permanent soldiers time and with the disruptions springing from ginger if you think i like or approve of this you are mistaken if you think i am incapable of dealing with it however you are also mistaken do you know what atvar said without waiting for a reply he went on i have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting that reffet on that basis i think we can get along well enough i certainly hope we can at any rate atvar knew he sounded surprised as well as pleased so did reffet i also hope so atvar let us make the effort shall we agreed atvar said at once after he broke the connection he stared at the monitor in astonished delight maybe we really can work together he thought never would have believed it but maybe we really can and maybe just maybe a stranger thought yet reffet is not an idiot after all who would have imagined that a moment later pshings face appeared on the monitor his adjutant said exalted fleetbord you have a call from senior researcher ttomalss will you speak to him yes put him through atvar said and then as he and ttomalss saw each other i greet you senior researcher and i greet you exalted fleetlord ttomalss said as you will know i have been examining the ways in which the big uglies administered their own relatively successful empires in the hope that we might learn from their history in this effort the empire administered by the big uglies called romans has proved perhaps the most instructive all right then atvar said how did these romans administer their empire and how might we imitate their example their most important virtue i think was flexibility ttomalss replied they treated areas differently depending on their previous level of civilization and on how well pacified they were they had several grades of citizenship with gradually increasing amounts of privilege until finally the inhabitants of a conquered region became legal equal to longtime citizens of their empire and they did their best to acculturate and assimilate new regions into the broader fabric of their empire these sound as if they may be ideas we can use atvar said the concept of multiple grades of citizenship strikes me as particularly intriguing and as being worth further exploration please prepare a more detailed report and send it to me for consideration and possible action it shall be done exalted fleetlord ttomalss said i thank you on the contrary senior researcher i may be the one who should thank you atvar said after ttomalss was off the line atvar made the affirmative gesture maybe just maybe the race would find ways to incorporate tosev into the empire after all liu han sat behind a table on a dais a disorderly crowd of city folk and soldiers of the peoples liberation army filled the hall here and there braziers had been lit but they did little to fight the chilly wind that howled in through shattered windows liu han brought her hand down sharply on the tabletop the noise cut through the babbling of the crowd people looked her way that was what she wanted we are ready to bring in the next defendant she told the soldiers nearest the table his name is she glanced down at a list ma haiteh yes comrade their leader said then he bawled out ma haitehs name at the top of his lungs more soldiers dragged a man through the crowd till he stood in front of the dais he wore a frightened expression and the filthy torn remains of a westernstyle business suit his hands were bound behind him you are ma haiteh liu han asked him yes comrade he answered meekly i want to say that i am innocent of the charges brought against me and i can prove it he spoke like an educated man and only an educated man was likely to have or to want westernstyle clothes you dont even know what those charges are liu han pointed out whatever they are i am innocent ma replied i have done nothing wrong so i cannot possibly be guilty did you serve as a clerk for the little scaly devils while they ruled peking liu han asked did you help them rule peking in other words i moved papers from one folder to another from one filing cabinet to another ma haiteh said that is all i did the papers were school records nothing more nothing in them could possibly have harmed anyone liu han nodded ma looked relieved that was a mistake and would doubtless prove his last now she wouldnt even have to bother calling witnesses to confirm that he had been a clerk for the scaly devils she said you have confessed to counterrevolutionary activity and to being a running dog of the little scaly imperialists there is only one penalty for this death soldiers of the peoples liberation army take him away and carry out the sentence ma haiteh stared at her as if he couldnt believe his ears he hadnt understood what sort of trial this was and he would never get a chance to improve his understanding but i am innocent he wailed as the boredlooking soldiers dragged him off a minute later a volley of gunfire outside cut off his protests liu han looked at the list again next case she said one ku chenglun unlike the luckless naive ma ku chenglun labored under no illusions about the sort of proceeding in which he found himself as soon as he had given his name he said comrade i used my clerical position to make as many errors as i could and to sabotage the little scaly devils every way i could i suppose you have some proof of this liu hans voice was dry she supposed no such thing shed listened to a lot of running dogs and lackeys trying to justify their treason to mankind shed heard a lot of lies but to her astonishment ku whose hands were also bound turned to his guards and said please take the paper from my shirt pocket here and give it to the judge when a soldier did so the clerk went on comrade this is a reprimand from my supervisor warning me not to make so many mistakes and saying i put his whole department in danger because i did but i kept right on because i hate the little devils i will look at this paper liu han unfolded it and rapidly read through it it was what the prisoner said it was and was even written on the stationery of the ministry of public works had he written it to protect himself after the scaly devils were expelled from peking had his boss written it because he was nothing but a lazy goodfornothing or was he really a patriot and a saboteur as he claimed he spoke now with unhesitating pride i am not a traitor i have never done anything but fight for freedom even if i did not have a rifle in my hands i suppose that is possible liu han said as great an admission as shed made in any of these summary trials she scratched the side of her jaw considering after half a minute or so she said i sentence you to hard labor building roads or entrenchments or whatever else may be required of you thank you comrade ku chenglun exclaimed hard labor was hard labor his overseers might well end up working him to death he probably knew that too he seemed very well informed but to come through one of these trials without getting executed was something close to a miracle ku had to be aware of that sure enough liu han sent the next man brought before her to the firing squad and the one after him and the one after him as well revolutionary justice ruled in peking now the little scaly devils had held sway for a generation traitors and collaborators and running dogs by the thousands by the tens of thousands needed to be hunted down and purged the fourth man after ku chenglun claimed to be in the service of the kuomintang that presented liu han with another dilemma the kuomintang had risen along with the peoples liberation army but having less in the way of armaments was very much a junior partner in the struggle against the little scaly devils still liu han didnt want to damage the popular front so she sentenced the fellow to hard labor if his fellow reactionaries chose to rescue him later she wouldnt worry about it nieh hoting had also been trying traitors they met for supper after nightfall ended the trials till morning over buckwheat noodles and bits of shredded pork nieh said even if the little devils do end up putting down this revolt they will have a hard time finding anyone to help them administer china that is good i suppose liu han said better would be driving them back so we go on ruling here yes that would be better nieh agreed i do not know if it can happen though wherever they concentrate their strength they can beat us that remains true even with our new weapons and weve used up a lot of those the russians will have to send us more then liu han said that wont be so easy not any more nieh hoting replied the scaly devils have already shot up a couple of caravans and molotov damn him doesnt dare get caught in the act of helping us if he does get caught the little devils land on him instead and he wont take that chance so were liable to be stuck with what weve got not good liu han said and used one of the scaly devils emphatic coughs no not good at all nieh said and we had an unpleasant report today from down in the south youd better tell me liu han said though she was anything but sure she wanted to hear here and there the scaly devils are starting to use human troops against us nieh hoting said theyve tried that before liu han said it doesnt work well before long the soldiers go over to us or enough of them do anyhow humans naturally have solidarity with one another but nieh shook his head this is different before they would try to use chinese soldiers here in china and youre right that didnt work but these men whoever they are arent chinese theyre mercenaries in the pay of the little devils they dont speak our language so we cant reach them they just do what the scaly devils tell them to do theyre the perfect oppressors now that is not good that is not good at all liu han scratched her jaw as she had while judging ku chenglun what she decided here was a good deal more important than her verdict in the clerks case though ku would not have agreed with that after some time she said we will have to speak in the little scaly devils language the mercenaries are bound to understand that or some of them are otherwise the scaly devils couldnt give them their orders nieh hoting nodded yes that is a good idea better than anything weve tried yet its bound to be some people say these soldiers are from south america others say theyre from india either way they might as well come from home for all the sense we can make of what they say we have to make them understand liu han said once we do the rot will start heres hoping anyhow nieh said before liu han could answer jet engines started howling low over peking antiaircraft guns barked antiaircraft missiles took off with roaring whooshes bombs burst the ground started to shake little waves shimmered in liu hans bowl of broth and noodles she picked it up i wish we had airplanes of our own she said the way things are the little devils can hit us but we cant hit back i know nieh hoting shrugged nothing we can do about that though molotov isnt about to pack fighter planes on camelback any more than hes likely to send us landcruisers but now at least we make the scaly devils pay a price when they use those things not enough liu han said more bombs burst some not very far away she glanced at the oil lamps that lit the inside of the noodle shop so easy for a hit to knock them into the rubble and start a fire broad stretches of peking had already burned from fires of that sort if we fail this time we try again nieh said and again and again and as often as need be sooner or later we win or we give up liu han thought but she would not say that saying it seemed to make it more likely to come true part of her realized that was nothing but peasant superstition but she kept quiet all the same shed grown up a peasant never expecting to be anything else and couldnt always escape her origins bombs fell again some nearer some farther away nieh hoting said if they keep doing this there wont be anything left of peking but ruins maybe not liu han said but theyll be our ruins nieh eyed her with more than a little admiration you would say that about all of china wouldnt you if it meant being rid of the little scaly devils for good i would she replied he nodded you always have taken the hard line against them i have my reasons even if some of them are personal and not ideological liu han said but i am not really a hardliner my daughter now she would say let all of china be ruined even if it doesnt necessarily mean getting rid of the little devils for good just so they cant have it nieh hoting nodded again i see the difference mao would probably agree with liu mei you know well hell have his chance with this uprising liu han said unless the people refuse to fight any more unless they would sooner have peace regardless of who rules them she kept that to herself too mao has been a revolutionary his whole life nieh said a lot of us have we will go on fighting however long it takes we are patient the dialectic is on our side we will bring the country with us of course we will liu han declared but then the doubts that never quite went away came out the only thing that worries me is the little scaly devils are patient too nieh hoting looked at her as if he wished she hadnt said any such thing she too wished she hadnt said it but she feared that didnt make it any less true more bombs rained down on peking just seeing tosevite railroads had convinced nesseref that she didnt like them instead of being clean and quiet they roared and puffed and chugged and belched filthy stinking black smoke into the air one of these days she was told the race would replace the horrible engines in poland with more modern machinery but it didnt look as if that would happen any time soon there were so many more urgent things to do no matter how filthy the locomotives the big uglies built they did work after a fashion and so they stayed in service and now she found herself in a passenger car behind one of those noxious locomotives the rolling swaying jouncing ride was even worse than shed expected and left her as nervous as a wild big ugly would have been to fly in a shuttlecraft for the first time fortunately few tosevites saw her discomfiture one car on each train was reserved for males and females of the race in fact nesseref had the entire compartment to herself a tosevite conductor came through and spoke in her language przemysl is the next stop all out for przemysl out she went in some anxiety if no one was waiting for her here at the station she would have to brave a taxi that would be doubly difficult first finding a driver who understood her and then surviving a trip through terrifying tosevite traffic having experienced both she vastly preferred space travel which had fewer things that could go wrong but a big ugly on the platform waved to her waved and called shuttlecraft pilot nesseref superior female over here with more than a little relief nesseref waved back i greet you mordechai anielewicz i am glad to see you and i am glad to see you her tosevite friend replied i was even gladder to see you when i came out of that house in kanth seeing any friends there was very good indeed i can understand how it would have been nesseref s eye turrets swiveled this way and that to her this crowded platform in przemysl full of shouting exclaiming big uglies was a frightening place she would not have wanted to be here without a friend and especially a tosevite friend but this was different from what anielewicz had gone through inside the reich she was fortunately sensible enough to understand as much no one wanted to kill her here she certainly hoped not at any rate but anielewicz could have died at any moment in kanth and hed volunteered to go there understanding that was so now he said come with me my apartment is not very far away my mate and hatchlings look forward to meeting you well heinrich looks forward to meeting you again and he looks forward to showing you his beffel nesserefs mouth fell open in amusement ah yes the famous pancer she pronounced the tosevite name as well as she could he may be interested in meeting me too i probably smell like a tsiongi and that is an odor that will always get a beffels attention anielewicz spoke three words in his own language dogs and cats then he explained these are tosevite domestic animals that often do not get along with each other i see nesseref said she skittered after anielewicz so she wouldnt lose him in the cavernous train station tosevites stared and pointed at her and exclaimed in their unintelligible languages many of them inhaled the burning herb that always struck her as noxious its acrid smoke filled her scent receptors outside the cold smote her mordechai anielewicz repeated it will not be far good she said shivering otherwise i do believe i would freeze before i got there this winter weather of yours makes me see why you tosevites deck yourselves in so many wrappings i have seen members of the race do it too anielewicz said staying warm is nothing to be ashamed of i suppose not nesseref hurried down the street after him but wrappings are rarely necessary back on home we do not like to think they should be necessary anywhere we live what you like to think is not always what is true anielewicz remarked a comment with which she could hardly disagree she sighed with relief on entering the lobby to his block of flats which was heated you must understand you have more tolerance for cold than we do she said here frozen water falling from the sky is something you take for granted back on home it is a rare phenomenon at the north and south poles and at the peaks of the highest mountains otherwise for us it is unknown that made the big ugly let out several of the barking yips his kind used for laughter it is not unknown here superior female he said and tacked on another emphatic cough if the race is going to live in large parts of tosev you will have to get used to cold weather so we have discovered nesseref said with an emphatic cough of her own the males of the conquest fleet have had more of a chance to grow accustomed to your weather than we newcomers have i must tell you my first winter here was a dreadful surprise i did not want to believe what the males had told me but it was true and seasons here on tosev last twice as long as they do on home so that winter seemed doubly dreadful without winter we could not enjoy spring and summer so much mordechai anielewicz said nesseref answered that with a shrug suffering to make pleasure seem sweeter struck her as more trouble than it was worth she didnt say so she didnt want to offend her friend and host instead she followed him upstairs that the apartment building had stairs instead of an elevator said something about the level of technology the local big uglies took for granted nesseref remembered the fire that had destroyed not just anielewiczs apartment but his whole apartment building such a disaster would have been impossible in her building with its sensors and sprinklers and generally more fireproof materials on the other fork of the tongue this building was more spacious than the one in which she lived part of that was because tosevites were larger than members of the race but only part the rest the big uglies didnt seem to build as if every particle of space were at a premium the race did the race had to home and especially homes cities had been crowded since before the empire unified the world the tosevites architecture said they still felt they had room to expand their technology has come very far very fast nesseref thought their ideologies lag behind in a way that was a comforting thought it let her view the big uglies as primitives in another way though it was frightening the tosevites had the means to do things they could scarcely have imagined a few generations before she wished she hadnt thought about how expansive they were here we are anielewicz led her down the hall and opened the door to what was she presumed his apartment it did not seem so very spacious not with so many big uglies inside it they greeted her in turn by their wrappings she identified two females and two more males besides mordechai anielewicz and there was a beffel a very fat very sassy beffel who swaggered out as if he owned the apartment and the tosevites in it were his servants he stuck out his tongue at nesseref taking her scent for a moment it was as if he had to condescend to remember what a member of the race smelled like but then he caught orbits odor clinging to her and swelled up in anger and let out a sneezing challenging hiss pancer heinrich anielewicz said sharply he spoke to the beffel in his own language nesseref had no idea what he said but it did the trick the beffel deflated and became a wellbehaved pet once more you have him well trained nesseref told the youngest tosevite i have known many males and females of the race who let their befflem become the masters in their homes that is not so here oh no the hatchling said my father would not allow it mordechai anielewicz laughed again convincing heinrich of that was easy enough convincing pancer of it has been harder nesseref laughed too even among us befflem are a law unto themselves anielewiczs mate did not speak the language of the race nearly so well as he did but she spoke with great intensity superior female i thank for to help mordechai for to find us i thank you for to help to go to kanth too you are welcome bertha anielewicz nesseref was pleased shed recalled the name even if she didnt pronounce it very well i am glad to be a friend to your mate friends help friends is that not a truth truth anielewiczs mate agreed along with what was surely intended to be an emphatic cough nesseref had wondered what sort of food the tosevites would serve her anielewicz had made it plain that following the jewish superstition limited what he and his kinsfolk could eat but the shuttlecraft pilot found nothing wrong with the roasted fowl that went on the table big uglies ate more vegetables and less meat than the race was in the habit of doing but if nesseref enjoyed more pieces of the bird and less of the tubers and stalks that went with it than did her hosts no one seemed to find that out of the ordinary here mordechai anielewicz set a glass half full of clear liquid in front of her this is distilled unflavored alcohol i have seen members of the race drink it and enjoy it i thank you nesseref said yes i have drunk it myself we have a custom of proposing a reason for drinking before we take the first sip he told her raising his glass he spoke in his own tongue lc a r then for her benefit he translated to life to life nesseref echoed imitating the tosevites around her she raised her glass before sipping from it the alcohol was potent enough to make her hiss after it slid down her throat she had to concentrate to make her eye turrets turn in the directions she wanted she asked may i also propose a reason for drinking anielewicz made the affirmative gesture please do raising her glass the shuttlecraft pilot said to peace to peace the tosevites echoed her this time anielewicz again translating they all drank so did she the alcohol was strong but it was also smooth before nesseref quite noticed what she was doing shed emptied the glass anielewicz poured more into it seeing everyone in the apartment having a good time and no one paying any attention to him pancer let out a plaintive squeak heinrich anielewicz patted his own lap the beffel jumped up into it and rubbed himself against the young big ugly as he might have against a member of the race maybe the alcohol had something to do with the solemnity with which nesseref spoke watching something like that makes me hope our two species really will be able to live in peace for many years to come wevamordechai anielewicz said in his language as he had before he translated for her once more may it be so may it be so nesseref agreed and then tried the tosevite word evamaybe it was the alcohol but she had no trouble saying it at all car keys clinked as sam yeager fished them out of his pocket ill be back in a bit he called to barbara and jonathan im going to see how the alterations for my tux look youll be dashing his wife said sam snorted that wasnt a word hed ever thought to apply to himself jonathan just snickered his tuxedo already fit fine so he didnt have to worry about return trips to the tailor out on the street cars slid past their lights on it was just a little past fivethirty but night came early in december even in los angeles yeager unlocked the door to his own buick in the driveway got inside and fastened his seat belt as he started the engine he shook his head in bemusement back before the lizards came nobodyd bothered putting seat belts in cars nowadays everyone took them for granted the races attitude toward minimizing risk had rubbed off on people he backed out of the driveway and drove south down budlong toward redondo beach boulevard on which the formalwear place stood maybe he really would look dashing by the time the japaneseamerican tailors were done with him jonathan did sure enough but jonathan of course was a young man and it would be his wedding day sam knew he needed more help to look sharp than his son did hed gone only a couple of blocks he hadnt even got to rosecrans yet when he spied motion in the rearview mirror he needed a heartbeat to realize it wasnt motion behind the car it was motion inside the car somebody whod been hiding lying down on the back seat or maybe between the front and back seats coming up and showing himself that heartbeats hesitation was at least half a heartbeat too long by the time sam took one hand off the wheel and started to go for his he felt something hard and cold and metallic pressed to the back of his head dont even think about it yeager his uninvited guest told him dont even start to think about it i know youre heeled keep both hands where i can see em and pull on over to the side of the road if you want to keep breathing even a little longer numbly sam obeyed hed known this day might come hed known it ever since he gave straha the information hed uncovered hed known it before then as a matter of fact but hed been extra careful since that day this once he hadnt been careful enough one mistake thats all you get attaboy his passenger said when he parked the car by the curb now tell me where its at so i can pull your teeth dont get cute with me either id sooner ice you someplace where its quieter than this but ill do it right here if ive got to right hip yeager said dully smooth and deft the man in the back seat half stood reached forward slid his hand under the safety belt and plucked out the pistol was stupid twice sam thought couldnt have got it very fast there myself right now though that didnt look as if it would matter okay said the man with the pistol with two pistols now get moving go down to redondo beach and turn right was going to do that anyhow yeager thought as he pulled back into traffic in an idiot sort of way it was funny or maybe his brain was just spinning round and round without going anywhere like a hamsters exercise wheel the light at the corner of budlong and rosecrans turned red sam hit the brake as he did one small light went on in his head youre strahas driver he blurted gordon that was the fellows name not any more im not gordon answered thats your fault and youre going to pay for it president warrens dead thats your fault the light turned green yeager drove south not knowing what else to do strahas driver no his exdriver now continued indianapolis went up in smoke thats your fault and a hell of a lot of good men lost their posts thats your fault too if i could kill you four or five times i would but oncell have to do what about all those lizards sam asked the light at compton boulevard was green he wished it were red that would have given him a few extra seconds they never had a chance fuck em gordons voice was flat and cold and fuck you buddy thanks a lot yeager said as he stopped for the red light at redondo beach boulevard fuck you too and the horse you rode in on strahas driver laughed yeah you can cuss me youll be just as dead either which way now go on down to western turn left there and keep on driving till i tell you to stop sam waited till the way was clear then turned onto redondo beach he had a pretty good idea where gordon would have him go western ran all the way down to the palos verdes peninsula where there were plenty of wide open spaces without any houses close by kids drove down to pv to find privacy to park he wouldnt have been surprised if jonathan and karen had done that a time or two or maybe more than a time or two palos verdes offered privacy for murder too coming up was normandie the next big street after it was western yeager swung into the left lane as he drove west on redondo beach he was nearing the light at redondo beach and normandie when it went from green to yellow to red cars on normandie started going through the intersection sam slowed as if he were going to stop at the light then stamped on the gas for all he was worth gordon only had time for the beginning of a startled squawk before the buick broadsided a chevy station wagon it had been a good many years since sams last traffic accident hed never caused hed never imagined causing one on purpose as they always did in pileups things happened very fast and seemed to happen very slowly collision noise incredible racket of smashing glass and crumpling metal yeager jerked forward his seat belt caught him before he could spear himself on the steering wheel or go headfirst through the windshield gordon wasnt wearing a seat belt sam had counted on that strahas driver hadnt been sitting directly behind him hed been more in the middle of the back seat at the impact he too was hurled forward half over the top of the front seat the pistol flew out of his hand sam had counted on that too hed hoped for it anyway with the reflexes that had let him play a pretty fair left field once upon a time he snatched it up from the floorboard and hit gordon in the head with it as hard as he could then he got back his own from gordons belt all that happened as quickly as he could do it he hadnt had time to think about it he couldnt remember thinking anything since deciding to run the light at normandie any more than hed done any thinking while chasing down a long fly ball in the alley in leftcenter thinking was for afterwards afterwards however much against the odds seemed to have arrived time returned to its normal flow sam suddenly noticed blaring horns and squealing brakes as other drivers somehow missed adding to the accident the first thing that ran through his mind was it wasnt an accident i meant to do it the next thought made a lot more sense id better get the hell out of here before the car catches on fire when he tried to open the door it wouldnt he twisted in his seat and kicked at it at the same time somebody outside yanked at it for all he was worth it did open then with a scream of tortured metal you son of a bitch roared the man outside a stocky swarthy fellow whose ancestors had come from mexico if he hadnt you stupid motherfucking son of a bitch you trying to get me killed you trying to get yourself killed he must have been driving the other car sam was proud hed managed such a brilliant deduction no i was trying to keep from getting killed he answered literal truth he realized he sounded mushy there on top of the dashboard quite undamaged sat his upper plate he reached out with his left hand and stuffed it into his mouth man i oughta beat the living shit outta you and the man standing in the intersection suddenly noticed the pistol in yeagers right hand his eyes went enormously wide he stopped roaring and started backing away that let sam get out of the car one look at the stovein front end told him hed never drive the buick again he shrugged hed have the chance to drive some other car one day almost as an afterthought he dragged gordon out of the wreckage gordons head thumped on the asphalt but sam wasnt about to lose any sleep over that a couple of other cars had stopped their drivers jumped out to lend a hand but nobody seemed eager to come very close to yeager not with one pistol in his hand and another on his belt dont do nothin crazy mister a tall skinny blond guy said i dont intend to yeager said hed already been crazy enough to last a lifetime and to prolong one im just waiting for the cops to get here he didnt have to wait long siren howling red lights flashing a squad car raced up normandie and stopped in the intersection which was already a lot more crowded than it needed to be two of gardenas finest got out and looked things over okay said one of them a burly fellow with black hair and very blue eyes what the hell happened here as far as sam could see that was pretty obvious he sighed with relief for a different reason though hed met the policeman before hello clyde he said how are you tonight the mexican man whod been driving the station wagon let out a wail of anguish his car was wrecked and it was totaled bent into an l and the guy whod rammed him knew the cop by his first name clyde needed a couple of seconds to pull sam out of his mental card file but he did lieutenant colonel yeager he exclaimed what the hell happened here this time he asked it in an altogether different tone of voice briefly as if making an oral report yeager told him what had happened yeah and thats all a bunch of bullshit too gordon said from the street sam jumped he hadnt noticed strahas driver coming to gordon went on this guy kidnapped me dragged me off the street he was babbling about ransom money sam handed clyde both pistols youll probably find both our prints on both of them you want to know where i was going when i left home call my wife and son you can check with the formalwear place too its right down the street here whaddaya think the other cop asked clyde yeager here hes had some nasty stuff happen to him that nobody ever got a handle on nobody this side of the fbi anyhow clyde said slowly you ask me this looks like more of the same he bent down and put handcuffs on gordon youre under arrest suspicion of kidnapping then he pointed at sam but youre coming down to the station too till we find out whose story checks out better what about me cried the man whod been driving the station wagon nobody paid any attention to him sure ill come sam said but please do call my wife will you and let her know im okay well take care of it the second cop said he went back to the police car and spoke into the radio then he walked back toward the accident tow trucks on the way another car too so we can get both these guys to the station okay good clyde answered like i said wel sort it out there he hauled gordon to his feet i want my lawyer gordon said sullenly whoever his lawyer was hed be good sam was sure of that but as he walked toward the squad car he didnt worry about it he didnt worry about anything by the odds he should have been dead and he was still breathing measured against that nothing else mattered jonathan yeager fiddled with his tie in front of the mirror in the churchs waiting room hed practiced tying a bow tie under a wing collar ever since hed got the tux but he still wasnt real good at it one side of the bow definitely looked bigger than the other i dont think ill ever get it right dad he said in something close to despair his father clapped him on the shoulder and advised dont worry about it nobodys going to care much as long as youre there and karens there and the ministers there and you probably wont have to worry about it again till youre marrying off your own kid and nobodyll pay much attention to you then believe me okay jonathan was willing more than willing eager to let himself be convinced he glanced at his father sam yeagers tie was straight the bulge under the left shoulder of his tuxedo jacket hardly showed at all jonathan shook his head i wonder when the last wedding was where the father of the groom carried a pistol dont know his father said usually its the father of the bride and hes carrying a shotgun dad jonathan said reproachfully his father grinned altogether unrepentant jonathan shook his head he and karen had been careful every single time no need for mr culpepper to go out and buy shotgun shells even so he changed the subject will you and mom be okay watching mickey and donald while karen and i are off on our honeymoon well manage his dad replied if we really start going crazy we can call one of the armys other lizardpsych boys like the fellow whos babysitting them today but i dont expect well need to theyre getting big enough to be easier than they were even a few months ago somebody knocked on the door you fellows decent in there jonathans mother asked no his father answered come on in anyway the door opened jonathans mother came in karen looks lovely she said shes wearing the dress her mother got married in you know i think thats so romantic jonathan hadnt seen karen yet he wouldnt not till she came down the aisle not everybody followed that old custom these days but her folks approved of it since they were footing the bill he could hardly argue with them his father asked everything okay out front hon everything looks fine his mother said and nobodys come in who hasnt been vouched for by somebody no strangers at the feast thered better not be just for a moment his fathers right hand started to slide toward the shoulder holster then he checked the motion he went on the judge refused to let gordon out on bail yesterday he was the biggest worry i hope he stays there till he rots jonathans mother said yeah that was jonathan he added an emphatic cough his father had told him some of what went on the night the buick met its end he had the feeling his dad hadnt told him everything not by a long shot well now that you mention it so do i sam yeager said another knock on the door the minister said about time to get ready there we are reverend fleischer jonathan said his heart thumped he was ready for the ceremony sure enough was he ready to be married he wasnt so sure about that he wondered if anybody was ready to be married before the fact his mother and father had made it work and so had karens parents if they could manage it he supposed karen and he could too he turned to his mother and father shall we do it his father started to say something his mother gave his dad a look and his dad very visibly swallowed whatever it had been instead he said wed better round up your best man too he ducked out for a cigarette didnt he yeah jonathan nodded greg goes through a pack a day easy with everything theyre finding out these days about what cigarettes do to you i think young people are foolish to start his mothers grin was wry that doesnt mean i dont use them myself of course i was going to point that out jonathans father said ive got a pack with me too the minister opened the door jonathans best man stood behind him greg ruzicka and he had known each other since the fourth grade gregs head was also shaved like so many of his generation he found the race at least as interesting as humanity he gave jonathan a thumbsup jonathan grinned if youll just come along with me now and take your places reverend fleischer said then ill give the organist a nod and we shall commence when jonathan got to the door that led to the aisle down which hed walk he looked at the backs of the guests heads his friends his parents friends ullhass and ristin were there shiplord straha for obvious reasons wasnt and a few relatives and those of karen and her folks he gulped it was real it was about to happen karen and her mother came out of the other waiting room she waved to him and smiled through her veil he took a deep breath and smiled back reverend fleischer bustled up to the altar and gave the organist the signal the first couple of notes of the wedding march rang out before jonathan realized they had something to do with him his best man hissed he jumped then started walking afterwards he remembered only bits and pieces of the ceremony he remembered his own parents coming up the aisle after him and karen on her fathers arm and her maid of honor shed known vicki yamagata even longer than hed known greg after that it was all a blur till he heard reverend fleischer saying do you jonathan take this woman to have and to hold to love and to cherish till death do you part i do he said loud enough for the minister and karen to hear him but probably not for anybody else it seemed to satisfy reverend fleischer he turned to the bride do you karen take this man to have and to hold to love and to cherish till death do you part i do she answered a little louder than jonathan had beaming the minister said then by the authority vested in me by the church and by the state of california i now pronounce you man and wife he nodded to jonathan you may kiss the bride that jonathan knew how to do he swept the veil aside took karen in his arms and delivered a kiss about a quarter as enthusiastic as he really wanted to give her that still made it pretty lively for a kiss in church when he let her go he saw almost all the men and what was to him a surprising number of women looking as if they knew exactly what he had in mind were really married he said not exactly brilliant repartee from a new bridegroom how about that karen answered that was commonplace enough to make him feel a bit better they went up the aisle this time and over to the hall next to the church for the reception after the wedding jonathan drank champagne fed wedding cake to karen and got fed by her and shook hands with everybody he didnt know and most of the people he did congratulations ristin told him in hissing english i thank you superior sir jonathan answered in the language of the race as his redwhiteandblue body paint showed ristin was an expow whod made himself thoroughly at home in the usa he kept right on speaking english this is an enjoyable celebration i almost begin to understand why those two of my kind who fled to this country would desire it weddings are supposed to be fun jonathan agreed now sticking to english himself from everything ive heard though its the settlingdown part later on that makes a marriage work ristin shrugged i would not know most of us have no interest in such unions but i know your kind does and i wish you every success thanks jonathan said again people pelted karen and him with rice when they went out to his elderly ford he hoped it would start it did he was glad to be out of the tux and in ordinary clothes again karen ran a comb through her hair getting the rice out of it how about that she said again yeah how about that mrs yeager jonathan said youre going to have to get used to signing your name a new way karen looked startled youre right i will and ill have to get used to being at the end of the alphabet too instead of near the front culpepper was good for that the hotel theyd picked for their wedding night was close to the airport when they got up to their room he picked her up and carried her over the threshold inside they discovered a bottle of champagne waiting in a bucket of ice karen read the little card tied to the bottle its from your folks she said and sighed my mom and dad wouldnt have thought of anything like that your parents are nice people jonathan said loyally but he didnt want to think about his new inlaws or his own parents for that matter that wasnt what a wedding night was for he wasnt very interested in more champagne at the moment either it might make him sleepy he didnt want to be sleepy not tonight karen might have been reading his mind we dont have to hurry she said glancing toward the bed that dominated the hotel room we dont have to worry about getting caught either i like that her eye went to the ring with the very little diamond jonathan had set on her finger i like this too good jonathan had a slim gold band on his own finger he wasnt used to wearing rings it felt funny thats the idea he walked over to her their arms went around each other who kissed whom was a matter of opinion this time in privacy they didnt have to hold back any enthusiasm not very much later they lay side by side on the bed jonathans hands wandered so did karens she said this is a lot better than parking in a drivein you know yeah jonathan couldnt take his eyes off his bride theyd never had the chance to be fully naked together before youre beautiful i already knew that but even more so she pulled him to her you say the sweetest things after theyd kissed for quite a while karen pulled back perhaps half an inch and said ill bet you tell that to all the girls she poked him in the ribs he squeaked shed found a ticklish spot and just for half a second the corny old joke put him off his stride he acftold kassquit something pretty much like that or as close to it as he could come in the language of the race which wasnt really made for such sentiments he wondered how kassquit was doing and hoped she was doing well but then his mouth found its way to the tip of karens breast again she sighed and pressed his head against her he stopped thinking about kassquit he stopped thinking about everything a moment later the marriage became official in a way that had nothing to do with either the church or the state of california but that was as old as mankind nonetheless oh jonathan karen said softly i love you he answered they made love a couple of times fell asleep in each others arms and woke up to make love again over the course of the night the champagne did disappear it wasnt enough to make them drunk it was enough to make them happy not that they werent pretty happy already the wakeup call at eight the next morning interrupted something that wasnt sleep afterwards jonathan said i dont know why were flying up to san francisco for our honeymoon itll be fun karen said well see all sorts of things we havent seen before if we ever get out of the hotel room we will he said i dont know about that braggart she wrinkled her nose at him they both laughed jonathan squeezed her they went downstairs for breakfast and then back up to the room to find something to do in the couple of hours before the plane took off to jonathans considerable pride they did on the basis of a bit more than half a day he liked being married just fine kassquit stooped slightly to look in the mirror in her cubicle that she had to stoop reminded her she wasnt biologically part of the race the mirror was at the perfect height for a male or female from home shed had to start stooping even before she reached her full growth either shed tried not to think about it or shed let it mortify her as did every difference between herself as she was and the female of the race she wished she were now she knew those differences were even larger than shed thought before she met wild big uglies that knowledge could mortify her too i am a citizen of the empire she said i am a tosevite but i am also a citizen of the empire it was a truth sometimes perhaps even more often than not it helped calm her but the converse held too she was a citizen of the empire but she was also a tosevite and at the moment she was engaged in a task which proved exactly that her hair the hair on her scalp that is not the hair that sprouted elsewhere on her body had got long enough to need combing the black plastic comb she held had come up from the surface of tosev at her request the race didnt make anything like it what point with scales instead of hair shed needed to send an electronic message to sam yeager to find out how the big uglies kept hair in any kind of order comb she said as she used it the word was english the race did not have the thing and so did not have a term for it after she finished using the comb she studied the result her hair was neater no doubt about it she suspected any big ugly who saw her would have approved she also suspected neither males nor females of the race would care one way or the other members of the race disapproved of her hair on general principles not long ago that disapproval would have crushed her now every once in a while she enjoyed annoying males and females if that wasnt her tosevite blood coming out she had no idea what it was the intercom panel by the door hissed for her attention who is it she asked i ttomalss came the reply kassquit stuck on an artificial fingerclaw for a moment so she could prod the switch to let him in i greet you superior sir she said bending into the posture of respect and i greet you ttomalss replied i hope you are well she made the affirmative gesture yes i thank you and yourself after ttomalss used the same gesture kassquit asked him and what can i do for you today superior sir you mentioned to me the ambiguities involved in recording every action of an individual who is a citizen of the empire with the same privileges as those enjoyed by other citizens of the empire ttomalss said i certainly did mention that to you yes kassquit said and i do not believe the issue is in the least ambiguous you will i hope understand that i did not and do not altogether agree with you ttomalss said but a review committee of higherranking individuals has come to a different conclusion i am now able to tell you that the routine recording of your actions has ceased and will not resume that is very good news superior sir kassquit added an emphatic cough she knew she sounded astonished she was astonished that the race would put her wishes ahead of its own research was something to be astonished about then she checked her swelling delight wait what is it ttomalss asked you say you are able to tell me the routine recording of my actions has stopped kassquit answered you do not say that this is a truth is it a truth superior sir she watched him narrowly she was not a female of the race to have instinctual cues about what his body language meant but shed been watching him all her life when he flinched now the motion was tiny but she saw it and when he said what do you mean she caught the startled alarm in his voice i mean that you were lying to me she said sadly i mean that you thought i would not pay close enough attention to your words when i was a hatchling i would not have but i am an adult now when you lie to me i have some chance of realizing it you do not understand but ttomalss didnt deny what shed said she wished he would have denied it i understand you have lied to me i understand i cannot trust you any more do you understand do you have any idea how much pain that causes me i am sorry superior sir but i do not think i want to see you again for some time to come please go kassquit i ttomalss began get out kassquit shrieked at the top of her lung no lungs being a tosevite she had two they seemed to make her voice doubly loud doubly shrill inside the little cubicle ttomalss cowered in alarm as her cry echoed and reechoed from the metal walls without a word he fled as the door hissed shut behind him kassquit fought the urge to run after him and do him an injury assuming she actually could what would it do except land her in trouble it would make me feel better she thought but in the end that proved not quite reason enough and she let her mentor escape she made the negative gesture no i let him escape physically she said much more quietly than shed ordered him to go but he will not get away with it by the spirits of emperors past after casting down her eyes as any other citizen of the empire would have she made a telephone call a female of the race said office of fleetlord reffet fleetlord of the colonization fleet how may i help you her voice faltered as she saw herself facing a tosevite rather than the member of the race shed expected i am junior researcher kassquit kassquit said i should like to speak to the exalted fleetlord if that is possible i doubt very much that it will be the female replied such a lack of acceptance didnt even anger kassquit any more shed encountered it too often she said please mention my name to the fleetlord you may possibly be surprised to another member of the race the females surely would have said it shall be done here she plainly debated refusing kassquit altogether at last with a shrug she replied oh very well her image disappeared as she set herself to finding out whether fleetlord reffet would indeed condescend to speak to this big ugly who bore the title and name of a female of the race if reffet decided he didnt care to speak with kassquit she probably wouldnt see the female in his office again the connection would just be broken but kassquit knew shed done the race and reffet a considerable service in identifying the male who called himself regeya on the electronic network as sam yeager wild big ugly she hoped the fleetlord would remember too and for a moment she wished she could forget had she not unmasked sam yeager she would never have become intimate with jonathan yeager she would have come closer much closer to remaining a good counterfeit female of the race but that hadnt been how things worked out now jonathan yeager was permanently mated to another wild big ugly and now kassquit knew she was doomed always to stay betwixt and between she could never make herself into a proper member of the race but she could never fully be a tosevite either the female reappeared the fleetlord will speak to you she said in startled tones she vanished again reffets image replaced hers kassquit folded into the posture of respect i greet you exalted fleetlord she said is it not a truth that i have been adjudged a full citizen of the race let me examine the facts before i answer junior researcher reffet said one of his eye turrets swung away from her presumably to look at another monitor no matter how she tried to make them behave so her eyes refused after a little while reffet swung both eye turrets back toward her yes that does appear to be a truth do i have all the privileges of any other citizen of the empire then she persisted i would say that would follow from the other reffet added the affirmative gesture in that case exalted fleetlord kassquit took a deep breath in that case i request that you formally reprimand my mentor senior researcher ttomalss for falsely assuring me that he had stopped recording my every activity when in fact he has not he admitted as much when i caught him in the lie and i daresay you can see and hear him admit as much on the recording he has denied making i also request that you order him to cease such recordings in the future junior researcher are you sure you wish to pursue this formally reffet asked exalted fleetlord i am kassquit replied i see no other way to gain at least some of the privacy a citizen of the race is entitled to being who i am being what i am i know i can never hope to lead a normal life but a citizen of the empire should not have to lead a life in which she is on constant display truth the fleetlord of the colonization fleet said he let out a soft hiss as he pondered at last he made the affirmative gesture to show he had decided i shall order ttomalss to cease this recording but i shall not reprimand him as you note your situation is not and cannot be normal i thank you kassquit said but perhaps you misunderstood i do not want him reprimanded for the recording i want him reprimanded for the lie think carefully on this junior researcher reffet said i understand your reasons i believe but do you truly wish to alienate your mentor for one in your unusual position having a prominent friend could prove valuable and not having one could prove the reverse he used an emphatic cough kassquit started to answer with something sharp but checked herself while she thought reluctantly she decided the fleetlords advice was good i thank you she said let it be as you suggested but could you please informally let ttomalss know you are displeased with him because of the lie reffets mouth fell open in a laugh perhaps you do not need a prominent friend after all you are a strong advocate for yourself i shall do that farewell well enough pleased with herself kassquit began checking the areas of the electronic network in which she was interested before long ttomalss telephoned her without preamble he said i suppose you are responsible for the tonguewhipping i just got from fleetlord reffet yes superior sir i am kassquit answered i am certain you think i deserve it too ttomalss said things are now arranged as you desired you are no longer being routinely recorded and that is a truth he used an emphatic cough good kassquit said and used one of her own she and ttomalss both broke the connection at the same time she hoped she wouldnt have to go on without his help if she did though she expected she would manage she was fundamentally alone being who and what she was how could she be anything else i just have to live with it she murmured and set about to do exactly that vyacheslav molotov was walking past his secretarys desk on the way to his own office when his legendary impassivity cracked stopping in his tracks he pointed at the object that had startled him and said bozhemoi pyotr maksimovich what on earth is that comrade general secretary it is called a furry his secretary replied my cousin is the protocol officer in our embassy to the united states and he sent it to me they are apparently all the rage there by what he said he had to fight a mob of housewives at a department store to get his hands on any of them i had forgotten you were related to mikhail sergeyevich molotov said he peered over the tops of his spectacles at the socalled furry i fail to see the appeal there must be many more attractive stuffed animals but this is not an ordinary stuffed animal comrade general secretary his secretary said here let me show you he aimed a handheld control at the toys nose the furry opened its eyes and swung them over the room for all the world as if it really were waking up and looked around it waved a hand and spoke in english bozhemoir molotov said again i see what you mean it is almost as if the devils grandmother lives inside the little thing when he spoke the furrys eyes turned toward him it said something else in english for all he knew it was answering him does it hear me he asked literally no his secretary said in effect yes it has all manners of sensors and circuits stolen from the lizards technology which make it much more versatile than toys commonly are versatile molotov echoed watching the furry it had been looking at the secretary but its alarmingly lifelike eyes returned to him when he spoke amazing he murmured the americans are foolish to use so much of this valuable technology in something to amuse children they are in some ways very much like children themselves my cousin writes that a canadian actually invented the furries though theyre being made in the united states his secretary said canadians americans molotov shrugged six of one half a dozen of the other there are no big differences between them the way there are between us russians and the ukrainians for instance he warily eyed the furry sure enough it was eyeing him too turn it off pyotr maksimovich certainly comrade general secretary his secretary wasnt about to tell him no when he used the control again the furry yawned waved goodbye said one last thing in english and closed its eyes it truly might have been falling asleep i hope your children enjoy it molotov said he had to repress the urge to sidle around his secretarys desk as he finally went on into his office it is only a toy a machine he told himself nothing but plush and plastic and circuits programmed to perform one way or another he was a thoroughgoing rationalist and materialist so that should have been selfevident truth and so it was when he forced himself to look at it rationally when he didnt when he didnt the devils grandmother might have animated the furry sitting down at his desk going through paperwork all that seemed a great relief hed done it every day for years for decades getting up for some tea and a couple of little sweet cakes dusted with powdered sugar was routine too the more he stuck to routine the less he had to think about the furry and what it implied so much technology casually lavished on a toy the ussr had stolen the same technology from the race and could have matched the furry but any economic planner who dared suggest such a thing would have gone to the gulag the next minute molotov wondered how many furries would be imported into the soviet union and what sort of demand for such fripperies they would create among the majority who would not prove able to get their hands on them he shrugged he cared very little whether or not people clamored for consumer goods what sensible planner would the red army got what it needed the party got what it needed if anything happened to be left over after that the people got it unlike the capitalist americans we have our priorities straight molotov thought smugly after a while he glanced at the clock it was after ten zhukov and gromyko should have been here on the hour molotov tapped one finger on the desk most russians were hopelessly unpunctual but those two had learned to come and go by the clock not by their own inclination where were they then almost as soon as the question formed in his mind he got the answer squeaky english came from the anteroom molotovs secretarys furry had captured the head of the red army and the foreign commissar no less than it had ensnared molotov himself he went out to the anteroom and said good morning comrades have you begun your second childhoods to play with toys instead of conducting the business of the soviet union gromyko said it is a clever gadget vyacheslav mikhailovich it is also a funny gadget if you speak english zhukov nodded delight glowed on his broad peasant features plainly he would sooner have gone on fooling around with the furry than dealing with state business he said im going to get some of these for my grandchildren of course of course molotov said dryly with obvious regret the diplomat and the soldier allowed themselves to be led away from the american toy even as zhukov sat down in front of molotovs desk he said thats a damn fine toy no two ways about it there are always two ways about everything georgi konstantinovich gromyko said the second way here is that the americans waste so much energy and technological expertise on this piece of frivolity when they could be using them to some advantage on their own defense all right something to that zhukov allowed but a little funs not against the law every now and then he still sometimes thought like a peasant all right molotov said can we forget the toys for the time being and discuss our plan of action for china that was if you will recall the reason we were to assemble here today had i known of the furry in advance i assure you i would have put it at the head of the agenda his sarcasm seemed to get through where nothing else had instead of blathering on about the stuffed animal zhukov said maos done better than we thought he could hasnt he indeed molotov said now the question is has he done too well for his own good gromyko said exactly so andrei andreyevich exactly so molotov agreed if he keeps giving the lizards as much trouble as he has lately how soon will they start using explosivemetal bombs to suppress him too many of those bombs used already all over the world gromyko said if the lizards do start using explosivemetal bombs they may not get rid of the whole peoples liberation army but theyre liable to wipe out the leadership cadres hukov said you are right georgi konstantinovich and that is not desirable molotov said we want the peoples liberation army to remain a thorn in the side of the race for years indeed for generations to come he turned to gromyko andrei andreyevich i want you to work closely with japan and the united states if all three powers express their displeasure at the use of explosivemetal weapons in china that may well give the lizards pause i shall do my best to arrange a joint declaration comrade general secretary gromyko replied too many sovereignties have already used too many explosivemetal bombs as i said a moment ago it bears repeating we should also emphasize it with the race molotov said and i believe we should make it less urgently necessary for the race to have to think about using explosivemetal bombs in china his gaze swung back to zhukov do you understand what i mean comrade marshal do you agree he wished he could simply give zhukov orders but the head of the red army would have had an easier time giving him orders than the other way round zhukov grunted now you want us to stop sending the peoples liberation army the german rockets that let them take out tanks and helicopters and airplanes molotov for once did not grudge a smile exactly mao will pitch a fit zhukov predicted this isnt the first time weve sold him down the river and it may not be the last either molotov replied with a shrug is weakening the peoples liberation army not what seems best for the soviet union and for the world as a whole he waited if zhukov said no he would have to backtrack and he hated the idea but after another grunt zhukov said yes i suppose so the chinese will still keep the lizards in play they just wont be able to do such a good job of it if the lizards didnt have explosivemetal bombs id answer differently of course if the lizards didnt have explosivemetal bombs and the technology that goes with them theyd still be stuck on home the world would be a different place gromyko said musingly better worse who can guess who indeed molotov said he thought the soviet union would have survived the attack the nazis were unleashing in when the race arrived he hoped the soviet union would have survived but he was anything but certain would anyone have tried flying into space by these early days of if the lizards hadnt shown it could be done he doubted that no point to such airyfairy questions zhukov said we can only deal with what is not with what might have been gromykos heavy eyebrows came down and together in a frown he didnt care to be casually dismissed like that but his voice showed none of his annoyance as he asked if we make it harder for the chinese to annoy the lizards shall we find some other way to make their lives interesting what have you got in mind molotov asked when we launched those missile warheads loaded with ginger at the races australian settlements the results were highly disruptive and highly entertaining the foreign commissar observed but this time zhukov spoke before molotov could nyet we got away with it once but that is no guarantee we could do it twice and the hot water we would land in if we got caught nyet reluctantly molotov nodded i agree with georgi konstantinovich smuggling ginger is one thing bombarding them with it is something else if we get caught an act of war gromyko sulked he didnt show it much he never showed anything much but he sulked molotov would much sooner have backed him than zhukov that would have enhanced his own power and diminished the marshals but he would have no power at all if the ussr went the way of the greater german reich survival first molotov thought everything else afterwards but survival first hed lived by that rule for three quarters of a century he wondered how much further he could go monique dutourd turned to turned on her brother with even more annoyance than usual isnt there anything you can do she demanded me pierre didnt just shake his head he laughed in her face if i tried to get auerbach out of the lizards prison do you know what would happen id end up back inside it myself thats what no thanks little sister he was likely right worse luck even so monique said its not fair the american got me up to tours and now hes locked away i notice you dont say anything about his girlfriend pierre remarked he was right about that too monique hadnt said a word about penny summers although shed also been arrested truth was monique had little use for penny and suspected the feeling was mutual trying not to sound defensive she said he did more for me than she did and what would you like him to do for you pierre asked insolently monique looked around for something to throw at him before her eye and her hand settled on anything her brother went on remember im not the one whos got clout with the lizards any more you are like ive said before youre the teachers pet and that ttomalss is sure as hell a lizard with pull hed have a lot better chance of getting the race to spring auerbach than i would do you really think i could monique heard the astonishment in her own voice she needed a moment to figure out why she was so astonished but then she did shed never had much power to do things or change things shed been done to and changed instead the idea that she could be an active verb rather than a passive one startled her pierre shrugged suppose he says no thats the worst that can happen and how are you worse off if it does at the very least youll know you tried youre right monique knew she sounded surprised again whens ttomalss going to call again her brother asked tomorrow isnt it monique answered yeah i think thats right pierre paused and lit a cigarette all right tomorrow you tell him no auerbach means no ancient romans sound like you mean it and youve got a chance peutetre monique started to laugh youre going to be the one who sounds like i mean it i dont know the language well see how it goes pierre said if he tells you no flat out then he does thats all he blew a smoke ring whether the american got out of prison didnt matter a centimes worth to him one way or the other ttomalss did telephone the next day i greet you he said through pierre we were discussing as i recall the ways in which the romans used gradations in status between full subject and full citizen to integrate foreign groups into their empire do i understand correctly that a groups degree of citizenship would depend on the degree to which it had assimilated itself to roman customs and practices that strikes me as a very rational approach to administration he did indeed understand correctly he wasnt stupid or anything close to it he reminded monique of that with every conversation they held but he was alien very alien he reminded her of that with every conversation they held too well pierre said not translating any more do you try or dont you i do monique replied tell him there is a personal matter we need to discuss before we go on with the roman history it shall be done her brother said one of the scraps of the lizards language she understood he went on with a long sentence of hisses and pops and coughs that were greek to her or would have been save that she knew greek after pierre finished ttomalss let out an amazingly humanlike sigh i might have known this would happen he said in fact this has already happened when you arranged to have your brother released from prison to translate for you what do you want from me this time i want you to release an american named rance auerbach who i believe has been unjustly imprisoned as a ginger dealer monique answered she said not a word about penny summers if pierre wanted to tease her more about that he could her conscience didnt trouble her too much auerbach was the one whod helped her penny wasnt and hadnt it always comes down to ginger dealers ttomalss observed this herb causes us more trouble than any drug does for people the lizard went on let me consult our records about this auerbach then i will tell you what i think silence fell on the other end of the line into it pierre asked what was the name of the lizard who got you this place in tours felless monique said senior researcher felless auerbach knew she tasted ginger and he blackmailed her into helping me senior researcher same title as ttomalss her brother observed i wonder if they know each other i wonder if he likes her which is even more to the point felless he scratched his cheek i think she was one of business administrator keffeshs pals keffesh is in jail too you know they do know each other felless recommended me to ttomalss do you think we can use all that to push him monique asked her brother shrugged a very gallic shrug dont know yet like i said a lot of its going to depend on what he thinks of her drumming her fingers on the desktop in front of the telephone monique waited to see what ttomalss would say after a couple of minutes the lizard began to speak again i am sorry but that does not appear possible his crimes include some in the subregion known as south africa in which members of the race fired on one another in pursuit of ginger that didnt sound good but monique had expected him to refuse at first after all doing nothing was easier and more convenient than doing something he didnt much care to do she said if males of the race were shooting at one another theres no evidence auerbach was shooting at anybody is there she hoped there wasnt to her relief ttomalss said no but he has admitted being there admitted being part of the plot he has implicated males of the race if hes given evidence that helped the race doesnt he deserve leniency monique asked he has leniency as far as imprisonment goes ttomalss paused then fired back a question of his own why are you so interested in this tosevite male monique dutourd do you want to mate with him pierre translated that rather more bluntly monique gave him a dirty look he laughed at her but ttomalss definitely was not a fool for the thought had been in the back of her mind while she wondered what to say pierre offered his advice if you mean yes say yes if you mean no say yes anyway they think were all sexcrazy all the time anyway itll help push him all right thanks translate this monique thought then said yes weve never had the chance yet and i can hardly wait weve just been friends up till now after putting that into the lizards language her brother nodded vigorously good real good friendship counts for a lot with them ive seen that from the questions he asks about the romans monique said ttomalss sighed again in spite of your desire however urgent it may be i doubt i have the influence to do as you wish why are you two tosevites laughing monique and pierre looked at each other and started laughing again how do we explain he sounds like the worst bad film ever made monique asked we dont pierre said which was also probably good advice back to the main argument then monique said tell him auerbach did me a large favor and i want to pay him back what sort of favor was this ttomalss asked i suspect it was no favor at all i suspect you are inventing it to fool me i am not monique said indignantly though pierre probably wouldnt be able to translate the indignation if it werent for rance auerbach i wouldnt have my position here at the university of tours now i know you are lying ttomalss said i happen to know for a fact that senior researcher felless of the race obtained that position for you she was the one who suggested i talk to you about the history of the romans monique nodded to herself now the question was were felless and ttomalss friends or just professional colleagues she said senior researcher felless got me the position because auerbach urged her to urged her to you say ttomalss echoed do you mean he threatened to publicize her ginger habit again auerbach hasnt said anything about it to the races authorities since not that i know of monique told ttomalss not yet anyhow not yet once more ttomalss repeated her words once more he sighed you will next tell me that if he stays imprisoned he will accuse felless of using ginger the question you should ask yourself is do i care no superior sir monique said thats the question you should ask yourself dont you think sure enough there was the rub of it if ttomaiss didnt care at all what happened to felless hed be less likely to help get rance auerbach out of prison instead of directly replying right away he said you want to help the tosevite gain his freedom because he did you this favor do you remember that senior researcher felless also did you the favor of obtaining this position for you is it just that you should threaten her after she gave you that assistance she wouldnt have if it hadnt been for auerbach monique said do remember something else as well ttomaiss added if you got your position thanks to the race you can also lose it thanks to the race i know believe me i know she said but i was working as a shopgirl before rance auerbach did me that favor i can find work as a shopgirl again i daresay i could find another roman historian too ttomalss warned what do you think monique asked pierre if he meant to tell you no hed have done it already her brother replied i think youre right i hope youre right monique said tell him this im sure hes right if he wants to do that he can but if he wants to keep working with this roman historian he needs to give me some help here hes not paying me much money to work with him and remind him of that too after pierre translated ttomaiss let out another sigh i can make no promises but i will see what influence i can bring to bear he said at last can we now continue with our discussion of grades of roman citizenship yes superior sir monique answered as meekly as if she were only a scholar of classical civilization and not a blackmailer at all glen johnson had company as he rode his scooter through the scattered drifting rubble of the asteroid belt though he was alone in the cabin he couldnt see his company with the naked eye either but his radar assured him he wasnt alone in this stretch of space one of the lizards probes followed him on his rounds this wasnt the first time a probe had shadowed him as he went hither and yon either he wondered if the machine had received instructions from back on earth to keep an electronic eye on him or if the computer controlling it had decided to follow him on its own mankind remained behind the race when it came to computerguided machinery just how far ahead the lizards were wasnt quite clear okay pal johnson said to the probe not that it could hear him you want the grand tour ill give you the grand tour he remained convinced that no matter how smart the probe was he was smarter it was faster and stronger and more accurate but he was more deceitful if the probe wanted to learn more about what all the americans were up to out here in the vicinity of ceres he would cheerfully lead it down the primrose path his radar guided him toward one of the rocks on which a work crew had mounted a motor a weapon in other words aimed at the lizards back on earth he used his little maneuvering jets to go all around the asteroid examining it in microscopic detail the lizards probe also went around the rock though it stayed several miles farther out than he did after finishing his inspection he radioed the lewis and clark asteroid code charlieblue all installations appear to be operating according to design that done he took the scooter away from the asteroid and on toward another one of similar size about twenty miles ahead he gave the second floating chunk of rock the same meticulous inspection hed given the first one as before the races probe followed him as before it also went all around the asteroid there was only one difference this asteroid didnt boast a motor even so johnson sent a radio message to the lewis and clark asteroid code charliegreen all installations appear to be operating according to design having said that he went on to the next rock on his list this time the lizards probe didnt follow him quite so quickly instead it kept prowling round and round the asteroid hed codenamed charliegreen he knew exactly what it was doing it was trying to figure out why hed gone there and what installations he was talking about he wondered how long the lizards would take to figure out that he was yanking their tailstumps the longer the better by the time he was done inspecting the next asteroid which also remained untouched by human hands the probe had caught up with him he sent off the usual kind of message asteroid code charliegreen all installations appear to be operating according to design then he had a new thought instead of heading off toward another drifting hunk of rock he pointed the scooter at the lizards probe and used the radar to steer toward it it was so efficiently blackened he couldnt see it till he got very close the scooter mounted machine guns he didnt know what sort of weaponry the probe mounted and didnt want to find out here instead he flew around the probe at about the same range as hed flown around the past several asteroids the probe maneuvered too making it more like a dance than anything else when johnson had finally finished he fired up the radio again and said asteroid code edgarblack all installations appear to be operating according to design what will the lizards make of that he wondered if he were a lizard monitoring the big uglies out in space he wouldnt care for the implication that his probe was one of their installations he hoped his hypothetical lizard wouldnt like it either after that bit of confusion he went on to visit several more asteroids some with motors mounted on them others without on a long looping trajectory that took him back to the american spaceship from which hed departed he guided the scooter into the airlock which closed behind him when the inner door opened and he emerged from the scooter the airlock operator said the commandant wants to see you right away fighting back a strong impulse to groan johnson said oh god what now beats me the operator said but thats what he told me and when he says something he usually means it isnt that the sad and sorry truth johnson answered okay rudy thanks he swung off to beard brigadier general healey in his den when he got to the commandants office deep in the heart of the lewis and clark healey fixed him with a fishy stare and said asteroid code edgarblack we have no asteroid with that code designation oh johnson fought against another groan the commandant was at least as literalminded as any lizard ever hatched he explained his pas de deux with the races probe i made up the code name let the race go nuts trying to figure out my signals the probe is black thats what made me think of it healey drummed his fingers on the desktop i see very well dismissed sir johnson said in surprise dismissed i said healeys expression turned suspicious which wasnt a very sharp turn why did you think i would keep grilling you once i found out what i needed to know johnson shrugged never can tell sir its happened before lord knows he didnt have to worry about keeping the commandant sweet brigadier general healey was going to despise him till one of them died he hoped healey would erupt now for a couple of seconds he thought the commandant would but no such luck after a long exhalation healey growled i havent got time to play games with you today lieutenant colonel get the hell out of my office yes sir johnson said and glided away he wondered if the commandant would throw something at him to speed him on his way but healey didnt out in the corridor johnson looked at his watch hed made better time out among the asteroids than hed expected he wasnt due back in the control room for another hour and a half that left him to ponder whether he felt more like sleep or company he yawned experimentally then shook his head he could do without sleep a while longer which left the refectory he murmured as if giving orders to his chauffeur but he was his own chauffeur he brachiated down the corridor till he came to the entrance to the large chamber it was the middle of the afternoon ships time not a meal period the place was crowded anyway because it was the biggest chamber in the lewis and clark and because people did assemble there for meals theyd got into the habit of gathering there to chat and socialize whether it was mealtime or not lucy vegetti spotted him floating in the entranceway and waved he waved back and swung his way toward her as he drew near he spotted mickey flynn hanging on to a nearby handhold you two plotting together he asked of course flynn said solemnly what else would we be doing this is after all a ship full of conspiracies about to hatch and if you dont believe him lucy added just ask the lizards oh i believe him johnson said after all could a man with a face like that possibly tell a lie why the mere idea is ridiculous flynn said besides johnson went on i just spent a few hours in the scooter adding to the lizards paranoid fantasies and to brigadier general healeys he thought but he didnt say that out loud lucy vegetti wagged a finger at him in mock indignation youve been visiting rocks with no motors on them again she paused did you notice anything interesting on any of them spoken like a geologist glen said at which she stuck out her tongue at him he continued i didnt see anything that struck me as strange no sorry but i did do a little buckandwing with the lizard probe that was trundling along after me he described how hed treated it as if it were an american installation not a spacecraft belonging to the race i like that lucy nodded then turned to flynn what do you think mickey how could i presume to disagree the backup pilot asked if i did you would presume me presumptuous anybody who knows you is more likely to presume you preposterous johnson said i am affronted flynn declared letting go of the handhold so he could fold his arms across his chest and show how affronted he was as far as johnson was concerned that only made him look more preposterous and since air currents started to move him away from the handhold he had to reach out and grab it again to the lizards were all preposterous lucy said thats part of the game johnson said the less seriously they take us us as people generally and us as the people out here the better off we are if they didnt take us seriously would that probe have followed you everywhere you went like marys little lamb mickey flynn enjoyed playing devils advocate maybe not johnson admitted but if i run around doing crazy things after a while the lizards will just be sure im nuts and then they wont take me seriously any more thatll be good like i said it would have been better if they thought we were just out here mining lucy said now that they know were turning little asteroids into weapons theyre going to keep a closer eye on us theyll keep a closer eye on us while were doing thatflynn said johnson nodded mickeys right the asteroids are useful as weapons but theyre also useful as camouflage the race is paying an awful lot of attention to those rocks and to the motors on them the race is paying attention to us when we go to them its paying attention to us when we set up motors on new rocks and when we look rocks over to see if theyd be good with motors on them i know lucy nodded too and the lizards arent paying so much attention while we go on about our real business our anumberone real business i mean out here she looked from johnson to flynn and back again do you really think well be able to launch a starship by the turn of the century ill be an old man by then glen johnson said too old to be in space by rights but i hope ill still be around to see it me too lucy said the lizards got here we ought to be able to go see home who knows where the russians will be by then either mickey flynn said maybe they be right behind us or right beside us i wouldnt mind home ten lightyears away a little more something to look forward to johnson said we should always have that his friends nodded once more
