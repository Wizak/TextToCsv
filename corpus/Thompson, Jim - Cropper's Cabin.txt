croppers cabin by jim thompson copyright it was almost dusk and i knew that meant shed be waitmg for me her car hidden under the thick willows waiting just like she had been all along it was a swell setup her name was donna she was onefourth indian and threefourths white and thats a blood mixture thats hard to beat if youre breeding for beauty she had the beauty all right and plenty more she could also mean plenty of trouble if anybody found out about us i finished what i was doing and was beginning to feel that dontgiveagoldarn crankiness that sneaks up on me when i get real hungry you know maybe you get the same way you almost hope that someonell say something to you so you can jump down his throat i put the papers in a folder marked miss trumbull burdock county oklahoma consolidated school district and started to slide it into the top drawer of miss trumbulls desk somehow one of the papers slipped out and fell into the wastebasket and when i lifted it out i saw this sandwich part of a sandwich rather lying there it was made out of some kind of fish mixed up with salad dressing and there were little pinkish smears of lipstick on it and a place where spit had hardened but it smelled awfully good it looked awfully good i pinched at it pinching away the spit and the lipstick and then suddenly the classroom door banged open and i shoved the sandwich into my pocket it was abe toolate the janitor i stood up trying to smile and he came toward me his mean little eyes fixed on mine he stopped right in front of me so close that i was breathing in the stink of corn liquor and held out one of his stubby copperskinned hands i seen you he grunted lets have it have what i said what you put in your pocket been wondering who was doin all the stealin around here at night i almost laughed in spite of myself because he was probably the only person around school that was wondering everyone else knew and abe would have been fired long before if he hadnt had a couple of relatives on the school board lets have it he repeated get away from me i said get away from me fast abe whats your name boy he blustered as if he didnt know what you doing here anyhow and i could feel my face going tight shucks he knew what i was doing there id been grading miss trumbulls papers for almost four years ever since i was a freshman i walked straight toward him i kind of herded him in front of me backing him toward the cloakroom and his face began shining with sweat nnow look tom tommy he stuttered i didnt mean tommy i said arent you getting a little familiar abe you mean mister carver dont you mmister carver he almost choked on that having to call a whitetrash sharecroppers boy mister i backed him into the cloakroom and stood staring at him a minute or two watching him sweat and squirm then i began to calm down a little and i wanted to try to patch things up but i knew there wasnt any way not after id made him put a handle on my name so i reached down for my football sweater with the big bcs on it and left i walked down the stairs and out the front door thinking about what a funny thing pride was what a troublesome thing now that my temper had simmered down i realized that abe must have seen what id stuck in my pocket hed tried to dig me in my pride to give himself a boost by pushing someone else down and id dug right back at him so now or rather tomorrow thered be trouble hed be in the principals office the first thing in the morning and i still wouldnt be able to admit that id been going to eat the leavings from miss trumbulls lunch i dug the sandwich out of my pocket and dropped it down at the side of the steps then i slung my sweater around my shoulders and headed across the yard to the road it was getting on toward true dark now but when i rounded the curve that leads down to the creek i saw donna ontimes new cadifiac parked under the willows apparently she spotted me at the same time she gave two short taps on the horn of the cat so i went on and it sure wasnt hard to do even though i knew what would happen if pa ever caught us together before i go any further perhaps id better explain that names like toolate and ontime arent uncommon in eastern oklahoma you see most of this land over here used to be owned by the five civilized tribes i mean the tribes themselves owned it not individuals in the tribes that system was all right during territorial days but before oklahoma could become a state the land had to be shared out they had to do away with tribal ownership so this is the way the government worked it they set a certain date right down to the hour and any child born before that hour got a share of the tribes property he got an allotment as the saying is but if he was born after that hour even a minute after it he didnt get anything he was just a plain hardup indian unless his kinfolks chose to take care of him thats the story behind names like toolate and ontime and a lot of others that have been switched around so much you can hardly recognize em for what they were abe toolate had been born after the allotment hour and his kin had soon learned better than to heir him anything matthew ontime donnas father had been born into a good allotment and hed inherited from most of his family and now he owned around five thousand acres if hed been willing to lease his land for oilwell drilling he could have been one of the richest men in oklahoma and even without oil he was plenty welloff in the back seat of the cadillac i looked down into donna ontimes smoldering black eyes and it struck me that i was right on top of yes and inside of more money than youll find in a pretty big bank but id have liked her just as well if her father hadnt had a penny i might even have liked her more if thatd been possible she smiled her teeth white and even in the darkness and cocked her head a little to one side well tommy swell i said but now you have to go isnt that right you have to go and you think youd better walk despite the fact i have to drive right by your place dont be like that donna i said you know i cant help the way pa feels never mind tommy but what can i do i said im nineteen years old and im still in high school and if i have to drop out for the spring chopping it may take me another year to finish i have to get along with pa at least until im out of school just until then no longer tommy well i tried to hedge what about your father donna i dont think hes very fond of us carvers i can handle my father well but look look honey i said its not the same way with me donna ive tried to explain to you that if pa was really my father if he hadnt done so much for me i i understand she held up a hand one of the fingers bent down item one mr carver adopted you back in mississippi after your own parents were drowned in a flood item two his wife died and rather than abandon you to an orphanage he adopted mary to look after you i might add that the law seems rather loose when a widower can adopt a fourteenyearold girl but id rather you didnt say it i said but it was probably apparent to the authorities that lust to mr carver was just a dirty word in the bible lets see now where were we oh yes item three the doctors thought you belonged in a higher dryer climate so mt carver left mississippi and brought you and mary here thats quite a lot for a man to do isnt it all for the sake of helping an infant who wasnt even related to him to become a man i think its quite a bit yes i said i havent overlooked anything i shrugged i guess not but youve overlooked something you were out in the fields doing a mans work when you were six years old and youve never known anything but work since then all youve got out of life is enough food to keep you working and enough beatings to kill two mules ive got more than that i said and pa isnt really mean hes just kind of oldfashioned and strict i see well that makes everything all right then no i said you dont see donna but i guess i wont be able to talk any more about it now i would like to have you drive me home though if i know if it wasnt for pa that wasnt what i was going to say i was going to say that i could scoot down in the seat and you could drive on past our place and she got up abruptly not speaking and slid over into the front seat she started the motor with a roar slammed in the gears and sent the car leaping out of the willows and onto the road i climbed over into the front seat and scooted down holding on for dear life the car was doing eighty by this time sailing and bouncing over the redclay ruts but there wasnt a thing i could do she was allout indianmad and when they get that way you cant reason with em id seen her this way just once before spring a year ago it was right after shed finished at the state university she had a big chrysler then and shed got a flat twothree miles out of the village and i offered to fix it for her i knew her of course since we sharecrop forty acres for matthew ontime in addition to our own ten but it was only in a nodding goodmorningmiss way well i went to work on the tire and i dont know as i said anything rather it was what i didnt say the way i acted sort of toocasual and indifferent because when youve been raised by a man like pa youre bound to absorb some of his ideas even when you know theyre completely unreasonable pa was always telling about how the five tribes had been forced out of georgia and mississippi and florida back in the early s and how they should have been crowded right on out into the pacific ocean instead of being allowed to hog onto good land that the white folks needed he was always saying that they were all streaked with the tarbrush that they were part nigger he claimed they were lazy and thieving loaded with all kinds of dirty diseases and id soon learned better than to argue with him id had to listen and listen never saying anything back until his way of thinking had almost become mine so i guess i was pretty offhand with donna insulting without saying or doing anything anyway she took it up to a point not seeming to notice and then and i dont know how else to put it she just went crazy i was hunkered down sliding the hubcap into place when it happened i heard a moan the kind you might hear from a hurtcrazy bobcat then she had thrown herself at me knocking me backwards to the road and she went down on top of me kicking and pounding and scratching and biting and i realized vaguely that she was actually trying to kill me but what i was thinking mostly was that even with her black hair tangled and her face smeared with the dirt of the road she must be the prettiest girl in the world i was thinking about what shed be like what she was bound to be like under her clothes it stopped as suddenly as it had started there wasnt any leadup to it it was just gone like a grass fire hit by a flash flood she went completely motionless looking at me wideeyed like she couldnt believe what had happened then she buried her head against my chest and began to cry i picked her up and set her in the car and well thats the way it started thats the way she was i hope she snapped out of this mad before she wrapped us around a cottonwood we went up a rise in the road i could feel the car shoot upward then the brakes went on so hard that i almost slid under the dashboard and we swung to the left horn blaring clear into the ditch and there was a blinding flash of light and someone yelled and another horn blared and i knew wed almost run down another cat then we were back on the road again still traveling fast but a lot slower than we had been and donna laughed softly she reached over and pulled my head down into her lap she scooted forward a little and i knew she wanted me to put my arms around her hips so i did we rode on in silence until we made the turn into ontime plantation which was also the turn into our place perhaps its best this way she said thoughtfully as if shed been arguing with herself i know i wouldnt like it if you were like the others kowtowing and falling all over your feet because of the money shed told me about that how shed felt about the university crowd and i liked her enough so much that id tried to talk her out of it i wanted her to have the breaks that she deserved so i told her again that she might be a little hard on people perhaps she said but you cant help thinking those things and its such a wonderful feeling when you know theres someone whos not influenced the least by money even if yes i said im like dad i guess id rather see someone with the wrong principles than no principles at all donna you know i know she lowered a hand from the wheel and stroked my head by the way i think that was your father we passed back there i thought i recognized his voice i said could you tell who he was with im afraid well it was a red and white car darling so i oh my gosh i said and i sat up a red and white car it was bound to be one of the oilcompany scouts id thought they all knew by now that they were wasting their time in trying to lease our ten acres because matthew ontime wouldnt lease his and we were almost spang in the middle of his land all of em should have known it but now here was another one a new man probably and hed be a fast talker like all the leasehounds were hed dangle a fortune in front of pa and pa would ache for it mainly for what it would mean to me and he wouldnt be able to touch it at the best hed be deepdown bitter for days twice as hard to live with as he usually was at the worst well it would be bad enough if he only tried to talk to donnas father if he only did that i wish i could help darling dad will listen to me about a lot of things but you mustnt try to talk to him i said hed wonder why you were interested and well anyway i think hes right he doesnt need money theres no reason why he should lease just to accommodate pa i would she hesitated if i could persuade dad to give me my inheritance now lets not talk about it i said no she nodded slowly perhaps wed better not shall i drive on past your house tommy no need i said mary wont say anything she throttled the cadillac down glancing up into the rearview mirror to make sure that the oilcompany car was still out of sight mary knows about us doesnt she tommy well she knows im with you whenever i can be ive had to have her cover up for me a time or two and she hates me tommy why thats crazy i laughed she feels like she has to go along with pa on everything sure you might say she hasnt got a real will of her own and probably she acts like it wasnt acting ive seen her in town a few times with your father and shes looked at me and her voice trailed off youre imagining things i said and i opened the door of the car tommy how old is she around thirtythree i guess she was somewhere around fourteen or fifteen when pa took her in shes never gone with anyone any men no maybe shes been too afraid of pa but i kind of think shes never been interested strange isnt it and shes she could be quite attractive she looks all right i guess i said shortly because somehow i was getting uncomfortable ill have to go now donna but she looked up into the mirror yes i guess youd better try to keep him from coming over to our house darling im always afraid he that he and dad might and it would change us tommy we wouldnt want it to but ill try god knows ill do my best i said she kissed me quickly and then drove away i ran crouching across the road to the house it was well i dont know how many times it was that id seen her but now that she was gone it seemed as incredible as it had the first time it was hard to believe that it had happened she had everything she was everything a man could want i glanced back over my shoulder and made a spurt toward the porch the chances were that id be a mighty sorebacked ploughhand if i wasnt a little more careful most people think of oklahoma as being new country a place that wasnt settled until the last forty years or so and thats reasonably true of part of it but it doesnt hold for the south and southeast section the five civilized tribes the creeks choctaws chickasaws cherokees and seminoles started moving in around they came up from the deep south blazing the trail of tears as they called it and they established five indian nations with towns and courts and schools and newspapers and well about everything youd find in any country of the period because maybe they had reason to hate the white people but theyd lived too long like whites to change they farmed like whites they and the slaves they brought with them they cottoned and corned the land to death it began losing topsoil then subsoil and by the time of statehood there were whole counties that werent producing a fourth of what they should have the state and federal governments finally woke up and tried to build the soil back up but the sharecrop system just naturally doesnt attract people with much brains if they understood anything about scientific farming and all they wouldnt be croppers in the first place anyway its hard to show a man where he can gain by improving land he doesnt own so as late as fifteen years ago when we moved in from mississippi a lot of land was still going to pot and it still is and probably its a good thing it was otherwise wed never even have been able to buy ten acres from one of matthew ontimes kin wed never got any more than that because that was another farm that matthew fell heir to and he knew what could be done with wornout land as well as pa he knew a lot more about the subject than pa did so all we had and were ever going to have was those ten acres and the two tenant shacks and outbuildings that had come with em but that was something it was a big step up from being ordinary croppers and wed made the most of it wed placed the two shacks endtoend with a screenedin breezeway connecting them and wed torn down one of the outbuildings and built a long porch across the front wed rubbed down the floors with sandstone and varnished em theyre probably the only cropperhouse floors in the country with varnish and wed painted the outside white with a green trim and thats something else you dont see often a painted house in cropper country it looked real nice for what it was i reached the porch just as the oil scouts car slowed down for the turn into the yard mary snatched the sweater out of my hands she thrust a bucket at me with a little water in it and disappeared inside the house i hadnt needed to tell her a thing shed known just what to do i poured the water into the wash basin and jerked up my sleeves by the time the car lights hit me i was bent over the washbench busy as all getout id just brought in an armload of firewood maybe and now i was scrubbing up for dinner the car stopped in the yard and for a minute or so there was a heavy silence then the lease scout i couldnt see what he looked like cleared his throat and i picked up the water bucket and sauntered down toward the well i just cant understand he said irritated and trying to sound like he wasnt ive been in this business all my life mr carver and i cant im trying to tell you mister is there anything that isnt clear to you what more could you ask for well give you a royalty of oneeighth of the production the usual production royalty no one can give you more than that but well pay you an advance against that royalty of twentyfive hundred dollars an acre twentyfive hundred that was twofifty more an acre than the last offer wed had think of it mr carver we pay you twentyfive thousand dollars tuhwentyfiuhv thousand cash on the barrelhead and thats just a starter why if this area here is even half as rich as our geologists report youll pa groaned he actually groaned and without seeing him i knew the way his face was twisting like a man in agony tuhwentyfiuv thousand dol stop it durn your hide stop it dont you say another word but i dont under ive been tryin to tell you pa yelled ive been tryin to tell you for an hour now you cant lease my ten acres you cant your company wouldnt let you the scout started to butt in again but pa yelled him down dont you reckon i know ive seen it tried man theyd have to check over the lease before the money was paid and theyd find out that my little ten here was all they could get and they wouldnt touch it then with a tenfoot pole they couldnt hope to moren break even if they were lucky enough to do that if youd just leave that to i aint going to leave it to you i aint gonna let you waste your time or mine whats it cost to drill a deep well anyway a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars right so you cant just have you enough room for one well an you put two or three down side by side you dont gain nothing they just drain each other off before you could drill on my acreage youd want everything in sight under lease and that biggety indian wont let you have one single acre not one mister the scout laughed a match flared as he lighted a cigarette well now im sure if we offered him the right kind of proposition all right mister said pa wearily all right its a deal then you and i have a deal you go talk to him said pa or go talk to some of the oilmen around town then come back and see me agreed well call it a deal mr carver ill bring an attorney out tomorrow morning and no said pa you wont be coming back tomorrow morning or any other time but i aint goin to argue with you about it he got out of the car swinging the white meal sack full of groceries over his shoulders he stood back to let the scout drive off and then he went plodding up toward the house not looking at me probably not even seeing me i emptied the water bailer into my bucket and ran and caught up with him here pa i said let me take that huh he blinked at me oh howdy boy hows school fine i said youre showin em huh you aint slackin up any youre showin em what us carvers can do yes sir i said i eased the meal sack onto my shoulder but he still stood blinking at me looking at me and through me he was as tall as i was tall and wiry but years of cropping had pushed his chest in curving his back and neck and he had to bend his head back to look at me his leathery upturned face made me think of one of those big snapping turtles that grab hold of something and never let go you see that fool indian girl he said indian girl almost ran me and that oil feller into the ditch good thing she aint my daughter id peel the hide right off of her yes sir i said he went on into the house nodded absently at mary and entered his bedroom the bedroom and the kitchen were the only two rooms in that house the one on the south end of the breezeway my room and marys and what passed as a sitting room was in the other house hed closed the door but we didnt have real walls between our rooms just two by eleven plank partitions and i heard him sigh and drop down on his cornshuck mattress i gave mary a grin letting her know that everything was all right and we began unloading the groceries hungry tom she said softly thats not the word for it i said you want a sweet potato while youre waitin i got them and the greens done guess i can hold out until supper i said i unwrapped the slab of side meat and started slicing it into strips she ripped open the sack of flour began measuring double handfuls into a crockery bowl him she muttered just too mean to live thats what he is aw now mary i grinned you dont really mean that i do so she tossed salt and baking powder into the flour hardly a bite in this house since yesterday morning all on account o his meanness he was in town yesterday wasnt he why couldnt heve bought groceries then instead of today well i said you know how pa figures weve only got so much to spend for food if we eat it all up at one time who eats it all who eats more around here than anyone else i shrugged well he has to do without too yeah she said bitterly i just bet he does he wants him a sandwich or a sody pop or somethin he buys it i see him doin without anything i told her shed better keep her voice down and she turned a little pale glancing at the partition then since there wasnt much else i could help with i crossed over through the breezeway to the parlor it was the best fixedup room in the place and it was a pretty good best considering mary had made the big hooked rug shed made the dyed floursack curtains shed woven the raffia mattings that padded the two easy chairs and the little settee pa and i had made the bases of the furniture rustic youd call it but the bentwillow arms and backs the parts that really prettied it up were marys work excepting the little packingbox center table and of course the kerosene lamp and the big oldtime bible practically everything in the room had been made by mary i lighted the lamp turning the flame down low to keep the wick from smoking i looked around me at the rug the furniture and curtains and suddenly for no reason i could think of i blew the lamp out again i stood there in the semidarkness the first rays of moonlight seeping through the windows and i looked out of the room because i no longer liked it i liked it but it made me uncomfortable i stared across the breezeway and into the kitchen how old quite attractive she plodded back and forth from the stove to the table from table to cupboard her bare brown legs rose tapering and strong from the old unlaced ploughshoes an old pair of mine the faded gingham dress clung to her body swelling and filling and curving as she reached up to the cupboard or bent over the table her breasts her pearshaped hips her belly her i sat down trembling a little i took out my bandanna and wiped the sweat from my face wiped my hands i didnt need to imagine i knew what they what all of her was like and why shouldnt i i thought why shouldnt i know and remember shed been like a mother to me shed been almost the same as the mother id never known no there hadnt been anything wrong back then back when i was a tot there was nothing wrong in knowing and remembering and there was nothing wrong now it was right to kiss her goodnight it was right to hug her and pat her when she was feeling blue and lonesome and beaten down it was right it was just as it should be everything was the same as it always had been except that id let donna put a crazy notion in my head that was the whole trouble and id better get over it fast because i had some real troubles to worry about id have a mess to face at school tomorrow and probably if pa did what i thought he would thered be an even worse fracas tonight with matthew ontime mary called out that supper was ready we all sat down at the oilclothcovered kitchen table and pa said a blessthisbountyeord and we ate id been halfstarved fifteen minutes before but sometimes you know when you get too hungry you lose your appetite and i guess that was the trouble with me mary kept passing me dishes and id pass em back id take a little sometimes but more often i wouldnt i just couldnt eat much you sick she said finally oh no i said just not very hungry you ought to be hungry whats the matter whats the matter with you said pa looking up from his plate whynt you stop gabbing all the time yyes sir said mary he knows whether hes hungry or not he aint no baby yes sir said mary again it was funny to watch her kind of sadfunny the minute his back was turned she couldnt say enough against him or do enough although there wasnt really anything that she could do but she couldnt face up to him for as much as a second when he spoke to her or looked at her she went down like a sunflower under a hoe that was one side of pa the way he treated mary that was awfully hard to take pa pushed back his plate and poured coffee into his saucer he lifted it up letting his eyes stray off to the right and my heart skipped a beat i knew what he was considering as he stared at the long shelf where the doublebarreled shotgun lay he squinted thoughtfully then he sighed and gave his head a little shake he put the saucer down on the oilcloth his mouth twitched god damn him he said and he was praying not cursing god damn his black soul to hell he glared from me to mary his leathery face working and he raised his hand and slapped it against the table im gonna make him im gonna make him you hear me all right pa i said i knew there wasnt any use arguing with him come on well go right now i pushed my chair back and got up all i could hope for was that he would not say anything to matthew ontime about donna matthew had taken a lot off of pa more than he had any call to but i knew thered be fireworks if pa said anything about his only daughter donna was the only family he had his wife being dead and indians set a heap of store by their families pa i hesitated theres just one thing yes said mary her voice strangely loud dont forget to tell him off about that crazy girl of his it was probably the only time in her life shed ever spoken up to pa and you can imagine how he took it up until then im pretty sure he had intended to speak his mind about donna but wild horses couldnt have made him do it now he couldnt do something that she told him to do if i hadnt been a little sore at mary id have felt sorry for her now thatd make a lot of sense wouldnt it he jeered his head thrust forward on his neck like a turkey gobblers mary didnt say anything shed started to fold up as soon as the words were out of her mouth supposin something happened to him and i had to deal with her he said arguing with himself convincing himself how you reckon shed act after id lowdowned her to her daddy hey you think id want her feelin mean and stubborn toward me it was a good argument i hoped he remembered it youre dead right pa i said youre a thousand percent right course i am he nodded anyone but that danged idjit could see it why for all we know oi ontime might be dead right now he mightnt even live the week out an what would a flighty girl want with runnin a plantation yes sir i said why any number o things could happen to him he went on someone might decide to take that uppitiness out of him or he might tumble off one of them pranky horses or he broke off glaring at mary as though shed disputed him you tellin me it couldnt happen you think i dont know whanm talkin about nno ssir better not either he jutted his chin out grab your sweater tom yes sir i said im nineteen not a man yet according to the law but ive got to go a long way back to remember when i wasnt one otherwise a man in thinking acting working you grow up fast in cotton country or you dont grow up you stop being a child just about as soon as youre out of the cradle youre concerned with cornbread not cookies beds not bedtime stories youre part of something that always has a little heavier load than it can carry that always has to put out more than it can get back so you hold up your end or it falls on you you dont drag your feet or you get left behind we walked along silently one of us on each side of the road where the walking was easiest the browndry bermuda grass rustling against our shoes the first frost was in the air out in the fields the dead cotton plants drooped sleepily it didnt seem loyal to pa to wish for the time when id be my own man because that was like wishing he was dead hed want me until then so i didnt wish not moren a little when i thought about donna no more than i could keep from wishing but i couldnt help thinking pa wouldnt be able to turn his lease but it wouldnt really change anything if he did wed eat better dress better id get to go to college but there wouldnt be any real change id still be pas man doing what he liked doing nothing that he didnt like i owed it to him i was so wrapped up in my thinking that i didnt hear him for a few seconds after he spoke it took that long for the words to register what i said why no i wanted to come with you pa you really did sure i did naturally well he said doubtfully maybe i shouldntve let you though i dont want nothin but good for you son youre gonna be someone and i cant let no trouble fall in your way ill be all right i said me i dont matter the lord put his curse on me long ago and there aint nothin left but atonement i lost my license to live the lord jehovah took it away in his righteous wrath an i could no longer dwell in his image and he gave me penance he went on talking mumbling with me putting in a yes sir now and then but not really listening id heard the same talk with variations a thousand times before from him and at the backwoods revival meetings i was dragged to i never could cipher out how people with so much work to do and so little money could do so much sinning but they all seemed to do a lot we came to the long grove of cottonwoods that led up to the plantation we came out of it and paused staring at the big white house with its columned portico and i heard pa swallow hard we went on our feet dragging a little and the road began to branch off into graveled cedarlined drives and pa stopped again he looked at me waiting and i knew what he wanted me to say think we ought to go around to the back pa what for whynt we march right up to the front well its closer around to the back i lied i dont see why we should put ourselves out any for him yeah well anyway hell be making a late patrol before he turns in we may be able to catch him out at the stables he gave in like hed intended to in the first place we followed the drive around to the rear and headed across the back lawn to the outbuildings there was a passe of them all painted white spread out along neat drives and walks like a little city dairy barn hog sheds chicken houses smoke house implement sheds blacksmith shop stables i hadnt actually believed wed find him there id meant to rouse up one of the hands and send him to the house with a message but there he came matthew ontime i mean we were a few paces short of the stable door when he came through it leading one of his big bay riding horses he saw us and stopped then he dropped the reins of the horse and came toward us he was probably as old as pa but he looked twenty years younger his shoulders seemed a yard broad under his suede jacket his head was bared and the thick barbered hair was as black as donnas and his teeth were as white and even he spoke pleasantly in a voice that was something like hers slapping the riding crop against his corduroy trousers mr carver he nodded to us tom it was a big courtesy his calling pa mister but he might not have meant it as such knowing what he did about pa he may have done it for his own sake a man like him had to be mistered and this was the only way he could swing it is this a social visit there was the faintest edge to the words or business i dont want to hurry you but i was just its about the oil said pa oil coal oil you mean you need some kerosene for the house no that aint what i mean said pa he knew hed started off wrong sounded foolish and it got his dander up im talking about the oil under my land that i cant get out account of you i see perhaps im in error but i thought id explained my position on that matter i had another offer today twentyfive hundred an acre twentyfive thousand in cash against a eighth royalty and and said pa thats all you can say and i aint fitten for field work much longer and i aint got no way of helpin tom help him to be somethin aside what i been i aint got nothin and i cant never get nothin except this way an you stand there an say and matthew ontime had stopped swinging the riding crop for the first time he sounded really friendly instead of puton friendly believe me mr carver he said i can understand your feelings and sympathize with them but i think there must be some solution to your problems other than turning a fivethousandacre plantation with sixty families on it into an oil field toms an excellent scholar he smiled at me yes i know your reputation tom thank you i said im sure he could get a scholarship and a student loan and an how about the farm howd i keep it goin without him to help youre cropping forty for me now cut it down to twenty and ill increase your share enough to make up for the cut we dont want no gifts said pa all we want is what were entitled to well im afraid matthew hesitated what did you pay for your ten mr carver fifty fiftyfive an acre fifty but i know youve put in a great many improvements done wonders with it so suppose i do this since youre dissatisfied and need ready cash you can go on cropping shares with me as much or as little land as you like and ill take the ten off your hands ill give you a hundred and a quarter no ill make that a hundred and fifty an acre a hundred and fifty pa yelled it out yes that seems fair dont you think so tom it was much more than fair but even if id been of a mind to say so i didnt get the chance fair pa yelled i just got through tellin you i was offered twentyfive hundred a acre but that was for the mineral rights matthew spoke carefully like he was talking to a child its not worth that as farm land course it aint why elsed i be wantin to lease it for oil but matthew laughed shortly irritably a lot less irritably i reckon then he felt reaching behind him he grasped the reins of his horse dont you think mr carver he said youre being just a little unreasonable whats unreasonable about wantin twentyfive thousand dollars i got a right to it aint i its my land aint it and the five thousand adjoining acres are mine surely you cant expect me to naw i dont expect you to dont expect you to do nothin thats decent an makes sense you dont need money you got yours an you dont care if anybody else has nothin or not now mr carver to heck with you please youve come here to get this matter straightened out now lets get it straight i was getting pretty puzzled puzzled along with the uneasiness because matthew ontime didnt have to take lip from anyone let alone a sharecropper and hed never been known to do it until now i almost shook my head wondering watching the straight proud way he stood watching the flash of his black eyes the white even teeth and the reason came to me the only reason he could have for doing it and i felt awfully happy but also sad and scared i remember how donna had been the day id stopped to fix her tire cool and pleasant one second a devil out of hell the next the only thing thats real mr carver you know how much just a little land can mean to a man growing land land held in fee simple you can take care of it and it takes care of you now its true that i have far more than the average share but well thats the point in a way dont you see why should i sacrifice a way of life and the principles i live by to get more now yeah but i aint let me finish please lets examine every side of this question it takes years before land thats been drilled for oil can be brought back to farm land sometimes it can never be brought back its worthless eroded and gullied soaked with oil and salt water and what happens to the people who farm that land what would happen to the sixty families who work this plantation pa grunted what do i care what happens to em a bunch o white trash an niggers and halfbreeds i see said matthew ontime slowly is that your attitude also tom youre talkin to me snapped pa im speaking to tom what about it tom i waited pa jerked his head go ahead boy answer him yes sir i said i forced the words out thats my attitude im sorry but perhaps its just as well now youll have to excuse me he started to turn toward his horse pa leaped forward and caught him by the arm i aint through talkin to you you i couldnt see what happened it was so fast but pa suddenly rose up in the air and when he came down again he was a good two yards from where hed been standing he landed on his feet upright but it took all of the breath out of him it would seem said matthew ontime quietly that im not through talking to you either youre not cropping for me any longer carver im dividing your forty among my other tenants bbut whatll i i dont give a damn carver but if i find you on my land after tonight youll be treated as a common trespasser he nodded curtly and put a hand on the saddle pommel and pa was screaming you dirty halfbreed you and matthew was on the horse and the horse was wheeling rearing its hooves raised high in the air and pa stumbled backwards and fell rolled screaming but no longer cursing and the hooves came down barely missing him and raised high again i came to my senses and sprang i took a running spring arms spread and matthew ontime came out of the saddle with me on top of him i clubbed my fist and hit him once twice then i staggered up back looking down at him at her watching him as he sat up brushing blood from his face what you bawlinfor whats the matter you idjit pa was shaking me by the arm pulling me toward the road come on dang you we hang around here an the barnyard floodlights were coming on and doors were slamming and heavy feet were pounding toward us we ran it rained during the night and it was still misty in the morning but pa was off for town the minute hed gulped his breakfast he knew that matthew ontime would have too much pride to put the law on us for what had happened so he couldnt get into town fast enough he could go around crowing about how wed beaten up one of the richest men in oklahoma and hed be perfectly safe i set off for school earlier than i usually did almost looking forward to the trouble id find there you know or maybe you dont maybe you dont know how it is when youre so sick inside sick and hopelessfeeling that you want someone to cross you a little just enough sos youll have an excuse to make them feel bad too ordinarily at least in the winter when the land was fallowing i cut across fields to the county road but this morning i had to go around by the plantation road the one donnad brought me home on there wasnt any doubt in my mind that matthew ontimed meant just what he said about trespassing as far as that plantation went he was the law in fact both of his overseers had deputy sheriff commissions they wouldnt haul you into court unless they caught you stealing or some such thing but they were apt to make you wish that they would take you to court i walked along in the mist my sweater dampening down near the intersection of the county nate laverty whistled at me and he and his brother pete came running down the path from their shack they were big thin bucktoothed kids about my age but several grades behind me pete asked me whyn hell i was all bundled up in a sweater i didnt see him and nate wearing sweaters did i what kind of a sissy was i he laughed you havent got a sweater i said you havent got anything but those raggedassed overalls and your mealbag shirts nates face fell pete tried to spit easy like like he hadnt heard me and his teeth got in the way spilling it over his chin shucks i laughed dont you know when a mans kidding why if i hadnt made the football team id have been worse offn you guys what you mean worse offn us said pete were doin all right goddammit i yelled and they stopped startled they knew id never cursed before goddammit it was easy now stop picking me up on everything hey said pete someone been steppin on your tail boy i pa and i had a runin with matthew ontime hes takin our acreage away from us yeah their eyes got wide how come because hes a nogood sonofabitch thats why mr ontime you must be talkin about someone else fella goddammit im talkin about yes sir said pete firmly you sure must be talkin about someone else there never was a fairer man than mr ontime nowheres the school doors were open because of the drizzle and we went on in they left me on the first landing since their homerooms were on that floor i went up the stairs to the second and there was miss trumbull waiting for me she smiled and spoke her pincenez glasses sparkling sos you couldnt see her eyes she was a prim pretty strict old lady and a lot of the students didnt like her but shed always been awfully nice to me will you step into mr redbirds office with me thomas i told him wed be in as soon as you arrived what for i said i havent done anything certainly you havent mr redbird knows it and i know it well then come along thomas she took me by the arm and i went along we went into the principals office and she closed the door he smiled at her and winked at me and we sat down on the other side of his desk he was dark of course darkhaired and darkeyed he taught my science class along with being principal and wed always got along real well well tom he grinned we have a terrible accusation against you our esteemed custodian mr toolate tells us i know what he told you whynt you have him here to tell me well now that awful man miss trumbull clucked her tongue i really cant blame thomas for being annoyed hes not worth getting annoyed mr redbird shrugged we have to put up with him it seems but tom just what was the trouble theres been some lightfingered work around here in yes and you know whos behind it ive got a pretty good idea yes tell us what happened were you teasing abe trying to get a rise out of him he tried to get smart with me i said and i threw a scare into the dirty halfbreed thomas said miss trumbull and her face went all tight and funny but mr redbird kept on smiling tell me you didnt put anything in your pocket tom he said thats all you need to do i suppose youd take my word against his of course i would i hesitated but i was so sick inside and what was the use anyway sure you would youd side against one of your own kind why do you try to cover it up anyway whynt you spell your name right red bird instead of pushin yourself off as a white man why get out he said get out get out gggg miss trumbull jumped up in front of me she jerked me up and whirled me around and shoved me out the door and she sure moved fast and strong for a little old lady get your books thomas youre on indefinite suspension shove the books i said im not coming back and i ran down the stairs and out of the building i heard her faintly calling after me thomas thomas carver then the bell for the first class started ringing and i couldnt hear anything else the sound followed me down the road and i had to bang my ears with my palms to drive it away i came to the draw under the willows where donna usually parked i walked back in under the trees and hunkered down against a rock thinking if i sat there awhile maybe until noon shed show up because she had done that several times shed drive by the school just before twelve signaling with the horn and id run down at noon and wed have as much as a halfhour together but but i didnt reckon shed be here today not today or any other day i walked on toward home and the mist turned into a hard chilling rain i was soaked in no time and i hardly seemed to notice it just didnt matter donna donna huhuh boy never again but i could i could slip up there at night yeah and maybe get your tail shot off i got to try shed listen anyway wouldnt she shed at least listen wouldnt a woman listen to the only man that listen whatd you say to her and suppose you could smooth over last night after shed bragged you up to him whatll you say then to hell with pa im my own man you name it and ill do it i maybe not you boy huhuh you wait i yelled maybe i will i shook myself it was like coming out of a bad dream and i felt kind of rested and eased i brushed the water rain i guess it was out of my eyes i started running and i ran the rest of the way home i stopped on the porch and kicked the mud off my shoes i wiped them solewards and sideways against the sacking mary had laid out i went into the kitchen well said pa what you doin home he was sitting down with his jeans legs rolled up and his feet in a pan of water he looked mighty sour i figured he hadnt had such a good time bragging about matthew ontime getting his comeuppance what you doin home he repeated why aint you in school i looked at mary but of course there wasnt any help there she looked like she was about to keel over herself you get into some trouble is that it yyes sir they kicked you out whats the difference i said what difference does it make pa we cant stay here on ten acres well have to find a new place to crop and they kicked you out you got kicked out i brought you up out of nothing and pushed you up into something to be proud of and now youve went and pushed yourself back almighty god writ his will as plain as day an you set yourself against it you flouted his will pa i said i couldnt help it all i did was he gave me a stone an i was to bring bread in return an you set yourself against him he held his hand out and mary scurried forward with a towel he took one foot then the other out of the pan drying them carefully wiping between each toe he got up dropping the towel on the chair and went into his bedroom he came out with a long thick harness strap face up to that wall he said mary moaned softly and threw her apron up over her face pa shot her a glance flexing the harness strap he jerked his head at me you better do what i tell you boy he said you better do it fast i had a mind to do it he couldnt hurt me much more than i already was and maybe it would give me the push away from him that i needed maybe it would take away the maybe about what i was going to say to donna if i got to see her but but i couldnt let him go ahead it would be mean spite to let him because i knew how hed feel afterward when he found out the truth i knew how bad hed feel if i was going to make a break all right but it was my job to make it i couldnt spite him into making it for me pa i said i didnt face up there but i didnt his arm went up in a swift looping motion and the harness strap zinged and popped it whipped around my neck and he jerked on it and i went down i toppled forward going down on my hands and knees the strap uncoiled and he swung it again and it did hurt it always hurt and this time it did something worse than hurt something evil and sickening and i knew id better stop him fast it came to me that what i was feeling must be hate and it sickened and scared me because despite all the puton id guess id never known what it meant to hate until then somehow id never learned how to hate and if it was like this i didnt want to learn any more i knew i hadnt better the strap came down on my back again the third the fourth time and he swung it again i started to get up and hed shifted ends and the buckle whipped around my shoulders nicking me in the corner of my mouth i stood up he looked at me and he took a step backward and his hand trembled when he pointed to the floor yyou better get down there boy i started to shake my head then i nodded all right i said if thats the way you want it i seen it coming on i seen you settin yourself up go ahead i said dont bother talking yourself into it it ought to be easy for you by now i he backed away another step i guess hed had to because id edged toward him id done it without knowing it my eyes fixed on his the blood welling across my lips whats wrong with you son go ahead i said go on pa you know whats wrong everythings wrong and always was thats how you get your exercise takin it out of me go on whats the sense in stopping now im tellin you boy you better make me i said make me tell you pa he brought the strap up fast it whistled and popped as he swung it up above his head and i grinned at him feeling the bad feeling that was now good to feel it was like a coon must feel when a trap gets him and he has to chew off a leg to get out i laughed and the strap came down it fell from his hand to the floor tell me tom im asking you to i told him watching what happened to his face and for a little i guess it felt good but i knew it wasnt good so i stopped looking at him i talked as fast as i could and still make it clear sos it would be over with fast for him i finished and he stood clenching and unclenching his hands his head sagged lower than id ever seen it on his turkeygobbler neck then he pushed it back sos he could look at me and his lips moved that thats just the way it was son you know i wouldnt steal anything pa no what i meant i mean you didnt tell em you didnt tell em you we was hungry no i said i didnt shame you pa i just let em think i was a thief he nodded and some of the pain went out of his face it seemed to leap from his to mine and i turned quickly before he could see it and went out the door i ran across the yard ducking under the clothes lines and into the old cowbarn that we used as a woodshed i sat down on the chopping block and buried my face in my hands and i tried to work up into tears i tried as hard as i could and the tears wouldnt come and it was worse than learning what hate was i guess its the worst thing there is when you lose everything youve lived by and you cant even cry about it because its not even worth that much a single solitary tear and it never was i didnt look up when i heard him coming he hesitated in the doorway i knew he was there because he was between me and the light and he cleared his throat then he came in stumbling a little as he stepped over the lintel and after a minute or two he put his hand on my shoulder tom he said tommy boy i moved my shoulder a little his hand fell away his feet scuffled in the wood chips and pretty soon i could sense the semidarkness and i knew he was standing back in front of the door he was staring off across the long broad fields raising his eyes above the red clay soil to the horizon looking across the fieryred plains of hell with its endless gauntlet of deadbrown imps the cotton the cotton cotton cotton closing his eyes to them and seeing only the horizon and its towering ranks of derricks steel giants snorting and chuckling amongst themselves sneering wonderingly at the cotton and the bentbacked pigmies amidst it huffing and puffing and belching up gold look tom he said softly come an look at em and i stayed where i was you hear me boy he said and i got up you do things out of habit you keep on for a little while i went to the door and stood with him look at em he whispered just lookit that then he said tuhwentyfiuhv thousand dollars he said it just like the oil scout had said it he repeated it a second time and he started to do it a third but his voice was dragging and he gulped and swallowed midway of the twentyfive and he didnt finish god damn his eternal soul he said and i said it after him its his fault everythings happened is his fault he aint fitten to live no i said he isnt he started to look at me but i reckon those oil derricks were a sight prettier and habit was strong in him too anyway if he had an idea that we werent goddamning the same person he didnt show it theres not much to do by way of entertainment around a croppers shack even as nice a one one thats actually two as ours and thats probably as it should be because most of the year anyhow youve got plenty to do outside but sometimes its kind of hard to bear just sitting and not doing its hard when youve got nothing to do but think and youve got something to think with and your thinking wont seem to lead anywhere we had an early supper and pa seemed a little out of himself he didnt holler at mary hardly at all and a couple of times he passed dishes to me and i guess that sounds like a pretty commonplace thing but it wasnt with pa i couldnt remember when hed ever done it before after supper he went over into the parlor and read the bible for an hour or so the old testament where most of the firstclass curses are called down on people he read to himself he didnt speak out loud i mean but his lips kept moving with the words and i could read them too just by watching him finally he closed the book and sat staring straight into the lamp flame then he sighed and took off his dimestore glasses and tucked them into the bibpocket of his overalls guess ill go to bed he said good time to catch up on my sleep these rainy nights i didnt say anything his trying to make conversation took me by surprise you dont need to though he said stay up as long as you want i guess he was surprised then himself because he ducked his head suddenly and hurried out he went across the breezeway and out on the porch and he stayed there a minute or two taking a leak i suppose to save a wet trip to the privy then he stamped back inside and his bedroom door slammed shut mary looked across at me from the settee whats got into him just trying to be decent i said huh she grunted hes got a sight of practicin to do before he makes out mean ol devil you wait i bet i fix hint one of these days yeah i wasnt really listening to her i couldnt imagine her fixing anyone unless she fainted and fell on em you think i wont but i betcha i do ill take the chop ax to him no i said dont even think that mary well theys other ways bound to be some way of puttin him in the hole i yawned and put my hand over my mouth why do you stay on mary he cant make you well i i her eyes went sort of empty and she began fumbling with the safetypin at the neck of her dress her fingers moved faster and faster and that was the only light in her eyes there was the glint of a pin id asked her a pretty sorry question you dont ask the dead why they dont get up and walk sho now i said listen to me talk how in tall cane would i make out without you to do for me you she stopped fumbling with the pin i bet youd really miss me wouldnt you why you know i would i said she blushed as much as she could under the tan and looked pleased and i thought what about her whatll happen to her if i pull out and i figured it wouldnt make too much difference reckon ill turn in myself i said and stood up how about you might as well she said i went over and kissed her on the cheek and she held onto me a minute brushing my hair back she pressed herself against me turning her head against my chest tommy you want me to rubyour back for you igot some good chicken fat in the kitchen its all right i said it doesnt hurt anymore i dont mind i jus soon as not tommy i like doin things for you its all right i said id id do mmost anything you asked me tommy you ask me somethin an see if i wont goodnight i said and i gave her a little slap on the bottom and went into my bedroom i closed the door and sat down on the bed and after a moment or two i realized i was holding my breath i took my shoes off and stretched out lying still to keep the cornshucks from rustling it was dark there not being any windows the only light came from the crack under the door i heard her shoes creak and the light all but vanished and i knew shed turned the wick down just leaving the usual nightlight in case someone had to get up then her door closed and there was a soft clumpclump as her shoes came off and her mattress creaked and rattled it rattled and rattled and i lay still almost not breathing then there was a little scraping thud against the partition and she whispered you asleep tommy and i cant hardly sleep at all i just caint sleep tommy and please tommy you know whatchacallit i been waitin an waitin an wwaitin i closed my eyes wondering how donna had probably seen it in her right from the first when i right there with her every day had to have it thrown at me before i could see it and i guessed women could just naturally spot those things because maryd sure tabbed the way donna stood with me i knew she must have the first time shed looked at her thatd probably touched mary off that had been the sign she was waiting for she was too beaten down to start anything but once it was started shed begun to move in tommy the thin planks squeaked as she pressed against them we could stay right where weare tommy n do it n do it an he couldnt catch us in a mfflion years tommy she scratched against the wood take your knife tommy an right here where im scratchin you cn it must have been a couple hours before she gave up and went to sleep she began to snore but i lay where i was a little longer i knew what i was going to do but it was hard to get started it was hard to break with habit go against pa i ticked off that holdback id already gone against pa whether he knew it or not and i was going to keep right on going the rain id got rained on before and i hadnt melted anyway the rain had practically stopped howd i get ahold of her well i probably wouldnt catch her outside on a night like this but i knew where her room was in the downstairs south wing of the house shed told me one time playteasing pretending like i could come and see her as well as not if i really wanted to suppose some of the hired hands caught me one of the riding bosses well let em let em try something i eased my feet to the floor and fumbled around until i found my shoes i tied the laces together swung them around my neck and stood up i got the door open timing the squeak sound with one of marys snores i closed it on another snore and tiptoed across to the porch door i got it open without any real racket and ran crouching to the road i wiped my feet on some wet weeds hopping first on one foot then the other i put my shoes on and got going again two miles is a pretty long hike on a muddy country road but i seemed to make it in almost nothing flat id say you name it and ill do it honey you call me any dirty name you want to and ill own up to it ill apologize to him ill let him punch me you just point out the row honey and ill hoe it heck she wouldnt hold a grudge i came to the cottonwood grove and walked through it just short of the end then i swung off to the right taking cover where i could behind the trees and shrubs that skirted the lawn i moved around parallel with the house until i came to a curving hedge that bordered the flower beds i followed it in crouching toward the house until i came to its end i hunkered down staring at the windows of her room so near and yet such a heck of a ways off i thought come out honey please come out please please come out donna i thought it as hard as i could and it seemed like i saw something move at one of the windows i could almost have sworn she was there and that she knew i was but i waited and she didnt come and i figured wishing wouldnt make her so i picked up some gravel from the path and tucked it into my pocket and i bellied down and crawled i crawled under the shrub and on to another one the last cover if you could call it that between me and the house i could toss the gravel from there i reckoned but i had to rest a minute first all that duckwalking and crawling had run into time and i was all out of breath i rested stretched out on my stomach with my head on my arms and i beganto feel how wet i was how soggy and smeared i pushed myself up shivering a little with the damp and got to my feet i stood bent over trying to peer around the shrub and like a cold wave hitting me i seemed to freeze that way the hair crawled on the back of my neck my stomach seemed to edge down toward my groin and my chest squeezed around my lungs i stood real still i couldnt bring myself to move then i did move i managed to turn around and there he was so close to me that i couldve touched him if id been of a mind to it was one of the riding bosses a big breed they called chief sundown though he wasnt a real chief of course he had a leather jacket pulled on over his undershirt and a long black bullwhip was coiled over his shoulder donna stood back of him and a little to one side her white houserobe or maybe it was what you call a dressinggown belted in tightly at the waist chief sundown shifted his glance a little and she nodded to him he moved back sort of sinking into the shadow of the far shrub and she moved forward all right she snapped her eyes like black coals in the whiteash of her face what are you doing here why i tried to smile but my face was too stiff why i wanted to see you donna you didnt need to sneak around here at night you could have seen me today i was there at noon and again this evening but well i didnt think youd be there i didnt think youd want to see me i see but you thought i would tonight is that it i tried to smile again i was scared and i could feel my temper coming up a little but she was so close and and i wanted everything to be all right so much well she said and i just shook my head smiling i could look down and see the beginning swell of her breasts i could see them actually the neck of her gown was open and they began so high up i could see past them imagine past because how can you forget or get over whats been part of you i could see the flat stomach and the white the creamcolored hips flaring swelling just enough and i remember how warm and soft theyd been the night before when wed ridden with my arms around them donna honey i said for gods sake and i reached for her and she moved back gripping the front of her gown and back in the shadows there was a quick slithering sound my hands dropped down to my sides i came here to tell you i was sorry i said i was wrong pa was wrong ill do anything i can to make it up to you youre appealing to the wrong person she said after last night ive stopped interfering in dads affairs ive decided hes a much better judge of people than i am appealing i said i guess i dont tell your pa hell have to see my father tell him that the influence which youve doubtless boasted of having with me no longer exists but i didnt get it for a minute and when i did i was kind of stunned the blood seemed to drain out of my face you mean you mean you think id ttry to get you to well she hesitated you must admit i dont admit anything but what ive told you ive been all mixed up and an i wanted to try and get straight again but if you think id id do that you know i couldnt do that why the one thing thats always bothered me is you having so much and wait wait a minute tom she held up a hand i dont think wed better talk any more tonight this has been building up for a long time and its not something to be settled in the middle of the night behind a tree i tried to see you twice today i needed to see you but you couldnt be bothered you i told you you felt that you didnt have to you could hurt me worse than ive ever been hurt and then when you got good and ready you could come around and id fall into your arms wait perhaps you dont actually feel that way but thats the way things have been and i think its gone on long enough i she faltered im upset tom i cant be fair to you now i think youd better go bebefore i please go quickly sure i will i said will i see you tomorrow honey i i ddont know i just cant the next day there at the usual place i she shivered oh tom why did you i know i know honey ill be there every evening until you come and you just take your time but wont you send that breed away for a minute honey well she sniffled and looked over her shoulder and my arms started to come up because i didnt feel like i could wait another second then her head snapped back around and what i saw in her face i never want to see in another cold white sick burningmad crazy sick but her voice was just a whisper breed she whispered breed i said donna honey you know i it finally came out didnt it she backed away you dont think much of breeds do you she kept backing away thats why you came here isnt it to finish up the job why not red meats cheap isnt it you know how cheap it is dont you you donna i said and i made a grab for her and she wasnt there but the chief was he was standing between us yes maam he said his eyes on me mmake him go take him away run him away yes maam he put two fingers between his teeth and whistled and back in the trees somewhere there was a nicker it was one of the plantations big bays all their horses were bays it came up to the chief and hung its head over his shoulder he reached back and stroked its muzzle never looking away from me you understand me chief yes maam he stepped back and swung into the saddle run him run him run him yes maam i backed up against the shrub i started backing around it pushing myself back into the branches yyou try it you try it and by god ill the bull whip came off of his shoulder he let it trail back behind him then snapped the handle and there was a craack like a rifle going off and a red hot iron seemed to jab through the toe of my shoe searing clear up through my toes and into my ankle id known what was going to happen and id set myself for it id told myself i wouldnt jump or yell id die before i did it but i didnt die i jumped i yelled i threw myself around the shrub and the whip swung again craackcraack and the hot iron jabbed me in the heels i threw myself frontwards and i got another load in the toes i backwards craackcraack frontwards craackcraack toes craack heels craack i leaped backwards away from the shrub and i stumbled went down sprawling on my shoulders and the fire raced through my soles i rolled over i went into a running crawl my eyes filling with blood my insides pushing up into my throat and craackcraack craackcraack left foot right foot left foot right foot craackcraack i rancrawled craaack i screamed and ran stumbling blind craaack i fell down screaming crawlrunning running falling and rolling and craack craack craack crack lights had come on there was a blur of sounds laughing shouts a scream the same scream over and over but they were just a blur like the lights i couldnt really hear them i couldnt really hear myself what i was yelling everything had gone numb inside of me and there wasnt any pain any more or anything else i stood up i turned around and faced him run me i yelled try and make me run craack craack go on run me goddam craack craack you

tom snap out of it son he was shaking me a man with a bandage over one eye and a strip of courtplaster down his cheek she was sagged against him still and white her head hung back over his arm she couldnt see me run now because her eyes were closed tom he was holding her with one arm and shaking me with the other are you badly hurt tom run me i said come in with me i want to talk to you will you do that son will you come in with me tom with donna and me run me i said he hesitated then he got his other arm under donnas legs and he lifted her and her head hung back eyes closed and now she couldnt see me run you should have known better than this chief yes sir but miss donna said to i know i know matthew ontime looked at me again he tried again now listen to me tom i dont know how this trouble arose but im sure it can be adjusted you were in a difficult position last night i was in an unaccustomed one my opinion of your fosterfather isnt well we wont go into that but as far as you and i are concerned you and i and donna im sure im more than willing to try to work something out that run me run me i turned and hobbled off across the grass and he said take care of him chief and i saw him going catercorner toward the house carrying donna with her eyes closed sos she couldnt see me run the chief touched my elbow teetering along at my side in his highheeled boots no hard feelings boy you aint sore are you you couldnt make me run i said no one can make me run no sir they sure cant aint a chance in the world so you just sit down here now and ill get a car out and run you home no one can run me sure but i started running running by myself because i wanted to and the last i heard was no hard feelings huh no sense in i didnt run very far just until i was in the grove and out of sight until id showed em that they hadnt hurt me a bit i fell against a tree wrapping my arms around it and i sank my teeth into the bark to keep from yelling i hugged it trying to ease the weight off my feet finally i was able to let go to stagger on to the next tree and i got through the grove that way moving from tree to tree i sat down on the edge of the ditch and scooted myself along sideways with my hands until i came to a little rain pool i pushed my feet down into it letting the water come up over my shoe tops and soak down inside i sat that way for quite a spell it helped some but i could tell my feet werent ever going to soak free they were swollen into the leather like sausage in a gut i was glad i didnt have any socks on i swung around facing the road and pulled out the laces then i got a good grip on the toe and heel braced myself and jerked and yelled i jerked and yelled and jerked and yelled i kept jerking because it looked like i might have waited too long as it was those were the only shoes i had and i didnt want to have to dig them off with my knife i got them both off and put my feet back in the ditch and they still ached like heck and burned where the hide had come off but the swelling started going out of them and they felt a lot better than they had i began to feel better too some of the craziness seemed to go out of my head with the swelling i got up and hobbled toward home walking in the mud as much as i could i tried to think back to the point id been at earlier in the evening i mean like id done something pretty bad myself and they were entitled to pay me off but i was a long way from feeling good enough to come around to that viewpoint punching a man was one thing it was something else to take a whip to him making him cringe and crawl and scream in front of his in front of a girl and god knows how many other people and now remembering the voices and the laughter i reckoned quite a few others must have seen it that was a lot different it was something you had to fan mighty hard to cool off so i wasnt crazy any more i could see that while id probably got a lot worse than id asked for i had been asking for something i could trace the fault back where it had started to pa hed started it they finished it that was the right of the matter but i could just see that you know only see it and until i could accept it i knew it would be an awfully good idea for me to keep out of their way and them out of mine i had to sit down and rest several times and it was just short of dawn when i got home the stars were fading out and the man in the moon was down to a shadow of himself and the coolwarm breeze that washes the path for the sun was rippling through the cotton stalks the air had a sweet cleandirt smell i couldnt hear a raincrow anywhere it looked like it could be a pretty nice day i got into the house and into my bedroom without anything happening i undressed and wiped myself off with the inside of my clothes and tossed them under the bed i laid out some clean clothes and slid under the blankets and stretched out and and mary was shaking me tom wake up now breakfasts ready and waitin i tried to pull the covers over my head it didnt feel like id hardly had time to close my eyes she kept shaking me tom dont want any breakfast i said please tom hhes waitin an since when did he wait on anyone tom you just got to i dont know what to tell him an hell all right i said get out and let me dress she left and i got up i dressed pulling on a pair of socks but leaving my shoes off i walked out into the kitchen making myself not limp he looked up at me over his saucer of coffee then looked down into it again woke up ahead of yourself boy he said trying for a joke plumb forgot your shoes i didnt forget them i said im going back to bed after breakfast i thought that would get a rise out of him but he didnt seem to be in a rising mood he couldnt believe what was happening hed had his own way too long but he knew thered been a big shift in the situation and he was moving cautiously until he could shift his sights with it i sat down and put grits and biscuits on my plate i broke the biscuits in two poured sorghum on them and began to eat going back to bed eh he said thats right how come how come not i took a swallow of coffee set the cup down and looked at him steadily he picked up his saucer again well no reason i guess reckon if youre tired beds the place for you thats the way i figured it i said i went on eating he wanted to ask questions let him ask em you uh you got pretty upset about yesterday had a hard time goin to sleep i shrugged damn him he said damn his black soul to hell he finished breakfast gulping it down a little slower than usual he got up took down his hat and jumper from a wall peg and put them on he pulled a straw out of the broom and tucked it into the corner of his mouth he bobbled it up and down looking partly out the door and partly at me watching me out of the corner of his eyes whatd you what you think wed better do son what do i think i said youre asking me for advice well now he paused i thought i was thinkin you an med kinda scamper around today and look for another place to crop i was figurin wed better do that he paused again dont land somethin pretty soon theyll all be spoken for thats right i nodded i thought wed better do that son awful late now even to be lookin people that aint settin tight from last year has already made their jump cant set on a place all winter an then move when the work starts thats right i said you uh you gonna be through eatin pretty soon when i get filled up im eating while its here to eat im not doing any more digging after other peoples leavings there was a crash then the ringrattleplop a plate makes when it spins on the floor and falls face down but pa didnt say anything to mary or even look at her i heard her ease the plate off the floor and slide it into the dishpan i thought thats the way hed like to have you yeah and thats what youd deserve anyone thats got feet to walk on and arms to swing has got it coming to em if they let it but uh o course he was saying o course if youre thats right too i said im not going his head snapped around fast and the broom straw fell out of his mouth our eyes met and held and then he shifted back to the doorway damn him he gritted damn his black halfbreed heart he aint fitten to live i poured myself more coffee rattling and scraping the spoon in the cup as i stirred in the sugar you aint heard of anything have you son you aint heard no one speak of a piece of land that might be open not a thing i said like you say its all spoken for by this time well i guess i better if a man looks hard enough huhuh i shook my head there isnt any and no ones going to make a place for you they dont want you around understand youre a good farmer a lot better than the average but no one wants a tenant who thinks hes god almighty landlords dont need to pay a man to fuss and nag at em and call em dirty names i saw his mouth twitch and he started to turn his head again but he wouldnt see the truth yet he couldnt give up as long as there was anything to grab at youre mighty upset son dont know as i can rightly fault you much after the way they treated you at school no i said you cant fault me sure wish i could figure out what to do reckon ill have to sell our ten here if i cant do anything else to matthew ontime you cant sell to anyone else no ones going to buy a tenacre plot inside another mans plantation itd cost him more to work than he could take out of it but damn him he yelled what am i gonna do hey a mans got to live i dont know i said he brushed his mouth with the back of his hand rubbing it back and forth you spose i could get a loan the banks ought to make me a loan on it hadnt they they probably would i said theyd know they could turn it to ontime when you defaulted how how much son they ought to treat me pretty good anyways hadnt they it aint just unimproved acreage yes theyll treat you good i said you might even get enough to well i wouldnt want to get your hopes up too high i might be all wrong but the way i see it with all these improvements and all you might get enough to uh uh oh i kind of hate to name a figure ill probably set it too high and then youll be disappointed no i wont tom his buzzards neck was almost tangent to his body i wont hold it agin you could i get enough to buy another place a bigger one maybe thats run down well enough to pay down on another place well now tom how much you know about them things all right i said you got enough now to ride until spring when you can draw against your crop if you were going to have a crop say that you got your loan today thatd leave you about sixseven months to go before the mortgage fell due and you had to move yeah so how much just about enough to live through those months three or four hundred dollars three or three or four hundred bbut if youre lucky i said and i got up and strolled back through the breezeway and lay down again i waked up around noon when i smelled cornbread and blackeyed peas cooking id slept soundly and i waked up to that smell and it was like i hadnt eaten in a week the tension had eased out of me and i felt starved my feet were in pretty good shape about as good as they were apt to be in without a week or sos rest i got my shoes on and went over into the kitchen i guess the way id stood up to pa had taken marys mind off the way shed carried on last night anyway she didnt seem skittish or embarrassed just halfscared only half since he was gone and puzzled and sullen what was i trying to do why did i act like that i kept it up and pa would be giving me whatfor forget it i said lets talk about something pleasant like what fr instance like that food or better still lets just eat it she didnt make a move to help me so i took a plate from the shelf and went over to the stove then she said oh ill do it you just set down tommy i said ill get it and i did i took my plate outside along with a cup of coffee and sat down on the edge of the porch she came out too a couple of minutes later she hesitated waiting i guess for an invitation to sit beside me when she didnt get it she went over and sat down against a post her legs crossed in front of her on the porch she crossed them one way then another smiling at me i went on eating i was looking at the ground you aint mad at me tommy i was just playin about not gettin your dinner i shook my head still looking down at the ground i wasnt mad about the food but i wasnt sure i wasnt going to be mad about something else its a real nice day aint it tommy too nice a day to be mad at anyone yeah i said grounds still a little damp though or maybe you hadnt noticed whats to notice about it tracks footprints when was she here her smile froze i when was who here aint nobody been here i sat the cup inside my plate and put it down on the porch i went over to her and caught her by the shoulders and jerked her up on her feet when bbout an hour ago you was sleepin so good an but you didnt tell her that you told her i wasnt here didnt you she set her jaw scared but stubborn i gave her a good hard shake id decided that i wasnt really mad about not seeing donna it was better as id decided last night if i didnt see her for a day or so but i still didnt like what mary had done even a little bit i was through with having people take care of my business and then tell me about it afterwards if they told me at all answer me you told her i wasnt here i all right i did you been in enough trouble without what did she say nothin what did she say i tightened my grip what did she say tommy she gasped youre lemme go tommy she said she understood thats all she jus said i understand an then she left she didnt leave any message didnt say for me to meet her anywhere nono tommy i let loose of her i figured shed probably told the straight of things donnad felt like she had to make a try at seeing me but shed realized too that it was probably a little too soon she knew it and i knew it but i sure did want her id never wanted anything so much in my life i was rested and halfway at ease in my mind for the first time in years and i wanted yyou aint mad tommy no i said but understand me mary dont you ever as long as im here do a thing like this again do you understand as long as youre not going away tommy ddont go i asked you if you understood me she looked up at me her eyes searching my face then she nodded smiling meekly yes tommy she said you know ill do whatever you want i stepped back all at once my hands were awfully sweaty well i said thats that tommy she smiled at me smoothing the dress down over her breasts pulling it down dont i always do what you want didnt i tell you i would i think ill i started to say i was going to lie down again but i changed my mind i think ill take a walk i said ill go with you itll be real nice down there by im going out and sit by the road i said and i headed away from the porch fast and i didnt look back i walked down the road a piece stepped across the ditch and sat down on the bank i turned my hands this way and that looking at them not really seeing anything of course but just to be doing something i scraped a little skinned spot on one of my knuckles i picked and tugged at the beginning of a hangnail until id turned it into a real one i wondered why a mans hands feel so empty at times sometimes ive been out somewhere walking across a field maybe and my hands will get that empty feeling and ill have to scoop up some clods or grab off a couple cotton bolls i feel like ill go crazy if i dont get something in my hands just anything at all to hang onto i took my old knife out of my pocket whetted it against the sole of my shoe and started whittling on a piece of stick it wasnt much of a knife wouldnt hold an edge much longer than a hogll hold its breath but it was something for my hands i tried to think more or less to keep from thinking about other things whatd ever become of that pretty good knife id had id found it like i had this one seems like if a man keeps his eyes open hes almost bound to find a pocketknife lying in a field with rust all over it or aside of a fence in the weeds where someones stooped to go under or alongside a bush where someones dropped his pants theres all sorts of places you can find knives and id found that pretty good one like id found this one and every other one ive ever had only it didnt look like anything when i found it any more than a pennys worth of pork chops but id took it home and scrubbed er up good with coaloil and i found a little piece of ashwood for the side where the bone handle was broken off and i carved and scraped it down and fitted it over the rivets where the bone had been and it went on slick as owl grease you couldnt tell the bone from the wood side unless you looked real close you couldnt tell then unless you knew id bet nate laverty a dime he couldnt tell and sure enough hed picked the wood side for bone and i knew he didnt have a dime any moren i did so pete had been standing there and i carried the bet to him and of course he knew then which side was wood and he picked it so nate didnt have to owe me a dime and then somehow id let it get away from me and the heck of it was i not only couldnt remember how i might have lost it but when id lost it you see id found this other old knife meanwhile i mean the knife i had now and id been carrying it around to putter at when i had the time and then one day at school it struck me that i had my good knife for quite a spell so i looked for it high and low but i couldnt find a trace of it as near as i could recollect id left it in a pair of dirty jeans when id changed to some clean ones and naturally maryd chosen that day to wash she claimed she hadnt seen anything of it but that didnt mean too much she always dumped her wash water in the privy to sweeten it and shed know that if she had forgot to turn my pockets out the knife was long gone so she wouldnt have wanted to own up to it but i didnt know that was what had happened i might have laid it down around the house and she might have tossed it up on a shelf somewhere not thinking about it or pa might have picked it up and hid it on me kept it in his room to use himself or it might have slipped down behind the seat in donnas car when well you know or i glanced up at the sun and gave a start then i had to laugh at myself it was getting on toward evening id spent almost the whole afternoon thinking about that blamed old knife nate and pete laverty were coming down the road joking and pushing each other i stood up and brushed the grass off my pants and went to meet them fora nineteenyearold man ive made a whale of a lot of mistakes but i never made a bigger one than pushing that old knife out of my mind if id done what i should have i wouldnt have rested until id dug it up id have taken the house apart board by board if id had to id but that was if and you know how it goes if the dog hadnt stopped to scratch himself hed have caught the rabbit nate said they had a note for me from mr redbird so i took it and pardoned myself to them and opened it up dear tom i have just finished a long talk with miss trumbull and we both feel as lam sure you will upon reflection that you should and must return to school think tom despite almost overwhelming difficulties of which i am more than aware you have shown more promise than any other student it has been a pleasure and a challenge to work with you we have enjoyed four years of mutual respect and i hope liking surely it is those years we must remember not an unfortunate three or four minutes as you know i was not responsible for abe toolate s employment but i realize now that being acquainted with his character all too well i should have insisted on ending it as i did successfully end it this morning the situation was inevitably open to unpleasant interpretation i needed no proof of your honesty nonetheless because it was the easiest way out because i felt it necessary to appease a known thief i asked you to tell me you were honest under the same circumstances i might myself have said things i would later regret but dont think im letting you completely off young man i have a stack of science i papers this high for you to grade and i want the work done right understand me as if youd do it any other way ill look for you in the morning tom sincerely david redbird i finished reading and tears were starting to come into my eyes and i just didnt see how i could go back right away anyhow until things were settled but i could go and see him and miss trumbull and i looked up nate and pete were grinning at me whats so funny i said pete snickered and gave nate a nudge looks pretty lively dont he couldnt hardly tell hed been out dancin all night yeah said nate and i could see the orneriness sticking out of him and pete they were like that slow to pick up a grudge theyd swallow something and spit it up at you later yeah he said but hes a pretty lively fella got a sweater to keep him hotted up now look i said i told you yesterday that i spoke out of turn what kind of spoke a little out last night too didnt you what do you mean i said but i knew of course the whole town everyone at school was probably laughing about me hows your feet said nate how they feel big boy they busted out laughing hawhawing in my face and i tried to laugh with them but it wasnt any good look at im pete hawhawed looks like hes been chawin persimmons chawin grass thats what he done cackled nate fella whynt you tell us how them feet that was as far as he got because just about that time i whaled off and kicked him on the chin and pete made a dive for me and i kicked him too they went white and silent their chests slumping with the pain then they both made for me at once and i slammed them both i gave them each a short stiffarm my fists doubled and they grunted and went down in the road they staggered to their feet waving their arms wildly and i slammed them again i knocked them down in the road a second time and a third and that trip they stayed down i tore up mr redbirds letter and threw it down on top of them i stared at them panting hoping theyd razz me just a little bit more praying to god that they wouldnt because i didnt want to stomp them to death and i knew i would if they said anything they didnt maybe they couldnt or maybe they were afraid to anyway they just lay there their faces as yellowish white as their mealsack shirts and i turned and walked away from there fast i almost ran toward the house i went into my bedroom slamming the door and threw myself down on the bed i shivered my head felt hot as fire but i couldnt stop shaking it was like i had fever and chills i thought ive had enough no one else better pull anything i hammered my fists against the mattress i wished now that id given nate and pete a real punching that was what i needed to pull the anger and shame out of myself and pass it on to someone else now though it was all corked up inside of me and tom marys hand closed over my forearm and turned me on my side whats the matter tommy go away i said i aint going way till you tell me youd better i said youd better go away fast mary why she said it whyee teasinglike and sat down on the edge of the bed her hip was almost against my face and i could smell her the musky wantingit smell whyee tommy i sat up and gave her a push but she was sitting solid she was a lot more steady than i was and i guess i didnt push very hard she was something to strike back at you see or strike with it seemed like if i did it to her id be getting back at them youd better go i said pall be here pretty soon huhuh im telling you mary if you dont get out of here ill ill yes and she dragged it out yesss i lay back down on the pillows id told her hadnt i id told her and all the others but they wouldnt leave me alone now i was through talking she stood up smiling at me she kept on smiling never taking her eyes away from mine as she stepped out of first one shoe then the other she pulled her dress down over one shoulder she eased the other arm out of its sleeve then slid the dress down past her hips and stepped out of it there wasnt anything on underneath shed had it all planned got herself all ready before shed come into my room move over tommy she said and i moved over now she said and she stretched out by me and up until then shed been all smiling and cool and sure of herself but then her arms went around me and her body swung in against mine and if there was ever a crazy woman she was it all at once all at the same time she was laughing and crying and giggling and sobbing biting and clawing and petting at me and i dont mind admitting i was scared as all heck i forgot all about myself how sickangry id been all i could think of was getting away from her but it was too late then of course and after that first minute i stopped wanting to get away it didnt last much longer than a minute then she fell back on the pillows her body heaving and quivering like shed run ten miles i pushed myself up on my knees and slid off the bed and i wasnt breathing so easy myself five seconds before i couldnt have been dragged away from her now i felt like id gag and start puking if she so much as laid a hand on me she was smiling again narroweyed trying to pull me back to her with her eyes tommy that was good wasnt it get up and get dressed mary i said come on start moving you like bettern her say you do tommy an ill get up suit yourself about what you do i said stay there and let pa find you wait tommy lets but i didnt wait i walked out of the room and out of the house i drew a fresh bucket of water from the well and sloshed it over my head and face then i dried myself on the porch towel and combed my hair and sat down on the edge of the porch i heard mary clomping around in the kitchen building up the supper fire it began to get dark and she lit the lamp and i could smell the coffee coming to a boil but she didnt come out and she didnt call to me i almost wished she would because i was beginning to get hungry and idve asked for a biscuit or something if shed given me an opening but she didnt so i stayed where i was and kept quiet myself around truedark six oclock or so pa turned in the gate from the road he nodded to me and i nodded back he stepped to the kitchen door told mary to hurry up the supper and splashed water into the wash basin he washed and sat down on the porch beside me after a minute or two he cleared his throat and spoke didnt have much luck at the banks son kinda like you said itd be i didnt say anything he hesitated then cleared his throat again heard you uh theres talk around that you had some trouble last night thats right i said you shouldntve gone up there by yourself son you ought tove told me what you had in mind and prepared yourself right idve been plumb proud to go with you i turned and looked at him frowning not getting what he meant then it came to me he thought id been aiming to do matthew ontime some dirt i started to set him straight but just then mary called out that supper was ready so i let it ride i was hungry and after all what difference did it make to me what he thought we all sat down at the table pa gulped his food whole as usual he finished eating ahead of the rest of us and refilled his coffee cup i felt him squinting at me over the rim of his saucer then without looking i knew he was staring at mary her fork rattled against her plate and he went on staring finally she scooted back her chair and headed for the stove with the biscuit pan i looked up at last he still had his eyes on her she was standing at the stove her back to the table waiting for him to look the other way in the dim light of the lamp i could see her shoulders trembling and yet she was standing straighter less beat down than she usually did pa lowered his saucer to the table what are you doin over there he said softly but his voice seemed to ring through the room you makin them biscuits nono sir bring em here you hear me mary yeyes sir she turned around and came slowly toward the table the pan trembling in her fingers she started to sit down pa kicked back his chair grabbed her by wrist and jerked her erect i stood up and he pulled her toward him staring into her face whats the matter with you he said nothin she actually tossed her head a little whats the matter with you he gave her a yank that almost jerked her off her feet she let out a little moan and that was the end of her defiance she folded up like a weed at sundown i aint done nothin pa yyou lemme go now i i been watchin you he said slowly i seen you prissin around all through supper squirmin and flauntin your backside an turnin all red an rosy like i aint neither she ducked her head and began to cry i mmean it aaint really like that pa let go of her arm he threw it away from him letting it strike against her breasts and she moaned again yyoure always wwatchin me you get me all upset with yyour watchin and then when i do somethin outta nervousness yyou fault me about it well pa hesitated and some of the hardness went out of his face well maybe yyou know you do i cant turn around wwithout yyou maybe pa repeated just maybe an im gonna keep right on watchin you hear an i better not never see nothin like like i dont want to see an i dont want no more of your lip regardless you hear she nodded shakily edging backwards away from him as scared as she was it looked like she might back right on through the stove and out the wall i stepped between the two of them she hasnt done anything i said why do you keep badgering her i know what im doin son so do i i said and i dont like it his eyes widened blazed for a second then the fire died out of them and he turned slowly and started for the door im tired he said everythings falling to pieces an i cant put it together again im too old too tired i i think we better talk a little son maybe we had i said and i followed him out of the house he sat down on the lintel of the woodshed and i sat down aside of him not close as far away as i could get he noticed it and sighed heavily like you sigh when youre asking for sympathy he reached behind him and picked up a sliver of kindling his hand went into his pocket then came out empty and he tossed away the sliver either he didnt have a knife with him or hed changed his mind about whittling about mary he said i reckon you think im pretty hard on her i shrugged i got to be hard on her son you see well youve probably wondered maybe youve wondered about her how a widower was able to adopt a young girl well he swallowed and went on doggedly i didnt adopt her i took her i just took her out of the place she was in an they didnt dare put up a fuss about it an she didnt they seen the wrath of god was in me an they didnt stand in my way i waited he sighed again but not so fakey as he had the first time now youre gonna say that she was awfully young he said she was young an maybe she was there against her will or she didnt know no better but that aint the way it was son she was doin it because she liked to she was she was just a just a hole that was all shed ever been from the time she was old enough to walk an thats what shed still be if i hadnt got hold of her an put the fear of the lord in her i still waited he moved uneasily on the lintel so so thats the way it is son thats why i got to keep bearin down on her you he paused now maybe you think its odd id pick up someone like that to look after you but i knew i could keep her in hand an it was the lords work to take her away from that house of sin you see that dont you no i said that isnt what i see well now you took her to punish her she was built with a certain appetite some women are and you fixed it so she could never have what she needed to satisfy it youve starved her punished her for almost twenty years do you want me to tell you why it seemed funny the way that everything fell into place in a matter of seconds but i guess it wasnt really so strange hed kept me bowed down as much as he had her until the last day or so id never got a good look at him youre dead wrong son yyou why would i you got her out of a whore house i said how did you happen to find her what were you doing there i son you know i never you never have since no i said because you were punishing her you held her responsible for something that happened to you and youve made her suffer for it thats the way it was wasnt it she do we got to talk about it son you started it i said yeah he nodded heavily so i guess i guess it was the end of pickin tom an id gone into town to get my pay from the gin an id got a late start kinda because your because effie my wife was sick an i couldnt find no one to set with her an by the time i got my money from the gin the stores was all closed and i couldnt get the needfuls i was sposed to take home i i guess i should have gone home without em an come back the next day but it was a long walk an i was afraid of highjackers with all that money so what was wrong with your wife i said huh he started oh nothin nothin youd understand son some kind of female complaint i see i said so like i was sayin i decided to stay the night in town an well i had had a few drinks i drank a little in those days i wasnt really drunk you understand but yes i said you were drunk and he hesitated and said yes i was drunk you can fault me for that for not knowin what i was doin because i honest didnt know son i was lookin for a boardinghouse some place to sleep an i seen her an asked her where there was one an she promised to take me to a place an well you know where she took me i nodded that takes care of the night when you were drunk but you were sober the next morning yes he said i was sober but you didnt go home i didnt go home he said i couldnt make myself somehow i stayed there for a week an my money was gone moren seven hundred dollars an i couldve kept on stayin far as she was concerned because shed do it for nothing being like she was but the house wouldnt stand for that an an shed wrung me dry so i went home i son you just cant understand i go on i said my wife was dead been dead for four days one of the neighborsd come in an was takin care of you but how old was i oh sixseven months i reckon but no i said id just been born i heard the creak of his jaws as his mouth dropped open he put his head down in his hands and held it there a moment and then he raised it again staring off across the fields toward the twinkling lights in the drilling rigs well son well i said its been mighty hard for me boy not bein able to claim you for my own son but you see why i couldnt dont you i couldnt let you know id that id that youd let my mother die in childbirth while you slept with a whore for a week tom try to understand boy i laughed what makes you think i dont understand its taken me a long time to get around to it but i understand everything about you pa i dont no i said you dont or you wont let yourself you wont see yourself as you are you made one big mistake a bad one but you cant come out and admit that you really made it youve got to lay it all on to mary youve got to make her do the suffering youre not actually sorry for what you did because youve never admitted that you did it it was her fault yes and mine for being born i was the cause of my mothers death and son he grabbed me by the shoulder i dont think nothin like that that aint let go of me i said but you let go of me he let go maybe you dont see it quite that way i went on but im not far wrong youve proved that im not you didnt need to tell me the whole truth to let me know that i was your son theres only one reason why you didnt let me know because you could get more out of me make me feel that i owed my life to you for taking me in son he shook his head curtly youre makin me out to be mighty lowdown because you are i said because i cant help myself every time ive slipped a little wavered a little from what you thought i ought to be youve taken it out on my hide and ive let you get away with it because i felt that i had to youd taken me in out of charity so i had to take whatever you handed out and be grateful for it he was still shaking his head hed been shaking it all the time i was talking i done plenty for you he said an dont you say i havent maybe i aint been too easygoin but easygo dont make the mare run ive made you make somethin of yourself like what i said like getting kicked out of school because i was starved down to eating scraps like making me knock a man down who wanted to help me i done plenty he repeated all right i said youve done plenty but im not giving you a chance to do any more i stood up brushing at the seat of my pants he stood up too bending his head back on his neck to look up at me now he said i suppose youre fixin to walk out on me i try to be honest with you an tell you the truth an i was going to do it anyway i said youve just helped me to make up my mind where you figure on goin i dont know you mean you dont want to tell me youre cuttin out of touch with me for all time i mean i dont know i said but im cutting clear of you for good yes when in the morping probably dont go tom he raised a hand toward me then let it drop trembling at his side maybe i been all wrong about everything but i sure didnt aim to be an whatever i done it was because i wanted you to be somethin better than i was i i know i said i was your redemption i was your way of squaring yourself with the lord i was supposed to be you what you wanted to be i wasnt entitled to have a life of my own i said maybe i was wrong son bbut his voice was begging aint i done i still done plenty tom i pointed out the path of the righteous to you an i kept you on it i are you sure i said about that years before right after wed moved to oklahoma nate and pete and i had been walking home from school together and wed come to a place along the road where the county was putting in a new culvert and there was a rat crouched back in the angle of a pile of bricks and wed got ourselves some sticks and moved in on it itd tried to run between our feet and wed driven it back and itd darted along one angle of the bricks then the other and wed kept moving in closer and finally it was squeezed clear back in the corner with no way of going farther back and no way out in front and what happened then well it gave me bad dreams for a month afterwards it wasnt a real big rat but all of a sudden it reared up on its hind legs and it looked as big as a dog and it seemed to have about a million teeth and every one of em showing it came out of that corner in a kind of running waltz waving its front paws all those teeth chattering against each other and that was the end of mr cornered rat it was us that was cornered from then on we had the whole world behind us but it didnt seem like there was any room at all we fell all over each other trying to get away and i think we were lucky to get away without a bad bite but but that had been a long time ago and a man forgets things he doesnt like to remember or remembering he goes right ahead and does the same thing all over again he figures hell be luckier than he was the first time or hes mad and doesnt care he thinks hes got nothing to lose that hes been pushed down as far as he can go and hes wrong of course theres always something worse that can happen to you pa was reaching for me again sticking his hand out toward me and holding it back at the same time what you mean son he was saying what you mean am i sure about about you know i said i grinned at him you noticed it at supper i had her pa just like you no he said no you didnt sshe wouldnt dare she knows what id do if but it was me i lied i made her oh she took to it fast enough after we got started but i got her started she didnt have anything to do with it and you cant fault her for it he wagged his head moving it slowly from side to side that aint the truth son he said quietly youre saying it to spite me how i said how would that spite you you want to take all the meanin away you dont want to leave me nothin i aint got nothin left but that an now now now you havent got that i said ask mary shell tell you the same thing i have naturally shed be afraid to tell him anything else got anything more on your mind before i turn in you didnt do it son say you didnt do it i did it i said he stood blinking at me his chin wobbling like he was trying to swallow something that wouldnt go down then suddenly he turned his head and spat drawing the back of his hand across his mouth all right he said just all right i grinned you dont want to make something of it take the strap or maybe the shotgun to me no he said and there wasnt anything in his voice at all it was like hed written the word on paper and handed it to me no that wouldnt be bad enough i laughed and way off somewhere in the backbrush a loon picked up the laugh and tossed it back across the fields heeah whoee heeah whoee and i shivered in spite of myself and pa nodded gently the lord will punish you he said mary was still in the kitchen when i passed through but she heard pa plodding along behind me so she kept busy at the dishes and didnt speak i crossed the breezeway and went into my bedroom i took off my shoes and opened the door a crack i listened pretty uneasily glad of what id done to pa but a little worried about mary i told myself that he wouldnt do anything id taken all the blame hed be afraid she might turn on him like i had and walk out and i thought if he did give her a tonguelashing it wouldnt scare her any more than she already was and she had it coming that and then some because i could see now that shed never really done anything for me everything shed done had been aimed at tying me to her so she could use me as soon as i could be used she couldnt help it i reckoned any more than a skunk can help stinking but that didnt make the smell any better i listened and i couldnt hear a thing out of the way i could hear their voices now and then not words just voices i could her the creak of shoes on the planking then finally i heard the kitchen door close and the door to pas bedroom and i figured that any minute shed be coming across the breezeway but ten twenty minutes passed and she didnt come i got uneasier and uneasier i wondered if pa had been mean enough to send her packing without even letting her take some clothes i tiptoed out of the bedroom and opened the outside door i looked out around the yard and down the road and i couldnt see a sign of her i closed the door again wondering what the heck had happened what id better do and then because i couldnt think of anything else i tiptoed across the breezeway and into the kitchen i listened a minute and that was all that was necessary it was more than enough to know that i didnt need to worry about mary i came back across the breezeway not bothering to tiptoe because the noise that mattress was making they wouldnt have heard me if id stomped and they wouldnt care that id heard them it wasnt in mary to care it wasnt in pa either now that as he saw it hed lost his last chance at redemption he was damned through me now the bars were down and nothing mattered to him i undressed and stretched out on the bed and my stomach felt all queasy and tight i felt like any minute i might throw up my guts i thought about that afternoon about mary and me that afternoon and i wondered if i could ever scrub away the dirt that seemed to be on me i scratched and scrubbed at myself thinking about her and suddenly i sat up shamed the blood rushing to my face shamed and sick for them for myself i lay down again i sat up and lay down again i closed my eyes and the image of them came into my brain it must have been two or three hours before i finally dozed off just like always the breakfast smells awoke me in the morning and i was out of bed and pulling on my pants before i remembered that this morning wasnt like the others i hesitated almost of a notion to walk right out from my bedroom without looking at them again but i figured that might suit them too well so i decided against it they were sitting at the table eating and there wasnt any chair or plate at the place where i always sat pa looked at me looking without looking like i wasnt there then bent back over his food mary gave me one quick glance then dropped her eyes shed never been able to meet anyones eyes for long and she couldnt now she was still beat down but she wasnt beat down too much to let me know with that glance exactly how she felt about me she didnt need me now i was in the way and the quicker i got out the better see her eyes said tried to do me dirt didnt you and it didnt work now you better watch out i sauntered over to the cupboard and took down a plate and cup i took a knife fork and spoon from the drawer and set my own place at the table i dragged up a chair and sat down mary gave me another one of those glances i winked at her i leaned forward pulled the food dishes up in front of me and loaded my plate i filled my coffee cup and began eating i didnt pay any more attention to them than they did to me from then on just looked right through them when i bothered to look up at all and of course they had a head start on me but at that it seemed like they finished eating pretty fast pa pushed back his chair and got up mary got up too as if shed been waiting for him to move and they went out on the porch together a couple of minutes after that i heard a car drive into the yard the door slammed two doors a couple of men were getting out i stopped eating id been pretty hungry everything considered but all at once i couldnt have put down another bite if id been paid a million dollars i went allover stiff and cold and dead it was almost as if i knew what was going to happen i stood up something seemed to pull me up from my chair i walked out the door and onto the porch pa and mary were out in the yard and there were two men with them and when i came out they all turned and looked at me and then they started for the porch together the two men in front sheriff blunden and one of his deputies howdy there boy the sheriff said wanta talk to you talk to me i said talk to me yeah and i want you to talk to me talk plenty and straight understand boy the deputy hunkered down in the yard on his bootheels squatting just short of the porch with his stetson pushed back and his fingers already working on a cigarette blunden sat down on the porch facing me with his back to a post he was short and fat a man who liked to take it easy and the way i must have looked he probably thought he could up until the last year hed run a cotton gin wheres your knife boy he said and his voice wasnt unfriendly he waited and when i didnt answer i still couldnt speak he asked the question again i began to come to a little i took my knife out of my pocket and held it out to him he shook his head i mean your other knife pretty knife with bone on one side the handle and ashwood on the other i havent got it anymore i said i lost it where i dont know somewhere around the house i think he shifted his eyes sidewise a second then moved them back to me seen bigger houses he said shouldnt be too much trouble to find it in there i didnt say id lost it there i said i said i heard what you said whend you lose it i dont know dont know when you lost a pretty knife like that didnt mean any more to you that you cant remember atall well i hesitated i think it was about a month or so ago i cant say for sure because i had this other one to use and the other the one youre talking about may have been lost a while before i discovered it he took off his hat it was just a plain store hat like business people wear and fanned himself with it hot he said dont know when i seen it so warm this time of year you recollect a fall like this bud he glanced at the deputy not in the last ten year the deputy nodded no id say it was all of twelve year had a tolable warm november back in the sheriff grunted and put his hat back on now lets see boy he said lets see uh mmm aint you been having quite a little trouble lately well i i dont know i said dont know dont know where you lost your knife dont know when you lost it dont know whether youve had any trouble dont know or you dont want to talk look i said whats this all about i dont know what youre getting at got caught stealing didnt you up at the school no i didnt i said cussed out your teachers no i i hesitated i said a thing or two i shouldnt have but i didnt mean anything by it i was just out of temper kind of an temper he said dont know anything thatll get a man in trouble quicker reckon you was kind of out of temper when you knocked down matthew ontime werent you no i said i was just scared on pa his account i jerked my head at pa without looking at him theyd been having an argument and mr ontime got sore and i was afraid he was going to ride him down didnt seem to me like he was pa put in mildly the way i looked at it he was just through talking and was gonna ride away i gasped and choked up the sheriff said well thats a youngun for you dont mean no harm at heart probly just cant keep off the halfcock cant keep their hands in their pockets and their tongues in their heads why i recollect now wait a minute i said see here now cant you see hes lying to you i didnt have anything against mr ontime i wouldnt ever have gone near the place except for him yeah blunden nodded your pa drag you up there night before last i i stopped uhhuh he said your pa tell you to go around calling scuse me miss mr ontime a dirty sonofabitch boasting about what you were going to do to him i didnt do that i said i spoke before i remembered that i had done it you didnt i can name you a couple of boys friends of yourn thatll say youre a liar well maybe i did i said i guess maybe i did but i didnt really mean it halfcocked he nodded again yessir thats the whole trouble with these younguns now you was up there to the ontime place and you got chased off with a bullwhip took a real toepopping howd that set with you i didnt like it i said no sir dont reckon you did wouldnt have liked it myself even if i got it from a white man whend you say you had that knife of yours last i didnt say look mr blunden maybe if youll tell me i heard you had it yesterday a couple of fellows say they saw you whittling with it it was this one they saw i said and they really didnt see it all they saw was me whittling i had the knife put away by the time they got to me had a little ruckus with em i hear or maybe theyre mistaken about that too we had one i said didnt like their teasin huh still pretty sore about that bullwhipping i didnt like it no i said i didnt like the whipping but i guess i had it coming where were you last night say around midnight where why i was right here i said i was in bed at midnight and the rest of the night too he eased one flank up off the porch and reached his hand into his pocket he brought it out again and there was my knife the one id lost at midnight last night he said matthew ontime was murdered someone stabbed him to death with this knife and tossed him into one of his own hogpens and what was left of him when they found him this morning wasnt pretty to see it took someone with a pretty bad grudge to do that now if you can prove you aint that someone ill probly be just as happy as you are prove it prove i hadnt killed him i laughed puzzled and irritated like you will when something doesnt make sense that strike you as bein funny boy well gosh i said i mean well thats crazy mr blunden i wouldnt why anyone ought to know i wouldnt he sat looking at me waiting as if he didnt see anything unreasonable about it at all and the deputy was looking at me the same way and mary and pa mary and pa pa and a cadillac pulled into the yard and donna got out of it her face was all drawn and white and hard and she stood at the side of the car watching me waiting for me to prove that that i hadnt done it the sheriff glanced at pa you said he was out of the house last night mr carver weel pa dragged it out no that aint what i said sheriff i said he could have been without me knowing about it like he was the night before what about you young lady you say you sleep over in that end of the house dont ask me mary ducked her head he could sneak in an out all the time for all i know and yyou you know i never did i stuttered over the words both of you know it i was never out of the house but the one night night before last and that was to try to square things with mr ontime tell em donna she didnt answer me she stood off there in the yard like she didnt want to get close to me thats why he said he came she said and they all looked at me again well boy ask them where they were at midnight i pointed at pa and mary this all started as his quarrel i got dragged into it through him i know where they were said the sheriff miss mary had to step out to the uh commode about that time your pa heard her when she came back in and called out to her seems like that takes care of them pretty well theyre lying i said reckon so you werent in bed asleep then sure i was whats that then how you know theyre lying he waited and there didnt seem to be much that i could say what good would it do to say that theyd slept together what would it get me and how could i prove it guess youd better come along with us boy want to get your hat or somethin well i said i guess maybe i i better i suppose i looked pretty dazed and bewildered and i was but not so much because of what had happened as what i intended to do it didnt seem like i could do it it seemed like i was planning it for another guy but there wasnt any other guy it was me that was trapped and i could only see this one way out still it was hard to get started i wondered why they didnt see what i had to do and try to stop me well you better get movin then the sheriff said go on or well have to go without it yes sir i said and i didnt linger after that i went through the kitchen door lifted the shotgun off its hooks and went right across the breezeway into the other end of the house moving fast walking light the door there was off the latch and i eased it open without a sound i stepped back into the room then ran i hit the screen in a running jump i landed in the yard threw an arm around donna and whirled her around in front of me i held her with the one arm and leveled the shotgun with the other nnow i panted now you bastards on your feet they got up slowly like people in a dream and marys face was so sickish gray i laughed out loud i jerked the gun at the deputy drawing my arm so tight round donnas breasts that she gasped you bud i said raise your hands turn around and back toward me i said it like id been saying things like that all my life and he did exactly what i said now unfasten that gun belt with your left hand keep the other one up and let it drop good now get back there with the others he moved forward again i hooked my toe under the belt and booted it under the porch boy the sheriff found his voice at last up until then no one had spoken you dont want to do nothin like this boy this wont settle nothin you just i triggered one barrel of the shotgun and there was a hell of a kick because i could only cradle it in one arm but i head on and the right rear tire of his car exploded all right i said all of you start walking stick close together and head for that field tom it was pa maybe i made a sheriff wouldnt it fix things if i was to say i swung the gun on him i rubbed my finger along the trigger i tightened it and his face was fishwhite with fear but to me it was red i was seeing everything through a gauzy hatered curtain fix things fix things hed killed my mother hed taken her away from me hed taken donna away from me hed taken nineteen years of my life and now he was taking the rest of it and now now i was laughing laughing and crying and silent my eyes frozen on his buzzards head now he was going to fix things im not sure why i didnt blast him all over the yard probably because it would have been too clean and quick for him because i knew thered be another time and a better way to pay him off you made a mistake i said but ill do the fixing count on that pa ill be back to do some fixing i wont forget you i wont forget her thats a promise and i always keep my promises i let it soak in on him grinning at that fishwhite pallor of fear then i moved backwards toward the cadillac pulling donna with me walk damn you i yelled head for that field or ill give you the other barrel they walked fast mary was dragging her feet a little but she couldnt help it i slid under the wheel of the cadillac holding donna so that she was half outside and half in i got it backed into the road tossed the gun into the back seat and yanked donna over the wheel and into the seat beside me i pinned one arm up behind her so that she couldnt move without breaking it i turned the wheel with the other hand and headed down the road but i just couldnt do it very long about a mile down the road where there werent any houses nearby i stopped the car and let go of her arm im sorry i had to do this i said you can get out here she opened the door and started to get out she didnt speak or look at me donna i said wait she waited back there i said you said you didnt know and i know how you feel how things look to you but you must know i i didnt know she said but i know now she got out without looking at me and started up the road i sat unmoving for a second then i slammed the car into gear and stepped on the gas and i whipped by her so close that the fender grazed her but she didnt waver an inch or a step i glanced up into the mirror and she was still walking just like she had been moving in a straight line with her shoulders squared and her head held high i didnt look back after that i slowed down for the county road wondering which way id better turn i had less than a third of a tank of gas and no money and i knew i wasnt going to use that shotgun to hold someone up anyway thered be an alarm out for me in thirty minutes or less just as soon as someone could get to the ontime place and telephone id never be able to make a getaway in this car an idea came to me not a very good one but there just couldnt be any very good ones in a spot like this i turned the car toward town i had to slow down at the school because someone had kicked a football into the road and a couple of guys had run out and were scrambling for it they got out of the way finally and i went on past and they waved and yelled at me hey tom whered you get that baby how about a ride tom i waved and stepped on the gas just then the schoolbell rang and i knew it was five minutes until nine the town was laid out in a series of squares like most county seats are i turned at the first square the outside one that is angling around it to the other side of town i hit the main road there followed it for about a halfmile and turned off again another quartermile and the sideroad i was on dipped down to a railroad crossing i pulled the car off into the weeds and got out it was a spurline road that ran into muskogee and there was a train due by on it at ninethirty about twenty minutes from now as i reckoned this far out of town it would be going too fast for me to catch with the tracks down in a cut this way i couldnt have made the run for it that i would have needed to make but they wouldnt know that i hoped it would look like id caught it i walked down to the tracks stepped up on one of them and walked foot in front of foot east toward the trestle across the creek and no it wasnt hard to do for anyone thatd walked a furrow as much as i had it was about a hundred yards to the trestle and being below the fields i got there without being seen i wasnt any too soon the tracks were humming the train was highballing out of town whistling for the crossing behind me i turned sidewise to the tracks and jumped into the creek i knew it was about five feet deep in the middle which was more than enough to break my jump but id overlooked the fact that the bed was bound to build up around the trestle joists i came down in about five inches of water just enough to cover the sloped up sand and one foot went down each side of the slope the jar snapped my head back then down against my chest my ankles socked down into the sand and bent under me i yelled out with the pain i hurt so bad that it was all i could do to pull myself under the trestle when the train passed over i wrapped my arms around a joist and hung on yelling as the train shook it making my legs shake i was sure that my ankles were broken all i could think of right then was that id have to let go and that theyd find me trapped there in the sand with my head under water but i didnt let go badly as i wanted to and after a while i could feel something in my arddes besides the pain the sugary numbness began to go out of them i wiggled and pulled them out of the sand one at a time i tested them with my weight i yelped a little when i did it but i could do it there werent any broken bones i worked my way from one joist to another until i was in the shallows near the opposite bank then i left the trestle and headed up stream this way of course i wouldnt leave any trail for dogs to follow the creek ran between steep wooded banks the tree branches curving over it and sheltering it so if anyone was out in the fields they wouldnt see me the creek swung south and east i could follow it for about ten miles until it petered out in the hill country then id take to the hills there wouldnt be any people there since the land couldnt be farmed and the blackjack and scruboak wasnt worth cutting so id go on through the hills to the kiamichi river steal a boat and drift south down to texas maybe over to arkansas maybe somewhere id figure it out when the time came right now i had ten miles of creek to walk that was job aplenty for me to work on the shallows kept curving down making me walk with my weight thrown sideways on my ankles branches and bushes poked out from the stream banks and i had to keep dodging under them or moving out into the water around them by the time i was a couple of hundred yards from the trestle i was winded and pain was running up and down my legs in a way i didnt like to think about i rested a little while hanging on to an overhead branch to ease the weight from my feet i went on again plodding through the water and sand and pebbles a strong cold wind was working up rattling and shaking the trees i tried to walk faster hoping my body heat would dry me i had pretty good going for the next halfhour or so the stream curved sharply in and out cutting away the banks until the shoreline was flat instead of sloping i must have covered all of a mile without having to stop and rest then i hit a bad stretch a really bad one it started with an overhang that was so low and bushcovered that i had to duckwalk to get under it i finally worked my way through it and there right ahead of me was a real poser an arrowshaped wedge of land that poked out about ten feet into the stream it was covered with thorn bushes i eased forward until i was facing it then started to walk around it sideways i got around to the point of the arrow flopping my arms to keep my balance then my feet shot out from under me and i went down in about eight feet of water i came up and i grabbed those bushes thorns or no thorns i pulled myself around the wedge and got to a little sandy flat where i could sit down i took out my old knife and began digging out the thorns so doggone mad and upset that its a wonder i didnt whack a finger off and right up above me not more than twenty feet away it sounded like a man hollered hi fella where you think youre headin i went stiff as a board and the knife dropped from my hands there wasnt any place to run down here and i couldnt run anyway it was all i could do to walk i turned my head slowly opening my mouth to call back to him because the news would be all over this end of the county by now and he probably meant business then he spoke again and he was quite a distance away now hed moved back into the field and i could only make out a few words of what he was saying reckon youre the news damned shame another mans voice hard to i let out my breath my heart was pounding like a modelt with the bearings burned out the first man i reckoned had been up there in the brush setting a snare probably when hed spotted a friend cutting crossfields i listened trying to hear what they were saying care if indian fine a a real gentleman and ill well catch him all nut the bastard i got up and took to the creek again they all had their minds made up now it was just a matter of catching me and nutting me sentencing me to the chair i thought i wished id brought that shotgun id do a little nutting myself i made it another mile or so and then i just caved in entirely i was blue with cold my ankles felt like chunks of ice with hot wires running through them i fell face forward on a stretch of sand another place where the bank had washed out after a few minutes i got up enough strength to roll up into the weeds and pull them around me i rubbed myself with them a little sunlight drifted down through the trees and it helped a lot some of the chill began to leave me now i thought its time to do some thinking real honest to gosh thinking so far youve just been running and i went to sleep i waked up to the smell of smoke and cooking corn and it was all so much like the way i was used to waking that i thought i was home i lay there smiling for a second thinking i was sure going to have to do some work on that roof i started to sit up and my whole body seemed to have been starched stiff and i remembered where i was then i plopped back down in the weeds because i hadnt dreamed that smell of smoke and corn that was real the fire was on the other shore down in a wash almost opposite where i lay and there was an iron pot boiling on it seated around it in a half circle was a dozen indians full bloods the old oldtimers who wore store clothes but still kept their hair in braids they were having some kind of ceremony i guessed i watched them peering through the weeds i couldnt leave until they did after a few minutes one of the old men got up and dipped a piece of bark into the pot he brought it out covered with something white and licked it he grunted a word or two in creek language to the others they all got up and began dipping into the pot grunting and gesturing it was pashofa corn fixed something like hominy and they acted like it was pretty good they ate steadily for all of a half hour and i watched with my mouth watering i hoped theyd leave the pot when they left but i was pretty sure they wouldnt indians always clean up good after themselves at any rate i didnt see how i could get across to scrape it if they did leave it everyone except the man at the pot the medicine man i guess stooped over the creek and each of them got himself a little rock or pebble they laid them down in a pile on the sand then two of them walked back up into the bushes and disappeared nothing happened after that for maybe two or three minutes they all just sat silent still as statues then the bushes started rattling and rustling again and the two indians returned pushing another man ahead of them his ankles were hobbled and his hands were bound to his sides his chin was bowed down against his chest the medicine man began grunting at him faster and sharper and slowly like he could hardly bear to do it the man brought his head up it was abe toolate even standing in the shadows and at the distance i was from him he looked pale he was just about the scaredestlooking man white or indian id ever seen his lips moved like he was about to say something and he sure shouldnt have done that it seemed because the medicine man began shrieking at him and the two indians at his side threw him down on the ground he lay on his back with the wind knocked out of him maybe anyway he didnt move or try to speak again the semicircle spread out the medicine man took two clamshells from his pockets and handed them to the indians nearest him they passed them on to the men nearest them and those two passed them on again they moved from man to man until they reached the two men sitting next to the creek one of them made a pass at the creek making out like he was filling the shell with water but not actually doing it he started it back up the line again and the indian opposite him waited a minute then went through the same motions and passed his shell back the medicine man squatted down at abes side he grabbed him by the nose and forced his mouth open one of the shells had reached him by this time and he snatched it and emptied it down abes throat and handed it down the line again then he took the other shell and emptied it into abe and passed it back he reached for the first one again it went on and on the shells moving at just the right speed to keep the water pouring down abes throat and i knew they werent actually doing it only going through the motions but it all seemed so real that i found my breath coming hard it was as though i were being executed by drowning in the old tribal way as they were executing abe the medicine man stood up and put the clamshells back in his pocket he walked to the pot scooped out some pashofa on a strip of bark and carried it back to abe he offered it to him pushing it out at him then jerking it back and abe stood up somehow in all the goingson his bonds had been untied but he didnt touch the pashofa of course dead men dont eat the medicine man laid the bark strip on the sand he squatted over and reached for the pebbles which the others had gathered and the others drew in their semicircle until abe was standing outside of it the medicine man covered the bark with the pebbles laying them over it one by one making a tiny stone wickiup that wickiup was abes grave the bark was his body everyone stood up again in that tight semicircle and abe was shut off from sight then the semicircle broke up and they began scraping out the pot the execution and burial were over and they got ready to leave but abe was already gone hed vanished while theyd turned their backs on him and i wasnt any indian of course but i knew that what had happened to him though he hadnt been harmed physically was about the worst thing that could happen to a man a few years ago during a smallpox epidemic an indian died up in the old osage nation the doctors pronounced him dead and all his kinfolks and friends came to his house and began mourning and he wasnt really dead just in a state of coma and all the racket snapped him out of it he sat up in bed and asked them what the heck was going on and no one heard him no one would admit hearing they just got up and walked out from that day on as far as the osages were concerned he didnt exist hed died and the dead dont come back to life no one would speak to him hed try to stop them on the street and theyd just look right through him and keep on going he was one of the wealthiest men in oklahoma had all sorts of oil holdings and when he really did die of loneliness i guess there was a big turnout for his funeral but not a single osage came to the osages all his kin and friends and anyone he cared anything about hed been dead for years and abe toolate would be dead from now on to all the fullbloods and all the partbloods who came under their influence practically every creek of any degree they wouldnt be told what he had done to be executed the old fullbloods would keep that a secret otherwise the white men would take over abes punishment and the old indians preferred their own brand of justice they wouldnt side with the whites against their own kind but the partbloods wouldnt need to know why hed been executed theyd know that it wouldnt have been done without a darned good reason that theyd better steer clear of him and let him stay dead i watched the indians leave walk up through the bushes and disappear dragging the pashofa pot with them and i wondered what the heck abe had done anyway and how the old men had found out about it of course they had ways of finding out things nothing much happened that they didnt know about and of course abe had been bringing disgrace on the tribe for years stealing lying getting drunk probably i decided theyd just let everything pile up and then paid him off for the lot by killing him i sat up pushing the whole matter out of my mind i tried to stand up and my legs crumpled under me i looked down at the water and shivered i knew if i tried to walk in that creek another ten feet id just fall over on my face and never get up i looked up through the trees trying to estimate the time of day i figured it would be all of two hours until dark and id have to wait until it was dark i took off my shoes and began chafing my feet and legs i scrubbed and pounded them with my knuckles and they started aching like anything but the blood came back into em and they felt warmer i stood up and began stamping them into the weeds flapping my arms at the same time then i rested a little and started in all over again something told me id better if i wanted to keep on living and i did want to i hadnt been kidding when id warned pa that id be to see him i was going to live long enough to do that if i never lived any longer i concentrated on him thinking of how as soon as they gave up looking for me id go back id go back at night or early in the morning say id stay in the woodshed until they got up id wait until they had the fire going and were sitting down to breakfast then id take the axe id have it sharpened up good by that time and sneak across the yard id creep up on the porch not making a noise and and then id move in front of the door and theyd raise their eyes real slow and id grin at them grin and twirl the axe and bring it back over my shoulder i was going to do it i knew it like you sometimes do know things and i knew it was going to be exactly like i was planning it got dark i crawled and pulled my way up the slope to the field above i rested a few minutes then started back toward the trestle it wasnt nearly as far back as id thought but if it had been much farther i couldnt have made it i crawled across the trestle on my hands and knees and tumbled into the cut on the other side i lay there for a while i think i must have passed out for a few minutes i crawled up the slope of the cut and under the fence i got my hands on top of a fence post pulled myself up and staggered across the field it was a dark night and that was good of course but it made walking twice as hard as it would have been i kept stumbling and going down and each time it was a little harder to get up i didnt seem to have any joints in my legs or ankles i had to push myself up kind of from the hips and along toward the last i was plopping down on my face a half dozen times or so before i could make it i got to the fence on the other end of the field crawled under it and pulled myself up again and i was sure glad she lived on the edge of town i was glad she had this orchard i stumbled and staggered through it pulling myself along by the trees i went across the yard at a staggering run and fell down on the back steps i pounded on them and she and miss trumbull came out why what in the oh my goodness she said oh heavens to betsy and i passed out again when i came to i was sitting at the kitchen table and she was trying to pour coffee down me i choked and coughed and she pulled the cup away then she put it back to my mouth again and i swallowed it down without stopping well she said thats better isnt it yes maam i said of all the foolish well i wont say anything now can you walk i think so i said let me help you now lean on me you stubborn thing there this way now ive got a nice hot bath all ready for you we went up the stairs with her arm around me and she guided me into the bathroom she pushed me down on a stool steadying me until she was sure i wouldnt topple off feeling any stronger she said think you can undress yourself yes maam i said though i wasnt feeling too strong sure i can do it then the quicker youre in that tub the better ill go get you a she went out leaving the door open she came back carrying a nightgown and i hadnt taken off but one shoe i think this will fit you she said hanging the gown over a hook it belonged to my father god rest his soul but why arent you out of those clothes well i i thought id better wait i said but oh my goodness she said oh heavens to betsy and she hurried out slamming the door i undressed and got into the tub and id never been in a real bathtub before but i did it easy as pie i lay back in the water soaking letting the warmth sink into me and i guess there arent many things nicer than getting warm after youve been cold a long time i scooted down until the water came clear up to my chin i closed my eyes and and there was a banging at the door thomas thomas carver have you gone to sleep in there no maam i said im getting right out miss trumbull well shake a leg and be sure to dry good before you put on that nightgown you dont want pneumonia do you no maam i said humph she said probably do wouldnt surprise me a bit she was waiting outside the door when i came out she took me into a room adjoining the bath jerked down the covers of a big fourposter and motioned i climbed into it now leave those covers down she said when i started to pull them up im going to rub your chest and no youd better take these pills first i took the pills quinine they tasted like and she began rubbing my chest with some strong smelly stuff she finished rubbing spread a thick flannel cloth over it and buttoned the neck of the gown there thatll fix you she said now can you eat anything almost anything i said how about some nice roast beef well i i reckon thatd be fine i said she frowned a little you dont like roast beef and i didnt seem too feverish any more but i could feel my face turning red i dont hardly know i said i never ate any she hurried out of the room and down the stairs and i heard her slamming things around in the kitchen i lay back on the pillows feeling warm and good in spite of what i had on my mind everything seemed so clean and peaceful lying there listening to her humming singing a few words now and then in the sweet bye and bye hmmmhmmhmm we will meet on that beautiful shore hmmmhmmhmm in the sweet she came back up the stairs walking slow and when she came into my room i saw why she was carrying a tray that must have been five feet around and it was so loaded with food you couldnt see between the dishes there was a big plate of roast beef and i knew id like it fine and brown potatoes and creamed corn and greens and a big piece of apple pie and coffee and i pushed myself up in bed and started reaching for the tray before i remembered my manners she placed it in my lap and stood back her eyeglasses twinkling and sparkling in the light how do you feel thomas fine i said and i picked up a fork and laid it down again still pretty weak but youll be stronger after you eat now youre welcome here you understand that i know you and i know you couldnt have done that terrible thing and i dont need you to tell me you didnt but if you think you would feel like talking tonight ill feel like it i said i can talk right now anything you want to know no you eat while your food is hot at any rate i want you to talk to mr redbird as well as me i want to have him come over oh i said and i frowned well i i dont know about that miss trumbull thomas dont you know who your friends are by now yes maam i said i just dont see much point to it all i want to do is get myself pulled together so that i can no sir she said no siree that is not all you want to do thus far youre not guilty of anything but a bit of rash conduct foolishness the thats not the way it looks though it looks like im guilty as allgetout and i cant prove im not oh yes you can she said firmly but youve got to face up to the situation you cant accomplish anything by running now i want to ask mr redbird over thomas hell know more about what to do than i will well i said if thats what you want i reckon thats what youll do thomas she shook her head sadly and i figured i must seem pretty curt and ungrateful im sorry miss trumbull i said id like to talk to mr redbird i really would fine she said splendid ill just give him a ring and whats the matter the telephone i said i imagine youre on a party line and oh she hesitated well of course i wouldnt need to say why i wanted to see him but perhaps youre right ill just run over to his house itll only take a few minutes i sure hate to put you out i said fiddlesticks she said stop saying sure all the time stop saying reckon havent i taught you anything at all eat your dinner yes maam i grinned and i got busy i heard the front door close as she left and that beef was sure certainly good but i stopped chewing for a minute i had a notion that i was doing the wrong thing by letting her get mr redbird but it was just a notion not even a real gradea hunch and after what id been through i was apt to be jumpy without any reason so i shrugged it off and went back to eating i was just finishing up about a halfhour later when i heard them coming up the front steps and across the porch the door opened and closed and she called up the stairs thomas everything all right yes maam i called back i su certainly am ill get more coffee for all of us she said you go right on up mr redbird he came up and i felt a little funny embarrassed and of course i didnt need to he winked at me pushing me back on the pillows when i started to get up he laid a hand on my forehead puffing his pipe thoughtfully his eyes warm and friendly think you might live he smiled and sat down yes sir i hope so i said just dont worry he said everythings going to be all right miss trumbull came in she set the coffee tray down on a stand lifted the other one onto the dresser and poured coffee all around now she said seating herself in a straight chair and nodding to me now thomas i started talking i told them everything there was to tell the only things i kind of glided over was how much donna had meant to me and the messy way mary had acted but i could see that they understood without having all the details i finished talking miss trumbull looked at mr redbird he sat frowning a little tapping the stem of his pipe against his teeth you think then he said at last that your father did it im sure he did i said just to put you in a bad light i dont know tom the risk hed run and all it seems like a rather extreme measure to me id call it a little more than putting me in a bad light i said trying not to make it sound too short he was killing me the same as killing me and mary would have told him about donna and he was fixing me there too just wiping me out wasnt enough for him he wanted to make her hate mmm yes i suppose he didnt seem very convinced can you think of any other reason why he would have killed mr ontime well i said theres the oil he may have thought that with mr ontime out of the way donna would lease their land for drilling and he could lease his ill just bet that was it said miss trumbull but mr redbird shook his head im afraid not theres a basic contradiction there if hed simply killed matthew ontime yes but to kill him and frame tom for the murder that doesnt add up hed know that donna would hardly be inclined to accommodate the father of the man who had kified her father well miss trumbull hesitated well i said i know i didnt do it now tom mr redbird smiled keep your nightshirt on of course he added we mustnt overlook the big thing your fathers hatred for mr ontime in itself it would hardly be sufficient to move him to prompt him to take such a terrible risk but when you couple that hatred with his hatred for you and he felt like he didnt have anything to lose i pointed out all that was left to him was getting even with me and mr ontime yes he said yes thats true but still he paused and frowned down into the bowl of his pipe let me ask you this he said is there a chance that your father went up to the plantation to argue with mr ontime no i said he wouldnt have done that he was too stiffnecked anyhow hed have known it wouldnt get him a thing unless it was what i got ill tell you why i ask tom you see well he frowned troubledly it all seems very clearcut in a way your father hated you and ontime he had your knife and he had mary to alibi for him so he committed the murder qed with premeditation youre doggone right he did i said perhaps it seems that he must have but the premeditation and its there axiomatically bothers me mr ontime worked long hours but it would be extremely unusual for him or any of his employees to be out and around the place as late as midnight your father would know that hed know that there wouldnt be one chance in ten thousand of catching him outside the house and he certainly wouldnt dare go inside so why i dont know i said i mean maybe he wasnt being too logical he was i understand he wanted revenge and he wasnt much concerned with the cost and since you planned on leaving he had to commit the murder last night if he was going to do it at all yes it could have been that way he wasnt sure hed find mr ontime outside the house but the possibility existed and unfortunately materialized but he shook his head again it still doesnt quite work out i cant quite get over the idea that the murder was the result of a quarrel that it wasnt premeditated but you just said without regard to the murder instrument tom thats difficult to account for on any basis matthew ontime was a strong vigorous man with so many other truly deadly weapons available why should your father choose a pocketknife to kill him because he had to he had to use my knife in order to pin the murder on me but the odds were all against his being able to kill with it the chances were that matthew ontime would take it away from him before he got in one blow pa would take that chance i said if he was mad enough he just wouldnt care what happened yes but miss trumbull cleared her throat our job as i see it is simply to establish thomas innocence whats so difficult about it this this mary woman has it in for thomas and shes completely dominated by his father shes let him do her talking for her and the sheriff hasnt had any better sense than to let him what needs to be done is to get her off by herself throw a good scare into her ill bet shed change her story fast shed forget all about this neat little alibi which places carver innocently in bed at the time of the murder but that still wouldnt prove that he did it we dont need to prove it it would prove that he and she were both liars that their testimony as to thomas probable whereabouts was inspired by pure malice thats all we need to prove the rest is up to the sheriff mr redbird hesitated well he admitted it would certainly help to break down marys story just help i said i cant see why it wouldnt do the whole job i mean its like miss trumbull says the rest is up to the sheriff he looked down at the carpet not saying anything i waited and then it came to me what he was thinking and didnt want to say i see i said it was my knife and i cant prove that i lost it and and ive acted pretty hotheaded i slipped up to the plantation before after theyd all gone to bed it looks like id be a lot more likely to go about a killing without figuring out the details than pa would thats about the size of it he said soberly now if your father and mary would swear that you werent it wouldnt do any good now well it certainly wouldnt be as effective as if theyd done it in the first place but just a moment miss trumbull banged her coffee cup into her saucer you two keep going off on tangents lets get back to thomas father naturally hes not going to do anything to assist the son he tried to incriminate and theres no use discussing it what we need to do is to prove that his alibi is false when we do that well prove a great deal more than the fact of his lying dont you see why else unless he committed the murder would he need an alibi a big smile began spreading over mr redbirds face he slapped his knee suddenly why of course he said laughing thats my devious indian mind for you i cant see the pit for the snakes in all likelihood toms father told mary hed committed the murder hed want her to be prepared of course her testimony would only be hearsay and were still faced with the matter of the we are not said miss trumbull firmly the sheriff is i stand corrected id feel a lot better if well i stand corrected he smiled good said miss trumbull now i more coffee well i guess i wont either then now i suppose its too late tonight to do anything and well hardly have time before school tomorrow morning do you suppose we could get away early in the afternoon around two say well do it whether we can or not ill talk to blunden explain that we have a strong personal interest in the matter and that we want mary given a thorough grilling and well go right along with him to see that he gives it to her said miss trumbull right he stood up brushing the tobacco crumbs from his trousers toms going to stay here is he why yes naturally miss trumbull frowned where else would he stay well i was just thinking if it became known that he was here it i dont need to stay i said im feeling fine now i can no no mr redbird said quickly i didnt mean that you should hide out my thought was that you might be uh doing yourself a disfavor by remaining a fugitive but but i have to i said what else can i do nothing said miss trumbull youll stay right here until this is all cleared up ill keep the shades drawn and you wont answer the door or telephone and everything will be perfectly all right mr redbird hesitated then his smile came back and he put out his hand of course it will be all right he said after all its only a matter of a day less than a day actually we shook hands and said goodnight miss trumbull walked downstairs with him to the door and they stood talking for several minutes before he left i couldnt hear what they were saying but it sounded like they might be having a kind of argument finally the door closed and miss trumbull came back upstairs she started stacking the trays and dishes together then paused and looked at me now whats the matter she said are you sure you want me to stay here if i didnt id tell you so she said and i knew she would too and i smiled anything else she said out with it may as well say it as think it i dont really think it i said i was just wondering if well stop wondering mr redbirds concern is all for you not for himself or me hes your good friend thomas remember that no matter how he acts yes maam i said i think the world of him too good keep right on thinking it now go to sleep yes maam i said and i did i didnt wake up until around ten the next morning and shed gone of course but there was a note for me propped up on the dresser it read like this do dont eat breakfast in warming oven worry sandwiches in refrig attempt housework rest as much as possible make yourself at home miss t shed washed and ironed my clothes and laid them out on the chair i took a long hot bath put them on and went down to the kitchen there was a platter of ham and eggs and biscuits in the oven and the coffee pot was half full and still warm i sat there eating until there wasnt so much as a crumb of biscuit left and the coffee pot was empty then i put the dishes in the sink and went back upstairs with a book i took my shoes off and stretched out on the bed but the way i was feeling i just couldnt read i was feeling so good that is i was still pretty stiff in the legs but in my mind the only way that really counts id never felt better in my life this time yesterday id been wading up that icy creek on a pair of twisted ankles and i hadnt had a hope in the world and now here i was all nice and clean and warm and i had hope and something better when you just hope youre not sure and i was sure i knew everything was going to be all right i reckoned that there wasnt a man in oklahoma that had two finer friends than miss trumbull and mr redbird and i wouldnt let them down either id make em proud of me id show em i had the stuff in me that they believed i had i lay back with my hands locked behind my head wiggling my toes grinning and squirming now and then out of pure good feeling i thought back over the past the times id gotten way out of line but i wouldnt any more and id do what i could do to swing the others around to the right way of thinking because our thinking it looked like to me was at least twothirds of what was wrong with us we were trying to support two civilizations side by side three if you counted the indians and there wasnt any land ever good enough to do that and we were always halfsore and suspicious of each other fighting each other instead of getting at the root of the trouble looking back i could see that just about all the mess i was in was due to the wrong kind of thinking abe toolate had tried to get me in trouble but i could have avoided that trouble if i hadnt prodded him about his race chief sundown had tried to whip me off the plantation and naturally i didnt like it but what had really riled me the thing that id dreaded having known and couldnt stand teasing about was the fact that hed done it and mr ontime cantankerous and mean as pa was hed never have talked and argued that way with a white landlord and but i wasnt going to go along that way any more id get some kind of little job around town sos i could finish high school id go on to college get some law training anyway that was the place to begin to start changing things the law and and donna well shed feel pretty strongly about pa naturally but she wouldnt feel any stronger than i would and i had a few things to forget myself so that would be all right it would all work out in time and if i could see that i was going someplace and i would be it would be all right about her money i raised my head a little and looked at the clock on the dresser it was almost noon but i wasnt even halfway hungry i yawned and lay back down i pulled the comforter up over me i sighed real long and deep and slow and closed my eyes friends i thought the finest a man could have it takes real trouble for a man to find out who his friends are i went to sleep i woke up at fivefifteen when the alarm on the dresser clock went off i guess miss trumbull kept it set for that time and forgot to change it when she brought it into my room it was hard to believe id slept that long i wondered what was keeping miss trumbull and mr redbird i went into the bathroom and washed and combed my hair i came back into the bedroom and put my shoes on i began to get a little worried i didnt see how anything could go wrong but and it wouldnt either how could it with them on my side i snatched up the book kind of mad at myself for worrying doubting and tried to read theyd be here any minute now any minute i listened to the clock ticking the minutes off any minute and sure enough they came up the stairs together miss trumbull walking in front and they seemed to be coming awful slow but naturally it would seem slow to me they came in and i started to stand up and then i let myself down on the bed again is theres something wrong i said bosh said miss trumbull but her eyes shied away from mine nonsense how are you feeling fine i said but weve had a little setback but well work it out just dont go getting yourself in an uproar all we need to do is keep our heads and she turned quickly and started for the door mr redbird will explain to you now you heed what he says thomas yes maam i said but no buts about it you just im going down and fix dinner she hurried out bumping into the door jamb as she left mr redbird sat down and began filling his pipe tom he said slowly will you do me a favor something thats very hard to do what about mary i said thats all i want to know did she no that isnt all you want to know miss trumbull and i and the sheriff spent most of the afternoon out there she and i have gone over all the circumstances of mr ontimes death weve found out but that doesnt matter i said all i want to its like miss trumbull said last night all we have to do is and perhaps you remember my attitude last night he gestured with the pipe stem now listen to me tom i want you to understand exactly what youre up what the situation is but will you listen to me tom will you start doing me that favor right now but i i swallowed and broke off all right i said he took a long pull at the pipe then leaned forward his arms resting on his knees so far as can be determined he said matthew ontime went to bed at tenthirty just when he got up and went outside again no one knows no one heard him or saw him his rooms are at the rear with their own entrance so arranged that he could go in and out without disturbing the household thus he may have got up a few minutes after he supposedly retired or it may have been immediately before the murder he paused a moment frowning down at the carpet i said i still dont see let me tell you or let me ask you a question youd been seeing donna secretly for a long time you were sweethearts and obviously youd talk a lot together personal intimate stuff did she tell you were you familiar with the living arrangements there at the plantation you knew where her room was you say but did she tell you i im not sure i said i dont remember that she did but she might have i see what does she say well he hesitated now shes understandably overwrought and shes not absolutely positive but shes probably right i said go on lets have the rest of it take it easy tom im not telling you all this because i like to i know i said im sorry mr redbird now the night of your fracas with chief sundown after hed interfered did mr ontime tell you he wanted to talk to you i guess you know he did i said and you simply walked off without answering him yes i said and i didnt make any appointment to see him later i didnt go back up there and tom well i didnt i said i know that now will you let me go on good mr ontime wasnt fully dressed he was wearing houseslippers and he had a jacket pulled on over his undershirt but he did have his trousers on and his wallet containing approximately two hundred dollars was in them and it was still there intact when his body was found in other words robbery wasnt the motive for the murder of course it wasnt i said i told go on he was stabbed from the front obviously he was acquainted with the man he had to deal with and he wasnt alarmed by him he knew him all right i said and he wouldnt have been afraid of him the man killed him stabbed him to death then he lifted his body up over a fivefoot fence and dropped it down inside thats it tom thats the whole story you need and are entitled to all of it and ive given it to you lets go through it again point by point one he held up a finger your father wasnt familiar with the ontime living arrangements two mr ontime would never have left the house to see him hed had his say to your father and that say was final three and this is the real clincher tom he simply couldnt have lifted mr ontime over that fence it would have been a physical impossibility for him to do it he nodded to me soberly and i felt the blood moving up into my face my hands trembled and i shoved them into my pockets he did do it i said he was the only one that could have it wasnt a robbery mr ontime got along fine with everyone else pa was the only one that had any reason to kill him i dont know how he did it i know it looks like i did and i dont need anyone to tell me or go out and see how much more they can dig up against tom stop right there i thought you were going to talk to mary make her tell the truth thats all you had to do shed have broken down fast why didnt you just do that instead of tom tom i yes sir i said we did talk to mary the sheriff took her back and forth through her story a dozen times and he couldnt shake it and he would have if shed been lying youll have to face it tom your father did not kill matthew ontime but i he i know he and mary could have removed you from suspicion largely removed you from it with a word or two and they did the opposite instead but that is no evidence at all that he killed matthew ontime particularly in view of the evidence to the contrary bbut but theres no one else i pointed out no one but me yes there is theres the man who did the killing but who no one else had any reason to if pa didnt do it then it has to be me everything about it looks like it was me theyll never look for anyone else theyll never find they dont need to tom we dont need to all that has to be done is establish your innocence all i laughed kind of wildly all yes and well do it too this case will look entirely different in the hands of a good lawyer and well see that you have a good one i stood up i appreciate that mr redbird i said thats mighty fine of both of you but it wouldnt do any good the best lawyer in the country cant change facts i wouldnt stand a chance all i can do now is no tom he shook his head thats the one thing you cant do thats tying the rope around your own neck dont you see people only think now but if you run theyll know theyll conclude that you dont dare face trial and theyll be right i said gosh mr redbird i dont see how sit down tom he said quietly i dont think id better the quicker i sit down he repeated well now i said sitting down well now i sure hope you wont try to stop me mr redbird ive trusted you you and miss trumbull are my friends all ive got in the whole world but youre not me mr redbird youre not the man whos maybe going to the chair youre youre not either tom youre innocent and well prove it but if we let you run away then that would be the end of you theyd catch you in no time at all and youd stand convicted before you ever had a trial or theyd hunt you down and shoot you trying to escape i ill take the chance at least ill have a chance no tom mr redbird i said im asking you to get out of my way no we were both standing now and i was trying to move around him he put his hand against my chest and pushed he kept saying no tom no and i didnt want to do what i could have done so i just elbowed his hand down and grabbed him by the shoulders i started to swing him around and someone was pounding up the front steps banging on the door three or four people it sounded like and i stood listening still holding on to mr redbird staring into his eyes and i could feel my own eyes getting wider and wider the door opened and miss trumbull was saying oh oh my goodness would you gentlemen mind waiting just a few minutes im afraid and another voice well now i reckon weve waited a little too long already miss trumbull and i cant say as i appreciate the way i took my hands away from mr redbirds shoulders i rubbed them up and down against my shirt i trusted you i said im sorry tom were only doing whats best for you i trusted you i said you were my friends then they were in the room and i was holding out my hands my wrists i was still staring at him my eyes getting wider and wider as they snapped on the handcuffs they kept their word to me miss trumbull and mr redbird did they got me a lawyer and he was a good one one of the best criminal lawyers in oklahoma or anywhere else i didnt want them to do it i wouldnt talk to them when they came to see me and the judge made it clear to me that i was entitled to counsel of my own choosing so id just about made up my mind to take an attorney appointed by the court but this lawyer he was from oklahoma city and his name was kossmeyer caustic kossmeyer the papers called him when they werent calling him something worse this lawyer came to see me and the first thing i knew i didnt speak or look up when the jailer let him into my cell i just sat on my bunk looking down at the floor like id been doing and the jailer locked him in and went away but i couldnt sit that way forever and it looked like he was prepared to stay that long so finally i looked up and it sounds crazy the spot i was in but i burst out laughing i just couldnt help myself he was a little fellow barely five feet if he was that and he wouldnt have weighed more than a hundred pounds with his clothes wet he didnt actually look like me at all but he was looking like me now in a way say that a cartoon will look like a man he had his lips pushed way out and his mouth pulled way down until the corners almost met under his chin his eyes were rolled down and in looking at the wisp of hair hed pulled down over his forehead i didnt want to laugh i was in pure hell and he was poking fun at me i tried to scowl and his face shifted a little and he was scowling and looking twice as funny as he had before and i couldnt hold in any longer when kossmeyer wanted you to laugh you laughed and he wanted me to and i did he tossed his briefcase into the corner of the bunk and sat down beside me im kossmeyer he said as though he was telling me something he didnt really need to like you might say im the president of the united states im your attorney youre my client now where can i buy about a thousand feet of calf rope calf id stopped laughing i said about your being my attorney mr koss a thousand feet he said and were going to need every goddam inch of it because were going to screw em kid theyre going to be screaming calf rope from here to red river he tapped me on the shirt front yessir well go through em like salts through a widow woman i laughed blushing a little i guess and he grinned and nodded thats better he said did you kill that guy tom and the way he put it i wouldnt have minded telling him if i had done it no i said i dont care how it looks i right the first time he said wrong the second looks are all we do care about now it looks like you killed ontime and frankly that side of the picture we cant change much we can scramble it up throw in all kinds of doubts accuse the prosecutor of wanting to stick you because youre a baptist and hes a belong to a church well thats all right ill dig up some kind of angle but we cant really change those looks much all we can do is make em harder to see change the looks of something that can be changed know what i mean i guess i dont i said i understand theres lot of hunting down here whats the penalty for shooting a possum hound huh i frowned why no one would do a thing like that theyd throw you so far into jail youd never find your way out what about rattlesnakes any penalty for shooting them no of course not no one wants rattlesnakes around he nodded and i waited for him to go on but he seemed to be through he was waiting apparently on me oh i said finally and i shook my head that wouldnt work mr kossmeyer itd be hard to find a finer man than mr ontime and id be the first to say so thats the way he appeared he said anyway i didnt kill him so it appears that you did we deny it naturally we throw in the old doubts by the armload but we cant and wont win that way for all practical purposes he tapped me on the chest again were not going to let em try you were going to try him and her donna no i said not if you mean what i think you do let me tell you something kid theres just one thing that people never get over being dead anything else can be patched up and when i say that im talking from experience i defended a madam one time mayhem and attempted murder shed put a bullet through her gentleman friends head and damned near sawed him in half with a razor now he was a hell of a nice guy honest easygoing had his own business in fact the whole trouble had started when he threatened to drop her if she didnt get out of her racket i said to hell with the facts to hell with the way things look hes an okay guy i said and he doesnt really want this beautiful woman hung in the smokehouse for twenty years hes suffered for it and hes entitled to it and im going to keep her out where he can get at it when he cools off so i put him on trial i smeared him like dog crap on a dance floor i hit him so hard his shirt ran up and down his back like a windowshade and the jury wanted to give my client a medal and about three months later she and this guy got married thats a true story tom sometime when youre in oklahoma city ill introduce you to them theyre good friends of mine and one of the happiest couples i know of well i said after i stopped laughing i see what you mean but it wasnt like that with this isnt the same thats right this is a capital case i i just couldnt do it i said am i crazy if you took a step toward the stand id murder you myself youre not going to say anything all i want you to do is look hurt and handsome like you wouldnt say crap if you had a mouthful but youd make her look like i guess not mr kossmeyer if ive got anything to say about it he shrugged all right tom what does miss what do they think about it i dont see that they have a think coming i got a thousanddollar retainer to come down here and look into the case all right ive looked the thousands spent now i start all over again well i said as long as theyre putting up the money and youre putting up your life its like i said tom they havent got a think coming its your life through no fault of your own and without your consent youve been forced to trust it to a thing called justice and that gal isnt blind tom shes a crosseyed drunk with dts and a hearing aid and she doesnt know shinola unless you shove it under her nose did you ever see a man electrocuted no i said i have ive seen any number of executions every time ive felt myself getting holy thinking more about blackstone than i did people ive gone to an execution ive seen em die in the gas chamber sitting on that little stool with their lips clenched their nostrils pinched together fighting to hold their breath until they just couldnt do it any longer ive dont i said and the hangings where their heads come off or their necks stretch way out three or four feet until theyre not much bigger around than one of those bars but the chair tom thats in a class by itself ive got a theory about it and ive talked to some pretty smart people who think i may be right i dont think the juice really kills em i think its such a terrific overload for what it has to pass through that it never reaches the brain all the brain they still know whats going on after theyre taken down to the basement and their guts are cut out and for gods sake i started to jump up but he pulled me back down you dont have to and theyre tossed into the brine tank they still know when theyre nailed into a pine box and dropped down into a hole in the ground they go on knowing thinking for days thinking about green grass and sunlight and cool air and the soft flesh of women and the laughter of little children and i dont know how they manage it but but some of those coffins have been opened up and it seems that they try to get out it doesnt do any good of course but they try to climb back up there with their gutted bellies and their melted eyes and i was sitting with my head bent forward in my hands shaking sick at my stomach he grabbed me by the shoulder jerked me around facing him all right he snapped thats it whats a little smearing compared to that think about that and tell me what difference it makes if she used herself for what she was made for ive got to think i said youre probably right but ill have to think about it mr kossmeyer forget about the goddam money and dont think im handing you charity when i say that im going to wait about a year and then im going to send my bill up to that big plantation house and youll be right there to pay it i didnt say anything i just couldnt make up my mind i knew he made sense and i didnt seem to make much at least i couldnt put it into words but i still couldnt say yes like he wanted me to i didnt kill him i said why cant we work on that find out who did it how well i dont know but neither do i and im not going to try tom i dont want anything else dug up theres too much already but oh i said he nodded slowly you say youre innocent i say you are and then we just forget about it because what you and i say doesnt matter its what the jury says that matters what you can make em say and ive showed you the only way to make em say the right thing if they say youre guilty you are if they say youre innocent you are but i am i said dont you didnt i say so tell the turnkey maybe hell let you go ill have to think about it i said maybe there is another way he said ill plead you insane it should be easy to prove i cant tell you now i said i just cant and thats all there is to it he picked up his briefcase and stood looking at me for a moment then he nodded suddenly as though hed asked himself a question and answered it all right he said thatll have to do i guess i was just about to take a case back in the city but i think i can hold off my decision a few hours of course it would be much better if but ill certainly try he shouted for the turnkey he waited frowning thoughtfully shaking his head now and then and i grinned to myself letting him go right ahead with his little act i was beginning to understand him i thought i could see right through him id forgotten already because he wanted me to forget that you didnt see any farther through kossmeyer than he wanted you to see the turnkey came kossmeyer sighed and started for the door dont worry tom im pretty sure ill be able to make it all right i said hell ill make it somehow im sure i can see you in the morning huh bright and early bright and early i said i woke up at daylight and of course that gave me quite a little while to wait even if he was early but that was all right id started thinking things through and i wanted to have them all clear in my mind before he came hed got me all confused the day before scared one minute and laughing the next i hadnt been able to get the real point of things across to him it wouldnt be enough for him just to get me off if everyone still thought that i did it well where would i be then how would donna feel if she went on thinking i killed her father of course i didnt want to die it wasnt right for me to go to the chair no matter what but if i could just make him understand that i wasnt guilty make him care whether i wasnt then maybe we could dig up the real murderer he had to be a local man he must have left some kind of clues if theyd really look for him with their minds open they were almost bound to get a lead on him i couldnt do anything but kossmeyer could hed have to if i could make him understand because what good would it do if everyone still thought i id be alive but id be alive i ate a pretty good breakfast everything considered i stood up on my bunk and peeked out the window and i figured it must be getting on toward nine oclock he said hed be there bright and early i started walking i walked back and forth from the wall to the door less than three good paces the turnkey went by the door i called out to him and asked him the time and then he went on past a few steps like he wasnt going to tell me he stopped though and took out his watch he dropped it back in his pocket again tenthirty tenthirty i said are you sure he kept on going not answering me i walked some more i stood up on my bunk and looked out i sat down on the bunk i lay down i counted to five hundred by tens then by fives then by ones and still he hadnt come it was way after eleven i started pacing again he would come of course he was just playing with me now he was waiting until i was softened up ready to say or do anything he wanted and then hed show up i looked out the window hed be here any minute now hed said hed be here early so i stopped he hadnt actually said so he hadnt promised he said hed try that he was almost sure he could make it he but that was part of the trick hed known id remember that and start wondering if but he was a busy man there were probably plenty of people trying to hire him people who didnt want a thing but not to die people with money and he knew he couldnt ever get any money out of me hed get plenty of publicity of course and i reckoned no lawyer everd had so much he couldnt use more but but he didnt need to fool around with a guy like me i couldnt mean a thing to him really when you got right down to it they didnt serve lunch at the jail just bread and black coffee but i couldnt even eat that much it was all i could do to keep from kicking it over and slamming it against the walls he had another case hed said early he hadnt promised the sweat ran down my face and i kept mopping it with my sleeve but it was sweaty too i was allover sweat and i had to keep catching myself to stop from mumbling and and i knew that was just what he wanted i knew hed planned it that way but i couldnt be sure i didnt know i didnt know i and finally i did know i knew he hadnt been kidding i knew he wasnt coming i knew it and i wondered how i could have been so doggone crazy as to hold out against him and id have given anything if and i looked up and there he was standing at the bars looking in wait a minute he jerked his head at the turnkey im not sure im going in how about it tom whats the answer wewell i said cant you no but but i didnt want to die i didnt want to die come in i said please come in the turnkey locked him in and went away he tossed his briefcase onto the bunk and looked down at me uhhuh he nodded but thats a head up there tom that thing you got he flicked his fingers across my forehead thats a pumpkin so which one of us do you suppose had better do the thinking you i said i didnt stall you simply to swing you around i wanted to show you what can happen if you try to do your own thinking i got it i said i got the idea all right hang onto it youll probably never have another one i nodded id have nodded or yessed him on anything he said he sat down beside me like he had the day before and slapped me on the knee good boy now lets get started take it right from the beginning how long have you known the gal well i said she grew up there on the plantation and weve i said known in the legal sense when did you start getting into her pants my face went kind of stiff i tried to smile but i couldnt it was over a year ago i said she was pulled up by the side of the road with a flat tire and i offered to help naturally naturally poor boy big car beautiful girl how could you resist you in all your innate innocence and courtesy well it as a matter of fact i wasnt real courteous i was pretty ofthand bashful he nodded inexperienced fighting against the peril you could only sense look i said it just wasnt that way mr kossmeyer i know it probably seems funny it happening the first time we ever really met but it wasnt shed never she was a virgin and did i say no he spread his hands sure she was a virgin and shed had about all of it she could take she could have got married sure but that would have been too much trouble and she wouldnt risk her social position with one of her own standing so she picked on you someone who wouldnt dare say anything and wouldnt be believed if he did but im telling you how often did you see her after that well pretty often maybe two or three times a week but there was more to it than that mr kossmeyer we enjoyed being together we were in love and that always makes it better he said where did you meet her near the school she used to park in a place back under the willows a little off the road go on keep right on talking tom and i went on i kept on talking that day the next one more than a week in all and he nodded and listened he listened and kept twisting things around after school hed say at noon sometimes even in the morning just wouldnt leave you alone and well she did tell you where her room was didnt she didnt she and you were up there at her house werent you werent you and thats a pumpkin boy there isnt a goddam thing in it but goo and its running out your mouth sure you wanted it but you didnt take it you wouldnt have dared to take a straight look at this beautiful rich girl who thought only of her own selfish pleasures she was beating you with it kid thats what happened she swung at you until you were in mortal fear for yourself and you climbed her in selfdefense and finally of course she is tom dont you suppose i know that shes a lovely sweet darling girl and thats why we cant let her make a serious mistake and if the game gets rough well we dont make the rules i was in the courtroom every day right from the time they started picking the jury and id been dreading that and every other part of the trial but now i got so i kind of looked forward to it i dont mean i liked it exactly it made me wince a little sometimes to think that this was the law to know the thinking that was going on behind the things he did it made me shiver to think what would happen and probably did happen every day somewhere if a man like that was against you hed help some guy down from the jury box and bow and smile to him and almost shine his shoes then hed sit down at the table with me and pretend to riffle through some papers and tell me the way of his actions a god dam deacon a baptist deacon dont they have any unitarians in this burg that was one of those eyeforaneye boys hed have pulled the switch on you himself if he had a chance and another time after hed accepted two jurors who looked mighty sorry to me barbers barbers and painters and paperhangers if you could get enough of em you wouldnt need a lawyer carpenters huhuh their minds seem to move in a straight line but barbers and painters and paperhangers id almost as soon have em as bartenders the county attorney was always watching me and it seemed to me that he must have just one thing on his mind and worried i mentioned it to kossmeyer he grinned then he looked thoughtful he might at that he might be stupid enough to ask why you dont take the stand ill try to crowd him into it were going to screw these bastards anyway but a mistrial always helps the first day of the trial the morning of the first day kossmeyer moved for dismissal on grounds of insufficient evidence then he asked that the judge disqualify himself because he was onesixteenth cherokee and he charged the county attorney with personal prejudice accepting fees from the ontime estate well the judge did have a little indian blood in him along with maybe a million other oklahomans and the county attorney and almost every other county officer did get little service fees from ontime the kind theyd get from any landowner but all this had to be explained to the jurors and the more you explain some things the worse they sound kossmeyer got a heck of a bawling out from the judge and he had to apologize to both him and the county attorney but as he turned away he hunched his shoulders and raised his eyebrows at the jurors the judge saw him and bawled him out again kossmeyer apologized again he said that he knew he appeared to be a humorous even pitiful figure but god in his wisdom has chosen to make him thus and he hoped that the court would bear with him with the resignation which he was forced to bear with himself he said that he understood this was hard to do for those who had been carefully nurtured and tended until their bodies became strong and handsome but the judge ordered him to sit down but he looked pretty uncomfortable he was six feet tall and he weighed two hundred pounds you see kid kossmeyer told me that night weve got em dodging already him and the ca no matter how they play it now theyre always a little in the wrong if they get tough theyre sore if they dont theyve got a guilty conscience i see i said how soon do you think ill be free mr kossmeyer free he said startled and i was thinking what i was going to do when i did get free how i was going to face pa with the axe in my hand yes i nodded how long do you think the trial will last three weeks perhaps he said and he left soon after that as it turned out it was three weeks before the case went to the jury but for all practical purposes the trial ended on friday of the second week donna was on the stand shed been there day after day and kossmeyer was leading her back and forth over the same thing phrasing the same questions in a hundred different ways and making her answer them until it sounded like shed never done anything else but i object again i object to this entire line of questioning and i am amazed that your honor the judges gavel came down with a bang the prosecution will refrain from mention of his emotions or the source of their inspiration however due to the seriousness of this charge mr kossmeyer i am allowing the defense the greatest latitude possible but i am inclined to feel that i shall connect everything up your honor i feel obliged to warn you again that i am quite sensitive to the courts warnings i might even say i am becoming intimidated by them i have been warned about my posture the tone of my voice the nervous tic acquired in childhood the mr kossmeyer you are in contempt of court you will leave one hundred dollars with the clerk at the close of todays session i shall have to ask the courts forbearance for a few days as the court knows my client has no funds and my resources have been seriously strained by youre breaking my heart i am relieved to learn that the court has yes may i proceed you may thank you your honor said kossmeyer and he turned back to donna now lets see i wonder if i might ask the reporter to oh never mind i seem to recall the topic under discussion by the way thats a very attractive suit you have on thank you i notice that the skirt is equipped with zippers laughter i object mr kossmeyer now said kossmeyer i believe we agreed that during the course of your uh active association with the defend ant you were probably intimate with him a hundred times yes give or take a few dozen your honor i demand that sustained the remark will be stricken could it have been as many as a hundred and twentyfive times miss ontime it could have been but no children resulted no your honor all this has already gone into the record and defense counsel can have no legitimate purpose in oh let it go said kossmeyer you used contraceptives miss ontime is that correct yes you did you supplied the money for them you purchased them in another town you did it not he is that right well naturally he just answer my question please yes with the intent and purpose of preventing human life i yes you dont have a very high regard for human life do you miss ontime objection your honor for certain specimens of it no said donna sustained strike it the witness will wait for the courts ruling hereafter before responding to questions how many times did you receive the defendant in your bedroom miss ontime never are you quite sure of that after all you seem to have satisfied your appetite in virtually every other place why not in the natural habitat for such activity objection mr kossmeyer just when are you going to connect this decidedly peculiar line of questioning to the case at hand very soon your honor i shall depend on that witness may answer im sure he was never in my bedroom why not since because he just wasnt oh said kossmeyer slowly you were afraid your father would object of course he would have objected i see you hadnt told him then of your affair with the defendant naturally i hadnt you were afraid to tell him i yes no i just didnt want to tell him you wanted to keep it secret right not only from him but everyone else i i suppose so it didnt make any difference to you did it if to conceal your affair an innocent man an innocent victim of circumstances objection i withdraw the question now let me ask you this miss ontime did you ever invite the defendant to visit you in your bedroom no are you very sure of that well i might have asked him but i was just did you ever invite him to visit you on the plantation grounds under the shrubbery say no youre sure im positive thank you said kossmeyer now let me see if i have the situation straight you asked him to come to your bedroom but he didnt come but you didnt ask him to visit you on the grounds and he did come is that what you expect us to believe miss ontime i dont care what you believe im sorry you dont care what we believe miss ontime a mans life is at stake and most of us these good jury men are here at considerable sacrifice but counsel will save his orations for the newspapers i take no exception to that your honor i find our american press much fairer than some of our other institutions may i proceed with the defense of my client you may you may also see me in my chambers after adjournment now miss ontime you were saying that you didnt care what we thought and i suppose a girl whos had every advantage of our civilization with none of its responsibilities mr kossmeyer wouldnt care incidentally what are your feelings regarding the defendant i hate him you do now at the beginning of the trial as i recall your attitude was more one of sorrow you were only interested in seeing justice done and i hate him i hope he dies i hate hate hate she was rocking in her chair eyes clinched screaming laughing i hhate hhim i ha and kossmeyer was shouting sure you do because youve been exposed for the shameless graceless thing you are thats why youve lied because you want him to die why dont you tell the truth hah why the county attorney was yelling objections the judge was swinging his gavel bang bang bang calling and gesturing to the bailiffs but kossmeyer kept on shouting at her he kept right on even after the bailiffs grabbed him and started dragging him from the courtroom youre not fooling anyone the jury knows what you are so why dont you tell the truth that this poor misguided youth is too chivalrous to reveal this youth who stands on the brink of eternity where you placed him tell the jury how he was attacked by your father and forced to de that was as far as he got before they dragged him out donna was carried from the courtroom court was adjourned for the day kossmeyer got a fivehundreddollar fine and a thirtyday jail sentence to be served as soon as he could arrange his affairs but he said it was worth it when he came to see me that night that wrapped it up kid he said it may drag on for another week but its all over with the jury well i swallowed hard thats good shell get over it tom i know people i dont know a goddam thing but people and i say shell get over it i knew she wouldnt get over it but i didnt say anything after all hed done it for me and id helped him do it all itll take is time he went on and tom he hesitated youll have that time how do you mean i said dont you see boy this was murder the big rap and they had you cold we didnt have a card in our hands weve won but we havent won the fight only the first round therell be others and well win those too well trim em down to size and pick em off on points but meanwhile well youll have some time but you said i said wed beat the chair and we have and were goddam lucky to do it i wonder i said the jury was out three days they brought in a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree with an urgent recommendation for leniency the judge asked me if i had anything to say before sentence was pronounced i started to shake my head then i said im not guilty of murder in the second degree or any other kind he sentenced me to twenty years at hard labor at the state reformatory for men at sandstone oklahoma i turned and looked out into the courtroom there was some overlapping but the spectators were divided roughly into three groups indians whites and negroes the white and negro sections were packed with people crowding into the aisles the indian section well that would have been packed except for abe toolate abe had a whole bench to himself my eyes swept on over him and i remember thinking and not getting much satisfaction out of it that he looked as miserable as i felt then i was looking at the front bench where miss trumbull and mr redbird were sitting id never really looked at them during the trial id kept from looking at them and id never spoken to them now i looked at them and spoke i said what mr redbird had told me i would thank you i said i tried to spot pa because i had something i wanted to say to him too but he must have been standing in the back somewhere and and two deputy sheriffs were leading me away it was all over sonofabitch whaack the guard swung the strap again and my whole body jerked against the bars you gonna straighten out you gonna get along get along with me i said ornery whaack bastard whaack say it goddam yuh you gonna hell with you i said you can whaack whaack whaaack wha thats enough the doctor grabbed him by the arms and spun him around i said it was enough you dont want to kill him do you youre goddam right i do i the guard was panting mopping the sweat from his face you know how he is doc he just wont try to take him down unfasten his wrists but doc you know yourself how i know but get him down he cant take any more the guard jerked the wriststraps free i tried to grip the bars but my hands were numb and i sagged down to the floor on my knees all right get some help weve got to get him to the hospital huhuh doc i mean no sir he goes to the hole an thats orders not now it isnt he goes to the hospital i went to the hospital again id been in sandstone a little more than four months and this was my fourth time in the hospital a trusty washed and disinfected my back and put a gauze pack over it then he went away and the doctor stood looking down at me and finally he kicked a stool up to my cot and sat down i liked him rather i would have liked him if id been letting myself like anyone he probably wasnt more than ten years older than i was and i guess he had plenty to learn yet or he wouldnt have been in this kind of job well he said grimly how much longer do you think you can go on like this i started to shrug and the bandages drew i let out a gasp and he nodded eyes narrowed not so good huh you keep it up and theyll be carrying you out of here in pieces i feel all right i said theyll do it carver theyre itching to do it and it wont cost them a cent they wont do it i said because i knew i was going to go back i was going to stand there in the doorway with the axe in my hands i dont give a damn if they do it he frowned puzzledly leaning forward on the stool i know im wasting my time but i just dont get it what do you want what do you expect to gain i havent asked for anything i said from you or anyone else but why what are you trying to prove this isnt a good stir there arent any good ones now there was quite a bit of sympathy for you when you first came here you werent a criminal in the true sense of the term you were just a country boy whod got himself in a jam with a rich girl and had to kill her i laughed and shook my head never mind me doc go right ahead everyone was prepared to go easy on you you could have used your time here to improve yourself built yourself up and made plans for the day when you would leave ive got i broke off the sentence what nothing i said well he hesitated thats the way it was this was a great shock to you a man your age it seems like the end of the world to you but carver the fact that you got a twentyyear sentence doesnt mean you have to serve it youve got a good lawyer pulling for you behave yourself and even if he cant swing a new trial he can get you a reduction of sentence why youd be out of here in well in no time at all no time i said i reckon you mean about ten or twelve years dont you well you cant really expect to i dont expect anything i said i dont want anything just leave me alone doc just mind your own business and let me mind mine thats all the favor i ask youve got it he started to stand up do you want a shot that backs going to give you plenty of trouble tonight give it to me i said dont give it to me suit yourself his eyes flashed and i thought for a second he was going to slam me one instead though he sagged back down on the stool staring at me im sorry i said but its like you said doc youre wasting your time no one can do anything for me but why why carver i hesitated i didnt see how i could explain it to him when i couldnt really explain it to myself but he was a good guy so i tried to tell him its well its kind of like this doc like a story i read one time about a man he got to where he couldnt see not really see you know he had eyes but somehow they didnt tell his mind anything and his ears were the same way and his mouth somehow he couldnt find any words to come out of it and he couldnt taste anything not really taste it and all over his body doc he was kind of numb he couldnt feel anything and he knew there was something wrong he knew what was wrong but there wasnt a thing he could do about it him or anyone else not a thing and it was a waste of time to try because he was dead he waited as if he thought i might be going to say something else then he sighed and stood up well he smiled a little at least youve talked thats a start no i said thats the end there isnt any more well see well see about that i shook my head you wanted to know something ive tried to tell you but dont bother me again or ill tell you something you wont like he saw that i meant it he gave me a hypodermic and walked away and he didnt look back and i was sorry kind of but i couldnt help it i couldnt use any favors id had enough of em things being done to help me for my own good i knew i was going to get out and i wasnt going to have any help doing it id had help from pa from mary from miss trumbull and mr redbird from kossmeyer id had all the help i was going to take from anyone id had several letters from miss trumbull and mr redbird be of good faith hold your head high things may seem very dark now but they can change overnight id had a couple of letters from kossmeyer its taking a little time kid but well pull it off just keep that pumpkin screwed on your neck i didnt answer em id thought about it the first letters i got but then after a little it just didnt seem worth doing it didnt matter like everything else id heard from donna too shed sent me something in an envelope rather because it wasnt a real letter when i saw what it was i almost changed my mind about writing to kossmeyer i didnt see how he could have done this to me on top of everything else but writing him wouldnt have done any good and it was beginning to sink in on me that he couldnt make things any worse than they already were when youre at the end of something you cant go any further so i hadnt written but i was hoping hed show up hed said hed come out to see me as soon as he had some news and when he did id have some news for him i had about the kind of night id expected to have worse than any id gone through during any of my other times in the hospital it was daylight before i could go to sleep and i didnt sleep soundly then i waked up when i heard the doctor coming he took my temperature and glanced at the trusty he been getting along all right didnt say nothin didnt ask for nothin the trusty shrugged you know him doc yes the doctor turned back to me how are you feeling all right pretty stiff want a shot suit yourself i said he handed his bag to the trusty and walked away he didnt stop by my cot again until four days later he had me stand up and strip then while he examined me its going to be hot out there today he was going over my neck pulling and pushing on the skin with his fingers there isnt a breath of air stirring not a breath carver that quarry dust will be hot as a furnace and just about as thick i didnt say anything i wasnt asking him to do my job and i wasnt going to do his those welts are they could stand a lot of healing carver you might be pretty weak yet he turned me back around or dont you think so i dont know i said what would you like to have me say there was a little tightlipped grin on his face you tell me carver ask me ask me to say that you cant take the quarry for another week im not asking for anything i said id just as soon go now he hesitated and his grin went away but he was awfully young himself and id crowded him hard and hed gone too far to back down im not sure i heard you carver what id just as soon go now i said so i went a guard marched me down through the corridors and across the yard and out through the gates i walked five paces in front of him with my hands clasped behind my back but that nothing like that was necessary not that is to keep a man from escaping sometimes quite a few times a con had stooped down grabbed up a chunk of sandstone and thrown it all in one motion theyd knocked the guards out and killed them with their own guns but none of them had ever escaped the tower guards had telescopic sights on their rifles and they could pick a man off two miles away if they had to but they never had to no one ever got that far it was may and hot like the doctor had said it would be the heat hit you twice striking down against your head and neck glancing up off the rock and getting you in the eyes and face i was glad when we got to the quarry i was getting a little dizzy and i knew id better not i knew id better not fall or stop walking or say anything the doctor had said i was all right and that was that usually when there was a wind the guards stood way back from the pit you could look out of some of the cell windows and see them strung out in a big circle lounging a couple of hundred yards apart with that mileacross doud of dust in the center today though there wasnt a puff of breeze and they were moved in close so they could call back and forth to each other the prison guard left me and one of the quarry guards took over i took off my cap and stuffed it in my pocket i took off my shirt folded it and wrapped it around my head he tossed me a dust mask and i strapped it over my mouth and nose it was all stopped up but it didnt matter id take it off when i got to the bottom you couldnt get enough air through a mask and there werent any guards to make you wear one they didnt need guards in the pit there was no way out except by the ladder the quarry gangs had so much work to do every day a certain amount of rock to be hoisted up at the end of the day and if they didnt have it they stayed there until they got it i edged forward through the dust until i came to the ladder i wiped my hands against my pants grabbed the top of the ladder and swung my feet around on the rungs i went down over the side and down down down it was funny about that dust up at the top youd think well one things sure it cant be any worse than this youd think that every time because you couldnt see how it could be any worse and it always was it got worse every rung you went down after a little ways i could barely see the ladder except for the feel id have thought i was gripping dust instead of iron and i was gripping a lot of dust dusty mud my hands were sweating they slipped against the dusty rungs you couldnt grip them tight enough to keep from slipping i came to a little ledge a setback where the first ladder ended i hooked my arm through a rung pulled down the mask and scrubbed my face against my arm i started down the next ladder i stopped every few rungs or so to wipe my hands against my pants but they were wet with sweat too now and it didnt help much i whuffed out my nose against my shoulder but in a moment it was stopped and stinging again i tried to dig out my eyes with my fists and it wasnt any good of course it was just piling dirt on dirt i went down and down and i thought i remember thinking now this doesnt make any sense a mans got to see hes got to breathe hes got to be able to get a grip and it seemed like a pretty unusual thought i stopped and whuffed my nose out good and dug out my eyes and it helped a lot and my hands didnt slip any more because now this is more like it i thought why didnt i think of this because i wasnt holding on to anything i was in the hospital almost ten weeks and and i didnt see that doctor again the young one whod wanted to know why he left just as soon as they could get another doctor before i became conscious and i never saw him again and i was sorry about that because i didnt blame him a bit id have gotten out of temper with a guy like me myself if id been in his place the new doctor was a man up near his sixties and he didnt care about whys and whats he didnt care period you were just a job with him and the quicker he got through with you the better he liked it he was three weeks finding out that i had anything wrong with me besides concussion and two broken collar bones finally when he got around to noticing that i was passing a lot of blood he opened my chest and took out the splinters of rib and i guess he did a pretty good job but there was quite a bit of infection and it was slow in going away i coughed a lot i got down to where i wasnt much more than skin and bones and around the temples well there wasnt much of it but my hair turned gray it was along toward the end of the sixth week when id started getting a little better that kossmeyer came to see me i went out to the visitors room and he looked up from the papers he was reading then looked back down again then he looked up the second time and a halfdozen expressions flickered across his face in the space of a second and i knew he couldnt decide on which one to use how hed better act finally he decided and he stood up wagging his head the corners of his mouth drawn down he grabbed my hand shook it and pulled me down into a chair beside his jesus kid you look like hell think youre going to live ill live i said what do you want his expression shifted again he tapped me on the chest not a thing boy i drew back from his hand but he didnt seem to notice not a thing but to get you out of here yes i said i know it seems like a long time and youre sore but this took a hell of a lot of finagling tom im strictly a yak guy you know i couldnt do the brief on the case and i wanted it done by exactly the right guys the right ones get me two attorneys who used to sit on the appeals bench so so youve got me a new trial i said i aint done nothing else but tom whatll you get me this time i said ninetynine years so youre sore should i say it again he spread his hands now look kid heres how it stands i got that sonofabitch jesus thats a lousy jail down there i got him reversed on umptynine different points and were going to go right back before him well get that dirty bastard i tell you im still scratching if i have to hogtie him and carry him into court on my back well no i said you think we wont well get him and and that county attorney will be a setup too hell be begging for a deal and well make like he isnt there well go right into trial toss em all into the suds again only this time itll be lye water she theyll be screaming for that calf rope kid and that judge wont ill have that walleyed st bernard paying me fi thats not very smart is it i said what he slowed down a little how do you mean about her she sent me your bill marked paid well he ran through his expression again decided on the right act you dont mean youre sore about that he shrugged and widened his eyes looking kind of bewildered and hurt like id hauled off and hit him on the nose and id have done it too i think if id had the strength tell me something i said slowly are you crazy actually or relatively youd better shake up the seeds in that pumpkin boy didnt i tell you id be sending my bill to the plantation well so what if you werent there yet cant a gal write her own checks never mind i said just never mind good now i was saying well go right into trial well get everything screwed up good then well talk deal well let the county attorney talk us into one and heres what itll be tom you know what itll be nineteen and a half years manslaughter thats the only thing well plead to with the time youve served to equal the amount of your sentence he noded firmly watching me well get it tom hell fall over his feet to give it to us he waited again and i didnt say anything and gradually a look came into his eyes that id never seen there before oh well he said why am i excited ive already got my money and id wanted to hit him a minute before but now id have laid anyone out that put a finger on him he didnt think like i did i could never think like he did but i knew now seeing that look in his eyes that what hed done had been every bit as hard on him as it had on me harder perhaps because he hadnt been fighting for his life but mine and i knew that there wasnt enough money in the world to have made him do it mr kossmeyer i said sure he said ask anyone thats all i care about im trying to tell you im sorry i said ive been so wrapped up in how i felt sympathizing with myself i guess that i havent seen how other people might feel that they might not give way to their feelings like i did hell now youre talking like a you couldnt have made any money on this case youve probably spent a lot of your own i dont know why i couldnt see how much it must have taken that youd have to have that money from from any place you could get it to keep on fighting for me and i should have will you catch this guy he was grinning again grinfling and trying to scowl at the same time waitll i make him sign a mortgage on that plantation and i should have stopped you i said but i couldnt see how things stood and i just couldnt care im sorry mr kossmeyer there isnt going to be another trial im not pleading guilty to anything youre not he shook his head you dont mean that tom i mean it dont you see i just couldnt do it it would be bad enough if i were cleared if they found me innocent even then shed never be sure that shes sure already you think shed have laid out all that dough on you if she wasnt sure after what i put her through thats not why she did it you just dont know her mr kossmeyer you know how she feels i said you heard her in court and you heard me there too and what did it all mean thats not the same thing she now you listen to me he said listen good you roughed her up when you made a break from your pas place and she said things she didnt mean then i roughed her up and she said a lot more i made her say it so what it wasnt because of what she thought youd done but the way she felt and id lay you twenty to one that she feels pretty damned sorry about it shes tried to show you she was and youre too goddamned stupid to see it you wont meet her even a tenth of the way we cut up rough she cut up rough it was hard on her but you really got the dirty end of the stick youre the one who had to stand trial and serve time she helped put you here and she knows youre not guilty and now she she doesnt know it no one knows it you lay shes practically married to you for more than a year and she doesnt know that she doesnt know what youre like she thinks youre guilty but she doesnt throw a special prosecutor in against me she doesnt fight a new trial she pays my bill i hesitated but i knew what she was like and i knew what he was like i knew he could talk a cat into barking if he took the notion well he said how about it you stupid jerk im sorry i said im sure sorry mr kossmeyer after all the work youve done but but what what the hells there to but about youd better be thinking about but kid twenty years is a hell of a long time to go without im sorry i just cant do it i said tom my god boy and im not going to be here twenty years i said maybe thats partly why i cant do what you want because i know im going to get out anyway im going to be out before the end of this year uhuh he jerked his head toward the window out there in the boneyard you mean under it thats where youll wind up they never break out of this place thats not what i mean i said i dont think itll be that way how then if you dont break out or get out on a new trial i dont know but i know i will i couldnt tell him why i was sure about the picture i had in my mind of facing pa with the axe because he might have thought it was crazy but hed have made it his business to see that nothing of the kind happened he told me about the thirtyday jail sentence hed served kidding trying to cheer me up and it was funny as heck most of it all but the part about his last night there i couldnt get much of a laugh out of that screwy kid i thought id seen some prize goofballs but this guy took the cake theyd picked him up early that evening saturday it was for being drunk put him in the cell next to mine and he went right to sleep by sundown he was as sober as i am now get that tom he was dead sober he knew what he was doing when well i was going to tell you it looked like about half of the indians in the county had got hold of a bottle and the turnkey kept bringing em in until there aint an empty cell left and then he starts doubling and tripling them up jamming them into the cells together until theyve hardly got standing room well so finally he herds in a fresh batch and stops in front of this cell next to mine the one the sober indians in and he tells him to clear out okay abe he says hit the street youre okay now and your pals dont want you around abe starts jabbering at the other indians and they act like he aint there the turnkey tells him to beat it again he keeps on telling him and abe keeps on jabbering and these indians keep on playing nosee nohear finally the turnkey has to call a couple deputy sheriffs and it takes all three of em to toss abe out of jail out of it see its the damnedest thing i ever heard of can you imagine a guy being so hard up for company that hed stay in jail to get it well i hesitated yes i can imagine that yeah well maybe he shrugged and looked at his watch well think over that new trial tom youll see that im right ive already thought it over i said think some more drop me a line at the end of the week just write okay on a piece of paper and shoot it to me here ill write it for you he whipped out a note book reached for his fountain pen and looked at me then he sighed and put the book back into his pocket well he said i think youre making an awful mistake but i cant help it i cant do the other yeah well he stared down at the floor frowning scraping a foot against a crack in the tiles he stood that way a long time like he was thinking up another argument and i began to get a little uneasy i knew that it couldnt be that way that i couldnt plead guilty but when i thought about being out there walking around free well when i thought about that i couldnt think much about anything else just getting out seemed to be enough and i knew that it wasnt yknow he looked up at me at last i should have my head examined maybe but ive just got a hunch i think youll do it you dont i said but thanks anyway would i lie to you youre the only guy that has hunches he took another quick glance at his watch ill be eating christmas dinner with you kid well get her to make a pie out of that goddam pumpkin the three of usll eat together well do it get me i get you i said now i gotta run so take it easy and stop acting like a horses ass and and and he was gone i went back to my cot and lay down hed been so convincing that for a while i believed that he meant what hed said i could close my eyes and see us eating dinner together with him joking and cutting up and donna leaning back and laughing then turning and smiling at me i i could see it for a little while then it faded away and somehow it was worse than if id never seen it in my mind there was nothing left but this and i began to wonder if i was wrong i began to wonder if there would ever be anything but this and gradually as the days passed i began to see that there couldnt be anything else id get out all right i was sure of that and i knew it wouldnt be too long because i was going to see pa there at the house and theyd be foreclosing on him in a few months id be out but staying out was another matter because i wouldnt have that axe in my hands to chop wood everyone would know whod done it and even if they didnt know even if i could figure out some way of getting away with it id know i couldnt have anything to do with donna i wouldnt let myself so so it wouldnt matter much whether i was here or not less than it mattered now i wasnt a murderer now and it looked like i would be id be back a man has to be someplace and this would be where i belonged id be here as long as i lived i tried to talk myself into the notion that one part of the picture could come true and the other not i tried to think of some way i could be out be there in the doorway of the house without using the axe and i couldnt talk myself into it i couldnt think of any the axe was there i couldnt get rid of it and i wasnt going to be chopping any wood in the kitchen once a couple of weeks after he left i almost wrote kossmeyer i almost told him to go ahead with the trial then i thought it over and i saw that that wouldnt really change things at all no matter how i got out id still be out id still be there in the doorway with the axe in my hands nothing could change that i knew it as surely as i knew that i was going to leave here before the end of my first year and i did leave before the end of it id entered sandstone in january i left in september but im getting a little ahead of myself i was in the hospital ten weeks like ive said and i still didnt have much strength then i couldnt do anything in the way of real heavy work but i wasnt actually sick and you didnt stay in the hospital unless you were so they worked out a kind of compromise they had a few cells on the hospital floor that theyd used for psychopathic cases but they didnt try to handle people like that any more just shipped em to the insane asylum so they put me in one of those cells the doctor looked in on me now and then mostly then i did a little leathercarving by way of work whenever they thought to furnish me with the leather all in all it wasnt too bad i was a lot better off than most of the prisoners the window was way up near the ceiling and the door was solid instead of being barred there was just a little porthole but there wasnt anything to see out the window but sandstone and there sure wasnt anything in the hospital i cared about seeing after i got used to it it suited me pretty well if i hadnt had that axe in my mind if id just been going free and there hadnt been any axe september came and one morning one forendon rather it was a couple of hours after breakfast there was a rattle at the lock and the door swung open it was the warden and the doctor they looked at me sort of strained but smiling like you might look at the town bum whos suddenly struck it rich well carver the warden said ive got some news for you good news have you i said the best in the world and let me say im mighty proud and happy for you why i was just telling the doctor here that i always felt you he hesitated the eyes in the big hard red face wavering away from mine well here let you read about it for yourself he handed me a newspaper one of the oklahoma city dailies the story was spread across the front page under a threepicture panel of me matthew ontime and abe toolate a partblood creek indian abe toolate confessed last night to the stabbing murder of wealthy plantation owner matthew ontime also of indian descent for which another man was tried and convicted the innocent man yearold thomas carver has been in sandstone state reformatory since january of this year according to peace officers of burdock county where the sensational crime took place last november toolate had been acting peculiarly for several months late yesterday afternoon they said he came to the sheriffs office and made a detailed confession to the murder a former school custodian and town neerdowell he declared that he had killed mr ontime in a moment of panic when the latter surprised him in the attempted theft of a pig from the plantation pens the murder weapon was a knife which he had stolen from carver a high school senior during his custodial employment attaches of the governors office revealed that immediate steps were being taken to free carver they pointed out that while the formality of a pardon would take several days it was within the governors power to i looked up the warden was grinning his hand thrust out i laid the newspaper in it all right i said how soon can i leave why uh his grin faded why right away but i thought we might have a little talk first id like to see you leave here with the right perspective i uh im afraid you dont understand that when the courts sentence a man to this institution we have no uh discretion we can only accord him the treatment which uh i understand i said dont worry warden worry well now im not going to talk i said it wouldnt do any good this place is like it is for just one reason because the people dont give a damn if they did theyd change it his face flamed red he whirled on the doctor get him out of here by god if i find him here an hour from now someones going to get him out of here they got me out within an hour in stiff hardtoed shoes and a baggy black suit with fifty dollars in my pocket ten from the state the rest i dont know whod left that on deposit for me kossmeyer or mr redbird or miss trumbull id never spent any money because id never had any canteen privileges i stood outside the high sandstone wall not moving for a minute or two somehow afraid to move then i began to feel the heat and i slung my coat over my arm and headed down the road toward town it was a fivemile walk and id just missed a bus when i got there i went into a restaurant and ordered pie and coffee the waitress slammed it down in front of me staring coldeyed at my suit she turned away again started to pick up the newspaper shed laid on the backbar then she paused and looked back at me the gum in her jaws moved excitedly why say youre that she took a quick glance at the paper youre that carver fellow thats right i said gosh i was just readin about you ill bet youre sure glad to get out aint cha i nodded you gonna sue the state i betcha theyd have to pay you you wasnt in very long o course but i guess not i said like you say i wasnt in very long she drew back a little looking down at the sloppedover coffee yknow well you know how it is seems like they all come in here and they all look alike yes i said they all look alike i was waiting outside when the bus came in the driver sized me up as i climbed on and jerked his thumb over his shoulder in the back bud i sat down on the long back seat i saw the waitress standing at the restaurant window tapping on the glass and holding up the newspaper the driver swung down to the walk and looked at it he got back on the bus and came back to where i was sorry bu mr carver how about comin up front riding gets pretty rough over these wheels i shook my head he started to reach for my elbow aw come on sit up there aside of me glad to have you i think i like it better here i said and i leaned back and closed my eyes a moment later the bus started with a jerk i kept my eyes closed most of the way to chickasha just opening them now and then letting them get used to the sunlight gradually i got off the bus at chickasha and bought myself some other shoes and a khaki shirt and pants i left the prison clothes in the store and caught another bus i got into oklahoma city around five i could have got another bus out right away but i checked the schedules and saw that it would put me into burdock city around midnight that was too early id be almost sure to run into someone who knew me if i got in at that time so i had supper walked around town a little while then caught a bus it would get me into burdock city a little after two in the morning there shouldnt be anyone up and around then and by the time i walked out to the place well i wouldnt have long to wait the sun was practically set by now and the evening was cool i sat next to the bus window looking out watching the fields rush by id always liked the fall of the year better even than the spring i know it seems like a dead season to some people with the green things gone or going and the land hard and tiredlooking and the birds kind of quiet and softsinging but its never seemed that way to me at all me well ive never really felt that the green is gone its there right in the fields it came out of and itll be right there when spring comes again all rested and shined up prettier than ever the land now well ill tell you how i feel about that its done a good job as good as it was able to anyway and its got a right to look tired itd be pretty upsetting if it looked any other way yes and the hardness is all right too its been through something pretty hard and some of that hardness was bound to rub off and sometimes a frown sets a lot better with you than a smile something thats taken a beating you dont want to see it laugh and just because its stopped laughing doesnt mean itll never laugh again the birds well i reckon singing never sounds so good none of the good things seem so good as when youve been without em a while and good things become bad mighty quick when you have too much of em you start taking them for granted and then they begin getting on your nerves and the first thing you know youre all out of temper all ready to strike out and snap back at the very things you loved youre well i dont know maybe you feel a little guilty like youre getting more than youre entitled to and a man may think thats all to the good but it never is hes never really content probably because down in his heart he knows theres no bargains in life sooner or later you pay for everything you get i i like the fall i watched the fields rush by the cotton they were all through picking in some places the corn and the cane i wondered if pa had put in a crop on our ten acres and i figured he probably would have it would give him a nice little stake to move on with when the mortgage fell due and but he wasnt going to need any stake he wouldnt be moving on it got dark the bus lights came on and i couldnt see the fields any more just the towns we went through and the lights of the houses sitting back from the road i tried to sleep but i didnt seem to be able to keep my eyes closed they kept coming open there wasnt much to see any more but i went on looking anyway i kind of felt like there might be something and id miss it if i wasnt looking there was a rest stop at muskogee and i had some more coffee and a piece of pie and of course that finished me as far as sleeping was concerned id had more coffee today real coffee than i got in a month at sandstone i felt like my eyelids were pushed back inside my head it was a couple of hours from muskogee to burdock city but when we got there i was more wide awake than ever i got off the only passenger that did i headed down the side streets until i reached the edge of town and then i took to the fields i didnt need to i guess because if i hadnt been seen in town and i hadnt i sure wasnt likely to run into anyone out here but i wanted to walk through them i wanted to feel them under my feet be close to the growing rather the grown things it was too dark to see anything but i didnt need to see you couldnt have lost me out here i knew my way where there was a gully or ditch or a fence i walked down the furrows brushing against the dewwet plants moving from field to field and i didnt have a bit of trouble i began to walk slower i was almost there this was part of our his workings it hadnt been picked yet the cotton here i reached down brushing my hand along the plants feeling their thickness i picked myself a couple of bolls and pulled the cotton through my fingers it seemed to be a pretty good stand should make all of two bales to the acre if it was picked at the right price and if something didnt happen to the market i let the bolls drop from my fingers this wasnt ours his it was some of the land wed used to work for ontime part of the sharecrop forty our ten acres lay next to this i pushed down the top wire of the fence straddled it and stepped over i took a few steps forward quite a few before i stopped because i just couldnt believe it was like this that this was johnson grass coming almost up to my waist and that those were sunflowers striking me in the face i stopped dead in my tracks angry bewildered not knowing quite what to think it just didnt make sense any way you looked at it a kid could work ten acres if he had to and if he pa hadnt wanted to work it he could have shared it over to someone else he could have done something with it he hadnt needed to let it go like this you just couldnt do like this you let johnson grass and sunflowers get a start like they had here and youd have to fight em for years to come and theyd spread youd make it hard on everyone around you maybe the land wasnt yours any more maybe you werent going to get any more out of it but that wasnt any excuse you just didnt do this if if you were even a tenth of a man if you gave a damn about anything it was like burningoff on a windy day it was like well standing outside a privy and dirtying your clothes i pushed on through the field and came to the fence i stepped over it and into the yard and it was the same way there the same as the field hed i stopped thinking about it i found the door of the woodshed and went inside the whetstone was over the doorsill where it always was and the axe like always was stuck in the chopping block i jerked it free and sat down on the block running my hand over the rusted blade i clamped it between my knees knocked the dust from the stone and began to whet it id done it in the picture i had to do it now i moved the stone back and forth across the blade stopping now and then to test the edge with my thumb i turned it again and again whetting it razor sharp until it had a sweet ring to it when i tapped it with my nails it was getting daylight now and the blade glistened like silver but there was still time i still had plenty of time so i went to work on the head i rubbed it with the stone polishing away the grit and rust and it began to shine like the blade i worked on and on the light going brighter and brighter on the blade and finally there wasnt any more to do there wasnt a speck of rust or grit left it was shiny as a mirror i could have seen myself in it if id wanted to there was nothing more to do to it only with it i took it by the handle and went to the door id had a pretty good idea of how it would look out there but seeing it was something else weeds sunflowers johnson grass filling the yard growing right up to the porch and pushing up under it through the planks and the house itself sagging at one end where one of the foundation rocks had crumbled the house sunburned of its whitewash windows dirty one of them broken and stuffed with rags this wasnt the yard i remembered this wasnt the house this had never been any part of me i waited listening in the morning stillness faintly i heard a door creak and after a minute or two the rattle of dishes they were up someone was up i looked down at the axe twirled it slowly watching it glisten in the sun i pushed through the weeds and the grass and the sunflowers and stepped up on the porch i moved over to the door and stopped looking in at him hello pa i said he was sitting at the table eating or just starting to eat his head bent over a bowl of something dry and powdery he looked up slowly raising a spoonful of the stuff at the same time and some of it moved with his breathing puffed away from the spoon and i saw that it was cornmeal dry uncooked pa i said he hesitated then he let his head come all the way up until he was looking straight at me and his eyes and mouth were like holes in the bottom of a dirty nest in the gray matted stubble of his beard no sir he looked at me shaking his head cant fool me you aint there youre he giggled craftily youre there you prove it gon get her shes off over to them oil workers camp you get her an an you know men you together huh and i i dont know i dont know quite how to put it somehow i must have had the idea that everything would stand still that id come back and pick up at the scene id left the two of them here together unchanged taking it easy safe grunting and struggling through the nights then lying back gloating grinning and whispering about the thing theyd done to me id seen them that way in my mind a thousand times and nothing beyond that i had to collect for it for sandstone for donna for all that hed taken away from me while hed been here safe taking it easy while safe taking it i felt lost empty i should have known by the way the yard was the yard and the field and the house the rot and the decay out there and the filth and the dirt in here i should have known that nothing stands still that there is always change in one way or another upward or downward but still the picture had been there and part of it still was the one part the only part id really seen in my mind him sitting there in the kitchen me in the doorway and the sharp shiny axe in my hands and i had to use that axe for just one thing didnt i i stepped forward suddenly swinging the axe back over my shoulder i brought it down whistling through the air and he ducked and toppled backwards tumbled over in his chair to the floor so i did use it to chop wood i chopped up the top of the table whacking it into kindling and splinters and i scooped up an armful poked and jammed it into the stove and started a fire hed gotten to his feet he stood humped over giggling that crafty giggle i whirled on him swinging the axe again i let go of it and it flashed across the room smacked quivering into the wall of the house there i panted you do that next time you do it hear me cook wash chop up the furniture if you have to but do it cant fool me you aint really you know im here i said you knew i was out there this morning and all my coming back meant to you was a chance to get something to keep on taking anything to get a fire built if nothing more anything at all so long as you could get get without putting out whats the matter with you i took a step forward reaching but i wasnt going to put my hands on that youre not sick what in the name of god is the matter with you but i knew what it was because i knew he hadnt changed after all he was like hed always been just more like hed always been he wouldnt give up yet it was his one way left of getting as he saw it and it was hard to give up got to show me youre tom you go an get her bring her back here an stop it i said gotta have her an thatll prove it you go and i laughed and that stopped him youre not crazy i said you know exactly what youre doing you know what youve done you were never thinking sharper in your life and all you can do with that thinking is this what do you want it for what does it get you look around you take a look at yourself and tell me this means something to you weeds filth the house falling apart and you sitting here like a like a toad in a trash pile sinking deeper and deeper and doing nothing waiting for someone to tom its been mighty hard here without here i said it was hard here you tell me it was hard here but you wanted to go on didnt you there wasnt nothin to go on for but you went on i shook my head that wasnt the same thing i couldnt help being in sandstone the way i lived there i hadnt had any choice like he but couldnt i have helped being there couldnt i have helped the things that helped to put me there couldnt i have helped the way i lived there doing nothing for myself but making them keep me alive and did he have a choice had he had one being what he was all right i said maybe maybe not i dont care i dont care what you do or dont do i didnt come here because i i suddenly i knew why id come and i knew it was ten times worse than the other not the clean sharp blow of the axe to finish everything in a second but to do what id done chop wood and build a fire and anything else that needed doing like this that i was doing now trying to find a reason an excuse to stay to watch him die rot gradually little by little while i tried to fight off the rot because id always done that and i hadnt really changed any more than he had i wished hed say something do something anything that would break the link between us let me turn my back and walk out of here let him live as he had to let me live as i wanted to while i still had a choice tom the crafty glitter was back in his eyes i know why you came yes i said ill bet you do you knew me didnt you you knew your ol pad hide you out but ill tell you somethin you dont need to hide out i know who done it tom hide out i frowned i dont oh i said uhhuh i dont get around no more just dont seem no sense in it somehow but i hear a thing or two an i know who done it he knew he and the whole state of oklahoma but he wouldnt see that he wouldnt think or hear beyond the point of what it meant to him what he could get out of it you want to know who it was tom you dont want em to catch you an take you back to sandstone i reckon you sure dont want that do you who was it i said huhuh he shook his head grinning not so fast you write out a little note to that injun girl tell her you got to have some money about a well whats it worth to you anyways whatll you give me to tell you i sighed and i felt my shoulders straightening it was like a thousand pounds had been lifted off my back thanks i said thanks a lot pa huh where you think youre going you go out that door an ill i dont know where im going i said or what ill do ill sic the law on you you write that injun girl or ill get work as soon as i can ill send you a little money when i can but dont ever try to see me dont ever speak to me if you do see me i walked out the doorway and his voice followed me shrieking youll see ill but he didnt follow me to the door and the shrieking stopped in a moment nothing was worth any effort there was nothing that effort would get i pushed my way through the weeds and he was a million miles behind me with every step i felt empty but i wasnt hungry tired but i didnt want to rest i plodded on through the weeds toward the road my head ached and my eyes felt tired and hot i tried to think figure out what i was going to do because i knew the one thing id wanted most would be the wrong thing now kossmeyers hunch might be right but you cant run a life on hunches she might be willing to start giving again giving where nothing could be given in return but you cant run a life on giving it wouldnt be a good life for either of us i could wait a man does what he has to and i had to wait perhaps we would have christmas dinner together if not this christmas the next if not that the next the when of it wasnt important but the how and what happened afterwards afterwards building something that would last instead of something that the first strong wind would blow away one thing was certain when we had that dinner id have earned it it might not be anything more than sowbelly and beans but id be doing the giving now there was work to do thinking real thinking not wishing so much so many things that it was hard to judge where to begin the past was all mixed up with the future and i had to sort it out and smooth it out patch up the backtrail while i got to work on the new one and i didnt know where to begin and i had to begin somewhere fast i had to do something i felt achy and empty and kind of scared i walked with my head down seeing nothing but the weeds in front of me my feet moving one in front of the other and then they slowed up all by themselves it seemed like they stopped by themselves like they knew a lot better what to do than i did i turned and looked back i walked back there was a birds nest built on the trestle of the wellpull i reached up and lifted it down gently sos not to shake the three speckled eggs birds couldnt hurt the well water of course not for a man who couldnt taste any more not really taste who couldnt smell or feel or but they might be hurt they might get too smart and sassy for their feathers the younguns and they wouldnt get another chance at life if they went down into the pit theyd stay down i walked back toward the road stepping easy looking around for a safe fence post or tree crotch i could put the nest in and somehow my own problems kind of slid away from me somehow this was my problem saving something that might be lost without my help and there wasnt anything more important i reached the road the grin id started to grin without knowing it froze on my mouth the weeds had hidden the road so i dont know how long the car had been there i dont know how long shed been waiting and there was nothing in her expression to tell me why she had come or why she had waited to tell me off maybe or maybe to do the opposite tell me everything was all right probably she didnt know why herself shed simply come here because she had to as id had to and shed been as mixed up as i was about the next step she came forward slowly neither smiling nor frowning her eyes fastened on mine waiting i guess for me to lead off say something and there was nothing i could say not now so soon all i could think of was to turn and run she kept on coming and i began to tremble in another second i knew id be running save something hell how could a man save sontething when he couldnt save himself there was a great silence and out of it came only one voice yelling at me to run and keep on running forever yelling at me not to do anything not to try to rebuild because youll be disappointed tom it just isnt worth the disappointment and heartbreak theyll never forget that trial kid theyll never let you or her forget it theyll laugh at you or worse theyll pity you and youre ignorant uneducated and your health isnt good and what can you do anyway what can you rebuild with think it over tommy think of everything youve got to fight keep thinking that youll lose even if you win then go and hide bury yourself and stay buried run away from her hands went around mine steadying them on the nest and it was odd that they should steady them for hers were trembling too but thats the way it was like in algebra sort of the two minuses together had made a plus the voice stopped yelling at me to run it saw i wasnt going to i guess so it just plumb gave up it went away and stayed away leaving us there together and there was nothing we could say that wouldve been right nothing that wouldnt have been as awkward and embarrassedsounding as we felt so we didnt say anything either of us we just stood there silently in the november sunlight kind of stiff and formalish thinking out the next step getting used to each other gradually we stood looking down into the nest wondering deciding rather what to do with this new life in our hands about the author james meyers thompson was born in anadarko oklahoma in he began writing fiction at a very young
