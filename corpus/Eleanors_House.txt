 eleanors house by willa sibert cather taken from mcclures magazine volume mayoctober shall you then harriet ventured go to fortuney the girl threw a startled glance toward the corner of the garden where westfield and harold were examining a leak in the basin of the little fountain and harriet was sorry that she had put the question so directly ethels reply when it came seemed a mere emission of breath rather than articulation i think we shall go later its very trying for him there of course he hasnt been there since she relapsed into silence indeed she had never come very far out of it and harriet called to westfield she found that she couldnt help resenting ethels singular inadeptness at keeping herself in hand come robert harold is tired after his journey and he and ethel must have much to say to each other both harold and his wife however broke into hurried random remarks with an eagerness which seemed like a protest it is delightful to be near you here at arques with only a wall between our gardens ethel spurred herself to say it will mean so much to harold he has so many old associations with you mrs westfield the two men had come back to the teatable and as the younger one overheard his wifes last remark his handsome brown face took on the blankness of disapproval ethel glanced at him furtively but harriet was unable to detect whether she realized just why or to what extent her remark had been unfortunate she certainly looked as if she might not be particularly acute drooping about in her big gardenhat and her limp white frock which had not been very well put on however some sense of maladroitness certainly penetrated her vagueness for she shrank behind the teatable gathering her scarf about her shoulders as if she were mysteriously blown upon by a chilling current the westfields drew together to take their leave harold stepped to his wifes side as they went toward the gate with their guests and put his hand lightly on her shoulder at which she waveringly emerged from her eclipse and smiled harriet could not help looking back at them from under her sunshade as they stood there in the gateway the man with his tense brown face and abstracted smile the girl drooping positively swaying in her softness and uncertainty when they reached the sunny square of their own garden harriet sank into a wicker chair in the deep shadow of the stucco wall and addressed her husband with conviction i know now my dear why he wished so much to come i sensed it yesterday when i first met her but now that ive seen them together its perfectly clear he brought her here to keep her away from fortuney and hes counting on us to help him westfield who was carefully examining his rosetrees looked at his wife with interest and frank bewilderment a form of interrogation with which she was perfectly familiar if there is one thing thats plainer even than his misery harriet continued it is that she is headed toward fortuney theyve been married over two years and he couldnt i suppose keep her across the channel any longer so he has simply deflected her course and we are the pretext certainly westfield admitted as he looked up from his pruning one feels something not altogether comfortable with them but why should it be fortuney any more than a hundred other things there are opportunities enough for people who wish to play at crosspurposes ah but fortuney sighed his wife fortuneys the summing up of all his past its eleanor herself how could he robert take this poor girl there it would be cruelty the figure shed cut in a place of such distinction i should think that if he could marry her he could take her to fortuney westfield maintained bluntly oh as to his marrying her but i suppose we are all to blame for that all his and eleanors old friends we certainly failed him we fled at the poor fellows approach we simply couldnt face the extent of his bereavement he seemed a mere fragment of a man dragged out from under the wreckage they had so grown together that when she died there was nothing in him left whole we dreaded him and were glad enough to get him off to india i even hoped he would marry out there when the news came that he had i supposed that would end it that he would become merely a chapter in natural history but you see he hasnt hes more widowed than before he cant do anything well without her you see he couldnt even do this this repeated westfield quitting his gardening abruptly am i to understand that she would have been of assistance in selecting another wife for him harriet preferred to ignore that his tone implied an enormity she would certainly have kept him from getting into such a box as hes in now she could at least have found him some one who wouldnt lacerate him by her every movement oh that poor limp tactless terrified girl have you noticed the exasperating way in which she walks even its as if she were treading pain forbearing and forgiving when she but steps to the teatable there was never a person so haunted by the notion of her own untidy picturesqueness it wears her thin and consumes her like her unhappy passion i know how he feels he hates the way she likes what she likes and he hates the way she dislikes what she doesnt like and mark my words she is bent upon fortuney that at least robert he certainly cant permit at fortuney eleanor is living still the place is so intensely so rarely personal the girl has fixed her eye made up her mind its symbolic to her too and shes circling about it she cant endure to be kept out yesterday when i went to see her she couldnt wait to begin explaining her husband to me she seemed to be afraid i might think she hadnt poked into everything while his wife grew more and more vehement westfield lay back in a gardenchair half succumbing to the drowsy warmth of the afternoon it seems to me he remarked with a discreet yawn that the poor child is only putting up a good fight against the tormenting suspicion that she hasnt got into anything she may be just decently trying to conceal her uncertainty harriet looked at him intently for a moment watching the shadows of the sycamoreleaves play across his face and then laughed indulgently the idea of her decently trying to conceal anything amuses me so thats how much you know of her she sighed shes taken you in just as she took him he doubtless thought she wouldnt poke that she would go on keeping the door of the chamber breathing faint benedictions and smiling her moonbeam smile as he came and went but under all her meekness and air of poetically foregoing she has a forthcomingness and an outputtingness which all the brutality hes driven to cant discourage ive known her kind before you may clip their tendrils every day of your life only to find them renewed and sweetly taking hold the next morning shed find the crevices in polished alabaster cant you see what she wants mrs westfield sat up with flashing eyes she wants to be to him what eleanor was she sees no reason why she shouldnt be westfield rubbed the stiff blond hair above his ear in perplexity well why in heavens name shouldnt she be he married her what less can she expect oh robert cried harriet as if he had uttered something impious but then you never knew them why eleanor made him he is the work of her hands she saved him from being something terrible westfield smiled ironically was he then in his natural state so so very much worse oh he was better than he is now even then but he was somehow terribly off the key he was the most immature thing ever born into the world youth was a disease with him he almost died of it he was so absorbed in his own waking up and he so overestimated its importance he made such a clamor about it and so thrust it upon one that i used to wonder whether he would ever get past the stage of opening packages under the christmas tree and shouting i suppose he did know that his experiences were not unique but im sure he felt that the degree of them was peculiarly his when he met eleanor he lost himself and that was what he needed she happened to be born tempered and poised there never was a time when she wasnt discriminating she could enjoy all kinds of things and people but she was never never mistaken in the kind the beauty of it was that her distinctions had nothing to do with reason they were purely shades of feeling well you can conjecture what followed she gave him the one thing which made everything else he had pertinent and dignified he simply had better fiber than any of us realized and she saw it she was infallible in detecting quality two years after their marriage i spent six weeks with them at fortuney and even then i saw their possibilities what they would do for each other and they went on and on they had all there is except children i suppose they were selfish as eleanor once said to me they needed only eternity and each other but whatever it was it was olympian ii harriet was walking one morning on the green hill that rises topped by its sprawling feudal ruin behind arqueslabataille the sunlight still had the magical golden hue of early day and the dew shone on the smooth grassy folds and clefts that mark the outlines of the old fortifications below lay the delicately colored town seen through a grove of glistening white birches the shining sinuous curves of the little river and the green open stretches of the pleasant norman country as she skirted the base of one of the thick towers on the inner edge of the moat her sunshade over her shoulder and her white shoes gray with dew she all but stepped upon a man who lay in a shaded corner within the elbow of the wall and the tower his straw hat tilted over his eyes why harold forscythe she exclaimed breathlessly he sprang to his feet baring his head in the sun sit down do he urged its quite dry there the masonry crops out and the views delightful you didnt seem to be doing much with the view as i came up harriet put down her sunshade and stood looking at him taking in his careless morning dress his gray unshaven face and heavy eyes but i shall sit down she affectionately assured him to look at you since i have so few opportunities why havent you been to see me forscythe gazed attentively at her canvas shoes hesitating and thrusting out his lower lip an impetuous mannerism she had liked in him as a boy perhaps perhaps i havent quite dared he suggested which means commented harriet reproachfully that you accredit me with a very disagreeable kind of stupidity you oh dear no i didnt i dont how could you suppose it he helped her to her seat on the slant of gray rock moving about her solicitously but avoiding her eyes then why do you stand there hesitating i was just thinking he shot her a nervous glance from under a frown whether i ought not to cut away now on your account im in the devil of a way in the early morning sometimes mrs westfield looked at him compassionately as he stood poking the turf with his stick she wondered how he could have reached eightandthirty without growing at all older than he had been in his twenties and yet that was just what their happiness had done for them if it had kept them young gloriously and resplendently young it had also kept them from arriving anywhere it had prolonged his flowering time but it hadnt mellowed him growing older would have meant making concessions he had never made any had not even learned how and was still striking back like a boy harriet pointed to the turf beside her and he dropped down suddenly im really not fit to see anyone this morning these first hours he shrugged his shoulders and began to pull the grassblades swiftly one at a time are hard for you he nodded because they used to be your happiest harriet continued feeling her way its queer he said quietly but in the morning i often feel such an absurd certainty of finding her i suppose one has more vitality at this time of day a keener sense of things my poor boy is it still as hard as that did you for a moment suppose that it would ever be any easier he asked with a short laugh i hoped so oh i hoped so forscythe shook his head you know why i havent been to see you he brought out abruptly harriet touched his arm you ought not to be afraid with me if i didnt love her as much as you did at least i never loved anything else so well i know thats one reason i came here you were always together when i first knew her and its easy to see her beside you sometimes i think the image of her coming down the stairs crossing the garden holding out her hand is growing dimmer and that terrifies me some people and some places give me the feeling of her he stopped with a jerk and threw a pebble across the moat where the sloping bank softened and made shallower by the slow centuries was yellow with buttercups but that feeling harold must be more in you than anywhere theres where she wined it and breathed it and stored it for years harold was looking fixedly at the bare spot under his hand and pulling the grassblades out delicately when he spoke his voice fairly startled her with its sound of water working underground it was like that once but now i lose it sometimes for weeks together its like trying to hold some delicate scent in your nostrils and heavier odors come in and blur it my poor boy what can i say to you harriets eyes were so dim that she could only put out a hand to be sure that he was there he pressed it and held it a moment you dont have to say anything your thinking reaches me its extraordinary how we can be trained down how little we can do with if she could only have written to me if there could have been a sign a shadow on the grass or in the sky to show that she went on with me it would have been enough and now i wouldnt ask anything but to be left alone with my hurt its all thats left me its the most precious thing in the world oh but that my dear harold is too terrible she couldnt have endured your doing it murmured harriet overcome yes she could shed have done it shed have kept me alive in her anguish in her incompleteness mrs westfield put out her hand entreatingly to stop him he had lain beside her on the grass so often in the days of his courtship of his first tempestuous happiness it was incredible that he should have changed so little he hadnt grown older or wiser or in himself better he had simply grown more and more to be eleanor the misery of his entanglement touched her afresh and she put her hands to her eyes and murmured oh that poor little ethel how could you do it she heard him bound up and when she lifted her face he was half the length of the wall away she called to him but he waved his hat meaninglessly and she watched him hurry across the smooth green swell of the hill harriet leaned back into the warm angle of masonry and tried to settle into the deep peace of the place where so many follies and passions had spent themselves and ebbed back into the stillness of the grass but a sense of pain kept throbbing about her it seemed to come from the spot where poor forscythe had lain and to rise like a miasma between her and the farms and orchards and the graygreen windings of the river when at last she rose with a sigh she murmured to herself oh my poor eleanor if you know i pity you wherever you are i pity you iii the silence once broken forscythe came often to mrs westfields garden he spent whole mornings there watching her embroider or walked with her about the ruins on the hilltop or along the streams that wound through the fertile farm country though he said little himself he made it supremely easy for her to talk he followed her about in grateful silence while she told him freely and almost lightly of her girlhood with eleanor sanford of their life at a conventschool in paris of the copy of manon lescault which they kept sewed up in the little pine pillow they had brought from schenectady of the adroit machinations by which on her feteday under the guardianship of an innocent aunt from albany eleanor had managed to convey all her birthday roses out to pиrelachaise and arrange them under de mussels willow harriet even found a quiet happiness in being with him she felt that he was making amends that she could trust him not to renew the terrible experience which had crushed her at their first meeting on the hill when he spoke of eleanor at all it was only to recall the beauty of their companionship a thing she loved to reflect upon for if they had been selfish at least their selfishness had never taken the form of comfortable indolence they had kept the edge of their zest for action their affection had never grown stocky and middleaged how harriet often asked herself could two people have crowded so much into ten circumscribed mortal years and of course the best of it was that all the things they did and the places they went to and the people they knew didnt in the least matter were only the incidental music of their drama the end when it came had by the mercy of heaven come suddenly an illness of three days at fortuney their own place on the oise and it was over he was flung out into space to find his way alone to keep fighting about in his circle forever yearning toward the center one morning when harold asked her to go for a long walk into the country harriet felt from the moment they left the town behind them that he had something serious to say to her they were having their dйjeuner in the garden of a little auberge sitting at a table beside a yellow clay wall overgrown with wallpeaches when he told her that he was going away i dont know for just how long perhaps a week perhaps two id hate to have you misunderstand i dont want you to underestimate the good youve done me these last weeks but you see this is a sort of a sort of tryst he explained smiling faintly we got stranded once in an absurd little town down on the mediterranean not far from hyиres we liked it and stayed for days and when we left eleanor said wed go back every year when the grapes were ripe we never did go back for that was the last year but ive been there that same week every autumn the people there all remember her its a little bit of a place harriet looked at him holding her breath the black kitten came up and brushed against him tapping his arm with its paw and mewing to be fed is that why you go away so much ethel has told me she said there was some business but i doubted that im sorry it has to be so of course i feel despicable do all the time for that matter he wiped his face and hands miserably with his napkin and pushed back his chair you see he went on beginning to make geometrical figures in the sand with his walkingstick you see i cant settle down to anything and im so driven there are times when places pull me places where things happened you know not big things but just our own things he stopped and then added thoughtfully going to miss her is almost what going to meet her used to be i get in such a state of impatience harriet couldnt she simply couldnt altogether despise him and it was because as he said she did know they sat in the quiet sunny little garden full of dahlias and sunflowers and the hum of bees and she remembered what eleanor had told her about this fishingvillage where they had lived on figs and goats milk and watched the meager vintage being gathered how when they had to leave it got into their compartment and flashed away along the panoramic mediterranean shore she had cried she who never wept for pain or weariness harriet put in fondly it was not the blue bay and the lavender and the pine hills they were leaving but some peculiar shade of being together yet they were always leaving that every day brought colors in the sky on the sea in the heart which could not possibly come just so again that tomorrows would be just as beautiful never quite satisfied them they wanted it all yes whatever they were those two they were olympian as they were nearing home in the late afternoon forscythe turned suddenly to harriet i shall have to count on you for something while i am away you know about the business oh yes ill understand and youll do what you can for her wont you he asked shakily its such a hellish existence for her id do anything if i could undo what ive done anything harriet paused a moment it simply cant you know go on like this yes yes i know that he replied abstractedly but thats not the worst of it the worst is that sometimes i feel as if eleanor wants me to give her up that she cant stand it any longer and is begging me to let her rest harriet tried to look at him but he had turned away his face iv forscythes absence stretched beyond a fortnight and no one seemed very definitely informed as to when he might return meanwhile mrs westfield had his wife considerably upon her hands she could not indeed account for the degree to which she seemed responsible it was always there groping for her and pulling at her as she told westfield the garden wall was not high enough to shut out entirely the other side the girl pacing the gravel paths with the meek bent step which poor harriet found so exasperating her wistful eyes peering from under her gardenhat her preposterous skirts trailing behind her like the briertorn gown of some wandering griselda during the long dull hours in which they had their tea together harriet realized more and more the justice of the girls position of her claim since she apparently had no position that one could well define the reasonableness of it was all the more trying since harriet felt so compelled to deny it they read and walked and talked and the subject to which they never alluded was always in the air it was in the girls long silent entreating looks in her thin hands nervously clasping and unclasping in her ceaseless pacing about harriet distinctly felt that she was working herself up to something and she declared to westfield every morning that whatever it was she wouldnt be a party to it i can understand perfectly she insisted to her husband how he did it he married her to talk to her about eleanor eleanor had been the theme of their courtship the rest of the world went on attending to its own business and shaking him off and she stopped and sympathized and let him pour himself out he didnt see i suppose why he shouldnt have just a wife like other men for it didnt occur to him that he couldnt be just a husband he thought shed be content to console he never dreamed shed try to heal as for ethel harriet had to admit that she too could be perfectly accounted for she had gone into it doubtless in the spirit of selfsacrifice a mood she was romantically fond of permitting herself and humanly unable to live up to she had married him in one stage of feeling and had inevitably arrived at another had come indeed to the place where she must be just one thing to him what she was or was not hung on the throw of the dice in a way that savored of trembling captives and barbarous manners and harriet had to acknowledge that almost anything might be expected of a woman who had let herself go to such lengths and had yet got nowhere worth mentioning she is certainly going to do something harriet declared but whatever can she hope to do now what weapon has she left how is she after shes poured herself out so ever to gather herself up again what shell do is the horror its sure to be ineffectual and its equally sure to have distinctly dramatic aspects harriet was not however quite prepared for the issue which confronted her one morning she sat down shaken and aghast when ethel pale and wraithlike glided somnambulantly into her garden and asked whether mrs westfield would accompany her to fortuney on the following day but my dear girl ought you to go there alone without harold you mean the other inaudibly suggested yes i think i ought he has such a dread of going back there and yet i feel that hell never be satisfied until he gets among his own things he would be happier if he took the shock and had done with it and my going there first might make it easier for him harriet stared dont you think he should be left to decide that for himself she reasoned mildly he may wish to forget the place in so far as he can he doesnt forget ethel replied simply he thinks about it all the time he ought to live there its his home he ought not she brought out with a fierce little burst to be kept away i dont know that he or anyone else can do much in regard to that commented harriet dryly he ought to live there ethel repeated automatically and it might make it easier for him if i went first how gasped mrs westfield it might she insisted childishly twisting her handkerchief around her fingers we can take an early train and get there in the afternoon its but a short drive from the station im sure she looked pleadingly at harriet im sure hed like it better if you went with me harriet made a clutch at herself and looked pointedly at the ground i really dont see how i could ethel it doesnt seem to me a proper thing to do ethel sat straight and still her liquid eyes brimmed over and the tears rolled mildly down her cheeks im sorry it seems wrong to you of course you cant go if it does i shall go alone then tomorrow she rose and stood poised in uncertainty her hand on the back of the chair harriet moved quickly toward her the girls infatuate obstinacy carried a power with it but why dear child do you wish me to go with you what good could that possibly do there was a long silence trembling and gentle tears at last ethel murmured i thought because you were her friend that would make it better if you were with me it couldnt seem quite so indelicate her shoulders shook with a sudden wrench of feeling and she pressed her hands over her face you see she faltered im so at a loss i havent anyone harriet put an arm firmly about her drooping slenderness well for this venture at least you shall have me i cant see it but im willing to go more willing than i am that you should go alone i must tell robert and ask him to look up the trains for us the girl drew gently away from her and stood in an attitude of deep dejection its difficult for you too our being here we ought never to have come and i must not take advantage of you before letting you go with me i must tell you the real reason why i am going to fortuney the real reason echoed harriet yes i think hes there now harold at fortuney yes i havent heard from him for five days then it was only a telegram dated from pontoise thats very near fortuney since then i havent had a word you poor child how dreadful come here and tell me about it harriet drew her to a chair into which she sank limply theres nothing to tell except what one fears ive lost sleep until i imagine all sorts of horrible things if he has been alone there for days shut up with all those memories who knows what may have happened to him i shouldnt you know feel like this if he were with any one but this oh you are all against me you none of you understand you think i am trying to make him inconstant for the first time her voice broke into passionate scorn but theres no other way to save him its simply killing him hes been frightfully ill twice once in london and once before we left india the london doctors told me that unless he was got out of this state he might do almost anything they even wanted me to leave him so you see i must do something harriet sat down on the stool beside her and took her hand why dont you then my dear do it leave him the girl looked wildly toward the garden wall i cant not now i might have once perhaps oh with a burst of trembling dont please dont talk about it just help me to save him if you can had you rather ethel that i went to fortuney alone harriet suggested hopefully the girl shook her head no hed know i sent you and hed think i was afraid i am of course but not in the way he thinks ive never crossed him in anything but we cant go on like this any longer ill go and hell just have to choose having seen ethel safely to her own door harriet went to her husband who was at work in the library and told him to what she had committed herself westfield received the intelligence with marked discouragement he disliked her being drawn more and more into the forscythes affairs which he found very depressing and disconcerting and he flatly declared that he wanted nothing so much as to get away from all that hysteria next door and finish the summer in switzerland its an obsession with her to get to fortuney harriet explained to her it somehow means getting into everything shes out of i really cant have her thinking im against her in that definite petty sort of way so ive promised to go besides if she is going down there where all eleanors things are ah so its to keep her out and not to help her in that youre going westfield deduced i declare to you i dont know which it is im going for both of them for her and for eleanor v fortuney stood in its cluster of cool green halfway up the hillside and overlooking the green loop of the river harriet remembered as she approached it how eleanor used to say that after the south it was good to come back and rest her eyes there nowhere were skies so gray streams so clear or fields so pleasantly interspersed with woodland the hill on which the house stood overlooked an island where the haymakers were busy cutting a second crop swinging their bright scythes in the long grass and stopping to hail the heavy lumberbarges as they passed slowly up the glassy river ethel insisted upon leaving the carriage by the roadside so the two women alighted and walked up the long driveway that wound under the lindentrees an old man who was clipping the hedge looked curiously at them as they passed except for the snipping of his big shears and occasional halloos from the island a pale sunny quiet lay over the place and their approach harriet reflected certainly savored all too much of a reluctance to break it she looked at ethel with all the exasperation of fatigue and felt that there was something positively stealthy about her soft driven tread the front door was open but as they approached a bent old woman ran out from the garden behind the house her apron full of gourds calling to them as she ran ethel addressed her without embarrassment i am madame forscythe monsieur is awaiting me yes i know that he is ill you need not announce me the old woman tried to detain her by salutations and questions tried to explain that she would immediately get rooms ready for madame and her friend why had she not been told but ethel brushed past her seeming to float over the threshold and up the staircase while harriet followed her protesting they went through the salon the library into harolds study straight toward the room which had been eleanors let us wait for him here in his study please ethel harriet whispered weve no right to steal upon anyone like this but ethel seemed drawn like the victim of mesmerism the door opening from the study into eleanors room was hung with a heavy curtain she lifted it and there they paused noiselessly it was just as harriet remembered it the tapestries the priedieu the louisseize furniture absolutely unchanged except that her own portrait by constant hung where harolds used to be across the foot of the bed in a tennisshirt and trousers lay harold himself asleep he was lying on his side his face turned toward the door and one arm thrown over his head the habit of being on his guard must have sharpened his senses for as they looked at him he awoke and sprang up flushed and disordered ethel what on earth he cried hotly she was frightened enough now she trembled from head to foot and pressed her hands tightly over her breast you never told me not to come she panted you only said with a wild burst of reproach that you couldnt harold gripped the foot of the bed with both hands and his voice shook with anger please go downstairs and wait in the receptionroom while i ask mrs westfield to enlighten me something leaped into ethels eyes as she took another step forward into the room and let the curtain fall behind her i wont go harold until you go with me she cried drawing up her frail shoulders she glanced desperately about her at the room at her husband at harriet and finally at her the handsome disdainful face which glowed out of the canvas you have no right to come here secretly she broke out its shameful to her as well as to me im not afraid of her she couldnt but loathe you for what you do to me she couldnt have been so contemptible as you all make her so jealous forscythe swung round on his heel his clenched hands banging at his side and throwing back his head faced the picture jealous of whom my god harold cried mrs westfield entreatingly but she was too late the girl had slipped to the floor as if she had been cut down vi one rainy night four weeks after her visit to fortuney forscythe stood at mrs westfields door his hat in his hand bidding her good night harriet looked worn and troubled but forscythe himself was calm im so glad you gave me a chance at fortuney harold i couldnt bear to see it go to strangers ill keep it just as it is as it was you may be sure of that and if ever you wish to come back forscythe spoke up quickly i dont think i shall be coming back again mrs westfield and please dont hesitate to make any changes as ive tried to tell you i dont feel the need of it any longer she has come back to me as much as she ever can in another person harold smiled a little and shook his head in another way she lived and died dear harriet and im all there is to show for it thats pitiful enough but i must do what i can i shall die very far short of the mark but she was always generous he held out his hand to mrs westfield and took hers resolutely though she hesitated as if to detain him tell ethel i shall go over to see her in the morning before you leave and thank her for her message harriet murmured please come she has been seeing to the packing in spite of me and is quite worn out shell be herself again once i get her back to surrey and shes very keen about going to america good night dear lady he called after him as he crossed the veranda harriet heard him splash down the gravel walk to the gate and then closed the door she went slowly through the hall and into her husbands study where she sat quietly down by the wood fire westfield rose from his work and looked at her with concern why didnt you send that madman home long ago harriet its past midnight and youre completely done out you look like a ghost he opened a cabinet and poured her a glass of wine i feel like one dear im beginning to feel my age ive no spirit to hold it off any longer im going to buy fortuney and give up to it it will be pleasant to grow old there in that atmosphere of lovely things past and forgotten westfield sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her head to him he is really going to sell it then he has come round sure enough hasnt he oh he melts the heart in me robert he makes me feel so old and lonely that he and i are left over from another age a lovely time thats gone hes giving up everything hes going to take her home to america after her child is born her child yes he didnt know until after that dreadful day at fortuney she had never told anyone he says hes so glad that it will make up to her for everything oh robert if only eleanor had left him children all this wouldnt have been do you think westfield asked after a long silence that he is glad i know it hes been so gentle and comprehending with her harriet stopped to dry the tears on her cheek and put her head down on her husbands shoulder and oh robert i never would have believed that he could be so splendid about it its as if he had come up to his possibilities for the first time through this silly infatuated girl while eleanor who gave him kingdoms she cried softly on his shoulder for a long while and then he felt that she was thinking when at last she looked up she smiled gratefully into his eyes well well have fortuney dearest well have all thats left of them hell never turn back i feel such a strength in him now hell go on doing it and being finer and finer and do you know robert her lips trembled again but she still smiled from her misty eyes if eleanor knows i believe shell be glad for oh my eleanor she loved him beyond anything beyond even his love
