 roald dahls revolting rhymes cinderella i guess you think you know this story you dont the real ones much more gory the phoney one the one you know was cooked up years and years ago and made to sound all soft and sappy just to keep the children happy mind you they got the first bit right the bit where in the dead of night the ugly sisters jewels and all departed for the palace ball while darling little cinderella was locked up in a slimy cellar where rats who wanted things to eat began to nibble at her feet she bellowed help and let me out the magic fairy heard her shout appearing in a blaze of light she said my dear are you all right all right cried cindy cant you see i feel as rotten as can be she beat her fist against the wall and shouted get me to the ball there is a disco at the palace the rest have gone and i am jalous i want a dress i want a coach and earrings and a diamond brooch and silver slippers two of those and lovely nylon pantyhose done up like that ill guarantee the handsome prince will fall for me the fairy said hang on a tick she gave her wand a mighty flick and quickly in no time at all cindy was at the palace ball it made the ugly sisters wince to see her dancing with the prince she held him very tight and pressed herself against his manly chest the prince himself was turned to pulp all he could do was gasp and gulp then midnight struck she shouted heck ive got to run to save my neck the prince cried no alas alack he grabbed her dress to hold her back as cindy shouted let me go the dress was ripped from head to toe she ran out in her underwear and lost one slipper on the stair the prince was on it like a dart he pressed it to his pounding heart the girl this slipper fits he cried tomorrow morn shall be my bride ill visit every house in town until ive tracked the maiden down then rather carelessly i fear he placed it on a crate of beer at once one of the ugly sisters sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe and quickly flushed it down the loo then in its place she calmly put the slipper from her own left foot ahha you see the plot grows thicker and cindys luck starts looking sicker next day the prince went charging down to knock on all the doors in town in every house the tension grew who was the owner of the shoe the shoe was long and very wide also it smelled a wee bit icky thousands of eager people came to try it on but all in vain now came the ugly sisters go one tried it on the prince screamed no but she screamed yes it fits whoopee so now youve got to marry me the prince went white from ear to ear he muttered let me out of here oh no you dont you made a vow theres no way you can back out now off with her head the prince roared back they chopped it off with one big whack this pleased the prince he smiled and said shes prettier without her head then up came sister number two who yelled now i will try the shoe try this instead the prince yelled back he swung his trusty sword and smack her head went crashing to the ground it bounced a bit and rolled around in the kitchen peeling spuds cinderella heard the thuds of bouncing heads upon the floor and poked her own head round the door whats all the racket cindy cried mind your own bizz the prince replied poor cindys heart was torn to shreds my prince she thought he chops off heads how could i marry anyone who does that sort of thing for fun the prince cried whos this dirty slut off with her nut off with her nut just then all in a blaze of light the magic fairy hove in sight her magic wand went swoosh and swish cindy she cried come make a wish wish anything and have no doubt that i will make it come about cindy answered oh kind fairy this time i shall be more wary no more princes no more money i have had my taste of honey im wishing for a decent man theyre hard to find dyou think you can within a minute cinderella was married to a lovely feller a simple jammaker by trade who sold good homemade marmalade their house was filled with smiles and laughter and they were happy ever after jack and the beanstalk jacks mother said were stony broke go out and find some wealthy bloke wholl buy our cow just say shes sound and worth at least a hundred pound but dont you dare to let him know that shes as old as billyo jack led the old brown cow away and came back later in the day and said oh mumsie dear guess what your clever little boy has got i got i really dont know how a super tradein for our cow the mother said you little creep ill bet you sold her much too cheap when jack produced one lousy bean his startled mother turning green leaped high up in the air and cried im absolutely stupefied you crazy boy dyou really mean you sold our daisy for a bean she snatched the bean she yelled you chump and flung it on the rubbishdump then summoning up all her power she beat the boy for half an hour using the handle of a vacuumcleaner at ten pm or thereabout the little bean began to sprout by morning it had grown so tall you couldnt see the top at all young jack cried mum admit it now its better than a rotten cow the mother said you lunatic where are the beans that i can pick theres not one bean its bare as bare no no cried jack you look up there look very high and youll behold each single leaf is solid gold by gollikins the boy was right now glistening in the morning light the mother actually perceives a mass of lovely golden leaves she yells out loud my sainted souls ill sell the mini buy a rolls dont stand and gape you little clot get up there quick and grab the lot jack was nimble jack was keen he scrambled up the mighty bean up up he went without a stop but just as he was near the top a ghastly frightening thing occurred not far above his head he heard a big deep voice a rumbling thing that made the very heavens ring it shouted loud fee fl fo fum i smell the blood of an englishman jack was frightened jack was quick and down he climbed in half a tick oh mum he gasped believe you me theres something nasty up our tree i saw him mum my gizzard froze a giant with a clever nose a clever nose his mother hissed you must be going round the twist he smelled me out i swear it mum he said he smelled an englishman the mother said and well he might ive told you every single night to take a bath because you smell but would you do it would you hell you even make your mother shrink because of your unholy stink jack answered well if youre so clean why dont you climb the crazy bean the mother cried by gad i will theres life within the old dog still she hitched her skirts above her knee and disappeared right up the tree now would the giant smell his mum jack listened for the feefofum he gazed aloft he wondered when the dreaded words would come and then from somewhere high above the ground there came a frightful crunching sound he heard the giant mutter twice by gosh that tasted very nice although i wish there werent so many bones by christopher jack cried by gum the giants eaten up my mum he smelled her out shes in his belly i had a hunch that she was smelly jack stood there gazing longingly upon the huge and golden tree he murmured softly gollygosh i guess ill have to take a wash if i am going to climb this tree without the giant smelling me in fact a baths my only hope he rushed indoors and grabbed the soap he scrubbed his body everywhere he even washed and rinsed his hair he did his teeth he blew his nose and went out smelling like a rose once more he climbed the mighty bean the giant sat there gross obscene muttering through his vicious teeth muttering loud fee fi fo fum right now i cant smell anyone jack waited till the giant slept then out along the boughs he crept and gathered so much gold i swear he was an instant millionaire a bath he said does seem to pay im going to have one every day snowwhite and the seven dwarfs when little snowwhites mother died the king her father up and cried oh what a nuisance what a life now i must find another wife its never easy for a king to find himself that sort of thing he wrote to every magazine and said im looking for a queen at least ten thousand girls replied and begged to be the royal bride the king said with a shifty smile id like to give each one a trial however in the end he chose a lady called miss maclahose who brought along a curious toy that seemed to give her endless joy this was a mirror framed in brass a magic talking lookingglass ask it something day or night it always got the answer right for instance if you were to say oh mirror whats for lunch today the thing would answer in a trice today its scrambled eggs and rice now every day week in week out the spoiled and stupid queen would shout oh mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all the mirror answered every time oh madam youre the queen sublime you are the only one to charm us queen you are the cats pyjamas for ten whole years the silly queen repeated this absurd routine then suddenly one awful day she heard the magic mirror say from now on queen youre number two snowwhite is prettier than you the queen went absolutely wild she yelled im going to scrag that child ill cook her flaming goose ill skin er ill have her rotten guts for dinner she called the huntsman to her study she shouted at him listen buddy you drag that filthy girl outside and see you take her for a ride thereafter slit her ribs apart and bring me back her bleeding heart the huntsman dragged the lovely child deep deep into the forest wild fearing the worst poor snowwhite spake she cried oh please give me a break the knife was poised the arm was strong she cried again ive done no wrong the huntsmans heart began to flutter it melted like a pound of butter he murmured okay beat it kid and you can bet your life she did later the huntsman made a stop within the local butchers shop and there he bought for safetys sake a bullocks heart and one nice steak oh majesty oh queen he cried that rotten little girl has died and just to prove i didnt cheat ive brought along these bits of meat the queen cried out bravissimo i trust you killed her nice and slow then the queen sat down and ate the heart i only hope she cooked it well boiled heart can be as tough as hell while all of this was going on oh where oh where had snowwhite gone shed found it easy being pretty to hitch a ride in to the city and there shed got a job unpaid as general cook and parlourmaid with seven funny little men each one not more than three foot ten ex horserace jockeys all of them these seven dwarfs though awfully nice were guilty of one shocking vice they squandered all of their resources at the racetrack backing horses when they hadnt backed a winner none of them got any dinner one evening snowwhite said look here i think ive got a great idea just leave it all to me okay and no more gambling till i say that very night at eventide young snowwhite hitched another ride and then when it was very late she slipped in through the palace gate the king was in his counting house counting out his money the queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey the footmen and the servants slept so no one saw her as she crept on tiptoe through the mighty hall and grabbed the mirror off the wall as soon as she had got it home she told the senior dwarf to ask it what he wished to know go on she shouted have a go he said oh mirror please dont joke each one of us is stony broke which horse will win tomorrows race the ascot gold cup steeplechase the mirror whispered sweet and low the horses name is mistletoe the dwarfs went absolutely daft they kissed young snowwhite fore and aft then rushed away to raise some dough with which to back old mistletoe they pawned their watches sold the car they borrowed money near and far for much of it they had to thank the manager of barclays bank they went to ascot and of course for once they backed the winning horse thereafter every single day the mirror made the bookies pay each dwarf and snowwhite got a share and each was soon a millionaire which shows that gamblings not a sin provided that you always win goldilocks and the three bears this famous wicked little tale should never have been put on sale it is a mystery to me why loving parents cannot see that this is actually a book about a brazen little crook had i the chance i wouldnt fail to clap young goldilocks in jail now just imagine how youd feel if you had cooked a lovely meal delicious porridge steaming hot fresh coffee in the coffeepot with maybe toast and marmalade the table beautifully laid one place for you and one for dad another for your little lad then dad cries gollygosh geewhizz oh cripes how hot this porridge is lets take a walk along the street until its cool enough to eat he adds an early morning stroll is good for people on the whole it makes your appetite improve it also helps your bowels to move no proper wife would dare to question such a sensible suggestion above all not at breakfasttime when men are seldom at their prime no sooner are you down the road than goldilocks that little toad that nosey thieving little louse comes sneaking in your empty house she looks around she quickly notes three bowls brimful of porridge oats and while still standing on her feet she grabs a spoon and starts to eat i say again how would you feel if you had made this lovely meal and some delinquent little tot broke in and gobbled up the lot but wait thats not the worst of it now comes the most distressing bit you are of course a houseproud wife and all your happy married life you have collected lovely things like gilded cherubs wearing wings and furniture by chippendale bought at some famous auction sale but your most special valued treasure the piece that gives you endless pleasure is one small childrens diningchair elizabethan very rare it is in fact your joy and pride passed down to you on grandmas side but goldilocks like many freaks does not appreciate antiques she doesnt care she doesnt mind and now she plonks her fat behind upon this dainty precious chair and crunch it busts beyond repair a nice girl would at once exclaim oh dear oh heavens what a shame not goldie she begins to swear she bellows what a lousy chair and uses one disgusting word that luckily youve never heard i dare not write it even hint it nobody would ever print it youd think by now this little skunk would have the sense to do a bunk but no i very much regret she hasnt nearly finished yet deciding she would like a rest she says lets see which bed is best upstairs she goes and tries all three most educated people choose to rid themselves of socks and shoes before they clamber into bed but goldie didnt give a shred her filthy shoes were thick with grime and mud and mush and slush and slime worse still upon the heel of one was something that a dog had done i say once more what would you think if all this horrid dirt and stink was smeared upon your eiderdown by this revolting little clown the famous story has no clues to show the girl removed her shoes oh what a tale of crime on crime lets check it for a second time crime one the prosecutions case she breaks and enters someones place crime two the prosecutor notes she steals a bowl of porridge oats crime three she breaks a precious chair belonging to the baby bear crime four she smears each spotless sheet with filthy messes from her feet a judge would say without a blink ten years hard labour in the clink but in the book as you will see the little beast gets off scotfree while tiny children near and far shout goodygood hooray hurrah poor darling goldilocks they say thank goodness that she got away myself i think id rather send young goldie to a sticky end oh daddy cried the baby bear my porridge gone it isnt fair then go upstairs the big bear said your porridge is upon the bed but as its inside mademoiselle youll have to eat her up as well little red riding hood and the wolf as soon as wolf began to feel that he would like a decent meal he went and knocked on grandmas door when grandma opened it she saw the sharp white teeth the horrid grin and wolfie said may i come in poor grandmamma was terrified hes going to eat me up she cried and she was absolutely right he ate her up in one big bite but grandmamma was small and tough and wolfie wailed thats not enough i havent yet begun to feel that i have had a decent meal he ran around the kitchen yelping ive got to have another helping then added with a frightful leer im therefore going to wait right here till little miss red riding hood comes home from walking in the wood he quickly put on grandmas clothes he dressed himself in coat and hat he put on shoes and after that he even brushed and curled his hair then sat himself in grandmas chair in came the little girl in red she stopped she stared and then she said what great big ears you have grandma all the better to hear you with the wolf replied what great big eyes you have grandma said little red riding hood all the better to see you with the wolf replied he sat there watching her and smiled he thought im going to eat this child compared with her old grandmamma shes going to taste like caviare then little red riding hood said but grandma what a lovely great big furry coat you have on thats wrong cried wolf have you forgot to tell me what big teeth ive got ah well no matter what you say im going to eat you anyway the small girl smiles one eyelid flickers she whips a pistol from her knickers she aims it at the creatures head and bang bang bang she shoots him dead a few weeks later in the wood i came across miss riding hood but what a change no cloak of red no silly hood upon her head she said hello and do please note my lovely furry wolfskin coat the three little pigs the animal i really dig above all others is the pig pigs are noble pigs are clever pigs are courteous however now and then to break this rule one meets a pig who is a fool what for example would you say if strolling through the woods one day right there in front of you you saw a pig whod built his house of straw the wolf who saw it licked his lips and said that pig has had his chips little pig little pig let me come in no no by the hairs on my chinnychinchin then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in the little pig began to pray but wolfie blew his house away he shouted bacon pork and ham oh what a lucky wolf i am and though he ate the pig quite fast he carefully kept the tail till last wolf wandered on a trifle bloated surprise surprise for soon he noted another little house for pigs and this one had been built of twigs little pig little pig let me come in no no by the hairs of my chinnychinchin then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in the wolf said okay here we go he then began to blow and blow the little pig began to squeal he cried oh wolf youve had one meal why cant we talk and make a deal the wolf replied not on your nelly and soon the pig was in his belly two juicy little pigs wolf cried but still i am not satisfied i know full well my tummys bulging but oh how i adore indulging so creeping quietly as a mouse the wolf approached another house a house which also had inside a little piggy trying to hide but this one piggy number three was bright and brainy as could be no straw for him no twigs or sticks this pig had built his house of bricks youll not get me the piggy cried ill blow you down the wolf replied youll need pig said a lot of puff and i dont think youve got enough wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew the house stayed up as good as new if i cant blow it down wolf said ill have to blow it up instead ill come back in the dead of night and blow it up with dynamite pig cried you brute i might have known then picking up the the telephone he dialled as quickly as he could the number of red riding hood hello she said whos speaking who oh hello piggy how dyou do pig cried i need your help miss hood oh help me please dyou think you could ill try of course miss hood replied whats on your mind a wolf pig cried i know youve dealt with wolves before and now ive got one at my door my darling pig she said my sweet thats something really up my street ive just begun to wash my hair but when its dry ill be right there a short while later through the wood came striding brave miss riding hood the wolf stood there his eyes ablaze and yellowish like mayonnaise his teeth were sharp his gums were raw and spit was dripping from his jaw once more the maidens eyelid flickers she draws the pistol from her knickers once more she hits the vital spot and kills him with a single shot pig peeping through the window stood and yelled well done miss riding hood ah piglet you must never trust young ladies from the upper crust for now miss riding hood one notes not only has two wolfskin coats but when she goes from place to place she has a pigskin travelling case
