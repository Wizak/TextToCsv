this is important im at the home of alex maclennan hes dead give me the address grant ill be there in twentyfive minutes jenny logan was an inspector in the edinburgh police the phone often woke her at night she got out of bed and dressed quickly in a blue suit she looked at herself in the mirror and decided that her short brown hair looked all right by a quarter past three she was driving through the streets of edinburgh it was december and there was snow on the ground princes street was empty she could see edinburgh castle high up to her left while she drove logan thought about alex maclennan the maclennans were famous in scotland murray maclennan alexs father had over sixty fish and chip shops in different scottish towns and cities everyone in scotland knew maclennans fish chips and most people ate them murray maclennan had one son alex murray did not want alex to go into the family business so he sent him to an expensive school in switzerland alex went from there to bristol university in england and then to a business school near boston in the united states learning was important for alex but so was having a good time the scottish newspapers were full of stories about his life he was having dinner with film stars in cannes or he was having drinks with sports stars in monte carlo or he was dancing with pop stars at a club in manhattan alex knew how to enjoy himself then six years ago murray maclennan died alex came back to edinburgh he got married and bought a house then he sold all the fish and chip shops and together with an old schoolfriend ian ross he opened an expensive restaurant in edinburgh logan drove into polwarth gardens and stopped outside alex maclennans house logan didnt come to rich areas of the city like this very often she usually spent more time in the dirtier poorer areas alex maclennans house was large and more than one hundred years old it was sergeant grant who opened the front door he was fiftyeight and usually he looked young for his age tonight he was looking old and tired hello madam come in he said wheres the body grant on the first floor in the bathroom the bathroom ok lets go and have a look what do you know so far asked logan they started to climb the stairs well madam mr maclennan went to have a bath probably at about eleven oclock he usually has a bath at about that time began grant i see mrs maclennan was already in bed grant said she says she fell asleep at about ten thirty and didnt hear her husband come up anyway she woke up at one thirty and he wasnt in bed she thought this was strange so she got up and went to look for him she couldnt find him but the bathroom door was locked did she try and get in asked logan yes she tried to break the door open but she couldnt so she called her brother he came round broke open the door and they found mr maclennan dead on the bathroom floor finished grant grant and logan arrived at the bathroom the walls were black the bath basin and toilet were white the floor was black and white alex maclennans body was on the floor there was a blue towel over his body you say someone locked the door on the inside asked logan thats right madam grant answered grant showed logan the broken wood has the doctor seen the body asked logan yes madam he left just before you arrived so how did he die then asked logan looking down at alex maclennans body a broken neck the doctor says looks like the floor was wet he fell hit the side of the bath end of alex maclennan logan looked at the body more closely and then looked round the room the floor was wet but not very wet the bath was empty alex maclennans body was dry the towel was dry too what about the window asked logan i thought about that said grant its closed but not locked logan walked across the room and opened the window she put her head outside and looked down it was about six metres to the ground not far right said logan get the scientists here i want them to look everywhere in this room very carefully they must look at the window and the wall outside and at the ground outside too ok madam said grant now where are the family and how are they well theres only mrs maclennan and her brother theyre both in the living room grant answered logan went down to the living room a man and a woman were sitting next to each other on the sofa the woman was probably in her late twenties but it was difficult to tell because she was crying she had red hair and was wearing nightclothes mrs maclennan im inspector logan of the edinburgh police said logan im very sorry about your husband thank you inspector the woman answered the man stood up he was tall and dark and he looked strong he was wearing a black jogging suit and he needed a shave good morning inspector im donald johnstone alices brother hello mr johnstone i know this is a terrible time for you both but im afraid i have to ask you some questions must you asked johnstone look at my sister shes crying cant you wait mr johnstone a man has died said logan i am a police officer i need to find some answers its all right donald said alice maclennan she turned to logan i understand inspector please ask your questions but be quick said johnstone mrs maclennan what time did your husband usually have a bath asked logan well he usually went upstairs at about eleven had a bath and then came to bed alice maclennan answered when i woke up at about one thirty and he wasnt in bed i went to look for him johnstone spoke she called me when she couldnt open the bathroom door i came as quickly as i could we broke into the bathroom and found alexs body weve told the sergeant this already logan moved across the room and looked at a photograph of alice and alex maclennan on the day they married they looked good together did your husband have any problems mrs maclennan asked logan i mean business problems no i dont think so ian ross took care of the business really alex brought his friends to the restaurant so that other people wanted to eat there logan remembered why people went to maclennans restaurant it wasnt cheap but when you went there you almost always saw someone famous so if i want to find out more about the restaurant i need to talk to mr ross logan said yes thats probably best alice maclennan answered mrs maclennan asked logan quietly were you happily married alice maclennan looked up quickly at logan johnstone stood up angrily now look here inspector you cant come round here asking questions like that i must ask you to leave please leave now logan looked hard into johnstones eyes but she spoke to mrs maclennan mrs maclennan she said softly im sorry to say this but it is possible someone killed your husband you mean began mrs maclennan but she put her hand to her mouth and stopped speaking yes said logan turning to her im not sure at the moment if it was murder or not she turned back to johnstone so i need answers to difficult questions mr johnstone inspector you cant really think that alice or i started johnstone logan put up a hand to stop him speaking mr johnstone she said i dont think anything at the moment now what were you doing when your sister phoned i was in bed asleep of course said johnstone in a quiet angry voice with your wife no actually my wife and children are away at the moment theyre staying with my wifes parents until christmas so there was nobody there at all except you logan asked quietly thats right logan looked at johnstone for some time without speaking then she told them both she would like to speak to them again later was this murder or not logan asked herself she knew something wasnt right she knew there was more to find out chapter two ian ross do you really think this is murder asked grant as they sat in logans office back at the london road police station i dont know answered logan but i know this i dont like mr johnstone and i dont believe mrs maclennan she hasnt told us everything about her and her husband grant drank his coffee and logan looked out of the window logan spoke again we wont hear from the scientists until later today before then i want you to find out about mr johnstone whats his problem why is he so unfriendly right madam agreed grant ill meet you back here at three oclock im going to talk to ian ross about the restaurant perhaps ill get a free lunch police officers never get a free lunch madam logan left the police station and drove back to her flat to shower put on some clean clothes and have something to eat logan lived in leith in the north of edinburgh by the sea many years ago leith was busy lots of boats came in and out every day these days there were few boats and many of the old buildings were now flats for the young people of edinburgh logan was only twentyeight but she did not feel young this morning when she thought about murder she always felt old as logan drove along princes street there was a loud noise it came from edinburgh castle logans favourite building in the city the noise was the sound of the one oclock gun on the castle walls every day at one oclock you can hear the gun logan turned right at the end of princes street and drove up to charlotte square the restaurant was on the west side of the square it was called charlottes logan left her car and went in it was busy inside a waiter walked up to logan can i help you madam he asked id like to see ian ross please he doesnt see anyone when the restaurants open im afraid madam im inspector logan edinburgh police ah he said right will you follow me please the man showed logan into a small office at the back of the restaurant and left her there a few moments later another man came in the man was tall with very short blond hair and a small blond moustache he was in his early thirties and looked strong inspector this is terrible news about alex terrible news he was a wonderful man a real friend now then how can i help you logan looked at him mr ross she asked logan took out her id card and showed it to the man yes yes sorry didnt i say ian ross pleased to meet you ross smiled at her mr ross were not sure how mr maclennan died at the moment yes alice told me we spoke on the phone this morning said ross im just asking a few questions so i can find out a little more about him said logan of course please ask anything you like well when did you first meet mr maclennan asked logan oh years ago answered ross we went to school together when we were young then he went to switzerland and travelled all over the world and what about you she asked i stayed here until i was sixteen then i joined the army became a soldier and travelled the world too said ross did you see each other often asked logan no not often he said but if we were both in edinburgh at the same time we always got together when did you start this place about five years ago said ross i left the army and came back here i didnt have a job alex was back from the states we spent a lot of time together and decided to start charlottes he had the money and the famous friends i did the work ross laughed but logan saw that his eyes were not smiling is the restaurant making money asked logan yes as you can see were very busy were always very busy the restaurant is doing very well you must earn a lot then did you each take half of the money or no if you must know alex paid me im the manager but i dont see how this is important i dont know if it is important mr ross tell me were you here last night yes inspector until about eleven then i went home i usually stay later but yesterday i was tired i went home and went to bed early do you live by yourself mr ross yes so logan thought to herself noone knows if you were at home or not she spoke again how well do you know alice maclennan now wait a minute inspector if you think alice and i he stopped logan looked at ross i dont think anything mr ross like i said i just ask questions chapter three help from friends when logan got back to the london road police station grant was waiting for her with some interesting news donald johnstone is a man with a lot of problems and not much money grant began really said logan tell me more well four years ago he borrowed some money from the bank he started a business buying and selling used cars i thought usedcar salesmen always made money said logan smiling not at the moment said grant the price of new cars has come down over the last two years and because of that the price of used cars has come down too so business has been difficult for mr johnstone and he keeps his cars at a place in the west end not far from princes street thats an expensive place to have a business logan said very expensive agreed grant most garages and car salesmen are outside the city not right in the centre so how bad is the problem asked logan very bad said grant hes borrowed pounds from the bank over the past four years and now they want the money back can he pay it back no answered grant but hes got a nice house quite near his sister if he cant find the money by the end of the year the bank is going to take his house his wife wont be very happy said logan no grant agreed is he hoping his sister will help him well shell have a lot of money now wont she said grant yes said logan she will logan looked at grant he had thick black hair and a large black moustache he was wearing an old blue jacket and old grey trousers he did not really look like a policeman but he was very good at getting information well done grant she smiled at him and where did you find out all that oh you know here and there said grant of course it helps that my cousin and johnstones wife are good friends logan laughed at that moment the phone rang grant answered it for most of the conversation he just listened then he thanked the person and put the phone down he turned to logan that was dr forbes the scientists have finished maclennan died some time between eleven thirty and twelve thirty of a broken neck they cant say if it was murder we knew that said logan anything else they found a very small piece of black material on the window lock and another very small piece on the wall outside the bathroom they think the material probably came from someones clothes they looked at each other it is murder isnt it said grant well i dont think someone climbed into the bathroom to have a shower do you said logan logan sent grant round to polwarth gardens she wanted to be sure that the black material did not come from alex or alice maclennans clothes she told grant to take any black or dark blue clothes and ask the scientists to have a look at them soon after grant left logan decided to find out if the maclennans really were happily married she could make a phone call but it was more interesting to talk to people face to face she put on her coat and went out onto london road she walked up leith street and turned into princes street princes street is unusual for the main street of a large city there are shops on only one side of the street the princes street gardens are on the other side in the summer the gardens are full of people sitting in the sun today there was snow on the ground and there were only a few people in the gardens they were hurrying to get in from the cold logan enjoyed her walk in the cold air she walked up the mound looking at the beautiful tall buildings this side of princes street was called the old town the other side already more than two hundred years old was called the new town logan soon turned left and walked into the offices of the scottish daily news she went up to the newsroom on the first floor it was full of journalists a short man with red hair and glasses looked up from his work well jenny logan said the man how nice to see you youre just in time to buy me a christmas drink ok tam said logan but youll have to work for it i want some information from you oh inspector youre a hard woman you think ill tell you everything you want just because i like you so much come on tam lets go laughed logan a few minutes later logan and tam were sitting in deacon brodies a famous old pub on the high street what do you know about the maclennans tam asked logan not much more than you probably said tam alex came back from america married a beautiful redheaded actress and started a restaurant hes got lots of money from his father lots of famous friends and a fine house in a nice area of the city well he had all these things until last night yes i know all that thats what i read in the papers but what else do you know what do you know that you dont put in the paper tam finished his drink and looked at the empty glass i get thirsty when i talk a lot he said logan smiled and went up to the bar while she was waiting for their drinks she turned round and looked at tam he was looking out of the window at the shoppers in the high street it was unusual for a journalist and a police officer to be friends but jenny logan liked tam a lot and she knew that he liked her when she came back to their table tam spoke everyone thought that the maclennans had a wonderful life the restaurant is always busy alexs friends were always there alice always had a smile on her face but but for the last eighteen months or so something was wrong said tam they werent happy how do you know asked logan little things said tam somebody heard them shouting at each other one night a few weeks later she went on holiday without him she stopped going to the restaurant so often in the old days they were very close but for the last year or two it was unusual to see them together do you think she had a lover or did he asked logan ah now thats the question come on tam whats the answer laughed logan and it doesnt cost another drink tam laughed and then started talking again well the answer is that if anyone had a lover she did alex didnt have enough time to see anyone else he was almost always at the restaurant or at home but we think alice was probably seeing someone else nobody is sure and nobody knows who the other man is or was did you try and find out asked logan of course i mean we are journalists you know logan smiled tam spoke again one of our men followed her a few times when he wasnt busy but he didnt find anything the strange thing was he lost her twice both times it was a thursday evening so you never found out if there was another man asked logan no said tam we wanted to find out more but we couldnt spend all our time following her there were other more important stories well thanks tam youve given me some good information its very kind of you tam put his hand on jenny logans looked into her eyes and gave her a big smile im a very kind man you know jenny logan then his voice changed and he said quickly so tell me was it murder and if so who did it logan laughed tams hand felt warm and nice but she took hers away slowly i dont know who did it tam she said but it was murder and you can put that in the paper if you want well well well so it was murder then said tam thanks jenny yes said logan and you are such a kind man that when i know who did it ill tell you first tam smiled at her logan left tam in deacon brodies and decided to go and meet grant at polwarth gardens she took her phone out of her bag and called grant it was time to find out what the maclennans marriage was really like chapter four alice maclennan for the second time that day grant opened the door when logan arrived at the maclennans house in polwarth gardens he followed her through the house to the living room johnstones gone home and will be back tomorrow said grant i didnt tell him you were coming good have you found any black clothes asked logan a black pullover and some black trousers answered grant they were alex maclennans mrs maclennan doesnt have any dark clothes at all well thats interesting said logan of course she could easily wear her husbands clothes get those clothes to the scientists as soon as possible we really need to know who was climbing in or out of she stopped speaking as they arrived at the living room door alice maclennan was standing behind a beautiful antique desk and studying some papers she looked up when logan and grant came into the room inspector logan she said what can i do for you im sorry but im afraid i have some more questions said logan thats all right inspector shall we sit down alice maclennan walked across the room and sat down on the large green sofa she was wearing light grey trousers and a white blouse logan sat in an armchair close to the sofa grant stood by the door as sergeant grant found out i have no dark clothes said alice maclennan people usually wear black after someone has died but alex will have to be happy with grey she smiled sadly im sure he wont mind said logan softly alice maclennan looked up anyway you must ask me your questions logan looked round the room at the beautiful antique furniture and the old pictures on the walls what happens to all this now asked logan who gets the house and your husbands money what happens to the restaurant well thats easy said alice maclennan he left everything to me i get the house and the money everything except the restaurant not the restaurant asked logan no the restaurant is different the restaurant was always alexs and ians ian didnt have any money when they started so alex paid him to be the manager but alex always said that the restaurant was theirs fiftyfifty so now alex is dead i will get half of it and the other fifty per cent will go to ian did mr ross know about this asked logan of course inspector answered alice maclennan he and alex talked about it when they started the restaurant so they were very good friends asked logan thats right logans dark brown eyes studied alice maclennans face carefully they were good friends when they started the restaurant i know that said logan but did they stay good friends i mean ive heard that mr ross did all the work and alex didnt do very much it was alex who was famous everyone came to see alexs friends how did mr ross feel about that alice maclennan looked away from logan her fingers started playing with a ring on her finger she looked back at logan and met her eyes i really dont know inspector she said youll have to ask him i dont often go to the restaurant these days i dont see ian very often logan was quiet for a moment you didnt answer my question this morning she said what question was that alice asked quickly almost too quickly were you and your husband happily married of course we were said alice mrs maclennan said logan i dont believe that is true and you know it isnt true logan looked into alice maclennans eyes please mrs maclennan im looking for the person who murdered your husband i know this is a very difficult time for you i dont want to make it more difficult but you must help me alice maclennan started to cry no we werent happily married she said when we first got married we were we were so so happy we were in love and everything was wonderful for a few years then alex and ian started the restaurant it took more and more of alexs time it was stupid really he didnt do any of the hard work but he spent more and more time at the restaurant sometimes we didnt see each other for days i became bored and angry were you angry with each other just before he died asked logan no things were beginning to change so no we werent angry with each other alice maclennan looked out of the window she thought carefully as she spoke we were starting to be happy again about six months ago we had a long talk about our marriage alex said he was sorry i was so angry he said he wanted to spend more time with me he wanted to try and make me happy again mrs maclennan when your husband was spending a lot of time at the restaurant did you have a lover asked logan alice maclennan looked at the inspector this time she did not look away no she said logan looked at her but said nothing no inspector i did not she said logan stood up well thank you for your time mrs maclennan she said i hope i dont need ask you anything else but if i do i know where to find you what do you think grant asked logan they stood outside the house in polwarth gardens what do you mean madam asked grant did she have a lover or didnt she you were watching her do you believe her you still dont im not sure answered logan i believe what she said about her marriage but i think she had a lover or maybe still has a lover and the lover could be the murderer asked grant that is very possible grant but if there is a lover nobody knows who it is at the moment alice maclennan certainly isnt going to tell us so lets think of something else to do logan told grant about her visit to the restaurant and what she had found out from tam she asked grant to send alex maclennans clothes to the scientists and then go to the restaurant she wanted more information about ian ross from the people who worked there she wanted to know how ross felt about alex maclennan logan started thinking about donald johnstone he needed lots of money and he needed it quickly his brotherinlaw was dead and his sister was now very rich was he just lucky or was he too lucky she decided she had some questions for him chapter five two angry men logan did not know where to find donald johnstone at home or at work she called his home number and he answered the phone she put the phone down without speaking five minutes later she arrived at his house in morningside johnstone opened the door he was wearing a dark grey suit and a black tie yes inspector he said mr johnstone id very much like to ask you one or two more questions said logan inspector he said im very busy im afraid i have no time at all youve got a choice mr johnstone we can talk now and it will take about ten minutes or i can take you to the police station and ask you some questions there perhaps youll be home again by tomorrow morning i believe the beds at the police station are rather uncomfortable too thats not much of a choice said johnstone come in and lets be quick logan went into the house and followed johnstone into the living room johnstone did not ask logan to sit down he stood behind an armchair and turned to her well he asked hows your business doing mr johnstone fine said johnstone he put his hands on the back of the chair in front of him i understand that actually business is not so good just now its just a small problem said johnstone and its a problem which will soon go away people always start buying cars in the new year and ill start earning money again i understand that your bank probably wont wait until the new year well you must know something that i dont know when i last spoke to my bank manager he was very happy to wait until the end of january really logan looked round the room you have a very nice house mr johnstone im sure you dont want the bank to take it away from you because you cant pay them back thats not going to happen said johnstone angrily his face was going red why not because your brotherinlaw is dead and so your sister now has enough money to help you said logan quietly what are you saying inspector that i wanted alex dead that i had something to do with it johnstones face was now dark red with anger get out he shouted get out of my house and dont come back logan turned and walked to the front door johnstone had big problems and he was an angry man was he angry because his business was doing badly or was he angry because of something else logan did not know the important question was did he need money badly enough to kill his brotherinlaw outside she got into her car and looked at her watch it was now six oclock and snow was falling again she sat in the car and thought more about johnstone he was wearing a dark suit this evening but what did he have on this morning she tried to remember but couldnt logan decided to go back to the police station she hoped that grant was still there while she drove she thought about ian ross it was interesting that he now had fifty per cent of the restaurant logan knew people who killed for fifty pounds fifty per cent of charlottes was much more than fifty pounds when she drove into the car park at the london road police station she saw grants car good he was still there she ran up the stairs and found him in his office when she came into the room he smiled you know madam i think ross really hated maclennan so you had an interesting visit said logan smiling she sat down opposite grant yes said grant very interesting ross was out so the people at the restaurant were happy to talk to me good so what did they say well the most interesting person was one of the waitresses a woman called isabel ferguson shes been at charlottes right from the start grant stopped and drank some coffee she said it was a great place to work at first ross and maclennan talked to all the people who came to eat there alice was there most of the time the three of them told funny stories about each other everyone was always laughing she said it was a great place to be a great place to work but said logan but the last year and a half have been terrible alice maclennan doesnt come to the restaurant any more alex maclennan wasnt as much fun as before and ross almost never comes out of the kitchen does she know why asked logan well the problem was that ross and maclennan stopped being friends she thinks it was because of money maclennan was earning a lot of money from the restaurant everyone knew that but he was still paying ross the same as when they started and ross didnt like it said logan isabel thinks he didnt like it at all did he talk to anyone about it asked logan no she and ross are good friends but he never said anything to her one night after the restaurant closed she heard ross and maclennan shouting at each other in the office later she asked ross what the problem was and he told her it wasnt important grant stopped speaking logan sat quietly then she looked at grant we must have a closer look at mr ross i think she said yes madam said grant he was in the army wasnt he i want to talk to someone about his time in the army she looked at her watch it was seven thirty but it will be much too late now can you find me a number to call in the morning then go home and ill see you tomorrow we cant do anything else today ok madam logan got her bag and coat then left the office outside it was dark on her way home she stopped at a supermarket to buy some food she drove home and left her car in the street outside her house when she got inside she made a sandwich opened a bottle of pepsi and sat down she started thinking about alex maclennans murder again did alice maclennan have a lover who why was donald johnstone so angry how did he feel about alex was he at home before his sister phoned did the bank want to take away his house who wanted alex dead logans last thought was about ian ross what did he do in the army she needed to find out more in the morning chapter six blood on their hands grant called logan at home early the next morning ive found someone who knows ian ross he said hes called major james innes he said hell meet you at the royal scots club at eleven oclock this morning ask for him at the main office and they will tell you where to find him thanks grant at a quarter to eleven logan was walking down queen street in the new town the weather had become very cold logan was wearing a thick coat a scarf and a hat her nose was red with the cold she kept her hands in her pockets and her head down against the wind the royal scots club was on the other side of the queen street gardens in abercromby place the club was a meeting place for a lot of people not just old soldiers there was a restaurant and a bar meeting rooms and also a number of bedrooms where people could stay it was a sort of hotel as well as a club major innes was waiting for logan in a quiet room near the main office he was sitting in an armchair in front of a warm fire he was about sixty years old with short white hair and a white moustache he was wearing a dark blue jacket and an army tie good morning inspector he said your sergeant told me you wanted some information about ian ross yes major how well did you know ross very well he was one of my men for a number of years well id like to know anything you can tell me about him said logan he was a good soldier a very good soldier said major innes he always did what i asked he was intelligent and he was strong were you together for a long time asked logan about four or five years where im sorry inspector said major innes i cant give you that sort of information you see we were in the sas we are not allowed to talk about where we have been and what we were doing logan sat back in her armchair and looked at the major the sas were some of the best soldiers in the british army they often worked in very dangerous places sometimes inside countries that were not at all friendly to britain the sas knew the meaning of danger they were hard men i didnt know ross was in the sas said logan quietly the fire was very warm but logan felt cold she thought for a moment then she spoke major i must tell you why im here im looking for the person who killed alex maclennan youve probably read about his murder in the papers yes inspector said the major well ian ross and alex maclennan were good friends at one time they had a restaurant business together i see and do you think ross murdered maclennan asked the major major did ian ross kill anyone when he was in the army asked logan not answering the majors question yes inspector he did a number of people but you must remember that he was a soldier it was his job soldiers only kill when they have to they do not kill their friends no thought logan soldiers dont kill their friends but were ian ross and alex maclennan friends or not thank you very much major im sorry ive taken so much of your time she stood up to go thats all right inspector i hope you find the right person ian ross was a very good soldier and he killed people when he had to but that doesnt mean he is a murderer logan left the royal scots club she walked back to queen street where she stopped a taxi it took her back to london road she got a cup of coffee and sat in her office she looked out of the window in the garden on the other side of the street some children were playing in the snow they were laughing and shouting and building a snowman logans phone rang she answered it logan she said this is your favourite newspaper journalist speaking it was tams voice logan smiled to herself hi tam she said if youre phoning about the maclennan murder im afraid i havent got anything for you thats ok jenny said tam because i could have something for you logan pulled her notebook out of her bag what is it tam how much do you know about donald johnstone well we know all about his business and his problems with the bank said logan ah said tam then you dont know that he nearly killed a man three years ago what logan almost shouted into the phone how do you know that interesting isnt it said tam another journalist here at the news is working on the maclennan murder he was talking to someone who knows johnstone and this story came out go on said logan well i dont know if this is true but anyway you know johnstone buys and sells used cars yes said logan well three years ago a man called neil erskine came to johnstone erskine said he had three bmws to sell he told johnstone that he had an expensive taxi company for rich business people he was buying some new cars for the company and he wanted to sell the old ones logan could see what was coming how much of the story was true she asked you are good at your job jenny he laughed well he wanted to sell three bmws but nothing else was true but johnstone believed him said logan yes he bought the bmws and then about a week later the police came round and took all three of them away they werent neil erskines at all two of them were from the south of england and one was from liverpool and where was neil erskine asked logan but she knew the answer gone said tam so what happened asked logan well neil erskine wasnt his real name his real name is neil gordon and hes from glasgow but johnstone didnt know that anyway about a year later johnstone was over in glasgow doing some business he was in a pub and he saw neil gordon said logan right again said tam well johnstone followed him home later that week he went back with three of his friends neil gordon spent the next three months in hospital and now three years later he still cant walk very well he didnt tell the police about johnstone no he didnt if the police found out about the cars tam stopped speaking i see what you mean said logan she said nothing as she thought about johnstone she knew that he got angry very quickly but she didnt know that he could do something like this are you still there asked tam oh sorry tam she said look thanks very much what youve told me is a real help you journalists have some very interesting friends tam laughed ill speak to you later he said bye said logan and put the phone down tams news about johnstone was interesting but what could she do with it it didnt mean johnstone was a murderer but now logan was sure he could kill if he wanted to she looked out of the window the childrens snowman was finished and snowballs were flying through the air she let different ideas run through her head after a time one idea stayed there and she thought about it very carefully some time later logan heard the one oclock gun and sergeant grant put his head round the door come in grant she said tell me what you think of my idea it took logan about twenty minutes to tell grant what she wanted to do then they got everything ready after that logan phoned alice maclennan and told her that she would like to come round and see her again she

living room as they sat down alice maclennan spoke you said on the phone inspector that you needed my help i dont see how i can help you ive already told you everything i know i know said logan but id like you to do something for me and my hope is that we can then catch the person who murdered your husband what do you mean asked alice maclennan logan looked into alices eyes mrs maclennan asked logan softly have you thought about who the murderer could be im hoping that its someone who broke into the house looking for money she said quietly but i think it probably isnt logan said nothing alice maclennan looked at logan and then down at her hands i think its probably someone i know said alice maclennan maybe someone im close to and thats a terrible thought i know it must be very difficult for you said logan sadly it almost certainly is someone close to you or your husband alice maclennan stood up and walked across the room to the window then she turned round and looked at logan well who do you think it is and what do you want me to do she asked as far as i can see its good news for two people that your husband is dead ian ross and your brother ross hated alex your brother needs money badly and you will now be very rich alice maclennan sat down again thats true she said very quietly what i want you to do said logan is phone both ross and your brother tell them that mr fraser who lives in harden place just behind your house has called the police he saw someone climbing into your bathroom the night your husband was murdered tell ross and your brother the police artist is going to harden place tomorrow morning to draw a picture of the person mr fraser saw and what do you think will happen asked alice maclennan the murderer will want to talk to mr fraser answered logan and we will be there waiting alice maclennan sat quietly thinking i need to think what to say she said logan sat quietly alice maclennan looked at her and gave a small smile did you know that i was an actress before i met alex she said yes i knew that said logan alice maclennan turned and picked up the phone harden place was a small street near polwarth gardens number eight was on the lefthand side of the street it had a small front garden and a red front door the ground floor of the house was quite small at the back of the house was a long living room with double doors which opened into the back garden there were trees in the back garden and a wall on each side in the living room a man was sitting in an armchair in front of the fire he was wearing old grey trousers and an old blue jacket and he had a large black moustache he was smoking a cigarette and reading the newspaper it was eleven oclock in the evening and dark outside there were three other doors from the living room one led into the hall a second led into a small room at the front of the house the third led into the dining room also at the back of the house between the living room and the kitchen in the front room the lights were off the door was open a few centimetres three police officers were sitting behind the door inspector logan was standing just inside the door she could see into the living room the man in the armchair was sergeant grant sometimes he looked up at the clock and then he went back to reading his paper logan watched the smoke from his cigarette going up in a line after a few minutes the smoke stopped going up in a line it moved slowly around the house was quiet logan felt cold air coming in grant put the newspaper down on the floor next to his chair as he did this the door behind him which led to the dining room opened very quietly a tall man dressed from head to foot in black came through the door into the room he had a sort of black hat over his head and face too only his eyes showed there was a knife in his hand logan could see that grant was ready grant stood up quickly and turned round the man in black moved to his left grant moved too he moved away watching the man with the knife carefully logan waited the man in black spoke softly you think you saw me do you he said you think you can tell the police who i am well im sorry but ive got no choice i cant let you do that the man in black ran quickly over to grant logan decided she could wait no longer now she shouted she ran into the living room the police officers followed her but they were all too late the man in black had his arm around grants chest the knife was at grants throat and a little blood was running down grants neck to his shirt dont come near me or ill kill him said the man in black drop the knife you cant get away said logan quietly nobody moved get away from the door or fraser dies shouted the man in black get away from the door again nobody moved then logan spoke its over ross that is sergeant grant not mr fraser let him go the room was quiet the knife moved a few centimetres away from grants throat grant was ready his elbow moved back very hard and very quickly into the stomach of the man behind him the man dropped his knife his hands flew to his stomach he fell to the floor quickly grant picked up the knife logan walked across the room and pulled off the black hat rosss face was dark his eyes black and angry how did you know it was me how did you know i killed alex he asked why did you do it asked logan he was so pleased with himself he loved everyone thinking he was rich and funny he loved telling me how much money he earned from the restaurant i asked him to pay me more but he said no he laughed at me when he said it did you know you got fifty per cent of the restaurant if he died asked logan thats what he told me answered ross sometimes i believed it sometimes i didnt it wasnt important anyway he had everything money the restaurant a beautiful wife i hated him i hated him so much i wanted him to die so two nights ago you climbed up the wall and into his bathroom yes i knew what he usually did in the evening i waited for him behind the bathroom door when he came in i killed him then i climbed back down and well you know what happened finished ross logan spoke to the three officers you three take mr ross to the police station and when you get there give him some different clothes and send those ones to the scientists i think theyll find the material is the same as the material from alex maclennans bathroom then she turned to grant grant you come with me chapter eight the last pieces when they got outside logan and grant walked round to alice maclennans house in polwarth gardens alice maclennan opened the door well she asked in a quiet and rather sad voice it was ian ross said logan some officers are taking him to the london road police station right now alice maclennan put her hand up to her mouth oh no ian she said how terrible are you sure yes hes told us everything well almost everything alice maclennan looked at logan strangely almost everything what do you mean inspector she asked well theres one thing he didnt tell us he didnt tell us how long you and he were lovers i was hoping you could tell us that come in inspector said alice maclennan lets talk inside its warmer they went into alice maclennans living room and sat down what i told you before was true alex and i were happily married until he started the restaurant began alice maclennan i told you we had some problems then but i couldnt tell you alice maclennan began to cry quietly go on said logan softly it started about eighteen months ago alex was spending all his time at the restaurant i knew ian was interested in me so i asked him round here one day when alex was away and you became lovers said logan yes we were lovers for about a year did your husband find out i dont know i dont think so at that time alex and i didnt talk very much so i dont think he knew when did you and ross stop seeing each other asked logan about six months ago said alice maclennan i didnt want to spend any more time with ian and alex was trying to make me happy again how did ross feel about this alice maclennan started to cry again logan put her hand on alice maclennans arm ian was terribly angry when i said we had to stop seeing each other said alice maclennan she stopped and looked out of the window then she went on i often asked myself why ian and i were together did he really love me or did he love me because i was alexs wife when i left him he said some terrible things he said he wanted you because you were alexs asked logan yes said alice maclennan quietly i dont know if it was true perhaps he was just so angry that he said the first thing that came into his head perhaps it was halftrue she stopped for a moment and then she asked you dont think he killed alex because i left him do you no i dont think so said logan mainly i think he was angry that your husband was making so much money now he asked for more money and your husband said no i think the money was the most important thing for him i hope so inspector said alice maclennan i really hope youre right the next morning grant and logan sat in logans office they were drinking coffee and talking about ian ross tell me madam said grant how did you know it was ross before you took off his hat it was a choice between ross and johnstone but i always thought it was ross said logan he was the only person who could climb up the wall he was in the sas climbing the wall was easy for him and what about donald johnstone asked grant well we had to see if it was him too said logan just to be sure but i never thought it was grant smiled and how did you know that ross and alice maclennan were lovers i only learnt that yesterday evening said logan from something that ross aid he said he knew what maclennan usually did at home in the evening how did he know im sure maclennan didnt tell him what time he had a bath and then i thought perhaps ross and alice maclennan were lovers perhaps they talked about alex when they were together perhaps she told him and i was right logan put her coffee cup down and looked at grant anyway you did very well last night sergeant she said where did you learn to take knives away from soldiers ive been in the police a long time madam said grant smiling ive taken away one or two knives from people on saturday nights after grant left logan made a phone call newsroom tam macdonald speaking a voice said tam said logan its jenny
