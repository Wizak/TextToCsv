lumley necroscope necroscope necroscope by brian lumley book of the necroscope series prologue interval one interval two final interval epilogue definitions tele a telescope is an optical instrument which enlarges the images of distant objects for example the surface of the moon may be viewed as from only a few hundred miles away micro a microscope is an optical instrument which makes small objects visible to the human eye through a microscope a drop of clear water is seen to contain countless unsuspected microorganisms necro a necroscope is a human instrument which permits access to the minds of the dead harry keogh is a necroscope he knows the thoughts of corpses in their graves the main difference between these instruments is this the first two perform purely physical oneway functions they are incapable of changing anything the moon cannot look back through the telescope the amoeba does not know it is under microscopic scrutiny thats harry keoghs big problem his talent seems to work both ways the dead know and they wont lie still for it prologue the hotel was big and rather famous ostentatious if not downright flamboyant within easy walking distance of whitehall andnot entirely what it seemed to be its top floor was totally given over to a company of international entrepreneurs which was the sum total of the hotel managers knowledge about it the occupants of that unknown upper region had their own elevator at the rear of the building private stairs also at the rear and entirely closed off from the hotel itself even their own fire escape indeed they they being the only identification one might reasonably apply in such circumstances owned the top floor and so fell entirely outside the hotels sphere of control and operation except that from the outside looking in few would suspect that the building in total was anything other than what it purported to be which was exactly the guise or aspect or lack of such which they wished to convey as for the international entrepreneurs whatever such creatures might be they were not in fact they were a branch of government or more properly a subsidiary body government supported them in the way a tree supports a small creeper but their roots were wholly separate and similarly because they were a very tiny parasite the vast bulk of the tree was totally unaware of their presence as is the case with so many experimental unproven projects their funding was of a low priority came out of petty cash the upkeep of their offices was therefore far and away top of the list where costing was concerned but that was unavoidable for unlike other projects the nature of this one demanded a very low profile indeed its presence in the event of discovery would be an acute embarrassment it would doubtless be viewed with suspicion and scorn if not disbelief and downright hostility it would be seen as a totally unnecessary expenditure a needless burden on the taxpayer a complete waste of public money nor would there be any justifying it the benefits or fruits of its being remained as yet entirely conjectural and the mildest frost would certainly put paid to them the same principles apply to any such organisation or service it must be seen to be effective while paradoxically maintaining its cloak of invisibility its anonymity ergo to expose such a body is to kill it another way to dispose of this sort of hybrid would be quite simply to tear up its roots and deny it had ever existed or wait for them to be torn up by some outside agency and then fail to replant them three days ago there had occurred just such an uprooting a major tendril had been broken whose principal function it had been to bind the vine to its host body providing stability in short the head of the branch had suffered a heart attack and died on his way home he had had a bad heart for years so that wasnt strange in itself but then something else had happened to throw a different light on the matter something alec kyle didnt want to dwell on right now for now on this monday morning of an especially chilly january kyle the next in line must assess the damage and feasibility of repairs and if such repairs were at all possible then he must make his first groping attempt to pull the thing back together the projects foundations had always been a little shaky but now lacking positive direction and leadership the whole show might well fall apart in very short order like a sandcastle when the tide comes in these were the thoughts in kyles head as he stepped from the slushy pavement through swinging glass doors into a tiny foyer shook damp snow from his overcoat and turned the collar down it was not that he personally had any doubt as to the validity of the project in fact the opposite applied kyle believed the branch to be allimportant but how to defend his position in the face of all that scepticism from above scepticism yes old gormley had been able to pull it off with all his friends in high places his old school tie image his authority and enthusiasm and sheer getupandgo but men such as keenan gormley were few and far between even fewer now and this afternoon at kyle would be called upon to defend his position the validity of his branchs being its very existence oh theyd been quick off the mark right enough and kyle believed he knew why this was it the crunch with nothing to show for five years work the project was to be terminated no matter what arguments he produced hed be shouted down old gormley had been able to shout louder than all of them put together hed had the clout the backup but alec kyle who was he in his minds eye he could picture the afternoons inquisition right now yes minister im alec kyle my function in the branch well apart from being second in command to sir keenan i was i mean i am er that is to say i prognosticatei beg your pardon ah it means i foresee the future sir er no i have to admit that i probably couldnt give you the winner of the at goodwood tomorrow my awareness generally isnt that specific but but it would be hopeless a hundred years ago they wouldnt accept hypnotism only fifteen years ago they were still laughing at acupuncture so how could kyle hope to convince them in respect of the branch and its work and yet on the other hand coming through all the despondency and sense of personal loss there was this other thing kyle knew it for what it was his talent telling him that all was not lost that somehow he would convince them that the branch would go on which was why he was here to go through keenan gormleys things prepare some sort of case for the branch continue fighting its cause and again kyle found himself wondering about his strange talent his ability to glimpse the future for the fact was that last night he had dreamed that the answer lay right here in this building amongst gormleys papers or perhaps dreamed was the wrong word for it kyles revelations his glimpses of things which had not yet happened future occurrences invariably came in those misty moments between true sleep and coming awake immediately prior to full conscious awareness the clamour of his alarmclock could do it set the process in motion or even the first crack of sunlight through his bedroom window thats what it had been this morning the grey light of another grey day invading his room getting under his eyelids impressing upon his idly drifting mind the fact that another day was about to be born and with it had been born a vision but again glimpse might be a better word for it for that was all kyles talent had ever permitted the merest glimpse knowing this and knowing that it would only occur once and then be gone forever he had fastened upon it absorbed it he dared not miss a thing everything be had ever seen in this way had always proved to be vitally important and on this occasion he had seen himself seated at keenan gormleys desk going through his papers one by one the top righthand desk drawer was open the papers and files on the desk in front of him had come from there gormleys massive security filing cabinet stood as yet undisturbed against the wall of his office its three keys were lying on top of the desk where kyle had tossed them each key would open a tiny drawer in the cabinet and each drawer had its own combination lock kyle knew the combinations and yet had not bothered to open the cabinet no for that which he sought was right here in these documents from the drawer as if realisation of that fact had galvanised the image of himself where it sat in gormleys chair kyle had then seen himself pause abruptly as he came to a certain file it was a yellow file which meant that it concerned a prospective member of the organisation someone on the books as it were someone gormley had had his beady eye on perhaps someone with a real talent as that thought dawned so kyle took a step towards himself where he sat then dramatically as was always the case his alterimage at the desk had looked up stared at him and held up the file so that he could read the name on the cover the name was harry keogh that was all that had been the point where kyle had started awake as to what the thing had meant or was supposed to signify who could say kyle had long since given up trying to predict the meaning of these glimpses other than the fact that they had meaning but in any case if something could be said to have brought him here today it would have to be that brief and as yet inexplicable dream before waking as yet it was still fairly early in the morning kyle had beaten the first rush of heavy traffic in londons streets by just a few minutes for the next hour or more all would be chaos out there but in here it was quiet as the proverbial tomb the rest of the admin team had been given today and tomorrow off out of respect for the dead man so the offices upstairs would be completely empty in the tiny foyer kyle had pressed the button for the elevator which now arrived and opened its doors he entered and as the doors closed behind him he took out his passcard sliding it easily and smoothly through the sensor slot the elevator jerked but made no upward movement its doors opened waited for a long moment closed again kyle frowned glanced at his card and silently cursed it had run out yesterday normally gormley would have renewed its validity on the branch computer now kyle would have to do it himself fortunately he had gormleys card with him along with the rest of his officerelated effects using the exhead of branchs passcard he coerced the elevator into carrying him to the top floor going through a similar procedure to let himself into the main suite of offices the silence inside was almost deafening high up above the level of the street with soundproofed floors to shut out hotel noises from below and doubleglazed tinted windows for additional privacy the place seemed set in a sort of vacuum the feeling crept in that if you listened to that silence long enough it would become hard to breathe it was especially so in gormleys room where someone had been thoughtful enough to draw the blinds at the windows but the blinds had jammed only a little more than halfway shut so that now with bands of light coming in through the greentinted windows the entire office seemed decorated in a horizontal submarine pinstripe it made this once familiar room strangely alien and it was suddenly very odd and unreal not to have the old man here kyle stood in the doorway staring into the office for long moments before entering then closing the door behind him he stepped to the centre of the room several hidden scanners had already picked him up and identified him in the outer offices as well as in here but a monitor screen in the wall close to gormleys desk wasnt satisfied it beeped and printed up sir keenan gormley is not available at present this is a secure area please identify yourself in your normal speaking voice or leave immediately if you fail to leave or identify yourself a ten second warning will be given following which the door and windows will lock automaticallyrepeat this is a secure area feeling irrationally aggressive towards the cold unthinking machine and not a little perverse kyle said nothing but waited after a count of three the screen wiped itself clean and printed up ten second warning commences nowtennineeightsevensix alec kyle said kyle grudgingly not wishing to be locked in the machine recognised his voice pattern stopped counting commenced a new routine good morning mr kylesir keenan gormley is not i know said kyle hes dead he stepped to the desk keyboard and punched in the current security override to which the machine replied do not forget to reset before you leave and switched itself off kyle sat down at the desk funny world he thought and funny bloody outfit robots and romantics super science and the supernatural telemetry and telepathy computerised probability patterns and precognition gadgets and ghosts he reached into a pocket for his cigarettes and lighter came out with both items and also the keys to gormleys security cabinet without thinking he tossed the keys on to an empty corner of the desk then he paused and stared at them lying there forming a pattern the pattern from this mornings glimpse into the future very well lets go from there he tried the drawers of the desk locked he took out gormleys notebook from the inside pocket of his overcoat checked the code it was open sesame unable to suppress a chuckle kyle punched open sesame into the desk keyboard and tried again the top righthand drawer slid open at a touch inside papers documents files and here comes the funny bit he thought he took out the papers and placed them in front of him on the desk leaving the drawer open he began to check through the documents placing each one back in the drawer in its turn he knew that by now his talent shouldnt really surprise him any more but it always did and so he gave a small involuntary start as he arrived at the yellow file the name on the cover was of course harry keogh harry keogh apart from kyles dream that name had only ever come up once before in an esp game he had used to play with keenan gormley as for this file he had never seen it before in his life and yet here he sat staring at it exactly as in his dream it was a very creepy feeling and in the dream he had held the file up to himself now the thought set the act in motion feeling foolish not understanding why he did it but at the same time feeling his skin charged with alien energy he held up the file to the empty room as if to a ghost from his own recent past and just as a thought had triggered the action now the action triggered something else something away and beyond all of alec kyles previous experience or knowledge god almighty gadgets and ghosts the room had been comfortably warm just a moment ago centrally heated the offices were never cold or should not be but now in a matter of seconds the temperature had plunged kyle knew it could feel it but at the same time he retained enough of instinctive reasoning to wonder if perhaps his own body temperature had also taken a tumble if so it wouldnt be hard to explain this must be what shock felt like no wonder people shivered jesus christ he whispered his breath pluming in the suddenly frigid air the file fell from his twitching fingers slapped down on the desk the sound of its falling that and what he saw galvanised kyle into an almost spastic reaction of motion he jerked back in his chair causing its legs to ride through the pile of the carpet tilting it backwards until it slammed against the window sill and rebounded the apparition the thing where it stood halfway between the door and the desk hadnt moved at first kyle had thought that it could only be himself he saw standing there somehow projected forward from the dream but now he saw that it was someone something else not once did it enter his mind to question the reality of what he was seeing and not for a moment did he consider it to be anything other than supernatural how could it be anything else the scanners where they constantly swept the room the entire suite of offices had detected nothing entirely independent if they had picked up anything at all intruder buzzers would be going off right now and getting louder by the minute until someone sat up and took notice but the alarms were silent ergo there was nothing here to scan and yet kyle saw it it he was a man a youth anyway naked as a baby standing there facing kyle looking directly at him but his feet werent quite touching the carpeted floor and the bars of green light from the windows penetrated into his flesh as if it had no substance at all damn it it had no substance at all but the thing stared at him and kyle knew that it saw him and in the back of his mind he asked himself is it friendly or inching his chair forward again his eyes spied something in the back of the open drawer a browning mm automatic hed known gormley carried a weapon but hadnt known about this one but would the gun be loaded and if it was would it be any good against this no said the naked apparition with a slow almost imperceptible shake of its head no it wouldnt which was all the more surprising because its lips didnt move by the smallest fraction of an inch jesus christ kyle gasped again out loud this time as he once more gave an involuntary start away from the desk and then controlling himself to himself he said youyou read my mind the apparition smiled a thin smile we all have our talents alec you have yours and i have mine kyles lower jaw already agape now fell open he wondered which would be easier to simply think at the thing or to talk to it just talk to me said the other i think that will be easier for both of us kyle gulped tried to say something gulped again and finally gasped out but whowhatwhat the hell are you who i am doesnt matter what i have been and will be does now listen ive a lot to tell you and its all rather important it will take some time hours maybe do you need anything before i begin kyle stared hard at thewhatever it was he stared at it jerked his eyes away from it peered at it out of the corner of his eye it was still there he surrendered to instinct backed up by at least two of his five senses those of sight and hearing the thing seemed rational it existed it wanted to talk to him why him and why now doubtless hed shortly be finding out but god damn he wanted to talk to it too he had a real live ghost here or a real dead one need anything he shakily repeated the others question you were going to light a cigarette the apparition pointed out you might also like to take your coat off get yourself a coffee it shrugged if you do these things first then we can get on with it the central heating had come on turning itself up a notch to compensate for the sudden fall in temperature kyle carefully stood up took off his overcoat and folded it over the back of his chair coffee he said yes er ill just be a moment he walked round the desk and past his visitor it turned to watch him leave the room a pale shadow of a thing floating there skinny insubstantial as a snowflake a puff of smoke and yetoh yes there was a power in it kyle was thankful it didnt follow him he put two fivepence pieces in the coffee machine in the main office fumbling the coins into the slot and headed for the gents toilet before the machine could deliver he quickly relieved himself picked up his steaming paper cup of coffee on the way back to gormleys office the thing was still there waiting for him he carefully walked round it seated himself again at the desk and as he lit a cigarette he looked at his visitor more closely in greater detail this was something he had to get fixed in his mind taking into account the fact that its feet werent quite touching the floor it must be about fiveten in height if its flesh was real instead of milky mist it or he would weigh maybe nine stone everything about him was vaguely luminous as if shining with some faint inner light so kyle couldnt be sure about colouring his hair an untidy mop seemed sandy faint and irregular marks on his high cheeks and forehead might be freckles he would be oh maybe twentyfive years old he had looked younger at first but that effect was wearing off now his eyes were interesting they looked at kyle and yet seemed to look right through him as if he were the ghost and not the other way about they were blue those eyes that startlingly colourless blue which always looks so unnatural so that you think the owner must be wearing lenses but more than that there was that in those eyes which said they knew more than any twentyfiveyearold had any right knowing the wisdom of ages seemed locked in them the knowledge of centuries lay just beneath the faintly blue film which covered them apart from that his features were fine like porcelain and seeming equally fragile his hands were slim tapering his shoulders drooped a little his skin in general apart from the freckles of his face was pale and unblemished but for the eyes you probably wouldnt look at him twice on the street he was justa young man or a young ghost or maybe a very old one no said the object of kyles scrutiny his lips immobile im not any kind of ghost not in the classic sense of the word anyway but now since you obviously accept me can we begin begin er of course kyle suddenly felt like laughing hysterical as a schoolgirl he controlled it with an effort are you sure youre ready yes yes go right ahead but er can i record this for posterity or whatever you know theres a tape recorder here and i the machine wont hear me said the other shaking his head again sorry but im only speaking to you directly to you i thought you understood that buttake notes if you wish notes yes kyle scrabbled in the desk drawers found paper and a pencil fine im ready the other slowly nodded the story i have to tell isstrange but working in an organisation such as yours you shouldnt find it too unbelievable if you dotherell be plenty for you to do afterwards the truth of the things im going to tell you will come out then as to any doubts you may have about the future of your branch put them aside your work will go on and it will go from strength to strength gormley was the head but hes dead now you will be head for a little while youll be up to it i assure you anyway nothing that gormley knew has been lost indeed much has been gained as for the opposition theyve suffered losses from which they may never recover at least theyre about to as the apparition spoke so kyles eyes opened even wider and he sat up straighter and straighter it knew about the branch about gormley about the opposition which was branch parlance for the russian outfit and what was this about them suffering heavy losses kyle knew nothing of that where did this being get its information and just how much did it know anyway i know more than you can possibly imagine said the other smiling wanly and what i dont know i can get to know almost anything see said kyle defensively its not that i doubt any of this or even my sanity for that matter its just that im trying to adjust and i understand the other cut him off but please do your adjusting as we go if you can in what im about to tell you timezones may overlap a little so youll need to adjust to that too but ill keep it as chronologically sound as i can the important thing is the information itself and its implications im not sure i quite under i know i know so just sit there and listen and then maybe you will understand chapter one moscow may central in a densely wooded tract of land not far out of the city where the serpukhov road passed through a saddle between low hills and gazed for a moment across the tops of closegrown pines towards podolsk which showed as a hazy smudge on the southern horizon brightly pricked here and there with the first lights of evening stood a house or mansion of debased heritage and mixed architectural antecedents several of its wings were of modern brick upon old stone foundations while others were of cheap breeze blocks roughly painted over in green and grey almost as if to camouflage their illmatching construction bedded at their bases in steeply gabled end walls twin towers or minarets decayed as rotten fangs and gaunt as watchtowers whose sagging buttresses and parapets and flaking spiral decorations detracted nothing from a sense of dereliction raised broken bulbous domes high over the tallest trees their boarded windows glooming like hooded eyes the layout of the outbuildings many of which had been recently reroofed with modern red brick tiles might well suggest a farm or farming community though no crops farm animals or machines were anywhere in evidence the high allencompassing perimeter wall which from its massy structure reinforced abutments and broad breast walls might likewise be a relic of feudal times showed similar signs of recent repair work where heavy grey concrete blocks had replaced crumbling stone and ancient brick to east and west where streams ran deep and gurgling over black boulders flowing between steep banks which formed them into natural moats old stone bridges supporting lead roofs green with moss and age tunnelled into and through the walls their dark mouths muzzled with steellatticed gates all in all grim and foreboding as if the merest glimpse of the place from the highway would not be sufficient warning in itself a sign at the tjunction where a cobbled track wound away from the road and into the woods declared that this entire area was property of the state patrolled and protected and that all trespassers would be prosecuted motorists were not permitted to stop under any circumstances walking in the woods was strictly forbidden hunting and fishing likewise penalties would be without exception severe but for all that the place seemed deserted and lost in its own miasma of desolation as evening grew into night and a mist came up from the streams to turn the ground to milk so lights flickered into life behind the curtained groundfloor windows telling a different story in the woods on the approach roads to the covered bridges large black saloon cars might also appear abandoned where they blocked the way except for the dull orange glowing of hot cigarette tips within and the smoke curling from partly wounddown windows it was the same inside the grounds squat silent shapes which might just represent men standing in the shadowed places their dark grey overcoats as like as uniforms faces hidden under the brims of felt hats shoulders robotically square in an inner courtyard of the main building an ambulance or maybe a hearse stood with its back doors open whiteoveralled attendants waiting and the driver seated uncomfortably at the high steeringwheel one of the attendants played with a steel loading roller spinning it on welllubricated bearings at the rear end of the long somehow sinister vehicle nearby in an openended barnlike structure with a sagging canvas roof a helicopters dull paintwork and square glass windows gleamed darkly in shadow its fuselage bearing the insignia of the supreme soviet in one of the towers leaning carefully on a low parapet wall a figure with army nightsight binoculars scanned the land about particularly the open area between the perimeter wall and the central cluster projecting above his shoulder the ugly blue metal snout of a specially adapted kalashnikov rifle was limned faintly against a horizon growing steadily darker inside the main building modern soundproof partition walls now divided what had once been a vast hall into fairly large rooms serviced by a central corridor lit with a row of fluorescent tubes strung along a high ceiling each room had a padlocked door and all the doors were fitted with tiny grille windows with sliding covers on the inside and with small red lights which when blinking signified no entry not to be disturbed one of these lights halfway down the corridor on the left was blinking even now leaning against the wall to one side of the door with the blinking light a tall hardfaced kgb operative cradled a submachinegun in his arms for the moment relaxed he was ready to spring to attention or into action at a moments notice the merest hint of the door opening the sudden cessation of the red lights blinking and he would snap up straighter than a lamppost for while none of the men in that room was his real master nevertheless one of them was as powerful as anyone in the highest ranks of the kgb perhaps one of the ten most powerful men in russia there were other men in the room beyond the door which in fact was not one room but two with an interconnecting door of their own in the smaller room three men sat in armchairs smoking their hooded eyes fixed on the partition wall of which a large central section floor to ceiling was a oneway viewscreen the floor was carpeted a small wheeled table within easy reach supported an ashtray glasses and a bottle of highclass slivovitz all was silent except for the breathing of the three and the faint electric whirr of the airconditioning subdued lighting in a false ceiling was soothing to their eyes the man in the middle was in his midsixties those to right and left perhaps fifteen years younger his protйgйs each of them knew the other for a rival the man in the middle knew it too he had planned it that way it was called survival of the fittest only one of them would survive to take his place when eventually that day came by then the other would have been removed perhaps politically but more likely in some other still more devious fashion the years between would be their proving ground yes survival of the fittest completely grey at the temples but with a broad contrasting central stripe of jetblack hair swept back from his high muchwrinkled brow the senior man sipped his brandy motioned with his cigarette the man on his left passed the ashtray half of the hot ash found its target the rest fell to the floor in a moment or two the carpet began to smoulder and a curl of acrid smoke rose up the flanking men sat still deliberately ignoring the burning they knew how the older man hated fussers and fidgets but at last their boss sniffed glanced down at the floor from beneath bushy black eyebrows ground his shoe into the carpet to and fro until the smouldering patch was extinguished beyond the screen preparations of a sort had been in progress in the western world it might be said that a man had been psyching himself up his method had been simplestartlingly simple in the light of what was about to occur he had cleansed himself he had stripped naked and bathed minutely and laboriously soaping and scrubbing every square inch of his body he iliad shaved himself removing all surface hair from his person with the exception of the closecropped hair of his head he had defecated before and after his bath on the second occasion doubly ensuring his cleanliness by washing his parts again in hot water and towelling himself dry and then still completely naked he had rested his method of resting would have seemed macabre in he extreme to anyone not in the know but it was all part of the preparations he had gone to sit beside the second occupant of the room where he lay upon a not quite i horizontal table or trolley with a fluted aluminium surface i and had lain his head on his folded arms where he rested them upon the others abdomen then he had closed his eyes and apparently had slept for some fifteen minutes there was nothing erotic in it nothing remotely homosexual the man on the trolley was also naked much older than the first flabby wrinkled and bald but for a fringe of grey hair at his temples he was also very dead but even in death his pallid puffy face thin mouth and dense grey inwardslanting eyebrows were cruel all of this the three on the other side of the screen had watched and all had been accomplished with a sort of clinical detachment and with no outward indication of awareness from the performer that they were there at all he had simply forgotten their presence his work was allengrossing too important to admit of outside agencies or interferences but now he stirred lifted his head blinked his eyes twice and slowly stood up all was now in order the inquiry could commence the three watchers leaned forward a little in their armchairs automatically controlled their breathing centred all their attention on the naked man it was as if they feared to disturb something and this despite the fact that their observation cell was completely insulated soundproof as a vacuum now the naked man turned the trolley carrying the corpse until its lower end where the claycold feet projected a little way and made a v overhung the lip of the bath he drew forward a second more conventional trolleytable and opened the leather case which lay upon it displaying scalpels scissors saws a whole range of razorsharp surgical instruments in the observation cell the man in the centre allowed himself a grim smile which his subordinates missed as they eased back fractionally in their chairs satisfied now that they were about to see nothing more spectacular than a rather bizarre autopsy their boss could barely contain the chuckle rising from his chest the tremor of ghoulish amusement welling in his stocky body as he anticipated the shock they had coming to them he had seen all of this before but they had not and this too would serve as a test of sorts now the naked man took up a long chromiumplated rod needle sharp at one end and bedded in a wooden handle at the other and without pause leaned over the corpse placed the point of the needle in the crater of the swollen bellys navel and applied his weight to the handle the rod slid home in dead flesh and the distended gut vented gasses accumulated in the four days since death had occurred hissing up into the naked mans face audio snapped the observer in the middle causing the men flanking him to start in their chairs his gruff voice was so deep in its range as to be little more than a series of glottal gurgles as he continued quickly i want to listen and he waggled a stubby finger at a speaker on the wall gulping audibly the man on his right stood up stepped to the speaker pressed a button marked receive there was momentary static then a clear hiss fading away as the belly of the corpse in the other room slowly settled down in folds of fat but while yet the gas escaped instead of drawing back the naked man lowered his face closed his eyes and inhaled deeply filling his lungs with his eyes glued to the oneway screen fumbling and clumsy the official found his chair again and seated himself heavily his mouth like that of his opposite number had fallen open both men now perched themselves on the front edges of their chairs their backs ramrod straight hands gripping the wooden arm rests a cigarette forgotten toppled into the ashtray on the table to send up fresh streamers of perfumed smoke only the watcher in the middle seemed unmoved and he was as much interested in the expressions on the faces of his subordinates as he was in the weird ritual taking place beyond the screen the naked man had straightened up stood erect again over the deflated corpse he had one hand on the dead mans thigh the other on his chest palms flat down his eyes were open again round as saucers but his colour had visibly changed the normal healthy pink of a young recently scrubbed body had entirely disappeared his grey was uniform with that of the dead flesh he touched he was literally grey as death he held his breath seeming to savoir the very taste of death and his cheeks appeared to be slowly caving in then he snatched back his hands from the corpse expelled foul gas in a whoosh rocked back on his heels for a moment it seemed he must crash over backwards but then he rocked forward again and again with great cure he lowered his hands to the body gaunt and grey as stone he stroked the flesh his fingers trembling as they moved with butterfly lightness from head to toe and back again still there was nothing erotic in it but the lefthand man of the trio of watchers was moved to whisper is he a necrophile what is this comrade general be quiet and learn something the man in the middle growled you know where you are dont you nothing should surprise you here as for what this is what he is you will see soon enough this i will tell you to my knowledge there are only three men like him in all the ussr one is a mongol from the altai region a tribal witchdoctor almost dead of syphilis and useless to us another is hopelessly mad and scheduled for corrective lobotomy following which he too will bebeyond our reach that leaves only this one and his is an instinctive art hard to teach which makes him sui generis thats latin a dead language most appropriate so now shut up you are watching a unique talent now beyond the oneway window the unique talent of the naked man became galvanic as if jerked on the strings of some mad unseen puppetmaster his burst of sudden unexpected motion was so erratic as to be almost spastic his right arm and hand flailed towards his case of instruments almost tumbling it from its table his hand shaped by his spasm into a grey claw swept aloft as if conducting some esoteric concerto but instead of a baton it held a glittering crescentshaped scalpel all three observers were now craning forward eyes huge and mouths agape but while the faces of the two on the outside were fixed in a sort of involuntary rictus of denial prepared to wince or even exclaim at what they now suspected was to come that of their superior was shaped only of knowledge and morbid expectancy with a precision denying the seemingly eccentric or at best random movements of the rest of his limbs which now fluttered and twitched like those of a dead frog electrically coerced into a pseudolife of their own the arm and hand of the naked man swept down and sliced open the corpse from just below the ribcage through the navel and down to the mass of wiry grey pubic hair two more apparently random but absolutely exact slashes following so rapidly as almost to be a part of the first movement and the cadavers belly was marked with a great t with extended top and bottom bars without pause the hideously automatic author of this awful surgery now blindly tossed away his blade across the room dug his hands into the central incision up to his wrists and laid back the flaps of the dead mans abdomen like a pair of cupboard doors cold the exposed guts did not smoke no blood flowed as such but when the naked man took away his hands they glistened a dull red as if fresh painted to perform this opening of the body had required an effort of almost herculean strength visible in the sudden bulging of muscles across the naked mans shoulders at the sides of his ribcage and in his upper arms for all the tissues fastening down the protective outer layers of the stomach must be torn at once also it had been done with a fierce snarl clearly audible over the radio link which had drawn back his lips from clenched teeth and caused the sinews of his neck to stand out in sharp relief but now with his subjects viscera entirely exposed again a strange stillness came over him greyer than before if that were at all possible he once more straightened up rocked back on his heels let his red hands fall to his sides and rocking forward again his neutral blue eyes turned down and began a slow minute examination of the corpses innards in the other room the man on the left sat gulping continuously his hands clawing at the arms of his chair his face gleaming with fine perspiration the one on the right had turned the colour of slate shaking from head to toe rapidly panting to compensate for a heart which now raced in his chest but between them exarmy general gregor borowitz now head of the highly secret agency for the development of paranormal espionage was utterly engrossed his leonine head forward his heavily jowled face full of awe as he absorbed each and every detail and nuance of the performance ignoring as best he might the discomfort of his juniors where they flanked him on the rim of his consciousness a thought formed he wondered if the others would be sick and which one would throw up first and where he would throw up on the floor under the table stood a metal waste bin containing a few crumpled scraps of paper and dead cigarette ends without taking his eyes from the oneway screen borowitz reached down lifted the waste bin up between his knees and placed it centrally on the table before him he thought let them fight it out between them in any case and whichever one let the down side his vomiting would doubtless elicit a response in the other as if reading his mind the man on the right panted comrade general i do not think that i be still borowitz lashed out with his foot catching the others ankle watch if you can if you cant then be quiet and let me the naked mans back was bowed now bringing his face to within inches of the corpses exposed organs and entrails left and right his eyes darted up and down as if they sought something hidden there his nostrils were wide sniffing suspiciously his brow hitherto smooth was now furrowed in a fantastic frown he resembled in his attitude nothing so much as a great naked bloodhound intent upon tracking its prey thena sly grin tugged at his grey lips the gleam of revelation of a secret discovered or about to be discovered shone in his eyes it was as if he said yes something is in here something is trying to hide and now he threw back his head and laughed laughed out loud however briefly before returning to a more frantic scrutiny but no it wasnt enough the hidden thing would not be exposed it shrank down out of sight and glee turned to rage on the instant panting furiously his grey face trembling in the grip of unimaginable emotions the naked man snatched up a slim tool whose sharpness shone in mirror brightness in something of an ordered manner at first he commenced to cut out the various organs pipes and bladders but as his work progressed so it grew ever more vicious and indiscriminate until the guts as they were partially or almost wholly detached hung out of the body over the edge of the fluted metal table in grotesque lumpy rags flaps and tatters and still it was not enough still the hunted thing eluded him he gave a shriek which passed through the speaker into the other room like chalk sliding on a blackboard like a shovel grating in cold ashes and grimacing hideously began to hack off the dangling gobbets and hurl them all about he smeared them down his body held them to his ear and listened to them he scattered them wide tossed them over his hunched shoulders hurled them into the bath the sink gore spattered everywhere and again his cry of frustration of weird anguish ripped through the speaker not there not there in the other room the gasping of the man on the right had turned to a wretched choking suddenly he snatched i he waste bin from the table lurched upright and staggered away to a corner of the room borowitz grudgingly gave him credit that he was reasonably quiet about it my god my god the man on the left had started to repeat over and over each repetition louder than the one before and awful awful he is depraved insane a fiend he is brilliant borowitz growled see see now he goes to the heart of the matter beyond the screen the naked man had taken up a surgical saw his arm and hand and the instrument itself were a blur of red grey and silver where he sawed upwards through the centre of the sternum sweat rivered his gorespattered skin dripped from him in a hot rain as he levered at the subjects chest it would not give the blade of the silver hacksaw broke and he threw it down crying like an animal frantic in his movements he lifted his head and scanned the room seeking something his eyes rested briefly on a metal chair widened in inspiration in a moment he had snatched the chair up was using two of its legs as levers in the freshcut channel in a cracking of bones and a tearing of flesh the left side of the corpses chest rose up was forced back a trapdoor in the upper trunk in went the naked mans handsa terrible wrenchingand out they came holding the prize aloftbut only for a moment then holding the heart at arms length in both hands the naked man waltzed it across the room whirled it round and round he hugged it close held it up to his eyes his ears he pressed it to his own chest caressed it sobbed like a baby he sobbed his relief burning tears coursing down his grey cheeks and in another moment all the strength seemed to go out of him his legs trembled became jelly still hugging the heart he crumpled plopped down on the floor curled up into an almost foetal position with the heart lost in the curl of his body he lay still all done said borowitz maybe he stood up crossed to the speaker and pressed a second button marked intercom but before speaking he glanced narroweyed at his subordinates one of them had not moved from his corner where he now sat with his head lolling the waste bin between his legs in another corner the second man was bending from his waist hands on hips up and down up and down exhaling as he went down inhaling as he came erect again the faces of both men were slick with sweat hah borowitz grunted and to the speaker boris boris dragosani can you hear me is all well in the other room the man on the floor jerked stretched lifted his head and stared about then he shuddered and quickly stood up he seemed much more human now less like a deranged automaton though his colour was still grey as lead his bare feet slipped on the slimed floor so that he staggered a little but he quickly regained his balance then he saw the heart still clutched in his hands gave a second great shudder and tossed it away wiping his hands down his thighs he was like someone newly awakened from the turmoil of a nightmarebut he must not be allowed to come awake too rapidly there was something borowitz must know and he must know it now while it was still fresh in the others mind dragosani he said again keeping his voice as soft as possible do you hear me as borowitzs companions finally got themselves under control and came to join him at the large screen so the naked man looked their way for the first time boris dragosani acknowledged the screen which on his side was simply a lightly frosted window composed of many small leaded panes he looked straight at them almost as if he could actually see them in the way a blind man will sometimes look and answered yes i hear you comrade general and you were right he had planned to assassinate you hah good borowitz balled a meaty fist and slammed it into the palm of his left hand how many were in it with him dragosani looked exhausted the greyness was going out of him and already his hands legs and lower body had taken on a more nearly fleshly tint only flesh and blood after all he seemed on the point of collapse it was a small effort to right the steel chair where he had thrown it and to seat himself but it seemed to consume his last dregs of energy placing his elbows on his knees his head in his hands he now sat staring at the floor between his feet well borowitz said into the speaker one other dragosani answered at last without looking up someone close to you i could not read his name borowitz was disappointed is that all yes comrade general dragosani lifted his head looked again at the screen and there was something akin to pleading in his watery blue eyes with a familiarity borowitzs juniors could hardly credit he then said gregor please do not ask it borowitz was silent gregor dragosani said again you have promised me many things borowitz hurriedly cut him off yes and you shall have them many things what little you give i shall repay many times over what small services you perform the ussr shall recognise with overwhelming gratitude however long the recognition is in coming you have plumbed depths deep as space boris dragosani and i know your bravery is greater than that of any cosmonaut science fiction to the contrary there are no monsters where they go but the frontiers you cross are the very haunts of horror i know these things the man in the other room sat up shuddered long and hard the greyness crept back into his limbs his body yes gregor he said for all that dragosani could not see him still borowitz nodded saying then you do understand the naked man sighed hung his head again asked what is it you wish to know borowitz licked his lips leaned closer to the screen said two things the name of the man who plotted with that eviscerated pig in there and proof which i can take before the presidium not only am i in jeopardy without this knowledge but you too yes and the entire branch remember boris dragosani there are those in the kgb who would eviscerate us if only they could find a way the other said nothing but returned to the trolley carrying the remains of the corpse he stood over the violated mess and in his face was written his intent the ultimate violation he breathed deeply expanding hislungs and letting the air out slowly then repeating the procedure and each time his chest seemed to swell just a little larger while his skin rapidly and quite visibly returned to its deep slategrey hue after several minutes of this finally he turned his gaze upon the tray of surgical instruments in its case by now even borowitz was disturbed agitated unnerved he sat down in his central chair seemed to shrink into himself a little you two he growled at his subordinates are you all right you mikhail is there any puke left in you if so stand well away and you andrei are you done now with your bending and ventilating the one on the right opened his mouth but said nothing keeping his wet eyes on the screen his adams apple bobbing the other said let me see the beginning at least but i would prefer not to throw up also when all is done i would be grateful for an explanation you may say what you like of that one in there comrade general but i personally believe he should be put down borowitz nodded you shall have your explanation in good time he rumbled meanwhile i agree with you i too would prefer not to throw up dragosani had taken up what looked like a hollow silver chisel in one hand and a small copperjacketed mallet in the other he placed the chisel in the centre of the corpses forehead brought the mallet sharply down and drove the chisel home as the mallet bounced following the blow so a little brain fluid was vented through the chisels hollow stem that was enough for mikhail he gulped once then returned to his corner and stood there trembling his face averted the man called andrei remained where he was stood there as if frozen but borowitz noted how he clenched and unclenched his fists where they hung at his sides now dragosani stood back from the corpse crouched down stared fixedly at the chisel where it stood up from the pierced cranium he nodded slowly then sprang erect and stepped to the table with the case of instruments dropping the mallet on to the tough floor tiles he snatched up a slender steel straw and dropped it expertly with hardly a glance into the chisels cavity the fine steel tube sank slowly pneumatically down through the body of the chisel until just its mouthpiece projected mouthpiece andrei suddenly croaked turning away and stumbling blindly across the floor of the observation cell my god my god the mouthpiece borowitz closed his eyes tough as he was he could not watch he had seen it all before and remembered it only too well moments passed mikhail in his corner trembling andrei across the room his back to the screen and their superior with his eyes tightly shut squeezed down in his chair then the scream that came over the speaker was one to shatter the strongest nerves indeed a scream to raise the dead it was full of horror full of monstrous knowledge full ofoutrage yes outrage the cry of a wounded carnivore a vengeful beast and hot on its heels chaos as the scream subsided borowitzs eyes shot open his heavy eyebrows forming a peaked tent over them for an instant he sat there a startled owl nerves jumping fingers clawing at the arms of his chair then he gave a hoarse shout threw up an arm before his face hurled his heavy body backward his chair crashed over allowing him to roll clear protected by the chair to the left as the screen caved inward in a shower of glass and small buckling strips of lead a large hole had appeared in the screen with the legs of the steel chair from the other room protruding halfway through the chair was snatched back out of sight and again driven forward smashing out the rest of the small panes and sending fragments of glass flying everywhere swine dragosanis shriek came from both the speaker and the shattered screen oh you swine gregor borowitz you poisoned him an agent to rot his brain and now you bastard now i have tasted that same poison from behind the outraged hatefilled voice came dragosani himself to stand outlined for a moment in a frame of jagged dangling glass teeth before hurling himself across the table and tumbled chairs at borowitz where he floundered on the floor in his hand something glittered silver against the grey of his flesh no borowitz boomed his bullfrog voice loud with terror in the confines of the small room no boris youre mistaken youre not poisoned man liar i read it in his dead brain i felt his pain as he died and now that stuff is in me dragosani leapt on to borowitz where he fought to struggle to his feet bore him down again raised high the sickle shape of silver in his clenched fist the man called mikhail had been flapping in the background like a windtorn scarecrow but now he came forward his hand reaching inside his overcoat he caught dragosanis wrist just as it commenced its downward sweep expert with a cosh mikhail applied it at precisely the correct point just hard enough to stun the bright steel flew from dragosanis nerveless fingers and he fell face down across borowitz who managed to roll half out of the way then mikhail was helping the older man to his feet while borowitz cursed and raved kicking once or twice at the naked man where he lay groaning up on his feet he pushed his junior away and began to dust himself down but in the next moment he saw the cosh in mikhails hand and understood what had happened his eyes flew open in shock and sudden anxiety what he said his mouth falling open you struck him you used that on him fool but comrade borowitz general he borowitz cut him off with a snarl pushed with both hands at mikhails chest and sent him staggering dolt idiot pray he is unharmed if theres any god you believe in just pray you havent permanently damaged this man didnt i tell you hes unique he went down on one knee grunting as he turned the stunned man over on to his back colour was returning to dragosanis face the normal colour of a man but a large lump was growing where the back of his skull met his neck his eyelids fluttered as borowitz anxiously scanned his face lights the old general snapped then lets have them up full andrei dont just stand there like he paused stared about the room as mikhail turned up the lights andrei was not to be seen and the door of the room stood ajar cowardly dog borowitz growled perhaps he has gone for help mikhail gulped and continued comrade general if i had not hit dragosani he would have i know i know borowitz growled impatiently never mind that now help me get him into a chair as they lifted dragosani up and lowered him into a chair he shook his head groaned loudly and opened his eyes they focused on borowitzs face narrowing in accusation you he hissed trying to straighten up but failing take it easy said borowitz and dont be a fool if youre not poisoned man do you think i would so readily dispose of my most valuable asset but he was poisoned dragosani rasped only four days ago it burned his brain out and he died in agony thinking his head was melting and now the same stuff is tin me i need to be sick quickly i have to be sick he struggled frantically to get up borowitz nodded held him down with a heavy hand grinned like a siberian wolf he brushed back his central streak of jetblack hair and said yes that is how he died but not you boris not you the poison was something special a bulgarian brew it acts rapidlyand disperses just as rapidly it voids itself in a few hours leaves no trace becomes undetectable like a dagger of ice it strikes then melts away mikhail was staring gaping like a man who hears something he cant believe what is this he asked how can he possibly know that we poisoned the second in command of the be quiet again borowitz rounded on him that loose tongue of yours will choke you yet mikhail gerkhov but man are you blind have you learned nothing the other shrugged fell silent it was all beyond him completely over his head he had seen many strange things since hed been transferred into the branch three years ago seen and heard things he would never have believed possible but this was so far removed from anything else hed experienced that it defied reason borowitz had turned back to dragosani had clasped his neck where it joined his shoulder the naked man was merely pale now neither leaden grey nor fleshy pink but pale he shivered as borowitz asked him boris did you get his name think now for its very important his name dragosani looked up looked sick you said he was close to me the man who plotted my assassination with that gutted dog in there who is he boris who dragosani nodded narrowed his eyes said close to you yes his name isustinov wha borowitz straightened up realisation dawning ustinov mikhail gerkhov gasped andrei ustinov is that possible very possible said a familiar voice from the doorway ustinov stepped through it his thin face lined and drawn a submachinegun cradled in his arms he directed the weapons muzzle ahead of him carelessly aimed it at the other three definitely possible but why said borowitz but isnt that obvious comrade general wouldnt any man whod been with you as long as i have want to see you dead too many long years gregor ive suffered your tantrums and rages all your petty little intrigues and stupid bullying yes and i served you loyally until now but you never liked me never let me in on anything what have i been what am i even now but a cipher of j yourself a despised appendage well youll be pleased to note that i am after all an apt pupil but your deputy no i was never that and i should step aside for this upstart he nodded sneeringly towards gerkhov borowitzs face clearly showed his disgust and you were the one i would have chosen he snorted hah no fool like an old fool dragosani groaned and lifted a hand to his head he made as if to stand fell out of the chair on to his knees sprawled face down on the glasslittered floor borowitz made to kneel beside him stay where you are ustinov snapped you cant help him now hes a dead man youre all dead men youll never carry it off borowitz said but the colour was draining from his face and his voice was little more than a dry rustle of course i will ustinov sneered in all this mayhem this madness oh ill tell a good tale be sure of you a raving lunatic and of the worse than crazy people you employ and who will there be to say any different he stepped forward the ugly weapon in his hands making a harsh chching as he cocked it on the floor at his feet boris dragosani was not unconscious his collapse had simply been a ploy to put him within reach of a weapon now his fingers closed on the bone handle of the small scythelike surgical knife where it had fallen ustinov stepped closer grinned as he quickly reversed his weapon slamming its butt into borowitzs unsuspecting face as the head of esp branch flew backwards blood smearing his crushed mouth so ustinov adjusted his grip on the gun and squeezed the trigger the first burst caught borowitz high on the right shoulder spun him like a top and tossed him down it also lifted gerkhov off his feet drove him across the room and slammed him into the wall he hung there for a second like a man crucified then took a single step forward spat out a stream of blood and fell face down the wall was scarlet where his back had pressed against it borowitz scrambled backwards trailing his right arm along the floor until his shoulders brought up against the wall unable to go any farther he hunched himself up and sat there waiting for it to happen ustinov drew his lips back from his teeth like a great shark before it strikes he aimed at borowitzs belly closing his finger on the trigger at the same time dragosani lunged upward his knife not quite hamstringing ustinov behind his left knee ustinov screamed borowitz too as bullets chewed up the wall just over his head hanging onto ustinovs coat dragosani hauled himself to his knees sliced blindly upward a second time his sickle blade cut through overcoat jacket shirt and flesh it carved ustinovs upper right arm to the bone and his useless fingers dropped the gun almost as a reflex action he kneed dragosani in the face gasping his pain and terror knowing he was badly cut andrei ustinov traitor hobbled out of the door and slammed it shut another moment saw him pass through a tiny anteroom and out into the corridor there he closed the soundproof door more quietly behind him stepped over the body of the kgb man where it lay with lolling tongue and cavedin skull the killing of this one was unfortunate but it had been necessary cursing and gasping his pain ustinov hobbled down the corridor leaving a trail of blood he had almost reached the door to the courtyard when a sound behind him brought him up short turning he brought out a compact fragmentation grenade from his inside pocket pulled the pin he saw dragosani step out into the corridor stumble over the body sprawled there and go to his knees then as their eyes met he lobbed the grenade after that there was nothing to do but get out of there with the grenades bouncing ringing in his ears and dragosanis hiss of snatched breath he opened the steel door to the courtyard stepped through it and pulled it firmly shut behind him out in the night ustinov mentally ticked off the seconds as he limped towards the two whitecoated attendants at the rear of the ambulance help he croaked im cut badly its dragosani one of our special operatives hes gone mad killed borowitz gerkhov and a kgb man from behind him lending his words definition there came a muffled detonation the steel door gonged as if someone had struck it with a sledgehammer it bowed outward a little and broke a hinge then was sucked back and open to slam against the corridor wall smoke heat and a lick of red flame billowed out all bearing the heavy stench of high explosives quick ustinov shouted over the frantic questioning of the attendants and the yelling of security guards as they came clattering over the cobbles you driver get us away from here at once before the whole place goes up there was little fear of that happening but it would guarantee some action and it would get ustinov out of harms way for the moment anyway the hell of it was that he couldnt be sure any of them back there were dead if they were he would have plenty of time to construct his story if not he was done for only time would tell he flopped into the back of the ambulance as its engine roared into life followed by the attendants who at once began to peel off his outer garments doors flapping the vehicle pulled away across the courtyard passed under a high stone archway and onto a track leading to the perimeter wall keep going ustinov yelled get us away the driver hunched down over the wheel and put his foot down back in the courtyard the security men and the helicopter pilot hopped and skittered on the cobbles coughing in the streamers of acrid smoke from the hanging door the fire what little of it there had been had died in the smoke and now out from behind that dense reeking wall of smoke staggered an ashen nightmare figure dragosani naked still blackstreaked over grey and gorespattered flesh carried a bellowing gregor borowitz draped in a firemans lift across his shoulders what the general shouted between coughs and splutters what wheres that treacherous dog ustinov did you let him get away wheres the ambulance what are you bloody fools doing as the security men lifted borowitz down from dragosanis bowed back one of them breathlessly told him comrade ustinov was wounded sir he went off in the ambulance comrade comrade borowitz howled no comrade that one and wounded you say wounded you arsehole i want him dead he turned his wolfs face up to the tower yelled you there do you see the ambulance yes comrade general it approaches the outer wall stop it borowitz screamed clutching at his shattered shoulder but blow it to hell the general raged the marksman in the tower slid his nightsight binoculars into a groove in the butt of the kalashnikov slapped home a mixed clip of tracers and explosive bullets kneeling he picked up the vehicle again in the crosshairs of the nightsights aimed at the cab and bonnet the ambulance was slowing down as it approached one of the archways through the perimeter wall but the marksman knew it would never get there jamming his weapon between his shoulder and the parapet wall he squeezed the trigger and kept it squeezed the hosepipe of fire reached out from the tower fell short of the vehicle by a few yards then jumped the gap and struck the target the front end of the ambulance burst into white fire exploded and hurled blazing petrol in all directions blown off the track turned on its side the vehicle ploughed to a halt in tornup turf someone in white crawled away from it on hands and knees as it burned someone else wearing an open flapping shirt and carrying a dark overcoat cowered back from the flames and limped in the direction of the covered exit unable to see out of the courtyard from where he stood supported by the security men borowitz eagerly shouted up to the tower did you stop it yes sir two men at least are alive one is ambulance crew and i think the other is i know who the other is borowitz screamed hes a traitor to me to the branch to russia cut him down the marksman gulped aimed fired tracers and bullets reached out chewed up the earth at ustinovs heels caught up with him and blew him apart in blazing phosphorus and exploding steel it was the first time the man in the tower had killed now he put down his gun leaned shakily against the balcony wall and called down its done sir in the lull his voice seemed very small very well borowitz shouted back now stay where you are for the moment and keep your eyes open he groaned and clutched at his shoulder again where blood seeped through the material of his overcoat one of the security men said sir youre hurt of course im hurt fool it can wait a little while but for now i want everyone called in i want to speak to them and for the moment none of this is to be reported outside these walls how many bloody kgb men do we have here two sir the same security man told him one in there hes dead growled borowitz uncaring then only one sir out there in the woods the rest of us are branch operatives good butdoes the one in the woods have a radio no sir even better very well bring him in and lock him up for now on my authority right sir and dont let anyone worry borowitz continued all of this is on my shoulders which are very broad as you well know im not trying to hide anything but i want to break it in my own time this could be our chance to get the kgb off our backs once and for all right lets see some action around here you he turned to the helicopter pilot get yourself airborne i need a doctor the branch doctor bring him in at once yes comrade general at once the pilot ran for his machine the security men for their car where it was parked outside the courtyard borowitz watched them go leaned on dragosanis arm and said boris are you good for anything else im still in one piece if thats what you mean the other answered i just had time to shelter in the anteroom before the grenade exploded borowitz grinned wolfishly despite the terrible burning in his shoulder good he said then get back in there and see if you can find a fire extinguisher anything still burning stop it after that you can join me in the lecture room he shook off the naked mans arm swayed for a moment then stood rock steady well what are you waiting for as dragosani ducked back through the ruined door into the corridor where the smoke had almost completely disappeared now borowitz called after him and comrade find yourself some clothes to wear or a blanket at least your work is over for tonight it hardly seems right that boris dragosani necromancer to the kremlin one day anyway should be running about in his birthdaysuit now does it a week later at a special hearing held in camera gregor borowitz defended the action he had taken at the converted chateau bronnitsy on the night in question the hearing was to serve a double purpose one borowitz must be seen to have been called to order over a serious malfunction of the experimental branch under his control two he must now be allowed the opportunity to present his case for complete independence from the rest of the ussrs secret services particularly the kgb in short he would use the hearing as a platform in his bid for complete autonomy the fivestrong panel of judges more properly questioners or investigators was composed of georg krisich of the party central committee oliver bellekhoyza and karl djannov junior cabinet ministers yuri andropov head of the komissia gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti the kgb and one other who was not only an independent observer but in fact leonid brezhnevs personal representative since the party leader would in any case have the last say his nameless but allimportant cipher was the man borowitz must most impress he was also by virtue of his anonymity the one who had least to say the hearing had taken place in a large room on the second floor of a building on kurtsuzov prospekt which made it easy for andropov and brezhnevs man to be there since they both had offices in that block no one had been especially difficult there is an accepted element of risk in all experimental projects though as andropov quietly pointed out one would hope that as well as being accepted the risk might also on occasion be anticipated at which borowitz had smiled and nodded his head in deference while promising himself that one day the bastard would pay for that cold sneering insinuation of inefficiency not to mention his smug and entirely inappropriate air of sly superiority during the hearing it had come out how one of his junior executives andrei ustinov had broken down under the stresses and strains of his work and gone berserk he had killed kgb operative hadj gartezkov had tried to destroy the chateau with explosives had even wounded borowitz himself before being stopped unfortunately in the process of stopping him two others had also lost their lives and a third man had been injured though mercifully none of these had been citizens of any great importance the state would do what it could for their families after the malfunction and until all the facts in the case could be properly substantiated it had been unfortunately necessary to detain a second member of andropovs kgb at the chateau this had been unavoidable with the single exception of a helicopter pilot flying his machine borowitz had allowed no one to leave until all was sorted out even the pilot would have been kept back had the presence of a doctor not been urgently required as for the agents detention in a cell that had been for his own safety until it could be shown that the kgb itself was not ustinovs main target indeed until it was discovered that no target as such existed but that a man had quite simply gone mad and committed mayhem borowitz had considered it his duty to keep the agent safe after all one dead kgb man was surely one too many a sentiment andropov must feel obliged to endorse in short the entire hearing was little more than a reiteration of borowitzs original explanation and report no mention at all was made of the disinterment subsequent evisceration and necromantic examination of a certain senior exmvd official if andropov had known of that then there really would have been a problem but he did not know nor would matters have been improved by the fact that only eight days ago he himself had lain a wreath on that poor unfortunates freshmade grave or the fact that at this very moment the body lay in a second unmarked grave somewhere in the grounds of the chateau bronnitsy as for the rest of it minister djannov had made some indelicate inquiry or other in respect of the work or the purpose of borowitzs branch borowitz had looked astonished if not outraged brezhnevs representative had coughed stepped in and sidetracked the question what is the use after all of a secret branch or organisation once it has been made to divulge its secrets in fact leonid brezhnev had already vetoed any such direct enquiries in respect of esp branch and its activities borowitz had been a sinewy old warhorse and party man all his life not to mention a staunch and powerful supporter of the party leader throughout it had been fairly obvious that andropov was disgruntled he would dearly have loved to bring charges or at least press for a full kgb investigation but had already been forbidden or rather he had been convinced that he should not follow that route but when all was said and done and the others had left the kgb boss asked borowitz to stay back and talk a while gregor he said when they were alone of course you know that nothing of any real importance i mean nothing is ever entirely secret from me unknown or as yet unlearned are not the same as secret and sooner or later i learn everything you do know that ah omniscience borowitz grinned his wolfs grin a heavy load for any one mans shoulders to bear comrade i sympathise with you yuri andropov smiled thinly his eyes deceptively misty and vacant behind the lenses of his spectacles but he made no effort to veil the threat in his voice when he said gregor we all have our futures to consider you of all people should bear that in mind you are not a young man if your pet branch goes down what then are you ready for an early retirement the loss of all your little privileges oddly enough borowitz answered there is that in the nature of my work which has assured my future my foreseeable future anyway oh and incidentally yours too andropovs eyebrows went up oh again his thin smile and what have your astrologers read in my stars gregor well he knows that much at least thought borowitz but it wasnt really surprising any secret police chief worth his salt could get hold of that much and so there seemed little point in denying it elevation to the politburo in two years he said without changing his expression by so much as a wrinkle and possibly in eight or nine more the party leadership really andropovs smile was halfcurious halfsardonic yes really still borowitzs expression had not changed and i tell you it without fear that you in turn will report it to leonid do you indeed answered that most dangerous of men and is there any special reason why i will not tell him oh yes i suppose you could call it the herod principle of course being good party members we dont read the socalled holy book but because i know you for a most intelligent man i also know that you will understand what i mean herod as you will know became a mass murderer rather than suffer the threat of a usurper on his throne even a baby infant you are by no means innocent as a baby yuri and at the same time of course leonid is no petty herod still i dont believe youll tell him what i predict for you after a moments thought andropov shrugged perhaps i wont he said no longer smiling on the other hand said borowitz over his shoulder as he turned and left the room perhaps i would except for one thing one thing what thing is that why that we all have our futures to consider of course and also because i consider myself wiser far than those three foolish wise men and grimacing savagely to himself as he stamped down the corridor toward the stairs suddenly borowitzs wolfs grin returned as he recalled something else his seers had told him about yuri andropov that shortly after attaining premiership he would sicken and die yes within two or three years at most borowitz could only hope it would be soor perhaps he could do better than just hope perhaps he should make preparations of his own starting right now perhaps he should speak to a certain chemist friend in bulgaria a slow poisonundetectablepainlessbringing on a swift deterioration of vital organs certainly it was worth thinking about on the following wednesday evening boris dragosani drove his spartan little russian puddlejumper the twentyodd miles out of the city to gregor borowitzs spacious but rustic dacha in zhukovka as well as being pleasantly situated on a pinecovered hillock overlooking the sluggish moscow river the place was also safe from prying eyes and ears especially the electric sort borowitz would have nothing made of metal in the place with the exception of his metaldetector ostensibly he used this to seek out old coins along the riverbank especially near the ancient fording places but in fact it was for his own security and peace of mind he knew the location of every nail in every log in his dacha the only bugs that could get anywhere near the place were the sort that crawled in the rich soil in borowitzs overgrown garden for all that still the old general took dragosani walking in order to talk to him preferring the outdoors to the everdubious privacy of four walls however well hed checked them over for even here in zhukovka there was a kgb presence indeed a strong one many senior kgb officials a few generals among them had their dachas here not to mention a host of retired staterewarded exagents none of them were friends of borowitz all would be delighted to supply yuri andro with whatever titbits of information they could unearth but at least the branch itself is now rid of them borowitz confided leading the way down a path along the river bank he took dragosani to a place where there were flat stones to sit on where they could watch the sun going down as the evening turned the river to a dark green mirror they made an odd couple the squat old soldier gnarled typically russian all horn and yellow ivory and timetooled leather and the handsome young man almost effete by comparison delicate of features longfingered hands of a concert pianist slim but deceptively strong with shoulders broad as his smile was narrow no apart from a mutual respect they seemed to have very little in common borowitz respected dragosani for his talent he had no doubt but that it was one which could help make russia truly strong again not merely super power strong but invulnerable to any wouldbe invader indestructible to any weapons system invincible in the pursuit of a steady stealthy worldenveloping expansionism oh the latter was already here but dragosani could speed up the process immeasurably borowitzs hopes for the branch were firmly founded it was still espionage yes but it was the other side of the coin from andropovs secret police or rather the edge of the coin espionage but with the emphasis on esp that was why borowitz liked the unlikeable dragosani he would never look right in a darkblue overcoat and fedora but by the same token no kgb man could ever fathom the wells of secrets to which dragosani was privy and of course borowitz had himself discovered the necromancer and brought him into the fold that was another reason he liked him he was his greatest find as for the paler younger man he too had his targets his ambitions what they were he kept to himself kept them locked in that macabre mind but they were certainly not borowitzs visions of russian world dominance and universal empire of a mother russia whose sons could never again be threatened by any nation or nations however strong for one thing dragosani did not consider himself a genuine russian his was a heritage older far than the oppression of communism and the blunt tribes who used its hammer and sickle sigil not only as tools but as a banner and a threat and perhaps that was one of the reasons he liked the equally unlikeable borowitz whose politics were quite unpolitic as for respect there was a measure of that in him for the old warhorse yes but not for ancient heroics on the field of battle or the practised ease with which borowitz could bluff the very sting out of a scorpions tail instead dragosani respected his boss much as a steeplejack respects the higher rungs of his ladder and much like a steeplejack he knew he could never afford to step back and admire his work but why should he when one day the chimney would be built and he could stand at its top and enjoy his triumph from its own unassailable apex meanwhile borowitz could instruct guide his feet up the rungs and dragosani would climb as fast and as high as the ladder could bear his weight or perhaps he respected him as a tightrope walker respects his rope and how then must he watch his step what friction there was between the two sprang mainly from disparate backgrounds upbringing loyalties and lifestyles borowitz was a born and bred muscovite who had been orphaned at four had cut bundles of firewood for a living at seven and had been a soldier from the age of sixteen dragosani had been named for his birthplace on the oltul river where it flowed down from the carpatti meridionali towards the danube and the border with bulgaria in the old days that had been wallachia with hungary to the north and serbia and bosnia to the west and that was how he saw himself as a wallach or as a romanian at the very least and as a historian and patriot he knew that his homelands history had been long and very bloody trace wallachias history and what does one find that it has been bartered annexed stolen retaken and stolen again raked over and ravished and ruined but that always it has sprung back into a being of its own the country was a phoenix its very soil was alive dark with blood given strength by blood yes the strength of the people had been in the land and that of the land in its people it was a land they could fight for which by its nature could almost fight for itself any set of historical maps would show why this was so in those old days before the aeroplane and the tank ringed about by mountains and marshes with the black sea on the eastern flank bog lands to the west and the danube in the south the region had been almost completely insular safe as a fortress and so through his pride in his heritage dragosani was first a wallach second a romanian but hardly a russian at all what were they after all gregor borowitz included but the settled spume of wave after wave of invaders sons of huns and goths slavs and franks mongols and turks of course thered be the blood of those dogs in boris dragosani too but mostly he was a wallach he could only liken himself to the older man in the one respect that they had both been orphans of sorts but even in that area the circumstances were very different borowitz had at least had parents of his own as a baby he had known them even though they were now long forgotten but dragosanihe had been a foundling found on a doorstep in a romanian village little more than a day old and brought up and educated by a rich farmer and landowner that had been his lot and not a bad one overall well boris said borowitz drawing his protйgй back from his musing and what do you think of that eh of what huh the older man snorted look i know this place is very restful and that im a boring old fart at best but for goodness sake dont go to sleep on me what do you think of the branch being free at last of the kgb is it really yes really borowitz rubbed his blunt hands together in satisfaction until they almost rustled were purged you might say we were only obliged to suffer them in the first place because andropov likes to have a finger in every pie well this pies no longer to his taste it has all worked out very well how did you do it borowitz shrugged almost as if to play down his own role in the affair which in itself gave dragosani to know that the exact opposite was the truth oh a little of this a little of that should i say that i put my job on the line that i put the branch itself on the line i gambled if you like except that i knew i couldnt lose then it wasnt a gamble said dragosani what exactly did you do borowitz chuckled boris you know how i hate being exact but yes ill tell you i went to see brezhnev before the hearing and i told him how things were going to be hah it was dragosanis turn to snort you told him you told leonid brezhnev party leader how things were going to be what things borowitz smiled his wolfs smile future things he said things which are not yet i told him his political billing and cooing with nixon would take him from strength to strength but that he should prepare for nixons fall three years from now when it will be shown to the world that he is corrupt i told him that when that is over he will be in a position of some advantage dealing with a bumbler in the white house i told him that in preparation for american hardliners yet to come next year he will sign an agreement permitting sputniks to photograph missile sites in the usa and vice versa that he should do it while he still had the chance and while america is ahead in the space race dйtente again you see hes keen on it hes similarly keen that they shouldnt get too far ahead in that race and so i promised him a joint space venture which will come in as for a whole crowd of jews and dissidents whove been giving him problems i told him wed be rid of a great many of them possibly as many as in the next three or four years oh dont look so shocked or disgusted or whatever emotion that expression of yours is supposed to signify boris were not barbarians my young friend im not talking extermination or siberia or prefrontal lobotomy but eviction emigration kicking or allowing them to drag their arses out of here oh yes all of these things i told him and more and i guaranteed them strictly between leonid and myself you understand if only hed let me do my job and get the kgb right off my back what were these starchfaced policemen anyway but spies for their boss and why should they spy on me loyal as any man and a damn sight more than most but over and above everything else how could i hope to maintain any sort of secrecy absolutely necessary in an organisation such as ours with members of another branch peering over my shoulder and reporting back to their master everything i was doing who couldnt possibly understand anything i was doing they would only laugh deride what they could not hope to fathom blow any last vestige of secrecy sky high and yet again our foreign adversaries would forge ahead for make no mistake boris the americans and the british yes and the french and the chinese too they also have their mindspies but give me four years leonid i said four years free of yuri andropovs monkeys and i will give you the sprouting germ of an espionage network whose incredible potential you cannot possibly imagine strong stuff dragosani was suitably impressed and his reply he said gregor old friend old warhorse old comradeall right you shall have your four years and i shall sit and wait and see to it that your bills are paid and keep you and your branch in funds enough to run your volgas and drink your vodka and i shall watch all of these things youve promised or predicted come to pass which will make me very grateful to you and if in four years they have not come to pass then i shall have your balls and so youve put your faith in vladys predictions said dragosani nodding are you so sure then that this seer of ours is infallible oh yes answered borowitz hes almost as good at predicting the future as you are at sniffing out the secrets of the dead huh this time dragosani was not impressed and why then didnt he predict that mess at the chateau surely he could have foreseen a disaster of that magnitude but he did predict it answered borowitz in a roundabout way two weeks ago he told me i would shortly lose both my right and lefthand men and i did he also said i would appoint others but this time from the rank and file as it were dragosani couldnt conceal his interest you have someone in mind borowitz nodded you he answered and perhaps igor vlady himself i want no rival said dragosani at once rivalry does not come into it your talents are diverse he does not profess to be a necromancer you cannot read the future the reason there must be two of you is to ensure continuity if anything should happen to either one of you yes and we had two predecessors dragosani growled what were their talents and did they also start out without rivalry borowitz sighed in the beginning he patiently began to explain when i was first pulling the branch together i was short of actual effective talent in the ranks my first troop of agents espers were untried those with real talent like vlady who ive had from the beginning and who improves all the time and more recently like yourself were too important to tie down with routine administration ustinov also with us from the start but purely as an administrator and later gerkhov fitted their positions precisely they had no esptalent whatsoever but both seemed to have open minds difficult to find in russia these days not that can stay on the right side o the political fence at the same time and i had hopes that at least one of them would become as deeply interested and involved with our work as i am when jealousy intervened and they became rivals i decided to let them weed themselves out without intervention natural selection you might say but you and vlady are different kettles of fish entirely i will not permit rivalry between you put it out of your mind nevertheless dragosani insisted when you are gone one of us will have to take the reins i do not intend to go anywhere said borowitz not for a very long time by thenwe shall see what we shall see he fell silent musing chin in hands watching the rivers slow swirl why did ustinov turn on you the younger man finally asked why not simply get rid of gerkhov surely that were easier less risky there were two reason why he couldnt just remove his rival said borowitz first he had been suborned by an old enemy of mine the man you examined who id suspected for some time of plotting my removal we actually hated each other me and this old mvd torturer it was unavoidable he would kill me or i him because of this i had vlady watch him concentrate on him read him in his immediate future he read treachery and death the treachery would be directed against me the death would be mine or his a pity igor isnt more specific anyway i arranged for it to be his second killing gerkhov however skilfully however carefully avoiding his own involvement in the actual accidental death would not remove the problem at its root it would be like cutting down a weed in time it would only spring up again doubtless i would elevate someone else to the post probably an esper and what hope would there be for poor ustinov then that was his only real problem ambition anyway i am a survivor as you see i used vlady to foresee what that old pig of a bolshevik arsekicker had in store for me and got him before he could get me and i used you to read his dead guts and see who else was involved alas it was andrei ustinov i had thought perhaps andropov and his kgb might be in on it too they like me about as much as i like them but they were not involved im glad about that for they dont give in very easily but what a world of petty feuding and vendettas we live in eh boris why its only two years ago that leonid brezhnev himself was fired upon at the very kremlin gates dragosani had been looking thoughtful tell me something he finally said when it was all over that night at the chateau i mean was that why you asked me if it was possible for me to read ustinovs corpse or rather the mess that was left of him because you thought he might have been got at by the newer kgb as well as your retired old chum from the mvd something like that borowitz shrugged but it doesnt matter now no for if theyd been involved at all it would have come out at the hearing our friend yuri andropov would not have been so much at ease id have been able to see it in him as it was he was just a bit pissed off that leonid has seen fit to haul in his leash a bit which means hell really be after your blood now no i dont think so not for four years anyway and if hen it is shown that im correct that is when brezhnev realises vladys predictions and so has proof positive of the effectiveness of the branch not then either so with a bit of luck were free of that pack for good hmm well lets hope so so it would seem youve been very clever general but i knew that anyway now tell me what other reasons did you have for calling me here today well ive more to tell you other things in the pot you know but we can do that over dinner natasha is serving fish fresh from the river trout strictly forbidden they taste all the better for it he got up began to lead the way back up the river bank also to advise you that you should now sell that box on wheels and get yourself a decent car a secondhand volga i should think nothing newer than mine anyway it goes with your promotion you can try it out when you go on holiday holiday it was all coming thick and fast now oh yes hadnt i told you three weeks at least on the state im fortifying the chateau it will be quite impossible to get any branch work done youre doing what did you say youre fortifying the place yes borowitz was very matter of fact about it machinegun emplacements an electric fence that sort of thing they have it at baikonur in kazakhstan where they launch the space vehicles and is our work any less important anyway the work has been approved starts friday were our own bosses now you know within certain limitationsinside the chateau anyway when im finished well all have passes for access and no way in without them but thats for later meanwhile therell be a lot of work going on much of which ill supervise personally i want the place expanded opened up widened out more room for experimental cells ive got four years yes but theyll go very quickly first stage of the alterations will take the best part of a month so so while all this is going on im to get a holiday dragosani was keen now the tone of his voice eager right you and one or two others for you its a reward you were very good that night with the exception of this hole in my shoulder the whole thing was very successful and also the loss of poor gerkhov of course my one regret is that i had to ask you to take it all the way i know how hateful that must be for you do you mind if we dont talk about it dragosani found borowitzs sudden concern for his sensibilities a bit much not to mention entirely out of character all right we wont talk about it said the other but halfturning and with a monstrous grin he added anyway fish tastes better that was more like it you sadistic old bastard borowitz laughed out loud thats what i like about you boris youre just like me very disrespectful to your superiors he changed the subject anyway where will you spend your holiday home said the other without hesitation romania of course back to dragosani where i was born dont you ever go anywhere else why should i i know the place and i love the people as much as its possible for me to love anything anyway dragosani is a town now but ill find a place outside the town somewhere in the villages in the hills it must be very pleasant borowitz nodded is there a girl no what then dragosani grunted shrugged but his eyes narrowed to slits walking in front his boss didnt see the look in his face when he answered i dont know something in the soil i suppose chapter two harry keogh felt the warm sun on the side of his face beating through the open classroom window he knew the solid nearindestructible feel of a school bench under his thighs its surface polished by tens of thousands of bottoms he was aware of the aggressive hum of a tiny wasp on its tour of inspection of his inkwell ruler pencils the dahlias in a vase on the window ledge but all of these things lay on the periphery of his consciousness little more than background static he was aware of them in the same way that he was aware of his heart hammering in his chest hammering far too quickly and loudly for an arithmetic class on a sunny tuesday afternoon in august the real world was there all right real as the occasional breath of breeze fanning his cheek from the open window and yet harry craved air no less than a drowning man or a drowning woman and the sun could not warm him where he struggled under the ice and the wasps buzzing was almost entirely lost in the gurgle and slosh of icy water and the burble of bubbles from his nostrils and straining silently screaming jaws darkness below frozen mud and weeds and above a sheet of ice inches thick and somewhere a hole the hole he had fallen through but where fight the rivers rush kick against it and swim swim think of harry little harry you have to live for him for his sake for harry there there thank god for the hole oh thank god clawing at the rim the edges of ice sharp as glass and heavensent hands coming down into the water seeming to move oh so slowly almost in slow motion dreadfully monstrously languid strong hands hairy a ring on the second finger of the right hand a catseye stone set in thick gold a mans ring looking up a face all aswim seen through the chop of wavelets and the liquid flurry of water and through the ice his frosty outline kneeling at the rim grasp his hands those strong hands and hell lift you out like a baby and hell shake you till youre dry for frightening him fight the current grasp at the hands kick against the rivers rush fight fight fight for harry there youve got the hands grip tight hold on try to lift your head up through the hole and breathe breathe butthe hands are pushing you down seen through the water the face wobbles shifting and changing the trembly jelly lips turn up at their corners they smile or grimace you hang on you scream and water rushes in to replace the escaping air cling to the ice forget the hands the cruel hands that continue to hold you down just grab at the rim and lift your head but the hands are there breaking your grip they thrust you away under the ice they murder you you cant fight the cold and the river and the hands blackness is roaring down on you in your lungs in your head in your eyes stick your long fingernails into the hands claw at them tear the flesh from them the gold ring comes loose spirals down into the murk and mud blood turns the water red red against the ultimate black of your dying blood from the cruel cruel hands no fight left in you waterlogged you sink the current drags you along the bottom tumbling you but you no longer care exceptyou care for harry poor little harry wholl care for him now wholl look after harryharryharry harry harry keogh christ boy are you here at all harry felt the elbow of his pal jimmy collins digging him covertly however sharply in the ribs causing him to draw air explosively he heard mr hannants rasping voice crashing in on his eardrums above the receding tumult of water he jerked upright on his bench gulped again at the air thrust his hand up foolishly as if in response to some question or other it was an automatic reaction if you were quick off the mark the teacher knew you knew the answer and hed ask someone else exceptsometimes it didnt work out that way teachers didnt always fall for it and hannant the maths teacher he was nobodys fool gone now the sensation of drowning gone utterly the bitter cold of the water the pitiless torture of thrusting brutally inhuman hands gone the entire nightmare or more properly the daydream by comparison the newer situation was a mere trifle or was it harry was suddenly aware of a classroom full of eyes all staring at him aware too of mr hannants purple outraged face glaring at him from out in front of the class what had they been dealing with he glanced at the blackboard oh yes formulae areas and properties of circles the constant factor diameters and radii and pi pi that was a laugh it was all pi to harry pie in the sky but what had been hannants question had he even asked a question whitefaced now harry peered about the classroom his was the only hand in the air slowly he drew it down beside him jimmy collins sniggered coughing and spluttering to hide it normally that would have been sufficient to set harry off too but with the memory of the night or daymare so fresh in his mind he had little difficulty staving it off well hannant demanded sir harry queried er could you repeat the question hannant sighed closed his eyes rested his great knuckles on his desk and leaned his stocky body on his straight arms he counted ten under his breath but loud enough for the class to hear him finally without reopening his eyes he said the question was are you here at all me sir god yes harry keogh yes you why yes sir harry tried not to act too innocent it looked like he might get away with it or would he but there was this wasp sir and my other question hannant cut him short my first question the one that made me suspect perhaps you werent with us was this what is the relationship between the diameter of a circle and pi i take it thats the one you wanted to answer the one you had your hand up for or were you swatting flies harry felt a flush riding up his neck pi diameter circle the class grew fidgety someone sniffed disgustedly probably the bully stanley green the pushy bigheaded swotty slob the trouble with stanley was that he was clever and bigwhat was the question again but what difference did it make without the answer jimmy collins looked down at his desk ostensibly at a work book there and whispered out of the corner of his mouth three times three times what did that mean well hannant knew he had him er three times harry blurted praying that jimmy wasnt having him on sir the maths teacher sucked in air straightened up he snorted frowned seemed a little puzzled but then he said no but it was a good try as far as it goes not three times but three point one four one five nine times ah but times what the diameter jimmy whispered equals circumference ddiameter harry stuttered equals er circumference george hannant stared hard at harry he saw a boy thirteen years old sandy haired freckled in a crumpled school uniform untidy shirt school tie like a piece of chewed string askew its end fraying and prescription spectacles balanced on a stub of a nose behind which dreamy blue eyes gazed out in a sort of perpetual apprehension pitiful no not that harry keogh could take his lumps and dish them out when his dander was up buta difficult kid to get through to hannant suspected there was a pretty good brain in there somewhere behind that haunted face if only it could be prodded into life stir him out of himself maybe a short sharp shock give him something to think about in this world instead of that other place he kept slipping off into maybe harry keogh im not altogether sure that answer was yours in its entirety collins is sitting too close to you and looking too disinterested for my liking soat the end of this chapter in your book youll find ten questions three of em concern themselves with surface areas of circles and cylinders i want the answers to those three here on my desk first thing tomorrow morning right harry hung his head and bit his lip yes sir so look at me look at me boy harry looked up and now he did look pitiful but no good going back now harry hannant sighed youre a mess ive spoken to the other masters and its not just maths but everything if you dont wake up son youll be leaving school without a single qualification oh theres time yet if thats what youre thinking a couple of years anyway but only if you get down to it right now the homework isnt punishment harry its my way of trying to point you in the right direction he looked towards the back of the class to where stanley green was still sniggering and hiding his face behind a hand that scratched his forehead as for you green for you it is punishment you obnoxious wart you can do the other seven the rest of the class tried hard not to show its approval dared not for big stanley would surely make them pay for it if they did but hannant saw it anyway that was good he didnt mind being seen as a sod but far better to be a sod with a sense of justice but sir green started to his feet his voice already beginning to rise in protest shut up hannant told him sharply and sit down and then as the bully subsided with a loud huh right whats next he glanced at the afternoons programme under the glass on top of his desk oh yes stone collecting on the beach good a bit of fresh air might wake you all up very well start packing up then you can go but in an orderly manner but before they could commence their metamorphosis into a pencilclattering deskslamming floorshaking horde wait you may as well leave your things here the monitor takes the key and opens up again after youve brought your stones back from the beach when youve picked up your things then hell lock up again who is the monitor this week sir jimmy collins stuck up his hand oh said hannant raising thick eyebrows but not at all surprised really going up in the world are we jimmy collins scored the winning goal against blackhills on saturday sir said jimmy with pride hannant smiled if only to himself oh yes that would do it jamieson the headmaster was a fool for football indeed for all sports a healthy mind needs a healthy bodystill he was a good head the boys were exiting now green elbowing his way through the crush looking surlier than ever with keogh and collins bringing up the rear the two of them for all their differences inseparable as siamese twins and as hed known they would they stood at the door waiting well hannant asked waiting for you sir said collins so i can lock up oh is that so hannant aped the boys breeziness and well just leave all the windows open will we as the two came tumbling back into the classroom he grinned packed his briefcase did up the top button of his shirt and straightened his tie and still got out into the corridor before they were through then collins turned the key in the lock and they were off brushing past him careful not to touch him as if fearing theyd catch something dashing after the others in a clatter of flying feet maths hannant thought watching them out of sight along the shining corridor slicing through the square beams of dusty sunlight from the windows what the hells maths star trek on the telly and a stack of brand new marvel comics in the newsagents and i expect them to study numbers god and just wait another year or so till they start to notice those funny lumps on girls as if they havent already and again maths hopeless he grinned however ruefully lord how he envied them harden modern boys was a secondary modern school on englands northeast coast catering to the budding minds of the collierys young men that did not mean a great deal most of the boys would become miners or employees of the coal board anyway like their fathers and older brothers before them but some a small percentage would go on through the medium of examinations to higher education at academic and technical colleges in neighbouring towns originally a cluster of twostorey coal board offices the school had been given a facelift some thirty years earlier when the villages population had suddenly grown to accommodate greatly expanded mining operations now standing behind low walls just a mile from the shore to the east and half that distance from the mine itself to the north the plain old bricks of the place and the square windows seemed to lend it an air of frowning austerity out of keeping with its prosperous selfhelp gardens a cold severity not at all reflected in its staff no for all in all they were a good hardworking bunch and headmaster howard jamieson ba a staunch survivor of the old school saw to it that they stayed that way the weekly stonegathering expedition served three purposes one it got all the kids out in the fresh air allowing those teachers with a predilection for naturerambling a rare chance to turn the minds of their wards towards natures wonders two it provided gratis much of the raw material for garden walls within the grounds of the school gradually replacing the old fences and trellises a project which naturally bore the heads stamp of approval three it meant that once a month threequarters of the masters could get away from school early leaving their charges in the care of the dedicated ramblers the idea was this that all the pupils employ tuesdays last period to walk a mile down leafy country lanes to the beach there to collect up large flat rounded stones of which there were plenty and to carry them back one per pupil to the school and as stated along the way one male teacher and two of the schools younger unattached female teachers would extol the glories of the hedgerows the wonders of the wild flowers and the countryside in general none of which was of any real interest to harry keogh but he did like the beach and anything was better than a classroom on a warm droning afternoon here said jimmy collins to harry as they strolled two abreast midway in a long line of kids down through the paths of the dene winding to the sea you really ought to pay attention to old hannant you know i mean not about all that needing qualifications stuff thats up to you but during lessons generally hes not a bad un old george but he could be if he decided you were just taking the mickey harry shrugged dejectedly i was daydreaming he said actually its sort of funny see when i daydream like that its like i cant stop only old hannant shouting and you giving me a jab pulled me out of it pulled me outthe strong hands reaching down into the waterto pull me out or push me under jimmy nodded ive seen you like it before lots of times your face goes sort of funny he looked serious for a moment then chuckled and gave harry a playful thump on the shoulder not that thats a big deal your face is funny all the time harry snorted listen whos talking me funnylooking id play kirk to your spock any time anyway what do you mean i mean how do i look you know funny well you just sit very still all staryeyed scaredlooking but not always sometimes you look a bit dreamy like anyway its like old george said you just dont seem to be here at all actually youre very weird i mean its true isnt it how many friends have you got ive got you harry feebly protested he knew what jimmy meant he was too deep too quiet but not studious not a swot if hed been good at lessons that would perhaps explain it but he wasnt oh he was clever enough if he wanted to concentrate on it it was just that he found concentration very hard it was as if sometimes the thoughts he thought werent really his at all complicated thoughts and daydreams fancies and phantasms his mind made up stories for him whether he wanted it to or not but stories so detailed they were like memories the memories of other people people who werent here any more as if his head was an echochamber for minds which hadgone somewhere else yes youve got me for a friend jimmy interrupted his train of thought and who else harry shrugged went on the defensive theres brenda he said andand anyway who needs lot of friends i dont if people want to be friendly theyll be friendly if they dont well thats up to them jimmy ignored the mention of brenda cowell harrys grande passion who lived in the same street he was into sport not girls hed hang himself from a goalpost before hed be caught with his arm round a girl in the cinema when the lights went up youve got mer he said and thats it as for why i like you just dunno because we dont compete said harry shrewder than his years i dont understand sport so you enjoy explaining it to me cos you know i wont argue and you dont understand me being so well quiet and weird jimmy interrupted and so we get along but wouldnt you like more friends harry sighed well see its like i have friends up in my head imaginary friends jimmy scoffed but not unkindly no theyre more than that harry answered arid theyre good friends too of course they areim the only friend theyve got huh jimmy snorted oh youre weird all right way up at the head of the column sergeant graham lane came out of the woods into bright sunlight pausing to hasten on the double rank of kids behind him this was the narrow mouth of the dene also the mouth of the stream which had cut its gulley through the sea cliffs to north and south those cliffs now rose mainly of sandstone but layered with belts of shale and shingle and banded with rounded stones and here the stream passed under an old rickety wooden bridge beyond lay a reedy weedy marsh or lake of brackish water only ever replenished by high tides or storms a path skirted the boggy area towards the sandy beach and beyond that there lay the grey north sea growing greyer every day with debris from the pits but today it was blue in the bright sunlight flecked white here and there by the spray of diving gulls where they fished right lane called loudly standing arms akimbo and very much the man in his tracksuit bottoms and tshirt on the nearside of the bridge off you go over the bridge round the lake and on to the beach find your stones and bring em back to me er no to miss gower for grading weve a good half hour so anyone who fancies can have a quick dip as soon as hes found his stone if youve got your costumes with you but no nude bathing if you please remember there are other people on the beach and stick to the pools left by the sea you all know what the currents like just here you young buggers they knew all right the current was treacherous especially on an ebb tide people were drowned up and down this coast every year strong swimmers too miss gower religious instruction and geography from her position roughly halfway back along the column had heard lanes gravelvoiced paradeground instructions she gave a little grimace oh she understood well enough why she was to grade the stones it was to allow lane and dorothy hartley a bit of freedom so they could have a little ramble along the rocks and find themselves a spot for a quick hump purely physical of course for their minds were totally incompatible miss gower tilted her nose and sniffed loudly and now as the pace of the kids towards the front began to speed up she called out all right boys hurry along and remember this weeks wildlife quest we need some good razorshells for the natural history room whole ones still hinged together if you can find them but please empty ones lets not carry any rotting molluscs back shall we farther back along the path under the trees where the rear was brought up by miss hartley and the monitors of her english and history classes stanley green trudged hands in pockets his clever but vicious mind dark with thoughts of violence he had heard miss gowers memo to the kids no dead shellfish no but hed like to fix it for a dead speccy keogh well maybe not dead but severely mauled it was that dumb kids fault he had those maths problems to work out tonight dumb shit sitting there like a zombie fast asleep with his eyes wide open well big stanley would open his eyes for him sure enough or close them hands out of your pockets stanley pretty miss hartley said from behind him its five months yet to christmas not quite cold enough for snow and why the hunched shoulders is something bothering you no miss he mumbled in answer his head down try to enjoy stanley she told him a little archly youre still very young but if you keep on taking your spite out on the entire world youll get old very very quickly and to herself she added like that frustrated bitch gertrude gower harry keogh was not a natural born voyeur just a curious boy last tuesday down here on the beach hed stumbled on something and he hoped to do so again today that was why after he delivered up his stone to miss gower he checked that no one was watching him and cut away across the dunes and round towards the other side of the reedy marsh it was only a little more than a hundred yards but in half that distance hed already picked up fresh footprints in the sand a mans and a womans and of course hed seen sergeant and miss hartley heading this way as hed suspected they might earlier harry had conveniently forgotten his bathing briefs this had left him free to pursue his own interests for jimmy had subsequently gone off to swim with the rest of the boys what harry was looking for was simple he wanted pointers sitting next to brenda in the cinema and pressing his knee against hers was all very well and even sort of exciting but it seemed pretty tame when compared with the games teachers lane and hartley got up to finally coming over a dune and crouching down he located them sitting on a patch of sand within a semicircle of tall reeds the same spot where hed seen them last week harry backtracked and quickly chose a place at the crest of another dune where he could lie down and peer through a clump of crabgrass last week she had been playing with sergeants thing whose size harry had found extraordinary her sweater had been up and sergeant had had one hand up her skirt while the other fondled and tugged at her firm largenippled breasts when hed come she had taken a handkerchief and delicately soaked up the glistening semen from his belly and chest then shed kissed him on the tip of his thing actually kissed him there and start to put her clothes right while he just lay there like a dead man harry had tried hard to imagine brenda cowell doing that to him but the picture just wouldnt develop in his mind it was too alien this time it was very different this time it was going to be what harry really wanted to see by the time he got himself settled down on his stomach sergeant had his tracksuit bottoms right off and miss hartleys short white pleated tennis skirt up around her waist he was trying to get her knickers off and his thing even bigger than last week if that was at all possible was jerking about on its own like a puppet on some unseen string from beyond the dunes far off down the beach harry could hear the kids shouting and laughing where they swam and splashed in one of the big tidal pools the sun burned the back of his neck and ears where he lay perfectly still his chin in the palms of his hands sand fleas jumped only inches from his face but he allowed nothing to distract him his eyes remained riveted to the sexual activity of the lovers in their reed bower at first she seemed to be fighting sergeant trying to push his hands away but at the same time she unbuttoned her blouse so that her breasts jutted up naked in the sunlight their pointed tips unbelievably brown harry sensed a sort of panic in her reflected in his own suddenly pounding blood it was as if she were hypnotised with sergeants penis a snake where it swayed over her belly mesmerised into lifted her bottom so that her lover could remove her panties and into bending her knees and parting her legs in there she was dark as night as if she wore a smaller pair of black knickers under her white ones black yes and then pink where she put her hands under her thighs to open herself for sergeant harry caught a glimpse of her pink white curving dark brown but that was all climbing between her legs his incredible penis disappearing into her in a moment sergeant allowed no more all that was left were feet and legs and the gym teachers tight buttocks starting to lunge shutting off the view the watching boy gasped felt himself grown hard inside his pants rolled on his side to relieve the throbbing of his genitals and spotted stanley green coming over the dunes scowling his little pig eyes full of venom on the trail of the lovers harry had found a perfect razorshell both valves intact and hinged together now he studiously scraped away sand found the shell slid down the dune holding it carefully in one hand aware that his complexion must be bright red he turned his face away from green pretending not to see him until the youth was almost on top of him after that there was no avoiding it no avoiding a showdown either hello there speccy the bully growled approaching in a halfcrouch his arms spread wide defying harry to run fancy finding you here stead of pissing about with your mate the big football star whatre we doin here then speccy found a pretty shell for miss gower have we whats it to you harry muttered trying to sidestep the other get round him and away green moved closer snatched the double shell out of harrys hand it was a shiny olive colour old brittle as a wafer as he deliberately closed his fist on it so it crumbled into fragments there he said his voice full of an unpleasant satisfaction you goin to tell on me speccy no harry breathlessly answered still trying to dodge past seeing in his minds eye sergeants backside going up and down up and down in the reed hollow not fifteen yards away on the other side of the dune i dont tell on people and i dont bully either bully you green found it funny you couldnt bully a fart out of a frog all youre good fors falling asleep in class and acting like a big tart that and getting people in trouble you got yourself in trouble harry protested giggling like that giggling big stanley caught his arm pulled him close giggling girls giggle speccy you callin me a girl then harry shook himself loose put his fists up trembling in every limb he said piss off greens mouth fell open rude is it he said then he shrugged halfturned as if to go and when harry dropped his guard turned back and caught him a punch at the side of his mouth ow said harry spitting blood from a split lip off balance he stumbled and fell and green was just readying a kick when sergeant lane tucking in his tshirt came storming over the top of the dune scarlet with rage and frustration what the bloody hell he roared he caught the flabbergasted green by the scruff of his neck swung him round aimed his instep accurately at the seat of the bullys pants and letfly green yelped as he flew facedown in the sand up to your usual tricks are you big stanley sergeant shouted and whos your victim this time what skinny harry keogh by god youll be strangling babies next as green scrambled to his feet spitting sand the pt master pushed him in the chest sent him flying again see its not so pleasant stanley when youre up against someone whos bigger and thats how harry feels about it right keogh still holding his mouth harry said i can look after myself big stanley for all that he was a year older than harry and looked older still was on the point of blubbering ill tell my dad he said scrambling away what sergeant laughed hands on his hips as the bully backed off tell your dad that fat beergut who armwrestles for pints with his mates in the black bull well when you do ask him who beat him last night and nearly broke his arm but stanley was off and running you all right keogh lane helped him to his feet yes sir mouths bleeding a bit thats all son you stay away from that one said the master hes a bad lot and hes much too big for you when i called you skinny i didnt mean it it was just to point up the difference in your sizes big stanleys not likely to forget this in a hurry so look out for him yes sir harry said again right then off you go lane made as if to return across the dune but just then miss hartley appeared looking all prim and proper shit harry heard sergeant say under his breath he wanted to grin but was afraid it would split his lip even more so turning his face away he made for where the rest of the boys were gathering around miss gower ready for the return trek it was the second week in august a tuesday evening and it was hot it was funny george hannant thought as he mopped his brow with a handkerchief just how hot it could get on an evening like this youd think it would cool down but instead the heat seemed to close in on you during the day there had been a breeze not much of a breeze but a breeze now there was none it was still as a painting out there all the heat of the day soaked into the earth was coming out now coming at you from all sides hannant mopped again at his brow his neck sipped an iced lemonade knew that that too would soon start to run out of him it was that kind of weather he lived alone not far from the school but on that side of it away from the mine the other side would have been too depressing too oppressive tonight he had papers and books to mark up lessons to plan he didnt feel like doing either one of these things or anything else for that matter he could use a drink butthe pubs would be full of miners in their caps and shirtsleeves their voices coarse and guttural there was a decent film on at the ritz but the sound system was deafening at the front and the courting couples in the back rows invariably annoyed him their sweaty fumblings distracting his attention from the screen and anyway he had that marking to do hannants home a semidetached bungalow on a tiny private estate overlooking the dene and its valley where they narrowed towards the sea was cut off from the school by the broad swath of a cemetery with its old church wellkept plots high perimeter walls he usually walked through the place to school each morning back again in the evening there were benches circling huge gorgeouslyclad horse chestnut trees their leaves already turning in places he could always take his books and papers there actually it wasnt a bad idea the occasional oldtimer a pensionedoff survivor of the colliery would get in there to sit with his dog and stick chewing baccy or drawing on an old pipe and spitting of course rotten lungs were a legacy of the pit rotten lungs and spines like eggshells but apart from the old lads it was usually quiet in there away from the villages centre the pubs and cinema the main road oh when the conkers began to fall thered be kids to contend with of course whats a conker without its child on the end of a length of cord that was a nice thought and hannant smiled at it someone had once said that from a dogs point of view a human was a thing to throw sticks so why shouldnt a horse chestnut have a point of view which might well be that boys were for whirling them on strings and for splitting them wide open one thing seemed certain boys werent for learning maths hannant showered towelled himself slowly methodically dry put on baggy grey flannels and an openneck shirt took up his briefcase and left his home he walked out of the estate into the graveyard and along the broad gravel path which bisected it squirrels played in the high branches of the brandyglassshaped trees shaking loose the occasional leaf the suns rays came slanting down from across the low hills to the west where that great brazen ball seemed permanently suspended as if it never would relinquish the day to night the day had been beautiful the evening despite the heat was incredibly beautiful and both of them would have been quite wasted or if not wasted spent fruitlessly if there was a difference he snorted mirthlessly picturing young johnnie miller in a couple of years time down the pits hewing coal relieving his boredom and passing his shift by calculating surface areas of circles what the hell was the point of it and as for kids like harry keogh poor little sod why he had neither muscles for the mine nor much of a mind for anything else well perhaps a mind but if so a mind like an iceberg only its tip showing as for how much of it lay under the surface who could say hannant only wished he could find a way to capsize the little bugger while there was still timehe had this feeling about keogh that whatever he was going to do or going to be should begin to show in him now like watching a strange seed throw up a shoot and waiting to see what the flower would be but talk of the devilwasnt that keogh there now sitting on an old slab in the shade of a tree his back to the mossy headstone yes it was keogh the sun glinting off his specs where it struck through the hanging foliage had given him away he sat there a book open in his lap sucking on the chewed stem of a pencil his head back lost in thought and jimmy collins nowhere in sight hed be at football practice with the rest of the team up in the recreation ground but keogh he wasnt a member of any sort of team suddenly hannant felt sorry for him sorry orguilty hell no keogh had got away with it for far too long one of these days hed go off like that out of himself and never make it back again and yet hannant sighed let his feet wend him around the plots and between the rows of headstones along illdefined paths to where the boy sat and as he got closer he could see that harry was once again lost in his own thoughts daydreaming away in the cool shade of the tree for some probably irrational reason this made hannant feel angry until he saw that the book in keoghs lap was his maths homework book which made it seem that he was at least attempting to work out his punishment keogh hows it going hannant said seating himself on the same slab this corner of the cemetery wasnt unknown to the maths teacher hed walked here and sat here himself on many many occasions in fact it wasnt that he was the intruder rather that keogh was the oddmanout here but he doubted if the boy knew or would even understand that harry took the pencil out of his mouth looked at hannant unexpectedly smiled hello sirer sorry er sorry hannant had been right the kid just hadnt been there king of the daydreamers the secret life of harry keogh i asked you hannant tried not to growl how it was going oh its all right sir drop the sir harry save that for the classroom out here it makes conversation difficult what about the problems i gave you theyre what i meant by hows it going the homework questions ive done them what here hannant was surprised and yet thinking about it it seemed entirely fitting its quiet here harry answered would you like to show me harry shrugged if you like he passed over the workbook hannant checked it was doubly surprised the work was very neat almost immaculate there were two answers both correct if his memory served him right of course the working would be equally important but he didnt check that just yet wheres the third question harry frowned is that the one with the greasegun where he began but hannant impatiently cut him off lets not piss about harry keogh there are only three questionsout of the ten which could possibly qualify the rest concern themselves with boxes not circles not cylinders or am i being unjust the books a new one to me too give it here harry lowered his head a little bit his lip passed the book over hannant flipped pages the greasegun he said yes this one and he stabbed at the page with a forefinger it showed this diagram the world of the gatejpg the measurements were internal barrel and nozzle were cylindrical full of grease squeezed dry how long would the line of grease be harry looked at it didnt think it qualified he said hannant felt angry two out of three wasnt good enough three wrong answers would almost be better than this crap why dont you just say it was too difficult he tried not to bark ive had all i can take of bluff for one day why not simply admit you cant do it suddenly the boy looked sick his face shone with sweat and his eyes seemed a little glazed through the lenses of his spectacles i can do it he slowly answered then more quickly with acid precision an idiot could do it i didnt think it qualified thats all hannant believed his ears must be deceiving him that hed misunderstood the boys answer what about the formula he rasped not required said the other shit harry its pi times the radius squared times length equals contents thats all you need to know look and he quickly scribbled in the workbook contents of barrel x x x x x contents of nozzle x x x x x he gave harry the pencil back said there after that most of it just cancels itself out the divisor is of course the surface area of a crosssection of the line of grease a waste of time said harry in such a way that hannant knew it wasnt just rank insubordination indeed in a voice which hardly seemed like harry keoghs voice at all there was authority in it for a momenthannant almost felt intimidated what was going on behind the kids glasses inside his skull what was the meaning in his notaltogetherthere eyes explain yourself hannant demanded and make it good harry glanced at the diagram not at the teachers suggested solution the answer is three and a half feet he said and again there was the same authority in his voice as hannant had said the textbook was new to him he hadnt properly worked through it himself yet but just looking at keogh hed be willing to bet the kid was right which could only mean you went back to the classroom with collins after the beach he accused td told him to lock up but before he did you opened my desk looked up the answers in the answer book there i wouldnt have believed it of you keogh but youre wrong harry cut him short in that same flat emotionless precise voice now he stabbed at the diagram with his finger look at it for yourself the first two questions required formulas yes but not this one given a diameter to four decimals whats the surface area that requires a formula given a surface area to four decimals whats the radius that requires almost the same formula in reverse but this listen the barrels diameter is three times greater than the nozzles the circles area is therefore nine times greater the barrels length is three times greater three times nine is twentyseven the barrel contains twentyseven times as much grease as the nozzle barrel and nozzle together therefore contain twentyeight nozzles worth the nozzle is one and a half inches long twentyeight times one and a half equals fortytwo and fortytwo inches equals three and a half feet sir hannant stared at the boys expressionless almost vacant face he stared at the diagram in the book his mind whirled and it seemed that a cold wind blew on his spine causing him to shiver what the hell for christs sake he was the maths teacher wasnt he but there was no fighting keoghs logic the question hadnt needed formulae hadnt needed maths at all it was mental arithmetic to someone who understood circles to someone who could see past the trees to the wood and of course his answer was must be right if hannant threw his formulae away he would have been able to do it too with a little thought but keoghs application had been instantaneous his scorn had been real and now hannant knew that if he didnt play this right hed probably lose this boy right here and now he also knew that if that happened he wasnt the only one who would lose there was a mind in there and it hadhell potential whatever hannants confusion he forced a grin said very good except i wasnt just checking out your iq harry keogh it was to see whether or not you knew your formulae but now youve really puzzled me seeing as how youre so smart how come your classwork has always been so lousy harry stood up his movements were stiff automatic almost can i go now sir hannant stood up too shrugged and stepped aside your free times your own he said but when you get five minutes you might still bone up on your formulae harry walked off his back straight movements stiff a few paces away he turned and looked back a beam of sunlight striking through the trees caught his glasses turning his eyes to stars formulae he said in that new strange voice i could give you formulae you havent even dreamed of and as the cold chill struck at his spine once more hannant somehow knew for a certainty that keogh wasnt just bragging thenthe maths master wanted to shout at the boy run at him even strike him but his feet seemed rooted to the spot all of the energy had gone out of him hed lost this round completely trembling he sat down again on the slab leaning back weakly against the headstone as harry keogh walked away he leaned there for a moment then jerked forward started upright threw himself away from the grave he tripped and sprawled on the closecropped grass keogh was disappearing lost among the markers the evening was warm no it was damned hot even now but george hannant felt cold as death it was in the air in his heart freezing him here in this place of all places and it came to him now just exactly where and when he had heard someone speak like harry keogh before with his authority his precision and logic thirty long years ago almost when hannant had been little more than a lad himself and the man had been more than his peer he had been his hero almost his god still trembling he got to his feet picked up keoghs books and put them in his briefcase then backed carefully away from the grave cut into the headstone lichened over in parts the legend was simple and george knew it by heart james gordon hannant june sept master at harden boys school for thirty years headmaster for ten now he numbers among the hosts of heaven the epitaph had been the old mans idea of a joke his principal subject like that of his son after him had been maths but he had been far better at it than george would ever be chapter three there was one short maths lesson first thing on the following morning but before then george hannant had done some soulsearching a little rationalising so that by the time all the kids were working away and the room was quiet bar the scratching of pens and rustling of papers he was satisfied that he had the right answer to what had seemed the night before an incident or occurrence of some moment keogh was obviously one of those special people who could get right down to the roots of things a thinker as opposed to a doer and a thinker whose thoughts while they invariably ran contrary to the general stream nevertheless ran true if you could get him interested in a subject deeply enough to make him want to do something with it then hed doubtless do something quite extraordinary oh he would still make errors in simple addition and subtraction two plus two could still on occasion come out five but solutions which were invisible to others would be instantly obvious to him that was why hannant had seen in the lad a likeness to his own father james g hannant too had had that same sort of intuitive knack had been a natural mathematician and he too had had little time for formulae and equally obvious to hannant was the fact that he had indeed fanned some spark into flame in keoghs brain for it was his pleasure to note that the boy seemed to be working quite hard or at least he had been for the first fifteen minutes or so of the period after that well of course he was daydreaming again but when hannant crept up behind him lo and behold the questions hed set were all answered and correctly however insubstantial the working it would be interesting later in the week when they got onto basic trigonometry to see what keogh would do with that now that the circle held little of mystery for him perhaps hed take an interest in the triangle but there was still something which puzzled george hannant and for the answer to that he must now go to jamieson the headmaster leaving the boys to work alone for a few minutes with the customary warning about their behaviour in his absence he went to the heads study harry keogh howard jamieson seemed a little taken aback how did he do in the technical college examination he took out a slim file from one of his desk drawers flipped through it looked up im afraid keogh didnt take the examination he said apparently he was down with hay fever or some such yes here it is hay fever three weeks ago he had two days off school unfortunately the exams took place in hartlepool on the second day of keoghs absence but why do you ask george do you think hed have stood a chance i think hed have sailed it hannant answered frank to the point of being blunt jamieson seemed surprised bit late in the day isnt it to worry about it i suppose it is no i meant this interest in harry keogh i didnt know you much approved of him wait he took out another file a thicker one this time from a cabinet last years reports he said checking through the file and this time he wasnt at all surprised thought so according to this none of your colleagues here give keogh a cat in hells chance at anything and that includes you george yes hannants neck reddened a little but that was last year also the technical college exams are aimed more at basic intelligence than academic knowledge if you were to give our harry keogh an iq test i think youd be in for a surprise where maths is concerned anyway its all instinct all intuition but its there sure enough jamieson nodded well its something when a master takes more than a grudging interest in a harden boy he said and thats not to put anyone down not even the kids themselves but they do have a hell of a handicap here in background and environment i mean do you know how many of our boys got through that exam by the way three three out of that age group which is to say one in sixtyfive four if harry keogh had taken it oh jamieson wasnt convinced but he was impressed at least all right he said lets assume youre right about the maths side of it and in fact you are right that the test is a measure of basic intelligence rather than knowledge assimilated parrotfashion so what about the other subjects according to these reports keogh is a habitual failure in just about any subject you care to mention bottom of his class in many of them hannant sighed nodded said look im sorry ive wasted your time on this one anyway the question hardly arises since he didnt sit the exam in the first place its just that i feel its a shame thats all i think the kid has potential tell you what said jamieson coming round his desk and moving towards the door with his hand on hannants shoulder send him to see me during the afternoon ill have a word with him see what i think no wait maybe i can be a little more constructive than that instinctive or intuitive mathematician is he very well he returned to his desk took a pen and quickly scribbled something on a blank sheet of a there you go he said see what he makes of that let him work at it through the lunch break if he comes up with an answer then ill see him and well see how we go from there hannant took the sheet of a and went out into the corridor closing the door behind him he looked at what the head had written shook his head in disappointment he folded the sheet and pocketed it then took it out again opened it and stared at it on the other handmaybe it was exactly the sort of thing keogh could handle hannant was sure that he could do it with a bit of thought and a spot of trial and error but if keogh could work it out then theyd be on to something his case for the boy would be proven in the event keogh failed then hannant would simply stop worrying about him there were other kids who were equally deserving of his attention he was sure at pm sharp hannant knocked on jamiesons door was through it on the instant the head called him in jamieson himself was just back from lunch hardly settled down he stood up as hannant crossed the floor of his study shook out the folds of the a and handed it to him i did as you suggested hannant told the head breathlessly this is keoghs solution the headmaster quickly scanned the scribbled text of his original problem magic square a square is divided into equal smaller squares each small square contains a number to inclusive arrange them so that the sum of each of the four lines and each of the four columns and the diagonals is one and the same number the answer in pencil including what looked like a false start had been drawn beneath the question and was signed harry keogh jamieson stared at it stared harder opened his mouth to speak but said nothing hannant could see him rapidly adding up the columns lines diagonals could almost hear his brain ticking over this isvery good jamieson finally said its better than that hannant told him its perfect the head blinked at him perfect george but all magic squares are perfect thats the lure of them thats their magic yes hannant agreed but theres perfect and theres perfect you asked for columns lines diagonals all totalling the same hes given you that and far more the corners total the same the four squares in the middle total the same the four blocks of four total the same even the opposing middle numbers at the sides come out the same and if you look closer thats not the end of it no it is perfect jamieson checked again frowned for a moment then smiled delightedly and finally wheres keogh now hes outside i thought you might like to see him jamieson sighed sat down at his desk all right george lets have your prodigy in shall we hannant opened the door called keogh in harry entered nervously fidgeted where he stood before the heads desk young keogh said the head mr hannant tells me youve a thing for numbers harry said nothing this magic square for instance now ive fiddled about with such things purely for my own amusement you understand ever since oh since i was about your age but i dont think i ever came up with a solution as good as this one its quite remarkable did anyone help you with it harry looked up looked straight into jamiesons eyes for a moment he looked scared possibly but in the next moment he went on the defensive no sir no one helped me jamieson nodded i see so wheres your rough work i mean one doesnt just guess something as clever as this does one no sir said harry my rough work is there crossed out jamieson looked at the paper scratched his very nearly bald head glanced at hannant then he stared at keogh but this is simply a box with the numbers laid in their numerical sequence i cant see how sir harry stopped him it seemed to me that was the logical way to start when i got that far i could see what needed doing again the head and the maths teacher exchanged glances go on harry said the head nodding see sir if you just write the numbers in like i did all the big numbers go to the right and to the bottom so i asked myself how can i get half of them over from right to left and half of them from the bottom to the top and how can i do both at the same time that seemslogical jamieson scratched his head again so what did you do pardon i said what did you do boy jamieson hated having to repeat himself to pupils they should hang on his every word harry was suddenly pale he said something but it came out a croak he coughed and his voice dropped an octave or two when he spoke again he no longer sounded like a small boy at all its there in front of you he said cant you see it for yourself jamiesons eyes bugged and his jaw dropped but before he could explode harry added i reversed the diagonals thats all it was the obvious answer the only logical answer any other ways a game of chance trial and error and hit and miss isnt good enough not for me jamieson stood up flopped down again pointed an enraged finger at the door hannant get that boy out of here then come back in and speak to me hannant grabbed keoghs arm dragged him out into the corridor he had the feeling that if he hadnt physically taken hold of the boy then keogh might well have fainted as it was he propped him up against the wall hissed wait here and left him there looking slightly dazed and sick back inside jamiesons study hannant found the headmaster soaking sweat from his brow with a large sheet of school blotting paper he was staring fixedly at harrys solution and muttering to himself reversed the diagonals hmm and so he has but as hannant closed the door behind him jamieson looked up and grinned somewhat feebly he had obviously regained his self control and continued to dab away at the sweat on his forehead and neck this bloody heat he said waving a limp hand and indicating that hannant should take a seat hannant whose shirt was sticking to his back beneath his jacket said i know its murder isnt it the schools like a furnace and its just as bad for the kids he remained standing jamieson saw his meaning and nodded yes well thats no excuse for insolence or arrogance hannant knew he should keep quiet but couldnt he was being insolent he said thing is i believe he was simply stating a fact it was the same when i crossed him yesterday it seems that as soon as you crowd him he gets his back up the lads brilliant but hed like to pretend not to be he does his damnedest to keep it hidden but why surely thats not normal most boys of his age like the chance to show off is it simply that hes shy or does it go deeper than that hannant shook his head i dont know let me tell you about yesterday when he was through the head said almost exactly parallel to what weve just seen thats right jamieson grew thoughtful if he really is as clever as you seem to think he is and certainly he seems to have an intuitive knack in some directions then id hate to be the one to deprive him of a chance to get somewhere in life he sat back very well its decided keogh missed the exams through no fault of his own soill speak to jack harmon at the tech see if we can fix up some sort of private examination for him of course i cant promise anything but its better than nothing hannant finished it for him thanks howard tine fine ill let you know how i get on nodding hannant went out into the corridor where keogh was waiting over the next two days hannant tried to put keogh to the back of his mind but it didnt work in the middle of lessons or at home during the long autumn evenings even occasionally in the dead of night the boys youngold face would be there hovering on the periphery of hannants awareness friday night saw the teacher awake at am all his windows open to let in what little breeze there was prowling the house in his pyjamas he had come awake with that picture in his mind of harry keogh clutching jamiesons folded sheet of a heading off across the schoolyard of milling boys in the direction of the back gate under the stone archway then of the boy crossing the dusty summer lane and passing in through the iron gates of the cemetery and hannant had believed that he knew where harry was going and suddenly though the night had not grown noticeably cooler hannant had felt chilly in a way he was now becoming used to it could only be a psychic chill he suspected warning him that something was dreadfully wrong there was something uncanny about keogh certainly but what it was defied conjecture or rather challenged it one thing was certain george hannant hoped to god the kid could pass whatever exams howard jamieson and jack harmon of hartlepool tech cooked up for him and it was no longer simply that he wanted the boy to realise his full potential no it was more basic than that frankly he wanted keogh out of here out of the school away from the other kids those perfectly ordinary normal boys at harden secondary modern a bad influence hardly that who could he possibly influence in what way when the rest of the kids generally considered him a weed a corruption then a taint which might somehow spread like the proverbial rotten apple at the bottom of the barrel perhaps and yet that simile didnt exactly fit either or maybe in a way it did for after all it makes little difference that an apple cant appreciate its own rottenness the corruption spreads anyway or was that too strong how could it even be possible that there was something well wrong with harry keogh something of which even he was unaware or lacked understanding actually the whole thing was becoming distinctly ridiculous and yetwhat was it about keogh which so worried hannant what was in him seeking a way out and why did hannant feel that when it finally emerged it would be terrible it was then that hannant decided to investigate keoghs background discover what he could of the boys past perhaps that was where the trouble lay and then again if maybe there was nothing at all and the whole affair was pi simply something spawned of hannants own overactive imagination it could be the heat the fact that he was if sleeping badly the unending unrewarding repetitious routine of the school any or all of these things it could be but why then did that inner voice keep insisting that keogh was different and why on occasion would he find keogh staring at him with eyes which might well be those of his own dead and buried father ten days and two tuesdays later tragedy struck it happened when the boys pti graham lane and the misses dorothy hartley and gertrude gower went off on their endofday stonegathering trek to the beach sergeant ostensibly to collect specimens of some rare wild flower but more likely to impress his lady love had climbed the beetling cliffs when he had been more than halfway up the treacherous face of the cliff projecting stones had given way under his feet pitching him down to the boulder and screeclad beach below he had tried to cling to the crumbling surface even as he fell but then his feet had struck a narrow ledge breaking it away and he had been set spinning free in air he had landed on his chest and face crushing both and killing himself outright the affair was made more especially gruesome in light of the fact that sergeant and dorothy hartley only the night before had announced their engagement they were to have been married in the spring as it was the following friday saw sergeant buried it would have been better for him hannant later remembered thinking as he watched lanes coffin being lowered into a fresh plot of earth in the old cemetery if hed stayed in the army and taken his chances there afterwards there had been sandwiches cakes and coffee in the staffroom at the school and a nip of something stronger for those who fancied it and of course dorothy hartley to console as best she could be consoled so that none of the teachers had been there to see the grave filled in or after the gravedigger was through and the wreaths lay in position the last lone mourner where he sat on a slab nearby chin in the palms of his hands and lacklustre eyes staring from behind his spectacles fastened mournfully curiously expectantly upon the mound meanwhile howard jamieson had not been remiss in seeking to get harry keogh a postexamination place at the tech in hartlepool or if not an actual place at least the opportunity to win one for himself the private examination in the main an iq test consisting of questions designed to measure verbal numerical and spatial perception and aptitude was to take place at the college in hartlepool under the direct supervision of john harmon the headmaster wind of it had got out however along the harden boys school grapevine and harry had become something of a target for various jibes and japes he was no longer simply speccy for instance but had acquired other nicknames including the favourite which meant that big stanley had been putting it about that harry was some sort of teachers or headmasters pet and with the help of a twisted sort of logic of which stanley was a pastmaster not to mention the threat in his pudgy but hardknuckled fists it hadnt taken long to convince even the more liberalminded lads that there was definitely something fishy about keoghs belated emergence as someone who was a bit more than just ordinary why for instance should speccy or the favourite why should he alone get this crack at a special tech examination other kids had been sick that day too hadnt they and were they being given special treatment no they werent it was just because that dreamy little fart got on well with the teachers that was all who was it went digging up stupid smelly shells for that old bag miss gower speccy keogh that was who and hadnt old sergeant always used to stick up for him of course he had and now since hed suddenly started being a bit clever at maths and so on even snotty old hannant was on his side oh he was the favourite all right the foureyed little fart but not with big stanley green he wasnt it had all sounded very logical to which add the now sullen voices of the others who through no fault of their own had missed the exam and soon the bully had a fairsized crowd of likeminded boys on his side even jimmy collins seemed of the opinion that something niffed a bit then tuesday came around one week exactly after the gymteachers death when once more the school trooped down to the beach for what was hopefully to be the last stonegathering expedition of the season the idea had been a novelty at first but now boys and teachers alike were fed up with it lanes death had soured it for everyone miss gower was present as usual with jean tasker of science taking the place of dorothy hartley who had been given leave of absence george hannant was also there replacing graham lane as usual after the stones had been collected and piled up the boys were allowed to do their own thing for an hour before carrying their booty back to the school geegee gower was giving instructions to a bunch of reluctant nonswimmers in a tidal pool george hannant and jean tasker stood down by the edge of the sea gathering shells and bright pebbles chatting and generally passing the time of day that was when big stanley who could no longer contain his vindictiveness saw his opportunity to teach keogh a lesson harry had been off on his own head down hands behind his back beachcombing but as he returned to the pile of stones he looked up and spotted green and a large handful of the others waiting for him well well sneered the bully pushing his way to the front of the crowd and if it isnt our little teachers pet little skinny speccy keogh with a fistful of pretty shells for daft old geegee hows things then speccy how dyou fancy your chances with this special exam theyve fixed it for you to take eh reckon youll pass it do you then speccy said another his voice hardedged theyll push you through it will they oh hes favourite all right said a third what him teachers pet and all how can he fail jimmy collins towelling himself dry as he came up the beach saw the mood of the crowd at once but said nothing instead he went to the rear of the group wrapped a towel round his waist and started to dress well green prodded harry in the chest how about it foureyes are the nice teachers going to let you pass your little exam then so you can get away from all us nasty rough boys and go to school in hartlepool with the rest of the fairies harry staggered backward from the others shoving dropping the shells hed collected big stanley gave a whoop jumped forward crushed them to dust under his shoes and ground them into the sand harry swayed looked sick began to turn away his eyes were suddenly misty behind his spectacles his face which wasnt tanned like the faces of the rest turned even paler shitty little cowardly teachers pet green crowed maliciously old man jamiesons little favourite eh speccy and is that you crying then tears is it wetting ourself are we you foureyed little shut it shithead harry growled turning back and facing the bully youre ugly enough without me making it worse wha green couldnt believe his ears what was that keogh had said no it couldnt have been why it hadnt even sounded like him he must have a frog in his throat or he was all choked up with fear whynt you leave him alone said jimmy collins pushing through the crowd three or four of them grabbed him held him back stay out of it jimmy said harry in his new gritty voice im all right all right is it cried big stanley ill say youre not speccy my son ill say youre in the shit with his last word he swung his fist for the smaller boys head harry ducked easily stepped forward jabbed with a straight arm fingers straight and stiff big stanley folded in the middle jackknifed his face coming down on harrys knee which was coming up the crack was like a pistol shot green straightened up and flew backward his arms straight out from his shoulders and down he crashed on the sand harry stepped close seconds passed but green just lay there then he sat up shook his head groggily his nose was the wrong shape bleeding profusely his eyes were glassy behind welling tears of pain youyouyou he spat blood harry bent over him showed him a white knobbly fist you what he growled the corner of his mouth lifting from his teeth go on bully say something give me a reason to hit you again green said nothing reached up a trembling hand to touch his broken nose his split mouth then he started to cry real tears but harry wasnt finished with him he wanted him to remember listen shithead he said if ever if you ever once call me speccy or favourite or any other bloody funny name again if you even speak to me ill hit you so hard youll be shitting teeth for a month have you got that shithead big stanley turned on his side in the sand and cried even harder harry looked up glared at the rest of them he took off his spectacles put them in a pocket scowled he didnt squint didnt look as though hed needed the glasses at all his eyes were bright as marbles full of sparks what i said to this shit goes for the rest of you or if any one of you fancies his chances here and now jimmy collins stepped beside him or any two of you he said the crowd was silent as a man all their mouths were wide their eyes even wider slowly they turned away began talking nervously laughing fooling about as if nothing had happened it was over and strangely they were all glad it was over harry said jimmy quietly out of the corner of his mouth i never seen anything like that not ever why you did it like like like a man like a grown man like old sergeant when he used to shadowfight in the gym unarmed combat he called it he elbowed his pal in the ribs but gingerly hey you know something what harry asked trembling all over his voice his own again youre weird you are harry keogh youre really weird harry keogh sat his examination a fortnight later the weather had changed in the first week of september since when it had grown progressively worse until the sky seemed permanently filled with rain it rained on the day of the examination too a downpour which washed the windows of the heads study where harry sat at a huge desk with his papers and pens jack harmon himself invigilated seated behind his own desk reading the minutes of the observations and notes of the last staff meeting but while he worked occasionally he would look up glance at the boy wonder about him actually harmon didnt particularly want harry keogh at the tech not for any personal motive not even because he half felt that hed been pushed into this unheardof situation that of being obliged to test a boy who had quite simply already missed his chance but because it might set an unfortunate precedent time was precious enough without extra work of this sort being found or manufactured exams were exams they were held annually and the colliery boys who passed them had the opportunity to finish their final years of schooling here where perhaps they could go on to better things than their fathers had known the system was longestablished and worked very well but this new thing howard jamieson pushing the keogh boy forward like this on the other hand the headmaster at harden modern boys was a proven friend from the old days and it was also true that harmon owed him a favour or two even so when jamieson had first approached him on the subject harmon had been cool about it but the other had persisted finally harmons curiosity had been aroused hed wanted to see this teenage prodigy for himself at the same time however and as stated he had not wanted to set any sort of precedent he had looked for an easy way out and believed hed found one he himself had set the questions choosing only the most difficult problems from the last six years examination papers no boy of keoghs educational background could possibly hope to answer them but while the examination itself would almost constitute a farce still harmon would be able to look at examples of keoghs work and so satisfy his curiosity jamieson too would have been mollified at least in respect of his request that the boy be tested keoghs failure would destroy the credibility of any further like requests in the future and so jack harmon invigilated keeping an eye on the boy while he worked at the papers an hour had been allowed for each subject there were to be tenminute breaks between subjects tea and biscuits would be served right here in the heads study during the breaks and a staff toilet was right next door the first paper had been the english exam following which keogh had sat quietly drinking his tea staring pallidly at the rain beyond the windows now he was halfway into the maths paper or should be that was a moot point harmon had watched him the boys pen had seemed barely to scratch the answer paper or if it had then it was during those moments when the techs headmaster had been busy with his own work oh the boy had been hard enough at it through the first hour the first test the english paper had seemed to interest him hed done a lot of frowning and penchewing and had written and rewritten indeed hed still been working when harmon had called time but the maths paper obviously had him stumped he made the occasional sporadic attempt at it harmon must give him that much but after only a moment or two hed sit back stare out of the windows go pale and quiet again almost as if he were exhausted then he would appear to pick up glance at the next question scribble away at frantic speed as if inspired before pausing again exhausted and so on harmon could well understand his tension or anxiety or whatever it was the questions were very difficult there were six of them each one of which would normally take at least a quarter of an hour to complete and only then if the boys aptitude was well in advance of his years and present level of education at harden modern what harmon couldnt understand was why he bothered at all why he kept making these furious attacks on the paper only to sit back each time after a little while frustrated and tired wasnt it obvious to him that he couldnt win what were his thoughts as he gazed out of the windows where was he when his face took on that blank almost vacant expression maybe harmon should stop this now put an end to it plainly the lad wasnt getting anywhere they were now thirtyfive minutes into the maths section as the boy sat back yet again his arms dangling and his eyes halfclosed behind the lenses of his spectacles so harmon quietly stood up and approached him from the rear outside the rain was blowing in gusts against the windowpanes in here an old clock ticked on the wall pacing the heads breathing he glanced over keoghs shoulder not really knowing what he expected to see his glance became a fixed stare he blinked blinked again and his eyes opened wide his eyebrows drew together as he craned his neck the better to see if keogh heard his gasp of astonishment he made no sign remained seated continued to gaze blearily at the rain rivering the windows harmon took a step backwards away from the boy turned and went back to his desk he seated himself slid open a drawer held his breath and took out the answers to the maths section keogh had not only answered the questions hed got them right all of them that last frenzied burst of work had been him working on the sixth and last moreover hed accomplished it with the very minimum of rough work and hardly any use at all of the familiar and accepted formulae finally the head allowed himself a deep deep breath gawped again at the printed answer sheets in his hand the masses of complicated workings and neatly resolved solutions then carefully placed them back in the drawer and slid it shut he could hardly credit it if he hadnt been sitting here through the entire examination hed swear the boy must have cheated but quite obviously that was not the case sowhat did harmon have here intuitive howard jamieson had called the boy an intuitive mathematician very well harmon would see how well this intuition of his worked with the next paper meanwhile the headmaster rubbed his chin and stared thoughtfully at the back of keoghs head he must speak to both jamieson and young george hannant at greater length these were early days of course butintuition it seemed to harmon that there just might be another word for what keogh was one which the teachers it harden simply hadnt thought to apply harmon could well understand that for he too was reluctant the word in harmons mind was genius and if this was so then certainly there was a place for keogh at the tech harmon would soon discover if he was right and of course he was it was only in his application that he was wrong keoghs genius lay in an entirely different direction jack harmon was short fat hirsute and generally apish he would be quite ugly except that he exuded a friendliness and an aura of wellbeing that cut right through his outer guise to show the man inside for what he really was one of natures truest gentlemen he also had a quite brilliant mind in harmons younger days he had known george hannants father that was when j g hannant had been head at harden and harmon had taught elementary maths and science at a tiny school in morton another colliery village on and off over the intervening years hed met the younger hannant and so watched him grow up it had come as no great surprise to him to learn that george hannant too had finally come into the business teaching must be as much a part of him as it had been of his father young hannant harmon had always thought of him ridiculous for of course george had been a teacher now for almost twenty years harmon had called the maths teacher down from his own school to hartlepool in order to talk to him about harry keogh it was the monday following keoghs examination and they had met at the tech harmon lived close by and had taken the younger man home with him for a lunch of cold meats and pickles his wife knowing it was business served the food then went shopping while the two men ate and talked harmon opened with an apology i hope it isnt inconvenient for you george to be called away like this i know howard keeps you pretty busy up there hannant nodded no problem at all himself is standing in for me this afternoon he likes to take a crack at it now and then says he misses the classroom im sure hed swap that study of his and the admin that goes with it for a classroom full of boys any time oh he would he would wouldnt we all harmon grinned but its the money george its the money and i suppose the prestige has a little to do with it too youll know what i mean when youre a head in your own right now then tell me about keogh youre the one who discovered him arent you i think its truer to say he discovered himself hannant answered its as if hes only recently woken up to his town potential a late starter so to speak but one whos all set to overtake the rest of the runners in a flash eh ah said hannant since harmon hadnt yet said anything about the results of keoghs tests he had halffeared that the boy had failed being called down here had reassured him a little and now harmons remark about keogh overtaking the rest had clinched it he passed then hannant smiled no harmon shook his head he failed miserably the english paper let him down he tried hard i believe but hannants smile faded his shoulders slumped a little but im taking him anyway harmon finished grinning again as hannants wide eyes came up once more to meet his on the strength of what he did with the other papers what he did with them harmon nodded i admit that i gave him the most difficult questions i could find and he made mincemeat of them if he has any fault at all id say it was his unorthodox approach if that in itself is a fault its just that he seems to dispense with all the customary formulae hannant nodded made no comment thought i know exactly what you mean and when he saw that harmon was waiting he said out loud oh yes he does that i thought it might just be maths said the other but it was just the same with the other paper call it iq or spatial or whatever its mainly designed to test the potential of the intellect i found his answer to one of the questions especially interesting not the answer itself you understand which was absolutely correct anyway but the way he arrived at it it concerned a triangle oh yes ah trig hannant thought forking a piece of chicken into his mouth i wondered how hed do with that of course it could have been solved with simple trigonometry or even visually it was that simple indeed it was the only simple question in the batch here let me show you he pushed his plate aside took out a pen and sketched on a paper napkin where ad is half ac and ae is half ab how much greater is the larger triangle than the smaller hannant dotted the diagram so and said four times greater visual as you said right but keogh simply wrote down the answer no dotted lines just the answer i stopped him and asked how did you do that he shrugged and said a half times a half is a quarter the smaller triangle is one quarter as great as the big one hannant smiled shrugged thats typical of keogh he said its what first attracted me to him he ignores formulae jumps gaps in the normal reasoning process leaps from terminal to terminal harmons expression hadnt changed it was a very serious expression what formulae he asked has he done trig yet hannants smile slipped he frowned paused with his fork halfway to his mouth no we were just starting so he wouldnt have known this formula anyway no thats true hannants frown deepened but he does now and so do we sorry hannant had been left behind somewhere harmon went on i said to him keogh thats all very well but what if it wasnt a rightangled triangle what if it was likethis again he sketched and i said to him harmon continued this time ad is half ab but be is only a quarter of bc well keogh just looked at it and said one eighth quarter times a half and then he did this what point are you trying to make hannant found himself fascinated by the others tense expression if not by his subject what was harmon getting at but isnt it obvious this is a formula and hed figured it out for himself and hed done it during the examination it may not be as clever or inexplicable as you think hannant shook his head as i said we were going to be starting on trig in the near future keogh knew that he may have done some reading in advance thats all oh said harmon and now he beamed reached across the table and punched the other on the shoulder then do me a favour george and send me a copy of the textbook hes been swotting from will you id very much like to see it you see in all my years of teaching thats a formula i never came across archimedes might well have known it euclid or pythagorus but i certainly didnt what hannant stared again at the diagram stared harder but surely i know this i mean i understand keoghs principle surely ive seen it before i must have christ ive been teaching trig for twenty years my young friend said harmon so have i and longer listen i know all about sines cosines tangents i fully understand trigonometrical ratios i am as familiar with all the common or garden mathematical formulae as you yourself are probably more familiar but i never saw a principle so clearly set forth so brilliantly logical so expertlyexposed exposed yes thats it you cant say keogh invented this because he didnt no more than newton invented gravity or discovered it as they say no for its as constant as pi it has always been there but it took keogh to show us it was there he shrugged defeatedly how might i explain what i mean i know what you mean said hannant no need to explain further its what i told jamieson this thing of keoghs for seeing right through the trees to the wood but a formula and suddenly in the back of his mind formulae i could give you formulae you havent even dreamed of oh but it is harmon insisted cutting in on hannants wandering thoughts for a specific sort of question certainly but a formula nevertheless and i ask myself where to from here are there any more basic principles in him principles we simply never stumbled on before just waiting for the right stimulus thats why i want him here at the tech so that i can find out actually im glad youre taking him said hannant after a moment he found himself on the verge of mentioning his disquiet concerning keogh then changed his mind and deliberately lied idont think he can realise his full potential at harden yes i see that harmon answered frowning and then a little impatiently but of course weve already made that point anyway you can rest assured that i shall do my utmost to develop his potential here indeed i will but come on now tell me about the lad himself what do you know of his background on his way back to harden at the wheel of his ford cortina hannant reflected on what hed told harmon of keoghs origins and upbringing most of it hed had from the boys aunt and uncle with whom keogh lived in harden his uncle had a grocery shop in the main street his aunt was mainly a housewife but she also helped out in the shop two or three days a week keoghs grandfather had been irish moving from dublin to scotland in at the end of the war and working in glasgow as a builder his grandmother had been a russian lady of some note who fled the revolution in and took up residence in an edinburgh house close to the sea there sean keogh met her and in theyd been married three years later harrys uncle michael was born and in his mother mary sean keogh had been hard on his son apparently bringing him into the building business and working him hard from the age of fourteen but by comparison he had seemed literally to dote on his daughter for whom nothing had ever been good enough this had caused some jealousy between brother and sister which came to an end when michael was nineteen and ran off south to set himself up in a business of his own michael was the uncle harry keogh now lived with by the time mary keogh was twentyone however her fathers doting had turned to a fierce possessiveness which totally shut her off from any sort of social life so that she stayed mainly at home and helped with the housework or assisted her aristocratic russian mother in the small psychic circle she had built up when she would attend and regularly take part in those stances for which natasha keogh had become something of a local celebrity then in the summer of scan keogh had been killed when an unsafe wall he was working on fell on him his wife who for all that she was not yet fifty was already ailing had sold the business and gone into semiretirement holding the occasional seance to eke out her living which now mainly derived from the interest on banked money for mary on the other hand the death of her father had heralded a hitherto undreamedof freedom quite literally a coming out for the next two years she enjoyed a social life limited only by her tiny allowance until by the winter of she had met and married an edinburgh man twentyfive years her senior a banker in the city he was gerald snaith and he and mary had been very happy for all the gap in their age groups living in a large house in its own private grounds not far from bonnyrigg unfortunately by then marys mother was rapidly sickening and her doctors had diagnosed cancer so that mary lived half of her time at bonnyrigg and the rest of it looking after her mother natasha at the seaside house in edinburgh harry keogh was therefore born harry snaith just nine months after his grandmother died in and just a year before his banker father would follow her dying from a stroke in his office at the bank mary keogh was a strong girl and still very young she had already sold the old family house by the sea and now found herself sole beneficiary of her husbands not inconsiderable estate deciding to get away from edinburgh for a little while in the spring of she had come down to harden and hired a house until the end of july spending a lot of time in becoming reconciled with her brother and in getting to know his new wife during that time she saw how his business was declining and helped out with sufficient hard cash to tide him over it was then too that michael first detected an aura of sadness or hopelessness about his sister when he asked what was bothering her she reminded him of their mothers sixth sense her psychic sensitivity she believed she had inherited something of it it told her that she would not have a long life that didnt worry her unduly what would be would be but she did worry about little harry what would become of him if anything should happen to her while he was still a child it was unlikely that michael keogh and his wife jenny would be able to have children of their own they had known this when they married but mutually agreed that it was not a matter of overriding importance their feelings for each other came first later when their small business was better established there would be time enough to consider adoption in these circumstances however and if anything should happen to mary a prediction which while her brother himself put little store by it mary seemed strongly inclined indeed resolved towards then she would not need to let it concern her of course her brother and his wife would bring up little harry as their own the promise was made more to put her mind at rest than as a real promise as such when harry was two his mother met and was swayed by a man only two or three years older than herself one viktor shukshin an assumed dissident who had made his way to the west in pursuit of a political haven or at least political freedom such as mary keoghs mother had done in perhaps marys fascination with shukshin was due to this russian connection but whichever she married him late in and they lived at the house near bonnyrigg a linguist harrys new stepfather had been giving private lessons in russian and german in edinburgh for the last two years but now all financial problems set aside he and his new wife gave themselves over to a life of leisure and personal interests and inclinations he too was greatly interested in the paranormal encouraging his wife in her psychic pursuits michael keogh had met shukshin at his sisters wedding and again briefly while on a touring holiday in scotland but after thatonly at the inquest for in the winter of mary keogh died as she had predicted at only thirtytwo years of age of shukshin himself hannant had only ascertained that the keoghs hadnt liked the man there had been that about him which alienated them probably the same thing which had attracted michaels sister as to marys death she had been a skater had loved the ice a river within view of the house near bonnyrigg had claimed her when she had apparently fallen through thin ice while skating and been swept away viktor had been with her but had been unable to do anything distraught almost out of his mind with horror he had gone for help but beneath the ice the river had been swollen rushing at the time of the accident downriver were many little backwaters where marys body might have been washed up under the ice remaining there until the thaw lots of mud had been washed down out of the hills too and this had doubtless covered her at any rate her body was never found within six months michael had fulfilled his promise harry keogh had gone to live with his uncle and aunt in harden this had suited shukshin harry had not been his child and he was in any case middling with children and did not feel inclined to bring the boy up on his own marys will had made good provision for harry the house and the rest of her estate went to the russian to michael keoghs knowledge shukshin lived there yet he had not remarried but gone back to giving private tuition in german and russian he still gave lessons at the house near bonnyrigg where he apparently lived alone not once over the years had he asked to see harry nor even enquired about him dramatic as his family history might seem still all in all harry keoghs beginnings had not been very remarkable the only matter which had made any real impression on hannant had been keoghs grandmothers and mothers predilection for the paranormal but that in itself was not very extraordinary or there againperhaps it was mary shukshin had seemed convinced that natashas powers had been passed down to her and what if she in turn had passed them down to harry now there was a thought or there might be one if hannant believed at all in such things but he did not it was an evening some three weeks later four or five days after keogh had left harden modern boys for the tech when hannant stumbled across one final oddity concerning the boy up in hannants attic hed long kept an old trunk of his fathers containing one or two books and bundles of old papers dusty bits of bricabrac and various mementoes of the old mans years of teaching having gone up there to fix a tile loosened in a brief storm off the north sea he had seen the trunk and admired it stoutly constructed its dark body and brass hasps and hinges retained an oldeworlde appeal it would create a very handsome effect beside the bookshelves in hannants front room dragging the trunk downstairs he had started to empty it glancing again at old photographs unseen for many a year and putting aside items which might be useful at school until hed come across a large leatherbound notebook full of notes and jottings in his fathers hand something about the pattern and layout of his fathers work had held his eye for a momentuntil it dawned on him just exactly what it was or what he thought it was in the next moment that awful inexplicable chill had come again to strike hannants spine causing him to tremble where he sat holding the book open in his lap stiffening his back with shock thenhe had snapped the book shut carried it through to his front room where a coal fire blazed beneath the wide chimneypiece there without even glancing at the book again he thrust it into the flames and let it burn that same day hannant had collected keoghs old maths books from the school for forwarding on to harmon at the tech now taking the most recent one he let its pages fall open for one last glance then closed it with a shudder and let it join his fathers old book in the flames prior to keoghs awakening his work had been scruffy lacking in order by no means precise afterwards for the last six or seven weeks well the books were gone now roared up in a sheet of flame and lost in the chimney lost to the night there was no comparing them now and that was probably the best way to consider that there might be any real comparison would be too gross too grotesque now hannant could put the whole thing out of his mind forever thoughts like that had never belonged in any completely sane mind in the first place chapter four it was the summer of and dragosani was back in romania he looked very trendy in a washedout blue opennecked shirt flared grey trousers cut in a western style shiny black shoes with sharply pointed toes and a fawnchequered jacket with large patch pockets in the hot romanian midday especially at this farm on the outskirts of a tiny village some way off the corabiacalinesti highway he stood out like the proverbial sore thumb leaning on his car and scanning the huddled rooftops and snailshell cupolas of the village which stood a little way down the gently sloping fields to the south he could only be one of three things a rich tourist from the west one from turkey or one from greece but on the other hand his car was a volga and black as his shoes which suggested something else also he didnt wear the wideeyed waryinnocent look of the tourist but a selfsatisfied air of familiarity of belonging approaching him from the farmhouse yard where hed been feeding chickens hzak kinkovsi the proprietor couldnt make up his mind he was expecting tourists later in the week but this one had got him beat he sniffed suspiciously an official maybe from the ministry of lands and properties some snotty lackey for those stonefaced bolshevik industrialists across the border hed have to watch his step here obviously at least until he knew who or what the newcomer was kinkovsi the young man inquired eyeing him up and down hzak kinkovsi they told me in lonestasi that you have rooms i take it that place is your guesthouse kinkovsi deliberately looked blank feigned a lack of understanding frowned as he stared at dragosani he didnt always declare his earnings from tourism not all of them anyway finally he said i am kinkovsi yes and i do have rooms but well can i stay here or cant i the other seemed tired now and impatient kinkovsi noted that his clothes at first glance smart and modern actually looked crumpled muchtravelled i know im early by a month but surely you cant have that many guests early by a month now kinkovsi remembered ah you must be the herr from moscow the one who made inquiry in april the one who booked lodgings but sent no money in advance is it you then that herr dragosani who has the name of the town down the highway but you are indeed early though welcome for all that i shall have to prepare a room for you or perhaps i can put you in the english room for a night or two anyway how long will you stay ten days at least dragosani answered if the sheets are clean and the food is at all bearable and if your romanian beer is not too bitter his glance seemed unnecessarily severe there was that in his attitude which got kinkovsis back up mein herr he began with a growl my rooms are so clean you could eat off the floor my wife is an excellent cook my beer is the best under all the carpatii meridionali whats more our manners are good up here which seems to be more than can be said of you muscovites now do you want a room or dont you dragosani grinned and held out his hand i was pulling your leg he said i like to find out what people are made of and i like a fighting spirit you are typical of this region hzak kinkovsi you wear a farmers clothes but youre a warrior at heart but me a muscovite with a name like mine why there are some whod say that youre the foreigner here hzak kinkovsi its in your name your accent too and what of your use of mein herr hungarian arent you kinkovsi briefly studied the others face looked him up and down decided he liked him the man had a sense of humour anyway which in itself made a welcome change my grandfathers grandfather was from hungary he said taking dragosanis hand and giving it a firm shake but my grandmothers grandmother was a wallach as for the accent its local weve absorbed a good many hungarians over the decades and a good many settled here now im a romanian no less than you only im not as rich as you he laughed showing yellow worndown teeth in a face of creased leather i suppose youd say im a peasant well im what i am as for mein herr would you prefer me to call you comrade heavens no not that dragosani answered at once mein herr will do nicely thanks he too laughed me on show me this english room of yours kinkovsi led the way from the big volga to the tall highpeaked guesthouse rooms he grumbled oh weve plenty of rooms all right four to each floor you can have a whole suite of rooms if you like one will be fine dragosani answered as long as it as its own bath and toilet ah en suite is it well then thats the top floor a room with its own loo and bath up under the roof very modern im sure said dragosani not too dryly he saw that the ground floor walls of the house had been rendered and pebbledashed on top of the sandcoloured cement rising damp probably but the upper levels showed their original stone construction the house must be three hundred years old if it was a day very suitable it took him back in time back to his roots and beyond them how long have you been away kinkovsi asked letting him in and showing him to a room on the ground floor youll have to stay here for now he explained until i can get the upstairs room ready an hour or two thats all dragosani kicked off his shoes hung his jacket over a wooden chair dropped onto a bed in a square of sunlight where it came through an oval window ive been away half of my life he said but its always good to come back ive been back for the last three summers now and four more to go oh got your future all planned out have you four more to go that sounds sort of final what do you mean by it dragosani lay back put his hands behind his head looked at the other through eyes slitted against the glancing sunlight research he finally said local history at only two weeks each year it should take me another four years history this country is steeped in it but its not your job then i mean you dont do it for a living no the man on the bed shook his head in moscow ima mortician that was close enough huh kinkovsi grunted well it takes all kinds right im off now to sort out your room and ill make arrangements for a meal if you want the loo its just out here in the corridor you just take it easy when there was no answer he glanced again at dragosani saw that his eyes were closed the warm sunshine and the quiet of the room kinkovsi picked up his guests car keys from where hed tossed them down at the foot of the bed quietly left the room and eased the door shut behind him one last glance as he went the rise and fall of dragosanis chest had taken on the slow rhythm of sleep that was good kinkovsi nodded to himself and smiled obviously he felt at home here dragosani chose new lodgings each time he came here always in the vicinity of the town he called home within spitting distance but not so close to the last place that hed be remembered from the previous year he had thought of using an assumed name a pseudonym but had thrown the idea out untried he was proud of his name probably in defiance of its origin not in defiance of dragosani the town his geographical origin but the fact that hed been found there as for his parents his father was that almost impregnable mountain range up there to the north the transylvanian alps and his mother was the rich dark soil itself oh he had his own theories about his real parents what theyd done had probably been for the best the way he imagined them they had been szgany romany gypsies young lovers out of feuding camps their love had not had the power to reconcile old slights and spites but they had loved dragosani had been born and he had been left as to actually tracking them down those unknown parents he had thought to do that three years ago and had come here for precisely that reason butit had been utterly hopeless a task enormous impossible there were as many gypsies in romania now as ever there had been in the old days despite their satellite designation old wallachia transylvania moldavia and all the lands around had retained something of autonomy of selfdetermination gypsies had as much right to be here as the mountains themselves these had been the thoughts in dragosanis mind as he drifted into sleep but the dream he dreamed then was not of his parents at all but of scenes from his childhood before hed been sent out of romania to complete his education he had been a loner even then had kept himself to himself and sometimes hed wandered where others feared to go or where they had been forbidden to go the woods were deep and dark on hillsides steep and winding as fairground figuresofeight boris had only ever seen a figureofeight once three days ago on his seventh birthday when his treat had been to go in to dragosani and visit the little picture house there a short russian film had been shot entirely from fairground rides and the figureofeight had been so real that boris had actually suffered from vertigo so that hed nearly fallen out of his seat it had been very frightening but exciting too so much so that hed devised his own game to simulate the thrill of the ride it wasnt as good and it was hard work but it was better than nothing and you could do it right here on the slopes of the wooded hills not a mile from the estate this was a place where no one ever went a completely lonely place which was why boris liked it so much the woods had not been cut here for almost five hundred years no gamekeeper had penetrated the pinegrown slopes where only the rarest sunbeams ever cut through to lighten the dusty gloom only the muted cooing and occasional flapping of wood pigeons disturbed the deep silence and the rustle of small creeping creatures it was a place of dancing dust motes of pine cones and needles of fungi and a few fleet strangely silent squirrels the hills were on the old wallachian plain sloping down from the foothills of the alps fortyfive miles away they were shaped like a crucifix with the central spine almost two miles long from north to south and the crossbar a mile long east to west around them were fields divided by walls hedges and fences and occasionally narrow avenues of trees but the fields in the immediate vicinity of the hills which formed the cross were unfilled where wild grasses grew long and thistles stood tall and gleamed green and lush now and then boriss fosterfather would let horses or cattle graze there but not often even the animals shunned the place they shied a lot for no reason and sometimes broke down fences or jumped hedgerows to be away from those wild too quiet fields but for little boris dragosani the place was something else entirely he could hunt big game there penetrate to the unexplored interior of the amazon search for the lost cities of the incas he could do all of these things and more provided that he never told his fosterfamily about his games or rather where he played them but for all that they were forbidden the woods fascinated him there was that in them which drew him like a magnet it was there now as he clambered up the steep slope near the centre of the cross clawing his way upward from closegrown tree to tree puffing and panting and dragging behind him the big cardboard box which was his vehicle his figureofeight car without wheels a long climb yes but worth it he would have one last ride this time from the very top before setting off for home the sun was low in the sky now and it seemed likely that he was in trouble already for being late so one more ride couldnt hurt at the top he paused to draw breath sat for a moment swatting at motes in the pale beams of sunlight lancing down through tall dark pines then dragged the box along the crest of the ridge to a place where he could see a track running clear to the bottom in some forgotten yesteryear a firebreak had been cut here before the lumbermen had remembered or been told about the nature of the place since when saplings had sprung up once more to almost but not quite obscure the scar now that scar was to become the track of boriss daredevil ride and balancing his car on the rim he jumped aboard and clutched the sides tilting the box forward until it began to ride the box rode smoothly and well at first slipping easily over a bed of pine needles and coarse grasses between low bushes and slender saplings following the old scar of the firebreak butboris was a child he had seen no danger had not reckoned on the steepness of the slope or rate of acceleration now the box picked up speed and now his ride more closely approximated the terrifying dizzy rush of the car on the figureofeight he hit a hummock of grass and the box jumped clear of the slope it came down struck a glancing blow at a sapling shot off sideways into the denser pines where they marched breakneck down the almost sheer hillside alongside the scar there was no controlling the careening ride of his car now boris had no brakes no guidance system he could only go where the box took him with many a jolting crash and sideways slide more bruised and shaken with every passing second he was rattled in his box like a loose pea in a pod and now away from the scar of the firebreak the failing light was shut out almost completely so that boris ducked his head a precaution against unseen whipping branches as his nightmare descent continued but with the trees grown so close it could only go on for a little while longer at last in a place where the ground beneath the trees was of sliding shale and scree where their humped roots stuck up above the surface like thickbodied serpents suddenly the ride as such came to a halt with a jarring crash the bottom of the box was ripped out from beneath boris and the sides quite literally disintegrated in his clutching terrified fingers he was thrown not quite headon into the bole of a tree and sent spinning tumbling head over heels bouncing and sliding boris hardly felt the many brittle branches flying into shards as he plunged through them he was aware only of glimpses of a whirling sky scanned through the tops of frowning pines of a sick plunging and jolting that seemed to go on forever and finally of shooting over a lip or ledge of rock and hurtling into dark dusty space then the impact and after that nothing nothing for a time anyway boris might have been out for one minute for five or fifty or he might not have been out at all but he was shaken up and badly if he hadnt been then what happened next could easily have killed him he might have died of fright who are you asked a voice in his reeling head why have you come here do you offer yourself to me the voice was evil utterly evil in it were elements of everything horrific boris was only a boy he did not understand words like bestial sadistic diabolic or the of phrases like the powers of darkness or the by which such powers are invoked to him there was fear in a creaking tread on a dark landing there was terror in the tapping of a twig on his bedroom window when all the house was asleep there was horror in the sudden squirm or hop of a toad or the startled freezing of a cockroach when the light is switched on and especially in its scurrying when it knows if is discovered once in the deepest cellar under the farm where his fosterfather kept wines in racks and cheeses wrapped in muslin on cool shelves boris had heard the rustling cheep of crickets in the beam of a tiny torch hed seen one leprous grey from the sightlessness of its habitation as he moved closer to step on it the insect jumped and disappeared he found another and the same thing happened and another and so on he saw a dozen and stepped on none they had all vanished climbing the steps out of the place as daylight filtered down from above a cricket had jumped from boriss shorts they were on him they had jumped onto him that way he couldnt step on them and oh how boris had danced then that was his idea of nightmare the knowledge of sly intelligence where none should be just as it should not be here ah said the voice stronger now ah so you are one of mine and because you are one of mine you came here because you knew where to find me it was then that boris knew he was conscious and that the voice in his head was real and its evil was the slimy touch of a toad the leaping of crickets in darkness the slow tick of a hated clock which seems to talk to you in the night and chuckle at your fears and your insomnia oh and it was much worse than that he was sure except he didnt have the words or knowledge or experience to describe it but he could picture the mouth which spoke those guttural clotted sly and insinuating words in his head and he knew why it was clotted and gurgling in his minds eye the picture was vivid and monstrous the mouth dripped blood like liquid rubies and its gleaming incisors were pointed as those of a great hound whatis your name boy dragosani boris answered or at least thought the answer for his throat was too dry for speech in any case it was enough ahhhh dragosani the voice was a hoarse sigh now like autumn leaves skittering on cobbles a sigh of dawning realisation of understanding of satisfaction then indeed you are one of mine but alas too small too small you have not the strength boy a child a mere child what can you do for me nothing your blood runs like water your veins it has no iron boris sat up stared frightenedly about in the gloom his darting and his head reeling he was more than halfdown the hillside on a sort of flat ledge of rock beneath the trees he had never been here before never guessed the place existed then as his eyes became more accustomed to the gloom and his senses returned to him more fully he saw that in fact he sat upon lichenclad stone flags before what could only be a mausoleum boris had seen the like before his uncle had died a month ago and had been interred in just such a place but that had been in holy ground in the churchyard in slatina this place on lithe other handthis was not a holy place no not by any stretch of the imagination unseen presences moved here stirring the musty air without stirring the festoons of cobwebs and fingers of dead twigs that hung down from above here it was cold clammy cold where the sun had not broken through for five hundred years behind boris hewn from a great outcrop of rock the tomb itself had long since caved in its roof of massive slabs lying in a tangle of masonry in his hurtling rush from above boris must have flown over that jumble of stone or doubtless hed have brained himself perhaps he had anyway for certainly he was feeling and hearing things where there was nothing to be felt or heard or where there should not be anything he pricked up his ears and squinted his eyes in the dusk of this enclosed place butthere was nothing boris tried to stand up managed it on his third attempt he leaned his trembling weight on a sloping slab which had once formed the front lintel of the tombs door then he listened and looked again straining ears and eyes in the gloom but no voice now no mouth dripping blood in the mirror of his mind he sighed his relief his breath rasping in his throat a thickly matted crust of dirt lichens and pine needles fell away from the slab beneath his hands partly revealing a motif or coat of arms boris cleared away more of the grime of centuries and he snatched away his hands at once reeled back tripped and sat down again gasping the arms had consisted of a shield bearing in basrelief a dragon one forepaw raised in threat and riding upon its back a bat with triangular eyes of carnelian and surmounting both of these figures the leering horned head of the devil himself forked tongue protruding and dripping gouts of carnelian blood all three symbols dragon bat devil now came together in boriss mind they became amalgamated as the author of the voice in his head the voice which chose that precise moment of time to speak to him yet again run little man runbegone from here you are too small too young too innocent and i am far too weak and oh so very old on legs that trembled so fearfully he was sure he would fall boris stood up backed away then he turned and fled the place full tilt away from the pineneedlestrewn flagstones which the gnarled roots of centuries were pushing upward away from the tumbled tomb and whatever buried secrets it contained away from the gloom of the place so menacing as to seem to have physical substance and as he went under the dark uncut trees and down the steep hillside torn by whipping branches and bruised from fall after fall so the voice chuckled in his mind like a file on glass or chalk on a blackboard obscene in its ancient knowledge aye run run but never forget me dragosani and be sure i shall not forget you no for i shall wait for you while you grow strong and when your blood has iron in it and you know what you do for it must be of your own free will dragosani then we shall see and now i must sleep bursting from the trees at the foot of the hill bounding a low fence where the top bar was broken down boris flew forward into long grass and thistles and blessed blessed light but even then he did not pause but scrambled to his feet and ran for home only in the middle of the field with no breath left in him to carry him on did he stop collapse to the earth turn his face and look back at the looming hills away in the west the sun was setting its last lances of fire turning the topmost pines to gold but boris knew that in the secret place the treeshrouded glade of the tomb all was clammy and crawly and dark with dread and only then did he think to ask whatwhowho are you and as if from a million miles away carried on the evening breeze which has blown over the hills and fields of transylvania since remembered time began the answer came to him in the back of his mind aaahhh but you know that dragosani you know that ask not who are you but who am i but what does it matter the answer is the same i am your past dragosani and youaremyfuuutuuure herr dragosani whatwhowho are you repeating his question from the dream dragosani came awake eyes gazed at him almost triangular unblinking searing in the unexpected gloom of the room so that for a moment a single second he almost fancied himself back in the glade of the tomb but they were green eyes like a cats dragosani stared at them and they stared back unabashed they were framed by a white face in an oval of ravenblack hair a female face he sat up stretched swung his feet down to the floor the owner of the eyes curtsied peasant fashion inelegantly dragosani thought he sneered at her rising from sleep he was always testy waking before his time as by an intrusion like now he was especially so are you deaf he stretched again pointed directly at her nose i said who are you also why have i been allowed to sleep so late his rigidly pointing finger didnt seem to impress her at all she smiled one eyebrow arching delicately almost insolently tm use herr dragosani use kinkovsi youve been asleep for three hours since you were obviously very tired my father said i should leave you sleeping and prepare your room in the garret that has been done oh so and what do you want of me now dragosani refused to be gracious and this wasnt the same game hed played with her father no for there was that about her which genuinely irritated him she was far too selfassured too knowing for one thing and for another she was pretty she must be ohtwenty it was odd she wasnt married but there was no ring on her finger dragosani shivered his metabolism adjusting not yet fully awake she saw it said its warmer upstairs the sun is still on the top of the house climbing the stairs will get your blood going dragosani looked about the room used his delicate fingertips to brush the crusts of sleep from the corners of his eyes he stood up patted the pocket of his jacket where it hung over the back of the chair where are my keys andmy cases yes she nodded smiling again my father has taken your cases up for you here are your keys when her hand touched his it was cool his was suddenly feverish and this time when he shivered she laughed ah a virgin what dragosani hissed probably giving himself away completely what did you say she turned towards the door walked out into the hall and towards the stairs dragosani furious snatched up his coat and followed her at the foot of the wooden stairs she looked back its a saying hereabouts its just a saying what is he snapped following her up the stairs why that when a boy shivers when hes hot its because hes a virgin a reluctant virgin a bloody stupid saying dragosani scowled she looked back and smiled with you it doesnt apply herr dragosani she said you are not a boy and you dont look at all shy or virginal to me and anyway its just a saying and you are too familiar with your guests he grumbled feeling that hed been let off the hook as if shed taken pity on him on the first landing she waited for him laughed and aid i was being friendly its a cold greeting when people dont talk to each other my father told me to ask you will you eat with us tonight since youre the only one here or will you have a meal in your room ill eat in my room he growled at once if we ever get to it she shrugged turned and started up the second flight here the stairs climbed more steeply use kinkovsi was dressed in a fashion quite out of date in the towns but still affected in the smaller villages and farming communities she wore a slightly longer than kneelength pleated cotton dress gathered in tightly at the waist a shortsleeved black bodice buttoned down the front with puffs at the shoulders and elbows and calfboots of rubber but doubtless they were fine in the farmyard in winter she would also wear stockings to the tops of her thighs but it was not winter he tried to avert his eyes but there was nowhere else to look and damn it she flounced a narrow black v separated the swivelling white globes of her buttocks at the second landing she paused deliberately turned to wait for him at the head of the stairs dragosani stopped dead in his tracks held his breath looking down at him and looking as cool as ever she leaned her weight on one foot more than the other rubbed at the inside of her thigh with her knee flashed her green eyes at him tm sure youll like ithere she said and slowly shifted her weight to the other foot dragosani looked away yes yes im sure ii use took note of the fine film of sweat on his brow she turned her face away and sniffed perhaps she had been right about him in the first place a pity chapter five without any more delay use kinkovsi now took dragosani straight to the garret showed him the bathroom and made as if to leave the rooms were very pretty whitewash and old oak beams with varnished wooden corner cupboards and shelves and dragosani was beginning to feel much better about things as the heat went out of the girl so he warmed a little towards her or more properly towards the as yet unseen kinkovsi family in its entirety it would be extremely gauche of him to eat here alone in his room after the kinkovsis father and daughter both had shown him such hospitality use he called after her on impulse er miss kinkovsi ive changed my mind i would like to eat at the farm yes actually i lived on a farm when i was a boy it wont be strange to me and ill try not to be too strange to the family sowhen do we eat descending the stairs she looked back over her shoulder as soon as you can wash and come down were waiting for you there was no smile on her face now ah then ill be two minutes thank you as her footsteps on the stairs faded into silence he quickly took off his shirt snapped open one of his cases and found shaving gear towel clean pressed trousers and new socks ten minutes later he hurried downstairs out of the guesthouse and was met by kinkovsi at the farmhouse door im sorry im sorry he said i hurried as fast as i could no matter the other took his hand welcome to my house please enter well eat at once inside it was just a little claustrophobic the rooms were large but lowceilinged and the decor was dark and very old romanian in the diningroom at a huge square deal table which could have seated a dozen easily dragosani found himself with a side of his own facing a window the light was such that the face of use who after she had helped her mother serve sat opposite was set in a vague semisilhouette to dragosanis right sat hzak kinkovsi with his wife when her duties were done and to his left two sons of maybe twelve and sixteen years respectively a small family by farming community standards the meal was simple abundant deserving of an accolade dragosani said as much and use smiled while her mother maura beamed delightedly across the table at him saying i thought you would be hungry such a long journey all the way from moscow how long did it take you oh well i did stop to eat he answered smiling and then remembering he frowned i ate twice and both meals were unsatisfactory and very expensive i even slept for an hour or two in the car just this side of kiev and of course i came via galatz bucharest and pitesti chiefly to avoid the mountain passes a long way yes hzak kinkovsi nodded sixteen hundred kilometres as the crow flies said dragosani but im not a crow more than two thousand kilometres according to my cars instruments and all this way just to study a little local history the farmer shook his head they had finished their meal now the old boy sat back with a claypipeful of fragrant tobacco dragosani lit a rothmans one of a pack of two hundred borowitz had purchased for him back in moscow at a special store for the party elite the two boys left to tend to evening chores and the women went off to wash dishes kinkovsis remark about local history had taken dragosani a little by surprise until he remembered that was his assumed reason for being here drawing on his cigarette he wondered how much he dare say on the other hand he was also supposed to be a mortician perhaps it would not seem too strange if his inclinations ran altogether morbid local history in a way yes but i might just as easily have gone into hungary or cut short my journey in moldavia or gone on across the alps to oradea or yugoslavia for that matter or as far east as mongolia they all hold a common interest for me but more so here for this is my birthplace and what is this interest then is it the mountains or perhaps the battles eh my god this country has known some fighting kinkovsi was not merely polite but genuinely interested he poured more farmbrewed wine into dragosanis glass and topped up his own the mountains are part of it i suppose the younger man answered and in this part of the world the battles certainly but the legend in its entirety is far older than any history we can hope to remember its possibly as old as the hills themselves a very mysterious thing and very horrible he leaned across the table stared fixedly into kinkovsis watery eyes well go on dont keep me in suspense what is this mysterious passion this ancient quest of yours the wine was very heady and had robbed dragosani of most of his natural caution outside the sun had gone down and dusk lay everywhere like a mantle of blue smoke from the kitchen came the clinking of dishes and soft muted voices in another room an old clock ticked throatily it was the perfect setting and these country folk being so superstitious and all dragosani couldnt resist it the legend of which i speak he said slowly and distinctly is that of the vampir for a moment kinkovsi said nothing looked stunned and then he rocked back in his chair roared with laughter and slapped his thigh hah the vampir i should have known it every year there are more of you and all looking for dracula dragosani sat astounded he was not sure what reaction hed expected but certainly it was not this more of us he said every year im not sure i understand why now that the restrictions have been relaxed kinkovsi explained now that your precious iron curtain has been opened up a little they come from america from england and france even one or two from germany curious tourists mainly but at other times learned men and scholars and all of them hunting this same lie of a legend what why ive pulled a dozen legs here in this very room by pretending to be afraid of thisthis dracula but what fools surely everyone knows even ignorant peasants like myself that the creature is only a character in a story by a clever englishman written at the turn of the century yes and not more than a month ago there was a film of the same title at the picture house in town oh you cant fool me dragosani why it wouldnt surprise me at all to discover that youre here as a guide for my english party theyre due in on friday and yes they too are searching for the big bad vampir scholars you say dragosani fought hard to hide his confusion learned men kinkovsi stood up switched on the dim electric light where it hung in a battered lampshade from the centre of the ceiling he sucked at his pipe and got it going again scholars yes professors from koln bucharest paris for the last three years all armed with their notebooks photocopies of mouldy old maps and documents their cameras and sketchbooks and oh all sorts of paraphernalia dragosani had recovered himself and their chequebooks too eh he feigned a knowing smile again kinkovsi roared oh yes of course their money too why ive heard that up in the mountain passes there are little village shops which actually sell tiny glass bottles of earth from this draculas castle my god can you believe it itll be frankenstein next ive seen him on film too and hes really frightening now the younger man began to feel angry irrationally he felt himself to be the butt of kinkovsis joke so the snagtoothed simpleton didnt believe in vampires they made him roar with laughter they were like the yeti or the loch ness monster tourist attractions born out of myths and old wives tales and right there and then dragosani made himself a promise that whats all this talk about monsters maura kinkovsi came in from the kitchen drying her hands on her apron you be careful hzak mind how you speak of the devil and you herr dragosani there are still things in the lonely places that people dont understand what lonely places woman her husband chuckled heres a man come down from moscow in little more than a day a journey which once would have taken a week and more and you talk about lonely places theres no room for lonely places any more oh but there is dragosani thought its a terribly lonely place in your grave ive felt it in them a loneliness they dont even know is there until they waken to my touch you know what i mean kinkovsis wife snapped its rumoured that in the mountains there are still villages where they yet put stakes through the hearts of people taken too young or dead from no obvious cause to make sure they dont come back and no one thinks ill of it its just custom so to speak like doffing your hat to a funeral procession now use also appeared what and are you a vampirhunter too herr dragosani but what a dark morbid lot they are surely you cant be one of them no no of course not dragosanis feigned smile was fixed now frozen on his face i was just having a laugh with your father thats all but my joke seems to have backfired he stood up eh said kinkovsi obviously disappointed early night is it i suppose youre still tired pity i was looking forward to talking to you never mind ive jobs aplenty to get on with maybe tomorrow oh well find time for talking im sure said dragosani as he followed his host to the door use said kinkovsi take a torch and see the herr to the guesthouse will you the dusk is worse than darkest midnight when youre not sure of your step the girl did as she was told and guided dragosani across the farmyard out of the gate and into the guesthouse there she switched on the lights for the stairs before saying goodnight she told him herr dragosani there is a button beside your bed if you require anything in the night just press it unfortunately it will probably wake up my parents too a better way would be to open your curtains halfway which i would see from my own bedroom window what said dragosani pretending to be slow on the uptake in the middle of the night but as to her meaning use kinkovsi left little doubt of that i dont sleep very well she said my room is on the ground floor i like to open my window and smell the night air sometimes i even go out that way and walk in the silver moonlight usually about am dragosani nodded his head but made no answer she was standing very close to him before she could further clarify the situation he turned away from her and hurried up the stairs he could feel her mocking eyes on him until he turned the corner onto the first landing in his room dragosani quickly closed the curtains at the window unpacked his cases ran himself a bath full of water heated by a gas jet the water steamed invitingly adding salts dragosani stripped himself naked in the bath he lay and soaked luxuriating in the heat and languid swirl of the water when he moved his arms in what seemed a very short while he found himself nodding his chin on his chest the water growing cold stirring himself he finished bathing and prepared for bed it was only pm when he slipped between the sheets but within a minute or two he was fast asleep just before midnight he woke up saw a vertical white band of moonlight deep and inches wide like a luminous shaft streaming into the room where the curtains missed coming together remembering what use kinkovsi had said he got up took a safety pin and firmly pinned the curtains shut he halfwished it could be different more than half butit couldnt it wasnt that he hated women or was frightened of them he didnt and wasnt it was more that he couldnt understand them and with so many other things to do so much else to learn and try to understand he simply had no time to waste on dubious or untried pleasures or so he told himself and anyway his needs were different to those of other men his emotions less volatile except when he needed them to be but what hed lost in common sensuality he more than made up for in uncommon sensitivity though even that would seem a paradox to anyone who knew his work as for those other things he had to learn or at least try to understand they were legion borowitz was happy with him the way he was yes but dragosani was not he felt that at the moment his talent was onedimensional that it lacked any real depth very well he would give it the very greatest depth a depth unplumbed for half a millennium out there in the night lay one who had secrets unique one who in life commanded monstrous magics and who even now in death was undead and there for dragosani lay the fount of all knowledge only when he had drained that well would there be time for the rest of his sorely neglected education it was midnight now the witching hour dragosani wondered how far the sleepers dreams reached out beyond the borders of the dark glade wondered if they might meet halfway the moon was up and full and all the stars were bright high in the mountains wolves prowled and howled even now as they had five hundred years ago all the auspices were right he lay back in his bed lay very still and pictured the shattered tomb where roots groped like fossil tentacles and the trees leaned inward to hide their secret he pictured it and out loud but also in his mind said old one ive come back i bring you hope in return for knowledge its the third year and only four remain how goes it with you outside in the night a wind sprang up blowing down from the mountains trees soughed as their branches bowed a little and dragosani heard a sighing behind the rafters over his head but as quickly as it had risen the wind fell and in its place ahhh dragosaaani is it you my son are you then returned to me in my solitude dragosaaani who else would it be old devil yes it is dragosani i have grown stronger i am become a small power in the world but i want more you hold the ultimate secrets of power which is why i have returned and why i will continue to return untiluntil four more years dragosani and thenthen you shall sit upon my right hand and i shall teach you many things four years dragosani four years ahhh long years for me old dragon for i must wake each morning and sleep each night and count all the hours between and time is slow but for you how has it been old one this last year it would have been the merest moment fleeting speeding gone had you not disturbed me dragosani but you have given meyearnings here i lay and for fifty years hated and lusted for revenge on them that put me here and for fifty more i desired only to be up and about my business which is to put down my enemies and thenthen i thought me but my murderers are no more they are bones in graves of their own now or dust blown on the winds and in another hundred yearswhat of even the sons of my enemies then ah well might i ask what of the legions who came up against these mountains in ages past and met my fathers fathers waiting what of the lombard and the bulgar the avarand the turk ah a brave fighter in his time the turk he was my enemy but no more and so five hundred years fleeting by for i was forgetting the glories just as a grandfather forgets his own infancy until i had forgotten almost until i was forgotten almost and what then when there was nothing left of me but a word in a book and when the book itself crumbled to dust why then surely i would have no reason to be at all and perhaps glad of it and then you came a mere boy but a boy whose namewasdragosaaaniiii as the voice faded so the wind sprang up again the two merging and dying away together dragosani thought of what was to be done and shivered in his bed but this was his chosen course this his destiny and fearing that he had lost the other he called out urgently old one you of the dragonbanner of the bat and the dragon and the devil are you there where else would i be dragosani the voice seemed to mock yes am here i quicken in my forsaken place in this earth which was my life i thought i was forgotten but a seed was sown and blossomed and you remembered and knew me and by your name so i knew you dragosaaaniiii tell me again dragosani was eager tell me how it was my mother my father their coming together tell me it twice you have heard it the voice in his head sighed and would you hear it again do you hope to seek them out then i cannot help you their names were of no importance to me i knew them not knew nothing of them except the heat of their blood aye and of that i tasted the merest drop a small pink splash but afterwards there was that of them in me and that of me in them which came out in you dont ask after them dragosani i am your father would you walk on earth and breathe and slake your thirst again old one would you slaughter your enemies and drive them back as before as your ancestors before you and this time as your own man not merely a sellsword to ungrateful dracul princelings if you would then trade with me tell me of my parents sometimes a bargain sounds more like a threat dragosani and would you threaten me the voice hissed in his head like ice on the strings of an illtuned violin you dare speak to me you dare remind me of vlads radus draculs and mirceas you call me a sellsword boy in the end my socalled masters feared me more than the turk himself which is why they weighed me down in iron and silver and buried me in this secret place in these same cruciform hills which i had defended with my blood for them i fought aye for the sake of their holy cross their christianity but now i fight to be free of it their treachery is my pain their cross the dagger in my heart a dagger which i can draw for you your enemies have come again old devil and none to drive them out save you and there you lie impotent the crescent of the turk is grown into the sickle of another and what he cannot cut down he hammers flat i am a wallach no less than you whose blood is older than wallachia itself nor will i suffer the invader well and now theres a new invader and our leaders are puppets once more so how is it to be are you content or would you fight again the bat the dragon the devil against the hammer and the sickle very well i will tell you how it was and how youbecame it wasspringtime i could feel it in the soil the growing time the yearbut what are years to me a quartercentury ago anyway it was said dragosani the war would soon be at an end the szgany were here fled into the mountains for their refuge as theyve done right down the centuries refugees from the german war machine they were here in their thousands and the transylvanian plateau shielded them as always the germans had been rounding them up szgany romany szekely gypsy call them what you will all over europe for slaughter along with the jews in the deathcamps stalin had deported many minority peoples alleged collaborators from the crimea and caucasus thats when it was and thats when it stopped spring but we had surrendered more than six months earlier than that anyway the end was in sight the germans were on the run by the end of april hitler had killed himself i know only what you have told me of that surrender you say hah i am not surprised but aieee more than four and a half centuries and still the invader came and i was not there to drink the wine of war oh yes you stir old yearnings in me dragosani anyway it was springtime when these two came i suspect that they were in flight perhaps from war who can say anyway they were very young and of the old blood gypsies aye in my day as a great boyar thousands such had worshipped me owed me allegiance more than the puppet basarabs and vlads and vladislavs and would they worship me still i wondered and did i yet have influence over them my tomb was broken down then just as it is now unvisited since the day i was interred except in the first halfcentury by priests who cursed the ground where i lay and so they came one night as the moon rose over the mountains young ones szekely a boy and a girl it was spring and warm but the nights were cold they had blankets and a small lamp with oil also they had fear and passion it was that i think which stirred me from my slumbers or perhaps i had been half awake anyway after all engines of war were rumbling and their thunder was in the earth perhaps it was that which stirred these old bones i felt what they were doing in four and a half centuries and more i had learned to recognise the fall of a leaf from a tree the timid landing of a woodcocks feather they put a blanket across two leaning slabs forming a shelter they lit the lamp to see each other also for warmth hah szekely they didnt need a lamp to be warm theyinterested me for years i had called for centuries and no one came no one answered perhaps they were kept away by priests by warnings by myths that had grown into legends down the long years or perhaps in life my excesses had been you have told me dragosani how many of my greatest deeds are now accorded to the vlads and how i am reduced to a ghost for frightening children more than this my very name will have been stricken from the old records for that was their way in those days if they feared something they destroyed it and pretended it had never been ah but did they think i was unique of my sort i was not i am not i was one of a few who once were a great many aye and word of my plight must surely have found its way to the others for hundreds of years it had angered me that someone had not come to release or at least avenge me and when at last someone did comegypsies szkeleys the girl was frightened and he could not calm her i calmed her i crept inside her mind gave her strength to face her fears whatever they were and to meet him in a hot collision of flesh ahhh yes and she was a virgin her maidenhead was intact i might have died again in my grave from lusting after it a maidenhead intact to quote an old old book of lies how are the mighty fallen i had broken two thousand in my day one way or another ha ha ha and they called young vlad the impaler sothey were lovers but not yet in the fullest sense of the word he was a boy a mere pup and never breached a bitch and she a virgin and so i got into his mind too ah and i bequeathed the night to them i drew strength from them and they from me one night they had from me just one for before the dawn they left after that i know no more of them except that she bore me said dragosani and left me on a doorstep to be found the answer to that was a while in coming sighing in a wind little more than a breeze now the old one in the ground was tired he had little more of strength left in him not even for thinking the earth held him in its hardpacked womb and turned on its inexorable axis and lulled him but at last sighingly yesss yes but at least she knew where to bring you she was a gypsy remember a wanderer and yet when you were born she brought you back here she brought youhome she did that because she knew your real father dragosani you might say that of my whole life which was bloody beyond measure that one night was a true labour of love aye and my only tribute a single splash of blood the merest drop dragosaaaniiii my mothers blood your mothers splashed on the earth where i lay but such a precious drop for it was your blood too and runs in your veins even now and then as a child it brought you back to me dragosani was quiet his head full of thoughts visions pseudomemories evoked of the others words in his head finally he said ill come to you tomorrow well talk more then as you will my son sleep nowfather a last gust of wind rattling a loose tile and with it a long last sighing sleep well dragosaaaniiii and some ten minutes later down in the farmhouse use kinkovsi got out of bed went to her window and looked out she thought it was the wind that woke her up but there wasnt the slightest breath of breeze it made no difference she had intended to wake up just before am anyway outside all was silvery moonlight but in the guesthouse garret boris dragosanis curtains were drawn tighter than shed ever seen them and his light was out the next day was wednesday dragosani ate a quick breakfast and drove off in his car before am he took the road which led him close to the hills in the shape of a cross down in a wide depression to the west of those hills lay the farm where hed spent his childhood new people had it now for the last nine or ten years dragosani found a vantage point on a littleused track and looked at the place for a while it no longer did anything for him maybe a very small lump in his throat which was probably dust or pollen from the dry summer air then he turned his back on the farm and looked at the hills he knew exactly where to look as if his eyes were the lenses of binoculars they seemed to focus on the place blowing it up large and with incredible clarity and detail he could almost see beneath the green canopy of the trees to the tumbled slabs and the earth beneath and if he tried hard enough maybe even deeper than that he dragged his eyes away it would be useless to go there anyway before nightfall or late evening at the earliest and then he remembered another evening when he had been a small boy after that first time when he was seven it had been six months before he went to the place again he had been out with his sledge a dog bounding by his side bubba was a farm dog really but where boris went he always had to be there was a slope on the other side of the farm towards the village a place where the kids snowballed and sledged each winter boris should be there but he knew where there was a better run the firebreak of course he also knew as he had always known that these hills were forbidden and since the summer he had known why people sometimes dreamed funny things there things which stuck in their minds and came back in the night to bother them that must be it but knowing it didnt stop him rather it drew him on now with the snow deep and crisp the hills didnt look so forbidding and the firebreak made for nearperfect sledging boris was good at it hed come here last winter too alone and even the winter before that when he was very small but today he used the slope only once and then halfway down hed looked across to his right to see if he could pick out the spot under the trees after that he left the sledge at the bottom of the hill and he and bubba had climbed up under the pines stark black against the snow he was going back to the tomb to satisfy himself that that was all it was just the burial place of some old and longforgotten landowner and nothing more that first time had been a bad dream after hed bumped his head when he was thrown from his cardboard cart and anyway he now had bubba for company and for his protection or would have bubba except the dog gave a whining worried bark as they approached the secret place and ran off after that boris saw him once through a break in the trees down at the bottom of the slope near the sledge wagging his tail nervously in sporadic bursts and offering up the occasional bark then at last he was there and the place was just as he remembered it if anything it was even darker for snow on the higher branches shut out most of what little light would normally penetrate and here where the winter had been kept out the ground was black to eyes used to a white glare airless as ever the place seemed and what air there was as before seemed stirred by unseen shapes and presences oh certainly it was a place for bad dreams especially in the evening and evening approached even now distantly heard with only the edge of his conscious mind boris was aware of bubbas occasional barking like frozen gunshots cracking the air wishing the dog would be quiet he scrambled to where the slabs leaned and the fallen lintel bore the ancient shield now that his eyes were growing accustomed to the gloom y and with his cold fingers to help him trace the batdragondevil symbols carved in stone he remembered the voice of uttermost evil which he had thought to hear last time he stood in this place a dream but such a real dream it had kept him from the wooded slope for half a year and what was he afraid of anyway an old tomb broken down the whispers of ignorant peasants their mumblings and obscure signs a fancied voice like the taste of something rotten in his mind rotten yes but so insistent and how often since then had it come to him in the night in his dreams when he was safe in his bed whispering never forget me dragosaaniiii on impulse out loud he suddenly called out see i didnt forget i came back i came here to your place no to my place my secret place his breath plumed in the air in bursts which turned white and drifted upward dispersing and boris listened with every fibre of his being blue icicles depended from the rim of a leaning slab like gleaming teeth the pine needles formed a frozen crust beneath his pigskinbooted feet his last breath fell to earth in frozen crystals before he drew another and still he listened butnothing the sun was sinking boris must go he turned from the tomb his words caught in the frozen crystals of his breath sent down their message into the earth ahhh it might have been the sighing of a wind in the high branches but it rooted boris to the spot like nails through his feet you he heard himself saying to no one to nothing to the gloom is ityou ahhh dragosaaniiii and has the iron crept into your blood then boy is that why youve returned boris had rehearsed this moment a hundred times his response his reaction should the voice ever speak to him again in the secret place bravado he remembered none of it now well and has the winter frozen your tongue to your teeth say it in your head if you cant speak it boy what are you a vacuum the wolves howl over the passes even now the winds likewise above the seas and mountains even the snow in its falling seems to sigh and you so full of words bursting with questions thirsting for knowledge are you struck dumb boris had meant to say these hills are mine this place is mine alone you are merely buried here so be quiet and he had meant to say it boldly just as hed rehearsed it but now what he said and stumblingly was this are youreal who what how are you how can you be how can the mountains be how can the full moon be the mountains grow and are eroded the moon waxes and wanes they are and so am i for all that he failed to understand boris grew bolder he at least knew where this being was in the ground and how could he harm anyone from down there if you are real show yourself to me do you play with me you know it cannot be would you have me put on flesh i cannot do that not yet also i see that your blood is yet water yes and it would freeze like the ice on my tomb if you saw me dragosani are youa dead thing i am an undead thing i know you boris suddenly clapped his cold hands youre what my stepfather calls imagination youre my imagination he says i have a strong one and so you have but my nature isother than that no i am not merely a thing of your mind do not flatter yourself boris tried hard to understand finally he asked but what do you do i wait for what for you my son but im here it grew darker in a moment as if the trees had leaned closer together shutting out the light the touch of the unseen presences was featherlight but suddenly bitter as rime boris had almost forgotten his fear but now it flooded back and because it is a true adage that familiarity breeds contempt he had almost forgotten just how much evil that voice in his head contained now he was reminded of that too child do not tempt me it would be quick it would be sweet and it would be futile there is not enough of you dragosani and your blood lacks substance i hunger and would feast and what are you but a nibble iim going now aye begone come back when youre a man and not merely an irritation and over his shoulder as he quickly tremblingly left the place and headed for the clean snow of the firebreak boris called back youre only a dead thing you know nothing what can you tell me i am an undead thing i know everything that needs to be known i can tell you everything about what about life about death about undeath i dont want to know those things but you will you will and when will you tell me these things when you can understand dragosani you said i was your future you said you were my past thats a lie i have no past im just a boy oh ha ha ha so you are so you are but in your thin blood runs the history of a race dragosani i am in you and you are in me and our line isancient i know all you want to know all you will want to know aye and this knowledge shall be yours and you shall be one of an elite and ancient order of beings boris was halfway to the break now until this point and from the moment he fled his conversation had been part bravado part terror like a man whistling in the dark now feeling safer he became curious again clinging to the bole of a tree and turning to look back he asked why do you offer anything to me what do you want of me nothing which you will not give freely only that which is offered freely i want something of your youth your blood your life dragosani that you may live in me and in returnyour life shall be as long perhaps even longer than mine boris sensed something of the lust the greed the eternal endless craving he understood or misunderstood and the darkness behind him seemed to swell expand rush upon him like some black poisonous cloud he turned from it fled saw ahead the dazzling white of firebreak through the black boles of trees you want to kill me he sobbed you want me dead like you no i want you undead there is a difference i am that difference and so are you its in your blood its in your try name dragosaaniiii and as the voice faded to silence boris emerged into the open space of the firebreak in the fading light he felt fear falling from him like a weight felt strangely uplifted so that he held himself erect as he descended to the foot of the hill and found his sledge bubba had waited there patiently but when boris reached out a hand to pat him the dog snarled and drew back the hair rising in a stiff ridge all along his back and after that bubba would have nothing at all to do with him under dragosanis gaze the snow faded from memory and the slopes turned green again the old scar of the firebreak was there still but merging into the naturalcontours of the hill under the weight of almost twenty years of growth saplings were grown into trees now their foliage thickening and in another twenty years it would be difficult to tell that the firebreak had ever been there in the first place dragosani supposed that somewhere in the land ordinances governing these parts there must be a clause which still forbade farming or hewing or gaming on the green cross of the hills yes for despite old kinkovsis lack of more typical peasant superstition the old fears still lived the taboos were still there even if their origins were forgotten they still existed as surely as the thing in the ground existed laws which were intended to isolate it now protected it preserved it the thing in the ground that was how he thought of it not as he but it the old devil the dragon the vampir the real vampire and not merely a creature of sensational novels and films still there lying in the ground waiting again dragosani let his mind slip back through the years when he was nine the local school in lonesti had closed and his stepfather had boarded him out to a school in ploiesti there in a very short time it had been discovered that his intelligence was of a high order and the state had stepped in and sent him to a college in bucharest always on the lookout for talent in the young of their satellite nations soviet officials from the ministry of education had eventually found him there and recommended that he go on to higher education in moscow what they meant by higher education was in fact intensive indoctrination following which he would one day be sent back to romania as a puppet official in a puppet government but before that when he had first learned that he was to board in ploiesti and that he could only come home once or twice a year then he had gone back to the dark glade under the trees to ask the advice of the thing in the ground now he went there again on the wings of memory and saw himself as he had been a boy sobbing into his hands where he kneeled beside a broken slab and poured his tears over the basrelief motif of batdragondevil what knowing i seek iron and strong meat you offer me salt and gruel can this be you dragosani who has the seed of greatness in him was i mistaken then and am i doomed to lie here forever tm to go to school in ploiesti im to live there and only come back now and then and this is the cause of your grief yes then you are a girl how would you hope to learn the ways of the world here in the shadow of the mountains why even the birds that fly see more and farther than you have seen the world is wide dragosani and to know its ways you must walk them and ploiesti but i know this ploiesti it is distant by only a hard days riding two at the most and is this a good reason to weep but i dont want to go i did not want to be put in the ground but they put me here dragosani i have seen a sister with her head cut off with a stake through her breast and her eyes hanging on her cheeks and i did not weep no but i pursued her payers and skinned them and made them eat their skins and i raped them with hot irons and before they could die soaked them in oil and put them to the torch and hurled them from the cliffs at brasov only then did i cry tears of sheerest joy what and did i call you my son dragosani im not your son boris snapped tears angrily flying im no ones son and i have to go to ploiesti and its not two days away but only three or four hours in a car you pretend you know so much but youve never even seen a car have you no i never have until now now i see it in your mind dragosani ive seen a great many things in your mind some have surprised me but none have awed me so your stepfathers car will make it easier for you to get to ploiesti eh good and it will make it easier for you to come back again when the time comes but now listen go to school in ploiesti become as clever as your teachers more clever and when you return come back as a scholar and as a man i lived for five hundred years and was a great scholar it was necessary dragosani my learning stood me in good stead then and will again one year after i rise i shall be the greatest power in this world oh yes once i would have been satisfied with wallachia transylvania rumania call it what you will and before that it was enough that the mountains were mine which no one else wanted but the world is a smaller place now and i would be greater when i took part in mans wars i learned the joy of the conqueror so that next time i would conquer all and you too shall be great dragosani but all in good time something of the importance of what the voice said got through to boris behind its words he sensed the raw power of the creature which issued them you want me to bea scholar yes when i walk this world again i would speak with learned men not village idiots oh i shall teach you dragosani and far more than any tutors in ploiesti much knowledge you shall have from me and in my turn i shall doubtless learn from you but how shall you teach me if you yourself are ignorant youve said as much before said boris but what can you teach me you know so little of things as they are now how can you know more youve been dead undead in the ground anyway for five hundred years you said so yourself there came a throaty chuckle in boriss head no fool you dragosani well and perhaps you are right ah but there are other seats of knowledge and other sorts of knowledge very well i have a gift for you a giftand a sign that indeed i can teach you things things you cannot possibly imagine a gift indeed go quickly now and find me a dead thing a dead thing boris shivered what sort of dead thing any sort a beetle a bird a mouse it makes little difference find me a dead thing or kill me a live thing and bring the body to me give it to me as a gift and you in turn shall have your gift i saw a dead bird at the foot of the slope a pigeon chick i think it must have fallen from the nest will that do hah and what dire secret has a pigeon chick pray tell butyes it will suffice if only to prove a point bring it to me in twenty minutes boris was back laying the poor limp body on the dark earth near the broken fallen slabs and again the cynical snort heard in his head hah small tribute indeed but no matter now tell me dragosani would you learn the ways of this small dead thing it has no ways its dead before it died would you know the things it knew it knew nothing it was a fledgling what could it know i knew many things now listen carefully spread the wings pluck out the down and small feathers and feel them smell them rub them between your fingers and listen to them do it boris did as instructed but clumsily without feeling or expectation mites and fleas and a small beetle scurried fleeing the small corpse no no not like that close your eyes let me more fully into your mind now like thisthere boris was in a high place he felt a swaying and heard the soughing of high branches overhead the beckoning blue vault of the sky opened outward forever he felt he could fall upward into that sky and never stop vertigo overtook him he fled back to his own mind dropped the dead bird and clutched at the earth ahhahhh said the devil in the ground and again ahhahhh what and was the nest not to your liking dragosani but no dont stop theres more take up the bird squeeze its body feel it pliant in your hands feel the small bones under the skin the tiny skull lift it to your face open your nostrils smell it breathe it in let it instruct you here let me help boris was not alone he was a twinthing and he was not boris the sensation was weird frightening he clung tightly to the memory of boris rejected the other no no let yourself go enter the thing be one with it know what it knew like this there was warmtha hard firm platform beneath soft warm down overheadsky no longer bright and blue but darkmany white pricks of light which were starsthe night was stilla warm weight pressing down wings coveringthe twinthing snugglingsomething close by a sound a hootingthe warm body above the parent body pressing down protectively wings closing tighter tremblinga slow heavy beating of the air growing louder passing fading growing faintagain the hooting farther afieldthe owl hunted smaller prey tonightthe parent body relaxing a little her rapidly beating heart slowingbright points of light filling the skysoft downwarmth now break the body dragosani tear it open crush the skull between your fingers and listen to the vapours of the brain look at it in your hands the entrails the guts and feathers and blood and bones taste it dragosani use all your senses touch taste see hear smell use all five and you will discover a sixth time to flytime to gothe air calling lifting the small new feathers and beckoningand the twinbeing already gone flownthe parent beings eager frustrated fluttering guiding calling come fly like this like thisthe earth a dizzy distance below and the nest swaying in the wind part of the fledgling boris launched himself with it from the shuddering platform of twigs which was the nest for one brief moment he knew the triumph of flightand in the next knew failure a squally blustery day the wind caught him unawares side on after that utter confusion rapidly turning to nightmare spinning tumbling an untried wing catching in the fork of a branch twisting and breaking the agony of hanging by broken wing and then of falling fluttering plummeting and the final sharp crack of a small skull upon a stone boris snapped back into himself snapped out of the spell saw the mess of a thing he held in his hands there said the old devil in the ground and do you hill think i can teach you nothing dragosani how is this for knowledge and was there ever a rarer gift in all my lifetime i knew only a handful with a talent such as this and you have taken to it as a why as a fledgling takes to flight welcome to a small ancient very select fraternity indeed dragosani the mess slid from boriss hands stained the earth left slime on his palms and slim fingers what he said his jaw hanging open clammy sweat suddenly starting from his brow what boris dragosani necromancer then the horror of the thing bursting over him boris had screamed long and loud and once more hed fled and fled in such panic that later he could remember very little of it except the pounding of his feet and heart but he couldnt run from his gift which from that moment on had gone with him or perhaps it wasnt the horror of what he had done which robbed his mind of the memory of his terrorflight that time but something else which came between his screaming and the flight proper at any rate vague pictures of that something had remained in his mind ever since and would spring to its surface on occasion when he least expected them as now the gloomy glade of the tomb and the shattered corpse spread in a welter of feathers and guts and limbs wrenched from their sockets and a thin and leprous tentacle thrusting upward through the scummy earth pushing aside soil pine needles clots of lichen and chips of stone leprous yes and composed of something other than flesh but with scarlet veins pulsing and thenand thena crimson eye forming in its tip and avidly scanning the ground the eye dissolving away and a reptilian mouth and jaws taking its place so that now the tentacle seemed a blind smooth mottled snake a snake whose forked scarlet tongue flickered over the pitiful remains whose fangs gleamed white and needle sharp and whose jaws chomped slaveringly until every last morsel was devoured then the swift withdrawal and the spell broken as the pulsing sickening member was sucked back down out of sight into the naked earth a small tribute the thing in the ground had called it when dragosani was done with memories and daydreams he drove into the town whose name he bore between the railway stockyards and the river on the outskirts of town he found the trade and barter market which had flourished there on wednesdays since a time when the town was the merest huddle of shacks indeed dragosani might well have sprung up from this marketplace this meeting place and more than that it had been a fording place now there were bridges across the river several but in olden times the crossing had been by ford it was here those long centuries ago that the invading turk pillaging and burning as he came from the east met the river where it flowed down out of the carpatii meridionali to meet the danube here too the hunyadi and after him the princes of wallachia had come down from their castles to call together the fighting men under their banners and set territorial voevods over them warlords to defend the lands against the incursion of the marauding turk the banner these warlords had fought under was that of the dragon immemorial seal and sigil of a defender especially a christian defender against the turks and now dragosani found himself wondering if that were perhaps the source of the towns name certainly it was the source of the dragon on the shield in the place of the forgotten tomb in the marketplace he bought a live piglet which he took away in a sack with holes for ventilation he took it back to his car and put it in the boot then drove back out of town and found a quiet track off the main road there he opened the sack a little way broke a chloroform capsule into the boot slammed the lid shut and left it that way for a count of fifty another ten minutes saw the boot flushed out following which the unfortunate pig went back inside again dragosani certainly didnt want the animal dying on him not just yet anyway by early afternoon he had driven back up out of the lowlying river valley and into the foothills where once again he parked the car within a few hundred yards of the forbidden cruciform hills in bright sunlight but keeping low and sticking to a hedgerow he made his way to the densely wooded slopes and began to climb there under the cover of the frowning pines he felt more at ease as he toiled towards the secret place the piglet in its sack was slung over his shoulder completely oblivious to a world from which it would soon depart at the site of the tomb dragosani laid the doped animal in a hollow between twining roots tethered it to the bole of a tree and tossed the sack over it for warmth there were plenty of wild pigs in the hills if the piglet came to in his absence and made a commotion anyone hearing it would believe it to be one of the wild variety not that that was likely just as in dragosanis boyhood the fields were deserted and grown wild for a mile and more around at any rate that was where he left the piglet returning to his lodgings in midafternoon booking an early evening meal and sleeping through the rest of the day there was still more than an hours light when use kinkovsi woke him with a substantial meal on a tray leaving him on his own to enjoy it and wash it down with a quart of local beer she hardly spoke to him at all seemed surly glanced at him with a sort of sneer that was all right indeed it was very much to his liking or so he tried to tell himself but as she left his room his eyes were drawn to the jiggle of her hips and he was given to reconsider his attitude for a peasant she was a very attractive woman and again he wondered why she hadnt married surely she was too young to be a widow and even then shed still wear her ring wouldnt she it was curious chapter six twenty minutes before sundown dragosani was back in the secret place the piglet had regained consciousness but did not yet have the strength to stand up wasting no time and wanting no distractions dragosani knocked the struggling animal out again with a single blow of a kgbissue cosh then he settled down and waited smoked a cigarette watched the light fading as the sun sank lower and lower here where the pines grew straight as spears in a ring about the ancient tomb the only real light came from directly overhead and that was filtered down through an interlacing mesh of branches but as night drew on so the first stars began to come out visible in advance to dragosani much as they would be to a man in a deep well and at last as he ground out his cigarette and the gloom closed that much more tightly around him ahhh dragosaaniiii the unseen presences were there as always springing up from nowhere invisible wraiths whose fingers brushed dragosanis face as if seeking to know him to be sure of his identity he shivered and said yes its me and ive brought something for you a gift oh and what is this gift and what would you have from me in return now dragosani was eager and made no effort to hide it the gift isa small tribute you shall have it later before i go as for now ive talked to you in this place old dragon many times and yet youve never really told me anything oh im not saying that youve deceived or misled me just that ive learned very little from you now that may well have been my own fault i may not have asked the right questions but in any case its something i want to put right there are things you know which i desire to know there once was a time when you hadpowers i suspect youve retained many of them which i dont know about powers oh yes many powers great powers i want the secret of those powers i want the powers themselves all that you knew and know now i want to know in short you desire to bewamphyr the word and the way it was uttered in his mind were such that dragosani could not suppress a shudder even he dragosani himself necromancer examiner of the dead felt its alien awe as if the word in itself conveyed something of the awful nature of the being or beings it named wamphyr he repeated it and then here in romania he quickly went on there have always been legends and in the last hundred years theyve spread abroad personally ive known what you are for many years now old devil here they call you vampir and in the western world you are a vampire there youre a creature in tales to be told at night by the fireside stories to frighten the children to bed and stir the morbid imagination but now i want to know what you really are i want to separate fact from fiction i want to take the lies out of the legend he sensed a mental shrug then i say it again you would be wamphyr there is no other way to know it all but you have a history dragosani insisted five hundred years youve lain here yes i know that but what of the five hundred before you died died but i did not die they might have murdered me yes for it was in their power to do so but they chose to the punishment they chose was greater far they merely buried me here undead but that asideyou want to know my history yes its a long one and bloody it will take time we have time plenty of it said dragosani but he sensed a restlessness frustration in the unseen presences it was as if something warned him not to try his luck too far it was not in the undead things nature to be pressured but finally i can tell you something of my history yes i can tell you what i did but not how it was done not in so many words knowing my origins my roots will not help you to be of the wamphyri nor even to understand them i can no more explain how to be wamphyr than a fish could explain how to be a fish or a bird how to be a bird if you tried to be a fish you would drown launch yourself from the face of a cliff like a bird and you would fall and be crushed and if the ways of simple creatures such as these are unknowable how then the ways of the wamphyri may i learn nothing of your ways then dragosani was growing angry he shook his head nothing of your powers i dont think i believe you you showed me how to speak to the dead so why cant you show me the rest of it ah no you are mistaken dragosani i showed you how to be a necromancer which is a human talent it is in the main a forgotten art among men to be sure but nevertheless necromancy is an art old as the race itself as for speaking to the dead that is something else entirely very few men ever mastered that for a skill but i talk to you no my son i talk to you because you are one of mine and remember i am not dead i am undead even i could not talk to the dead examine them yes but never talk to them the difference lies in ones approach in their acceptance of one and in their willingness to converse as for necromancy there the corpse is unwilling the necromancer extracts the information like a torturer like a dentist drawing good teeth suddenly dragosani felt that the conversation was going in circles stop he cried you are deliberately obscuring the issue i am answering your questions as best i might very well then dont tell me how to be a wamphyr but tell me what a wamphyr is tell me your history tell me what you did in your life if not how you did it tell me of your origins after a moment as you will but firstfirst you tell me what you know or think you know of the wamphyri tell me about these myths these old wives tales which youve heard on which you appear to be something of an authority then as you say we shall separate the lies from the legend dragosani sighed leaned his back against a slab lit another cigarette he still felt he was getting the runaround but there seemed little he could do about it it was dark now but his eyes were accustomed to the gloom anyway he knew every twisted root and broken slab at his feet the piglet snorted fitfully then lay still again well take it step by step he growled a mental shrug very well lets start with this a vampire is a thing of darkness loyal subject of satan ha ha ha shaitan was first of all the wamphyri in our legends you understand things of darkness yes in that night is our element we aredifferent but there is a saying that at night all cats are grey thus at night our differences are not so great or are not seen to be so great and before you ask it let me tell you this that because of our proclivity for darkness the sun is harmful to us harmful it would destroy you turn you to dust what that is a myth no nothing so terrible but even weak sunlight will sicken us just as strong sunlight sickens you you fear the cross symbol of christianity i hate the cross to me it is the symbol of all lies all treachery but fear it no are you telling me that if a cross were held against you a holy crucifix it wouldnt burn your flesh my flesh might burn with loathing in the moment before i struck dead the one who held the cross dragosani took a deep breath you wouldnt deceive me your doubts tax my patience dragosani cursing under his breath for a moment finally dragosani continued you cast no reflection neither in a mirror nor in water similarly you have no shadow ah a simple misconception but not without its sources the reflection i cast is not always the same and my shadow does not always conform to my shape dragosani frowned do you mean that you are fluid unsolid that you can change your shape i did not say that then explain what you did say now it was the turn of the old one in the ground to sigh will you leave nothing of mystery dragosani no im sure you wont but now dragosani was doing some thinking for himself i believe this may answer two questions in one he said while the other pondered your ability to change into a bat or a wolf for example thats part of the legend too if it is legend are you a shapechanger he sensed the others amusement no but i might seem to be such a creature in fact there is no such thing as a shapechanger not that i ever encountered thenit seemed that the old one had come to a decision very well i will tell you what do you know of the power of hypnotism hypnotism dragosani repeated continuing to frown but then his jaw fell open as he saw the truth or what might be the truth in a sudden flash of realisation hypnotism he gasped mass hypnotism thats how you did it of course but while it fools the mind it cannot fool a mirror and while i might appear to be a fluttering bat or loping wolf still my shadow is that of a man ah the mystique falls away eh dragosani dragosani remembered the leprous tentacle again but said nothing he had long ago decided that dead things which talked in mens minds might also be masters of deception anyway he had other questions to ask you cant cross running water it drowns you hmmm i may have an answer to that one too in my life i was a mercenary voevod and aye i would not cross running water it was my strategy when the invader came i waited and let him cross the water and slaughtered him on my side perhaps this is where this legend arose on the banks of the dunarea the motrul and the siretul and i have seen those rivers run red dragosani while the other offered his explanation dragosani had been building up to the big one now without pause he tossed it in you drink the blood of the living it is a lust in you which drives you on without blood you die your utterly evil nature demands that you feed on the lives of others the blood is the life ridiculous as for evil it is a state of mind if you accept evil you must accept good perhaps i am out of touch with your world dragosani but in mine there was very little of good and as for drinking blood do you take meat and wine of course you do you devour the flesh of beasts and the blood of the grape and is that evil show me a creature which lives which does not devour lesser lives this legend springs from my cruelties which i admit and from all the blood i spilled in my lifetime as to why i was so cruel it seemed to me that if my enemies believed i was a monster then that they would be reluctant to come against me and so i was a monster if my legend has lasted so long and grown so fraught with terror who may say i was wrong that doesnt answer my question i and iam tired now do you know what it takes from me this sort of inquisition and do you think i am one of your corpses dragosani a suitable case for necromantic examination at that a thought came into dragosanis mind but he suppressed it at once one last question he said darkly very well if you must the legend has it that the vampires bite turns ordinary men into vampires if you were to draw my blood old one would i become as you undead a long pause through which dragosani sensed something of confusion a mental scrabbling for an answer and finally there was a time in the worlds youth when the forests were alive with great bats as they were with all sorts of creatures disease destroyed most of them a specific disease and horrible but some learned to live with it in my day a species existed which drew the blood of other animals including men since the bats were carriers of the disease they passed it on to those they bit and the infected victims were seen to take on certain characteristics which stop said dragosani you mean the vampire bat which still exists in central and south america even today obviously you do the disease is rabies buti dont see the connection the thing in the ground chose to ignore his scepticism said america a new land dragosani explained they hadnt found it in your day its vast and rich andvery very powerful ah you say so well and you must describe this entire new world of yours in more detail but on some other occasion as for nowi am tired and not so fast cried dragosani aware that the conversation had strayed are you saying i wouldnt become a vampire if you bit me are you trying to say that the legend is unfounded except upon this supposed connection with vampire bats that wont wash old devil no for the bat was named after you not you after the bat another pause but not so long as to give the other too much time to think over what he had said and dragosani quickly continued you asked me if i desired to be of the wamphyri and how would you make me a wamphyr if not in this way could i be invested with it then as you were once invested with the order of the dragon hah no more lies old devil i want only the truth and if you really are my father why do you hold the truth back what do you fear dragosani felt the disapproval of the unseen presences sensed them drawing back from him in his mind the others voice was indeed tired now and accusing you promised me a gift a small tribute and brought me only weariness and torment i am a spark that grows dim my son an ember that expires you have kept the flickering flame alive and would you now snuff it out let me sleep now if you would notexhaustmeutterlydragosaaniiii dragosani clenched his teeth growled his frustration low in his throat snatched up the piglet by its hind legs he jumped to his feet took out a switchblade and snapped it open the blade glittered sharp as a razor your gift he snapped the piglet struggled squealed once dragosani slit its throat let the scarlet blood spray out then drain on to the dark earth a wind at once sprang up that sighed in the pines with a voice not unlike that of the thing in the ground ahhh dragosani tossed the piglets corpse down in tangled rootlets stepped back from it took out a handkerchief and cleaned his hands the unseen presences crept forward back dragosani snapped turning on his heel to leave back you ghosts of men its for him not you descending through the pines in total darkness dragosani was surefooted as a cat in his way he too was a creature of the night but a live one and thinking of life death undeath he smiled an emotionless smile into the darkness as he considered again the one question he had not asked how might one kill a vampire kill it dead no he had not asked the thing in the ground that question not in a place such as this during the hours of darkness for who could gauge what the reaction might or might not be it could be a very dangerous question indeed and anyway dragosani believed he already knew the answer the next day was thursday dragosani had spent a poor night with very little sleep and he was up early looking out of his window he saw use kinkovsi feeding chickens where they had wandered out of the farmyard and on to the grass verge of the country road out of the corner of her eye she saw his movement at the window and turned her face up to him dragosani had thrown the windows wide was breathing the morning air deeply into his lungs leaning on the sill leaning out into the light his flesh was pale as snow use looked at his naked chest when he breathed in deeply like that the muscles under his arms where they fed down into his back seemed to swell out like air sacs he was deceptive this one she suspected he would be very powerful good morning she called up for an answer he nodded and staring at her knew now why hed slept so badly she was the reason is that good she asked her teeth white where she deliberately licked them what he went on the defensive again and at once silently cursed himself for an immature child yes him dragosani the air on your skin like that does it feel good but look at you so pale you could use some sunlight too herr dragosani yes you couldcould be right he stuttered and withdrew from the window to get dressed angrily tugging his clothes on he thought women females sex sougly is it so unnatural and sonecessary is this what i lack well there was a way to find out tonight it would have to be tonight for tomorrow the english were coming he made up his mind and went back to the window use had gone back to feeding her chickens hearing his cough she looked up to see him buttoning his shirt staring down at her for a long moment their eyes met then stumblingly he said use does it get chilly still er in the night i mean she frowned wondering what he was getting at cold why no its summer then tonight he blurted i believe ill leave my window and my curtains open her frown lifted she tossed her head and laughed thats very healthy she answered after a moment im sure youll feel better for it embarrassed now dragosani once more withdrew closed the window and finished dressing for a moment or two he regretted what he had done this rendezvous so simply arranged which in fact seemed to have been arranged for him but finally he shrugged the feeling off it was done now what would be would be and anyway it was time he lost his virginity lost his virginity indeed it made him sound like a young girl and yet there was a touching naivety about that phrase unlike the blunt delivery of his undead mentor how had the old devil in the ground put it that time a mere pup who never breached a bitch yes that was it and hed been referring to dragosanis father his true father and so i got into his mindand i bequeathed the night to them he got into his mind to show him how to do itdragosani started as a pebble clattered against his window he had been sitting on his bed lost in thought now he got up opened the window again it was use breakfast in your room herr dragosani she called up or will you eat with us the emphasis she put on in your room was unmistakable but dragosani ignored it no for first he must speak to the old dragon ill come down he answered and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully at the disappointment which instantly registered in her face oh yes he would need assistance with this one this time this first time she would know exactly what she was about and he knew nothing butthe wamphyr knew everything and dragosani suspected that there were certain secrets which even that devious old one wouldnt mind divulging no not at all dragosanis sexual problem rather the mental block which had until now checked his psychological development in this area had been implanted in puberty at a time when other boys went on to steal their first kisses and explore their first soft bodies with hot groping inexperienced fingers it had happened during his third year in bucharest while he was boarding at the college there he had been thirteen and looking forward to the summer break then his stepfathers letter had arrived telling him not to come home there was disease on the farm the animals were being slaughtered visitors were forbidden and even boris would not be allowed on to the estate the fever was virulent people could easily spread it about on their feet their shoes the entire area for twenty miles around was under quarantine a disaster apparently but it need not prove to be one for boris he had an aunt in bucharest his stepfathers younger sister and could stay at her house for the break it was better than nothing at least he would have somewhere to go and not be stuck in an outbuilding of the old college cooking his own food on a tiny stove his aunt hildegard was a young widow with two daughters only a year or so older than boris himself anna and katrina and they lived in a large rambling wooden house on the budesti road oddly they had never been much mentioned at home and boris had only ever met them on their very infrequent visits to the romanian countryside he had always found his aunt very affectionate perhaps too much so and his cousins a little sickly and giggly in the way of young girls except that there were also undercurrents of a sly sensuality beyond their years but hardly darkly suspicious or especially odd yet he gained the impression from his stepfathers attitude towards them that his aunt was something of a black sheep or at least a lady with a terrible secret in the three weeks he lived with her and her precocious daughters when the college closed down for the summer break boris had discovered all he believed he needed to know of her oddness of sex and the perverse ways of females and his experiences had turned him off for all the years in between until now for the simple fact of the matter had been that his aunt was a nymphomaniac recently set free by the death of her husband she had allowed her sexual obsession to get out of hand and her daughters apparently were cut of pretty much the same cloth even when her ailing husband had been alive she had been notorious for her lovers word of her affairs had often got back to her brother in the country so bringing about his aloofness his disapproval he was no prude himself but he considered her little more than a whore just how far she had carried her excesses was beyond her brothers power to know especially now that he had broken off almost all contact with her if he had known then he would have made other arrangements for the youth but his adopted son was after all barely a boy he would surely stand exempt from the womans vices boris had known none of this but was to find out about it soon enough to begin with there had been no locks on any of the interior doors in his aunts house neither the bedrooms nor the bathroom had locks not even the toilets aunt hildegard had explained that there were no secret places here nowhere for the performance of secret deeds and that secret things in general were not tolerated which made it hard for boris to understand the secretive or mischievously furtive looks which often passed between mother and daughters when he was present as for privacy there was likewise absolutely no need for privacy in a place where nothing was forbidden nothing frowned upon enquiring as to his aunts philosophy boris had been told that this was a house of nature where the human body and its functions were things of nature given us to explore discover understand and enjoy to their full without conventional restrictions provided that he respect the house and property of his hostess there was nothing he could not do here and welcome but he must similarly respect the natural behaviour of the resident females of the house whose ways he would find entirely open and unrestricted as for philosophy as such there was too little love in the world and too much hatred if the lusts of the body and fires of the spirit could be quenched sated in the pleasurable violence of embraces instead of war then surely it would be a better place perhaps boris would not understand immediately but his aunt was sure that he would in a little while after an early supper on the first evening boris had gone up to his room to read he had brought some of his own books with him from the college but at the foot of the stairs leading to his bedroom was a tiny room set aside by his aunt as her library looking in boris had found the shelves full of erotica and sexual perversions and abnormalities some of which were so fascinating that he took several of the illustrated volumes upstairs with him they were unlike anything he had ever seen before even in the college library which was fairly comprehensive in his bedroom he had become engrossed with one of the books and like any boy of his age soon found himself aroused masturbation was not unknown to boris he relieved himself that way from time to time as most young men do but here in his aunts house he hadnt felt secure or private enough to do so to avoid further frustration he had taken the books back downstairs to the library earlier while reading he had heard a car pull up to the house and the arrival and entry of some visitor or other someone obviously popular with the household but had paid no heed as he deposited the books back in the library however he now heard laughter and the sounds of physical activity and apparent enjoyment from the main livingroom a room he had been shown and in which hed admired the mirrors set all about and the curiously mirrored ceiling and was drawn to see what was taking place the door stood a little ajar and from within as he approached in silence boris could hear a guttural male voice straining in something of exertion plus the now coarsened and urgent voices of his stepaunt and cousins it was then that he had started to suspect that something very much out of the ordinary must be going on in there boris paused at the door to stare in through the incheswide gap and was shocked almost rigid by what he saw far from being fantastic as he had supposed the book he had been reading had contained nothing comparable with this the man a stranger to boris bearded pockmarked huge in the belly and hairy was quite repulsive in his looks and almost malformed in his body also he was naked what boris could not know was that he was a satyr which by this houses standards more than compensated for his ugliness and malformation viewing the interior of the room through a mirror which stood just inside the door therefore not directly boris could not see the entire performance but what he could see was more than enough the three females were taking turns with their playmate urging him to greater efforts working on him with their hands and mouths and bodies in a frenzy of sexual excess he lay on his back upon a divan while the younger of the sisters anna kneeled astride him and literally bounced herself up and down on him with each upward bound of her body she revealed most of the great length and thickness of him shiny with the liquids of their throbbing bodies with each brief appearance of that slippery pole of flesh boris could see katrinas tiny and almost fragile hand locked tightly around its girth between the two where they continued to collide working at it no less than her sisters jolting body as for the mother of the girls aunt hildegard a woman of perhaps thirtyfour she kneeled at the head of the couch and flopped her great loose breasts upon his feverish face so that her nipples dangled alternately into his gaping gasping mouth occasionally apparently lost in her ecstasy she would stretch up thrusting her pubic region against his quivering lips and tongue the women were not naked but all the more lewd for their garments loose baggy white things which were open and allowed their breasts and buttocks to be fondled and all parts of them to be touched at will what transfixed boris most riveting him to the spot was not so much that this was sex of which he knew very little in any case but that all four participants seemed so utterly involved and engrossed each enjoying not only the rewards of hisher own facet of the performance whatever the part being played but also the cavorting of the others but as they changed places and positions before his eyes and almost without pause commenced a new series of intricate exertions so boris had begun to understand no one was neglected here each became the aggressor in turn so that all received maximum satisfaction or in boriss fevered eyes so that all seemed equally disgusting in any event while he believed that he now understood something of what he was seeing still he did not quite believe that he was actually seeing it it was the central character the man the awful spurting machine which he couldnt fathom boris knew how exhausted he always felt after masturbating so how must this hairy animal in the room of mirrors feel he seemed to be hosing out semen almost continually and groaning with the intensity of the pleasure given him by each fresh burst except that it hardly seemed to weary him at all but only served to drive him to greater excess surely he must collapse at any moment now and as boris had finally got his legs going and backed away from the door and as if his aunt had been thinking almost precisely the same thing as boris himself he heard her gaspingly say now now you two lets not weary dmitri so quickly why dont you go and play with boris eh but not too fiercely or else you might frighten him poor lamb he looks the sort whod frighten very easily about as lusty as a lettuce that had been enough to send boris scrambling frantically upstairs to his room out of his clothes in a flash and into bed there he lay and cringed knowing his door was unlocked that it couldnt be locked waiting forsomething he darent even essay a guess at if he had been alone with one cousin one normal girl then perhaps things might have been different perhaps then there might have been a shy gradual fumbling introduction to sex to normal sex with boris himself taking the stumbling initiative for until now boriss dreams and fancies in this respect had been fairly ordinary he had even entertained fantasies of being alone with his aunt of smothering himself in her soft breasts her white body and had not found them especially abhorrent or shameful not before but now he had seen any innocence his fantasies might have contained was gone now wrenched out of him what could there possibly be of normal healthy sex now was there any such thing he had seen yes downstairs in this very house he had seen three women coupling with a seemingly inexhaustible beast he had seen the beasts great pole of lusting flesh and should he compare himself with that did he as a male even exist after that a twig against a branch and must he be a party to orgies such as that like one small hare amongst a pack of hounds the mere thought of contact with the beast was sickening these had been his thoughts as his cousins came looking for him where he lay wrapped in sheets and blankets absolutely still and breathless in his bed he had heard them enter had tried not to twitch when anna had giggled throatily and asked boris are you awake is he is he katrina had eagerly wanted to know no i dont think so buthis light is on boris are you sure youre asleep feigning sleep his heart hammering boris had turned a little where he lay grumbled said wha what go away im tired it was a mistake both of them giggled now their voices still coarse and full of lust boris wont you play a game with us said katrina stick your head out at least weve something something to show you he couldnt breathe hed tugged his bedclothes so close and tight that hed shut out the air he would have to come out in a moment whether he wanted to or not please go away and let me sleep boris if we put the lights out will you come out for a moment the merest moment a gulp of air just long enough to fill his lungs yes he had gasped then hed heard the click of the light switch and felt anna stand up lifting her weight from his bed there its out it was out as boris discovered a moment later when having struggled to free his head he thrust it into darkness and breathed air deeply into his starved lungs and almost gagged and at once with more giggles from across the room the light came on again which of the girls it was he couldnt tell but one of them had been standing beside his bed with her loose cassock thing over his head like a tent the musty smell of her body had been beating into his face and he had seen the dark v of her pubic patch dewed with a string of milky semen pearls the light through her garment wasnt good but it was good enough for boris to see when she deliberately bowed her legs outward a little what looked to him like the parting of that patch into a greedy vertical grin there boris had dimly remembered a husky voice saying through a rising gale of coarse laughter and didnt we tell you we had something to show you but that was all that was said for suddenly beside himself in a panic of loathing that was when boris had lashed out later he remembered little of it only the giggles turning to screams and the dull pain in his fists and skinned knuckles but he did remember how the next day his tormentors had kept well away from him and how both of them had sported blue bruises while anna had a split lip and katrina a great black eye perhaps his aunt had been correct to liken him to a lettuce in one direction but as for tenacity and ferocity boris had lacked neither one that next day had been nightmarish exhausted after a night of wakefulness barricaded in his room against all entreaty to come out boris had had to suffer his aunts wrath and the accusations of her oversexed daughters aunt hildegard would not feed him starving him for punishment and she swore that she would complain to his father if he didnt come to his senses at once by that she meant that he should come out of his room and talk to her apologise to the girls and generally pretend that nothing had happened he would have none of it remaining in his room except for short and hurried excursions to the toilet and bathroom determined that before nightfall he would flee the house and make his way back to bucharest the only trouble with that scheme was that his father was bound to find out and would want to know why and boris would simply not be able to tell him hed never been an easy man to talk to and this this had been simply unbelievable and even then assuming his stepfather did believe and accepted all that had happened mightnt there still be doubts about boriss own participation his active perhaps his willing participation there were other difficulties too boris had no money and no arrangements had been made for him at the college which was why when evening came around again and when his aunts threats turned to pleading he had dragged his bed and dresser away from the door and allowed her to take him downstairs she was sorry she said that the girls had teased him so badly the night before and that hed been so alarmed what they could possibly have done to offend him so that he should have reacted so violently was quite beyond her powers of understanding but whatever it was all over now and boris should try to forget it it could only cause trouble between herself and her brother if he learned of it whatever it had been oh yes for he always blamed her for everything boris had silently agreed with her it would cause trouble yes and even more so if there should be mention of the beast but his aunt didnt know he knew about that and it was best that she shouldnt otherwisethe entire charade would fall apart anyway the satyr was no longer in the house and boris had hoped he wouldnt be back aunt hildegard had fed boris and later hed heard her telling anna and katrina to leave him completely alone that he wasnt for them and this must all be handled very delicately the thing had seemed to be finished with for which boris had been grateful until that night exhausted boris had slept in his bed against the door his own weight replacing that of the dresser but that had not been enough at about am aware of some sort of erratic intermittent motion he had come halfawake to hear his aunts voice clumsily hushing and lulling him back to sleep or at least attempting to her voice had been slurred and her breathing very heavy she had been drinking and was naked as he discovered when he put out his hand in the darkness that had instantly shocked him fully awake aware that this insatiable woman was trying to get into bed with him and at that immediately and like a cool salving hand on his hot brow an icy anger had come over him to oust and completely replace all fear aunt hildegard he had said into the darkness sitting up and averting his face from the alcohol on her breath please put the light on ah dear boy youre awake and want to see me butwhy ive been to bed boris and im afraid ive no clothes on so hot these summer nights i got up for a little drink of water and must have stumbled in here by mistake as she finished speaking her breasts had brushed his face gritting his teeth and again turning his face away boris had repeated put on the light but thats very naughty of you boris shed girlishly pretended to protest at the same time finding the light switch and momentarily dazzled there she had stood quite naked where shed forced the bed back from the open door and smiling a little drunkenly at him which had the effect of making her look utterly stupid and disgusting shed moved towards him and reached out her arms then seeing that he was fully dressed and for the first time noting the strange look on his face her hand had flown to her mouth boris i aunt he had swung his legs out of bed and slipped his feet into his shoes you will get out of this room now please and stay out if you do not i shall leave and if the door downstairs is locked then ill break a window then as soon as im able i shall tell my stepfather exactly what goes on in this house and goes on she was sobering rapidly trying to catch hold of his hand beginning to look worried about the men who come here to fuck you and my cousins like the great bulls which service my stepfathers cows why you she had staggered back from him her eyes wild in a suddenly white face you saw get out boris had sneered at her then a withering look which he would employ from that day forward when dealing with women and tried to thrust her from the door at that her eyes had narrowed to slits and shed spat at him so thats the way it is is it the big boys at the college got to you first did they you like them better than girls do you boris had turned towards the window then picking up a chair go on hed snapped out or i leave at once right now and not only will i tell my father but also every policeman i meet between here and bucharest ill tell them about the library of dirty books you keep which alone might get you a term in prison and about your daughters who are little more than girls and already worse than whores whores she had cut him off with such a hiss that hed thought she would fly at him but who could never be as totally rotten as you hed finished then she had broken down bursting into tears and letting him shove her from the room without further protest and for the rest of the night hed slept soundly and completely undisturbed that had been the end of it at midday the next day while boris was enjoying his lunch in silence and on his own his stepfather had arrived to take him home the trouble with the animals was over it had not been so serious after all thank god never had boris been so glad to see anyone in his whole life and hed had to fight hard not to show it too much while he got his things together aunt hildegard spent an apparently cordial if careful halfhour with her brother who made a point of asking after his nieces neither of them being present then with brief farewells boris and his stepfather had left to begin their trip back into the country at the gate as they got into the car aunt hildegard had managed to catch boriss eye her look just for a second before she began to wave them goodbye was pleading her eyes begged his silence in answer he had once more shown her that sneer that look far worse than any snarl or threat which said more of what he thought of her than any thousand words ever could in any event he had never spoken of that awful visit to anyone nor would he ever not even to the thing in the ground the thing in the groundthe old devilthe wamphyr he was waiting when dragosani arrived in the gloomy glade of the tomb just before dusk with another piglet in a sack he was awake angry lying there in the ground and fuming and as the suns rim touched the rim of the world and the far horizon turned to blood he was the first to speak dragosani i smell you dragosani and have you come to torment me with more questions more demands would you steal my secrets dragosani little by little piece by piece until theres nothing left of me and then what when i lie here in the cold earth how will you reward me with the blood of a pig ahaaa i see its so another piglet for one who has bathed in the blood of men and virgins and armies often blood is blood old dragon dragosani answered and i note youre more agile tonight for what you drank last night for what i drank no the earth is the richer dragosani not these old bones i dont believe you and i dont care go leave me be you dishonour me i have nothing for you and will have nothing from you i do not wish to talk begone dragosani grinned ive brought another pig yes for you or for the earth whichever but theres something more something rare except the old one was interested intrigued except dragosani shrugged perhaps it has been too long perhaps youre not up to it perhaps its impossible even for you for after all what are you but a dead thing and before the other could object or an undead thing if you insist i do insistare you taunting me dragosani what is it you bring me this night what would you give me what do youpropose maybe its more what we can give each other say on dragosani told him what was in his mind exactly what it was he was willing to share and you would trade what would you have from me in return for thissharing knowledge dragosani answered at once im just a man with a mans knowledge of women he lied and he paused in confusion for the old one was chuckling it had been a mistake to lie to him oh a mans knowledge of women a complete mans knowledge eh dragosani he gritted his teeth choked out there hasnt been timemy work studiesthe opportunity hasnt arisen time studies opportunity dragosani you are not a child i was eleven when i tore through my first maidenhead a thousand years ago after that virgin bitch whore what did it matter i had them all in all ways and always wanted more and you you have not tasted you have not soaked yourself in the sweat and the juice and the hot sweet blood of a woman not one and you call me a dead thing the old one laughed then laughed uproariously outrageously obscenely he found it all so ecstatically ridiculous his laughter went on and on became a deluge a tidal wave a howling ocean of laughter in dragosanis head threatening to drown him damn you he stood up and stamped on the earth spat on it damn you he shook his knotted fists at the black soil and tumbled slabs damn you damn you damn you the old one was quiet in a moment oozing like some nightmare slug in dragosanis mind but im already damned my son he said after a little while yes and so are you dragosani snatched out his knife reached for the shunned piglet wait not so hasty dragosani i have not refused but tell me since it would appear that like some puny priest youve abstained for all these long years why now dragosani thought about it decided he might as well tell the truth the old devil in the ground had probably seen through him anyway its the woman she aggravates me taunts me flaunts her flesh ahhh i know the sort also i believe she thinks ive been with men or at least she has wondered about it like the turks the old ones mental response was sharp touched with hatred that is an insult i think so too dragosani nodded sowill you do it you are inviting me into your mind am i correct tonight when this woman comes to you yes and it is an invitation made of your own free will dragosani grew wary just this once he answered it will have no permanence again you flatter yourself the other chuckled i have or will have my own body dragosani which is nothing so weak as yours and you can do it and will i learn from it oh i can do it my son yeeessss have you forgotten the fledgling and didnt you learn something that time too who made you a necromancer dragosani yes and this time you will learnmuch then i want nothing more from you for now anyway he began to back away from the tomb moving downhill away from that place of centuried horror and but what of the piglet asked the thickly glutinous voice in his head and more hurriedly for the earth dragosani for the earth in the deep unquiet gloom dragosani narrowed his eyes oh yes i very nearly forgot he said his tone not quite sarcastic the piglet of course for the earth quickly he returned slit the insensate animals throat tossed its pink body down and then without looking back he made silently away a little way down the slope against the bole of a tree where great roots forked trapped there and unable to roll any farther he saw something strange and stopped to pick it up it was last nights offering or what remained of it a tightly interwoven ball of pink skin and crushed bones all dry as crumpled cardboard a beetle crawled on it seeking in vain for some morsel of sustenance dragosani let it fall and roll out of sight oh yes he thought but guarded his thoughts carefully there in the darkness beneath the pines oh yes for the earth only for the earth dragosani got back to the kinkovsi place in time to eat supper with the family again for the last time though he couldnt know that then during the meal use showed little or no interest in him which was as well for he felt tense and on edge he was not sure hed done the right thing the old devil in the ground was no fool and had stressed that this would be at dragosanis own invitation his old revulsion was gradually mounting in him as the time approached but at the same time his body ached for release from years of sexual selfdenial for the first time since his arrival here the food seemed tasteless to him and even the beer was flat and lifeless later in his room he paced and fantasised growing ever more angry with himself and fretful as the hours slipped by for the third or fourth time since supper he took out the halfdozen volumes hed brought with him on vampirism read through the relevant passages put the books away again out of sight in a suitcase according to legend one must never accept any invitation from a vampire and equally important one must never invite a vampire to do anything in this the conscious will of the victim was allimportant it meant in effect that it was his decision to be a victim the will was like a barrier in the mind of the victim which the vampire was reluctant even unable to surmount without the aid of the victim himself or perhaps psychologically it was a barrier the victim must surmount before he could become a victim he must first believe in dragosanis case it was a question of the depth of his belief he knew the thing in the ground was there so that didnt come into it but as yet he did not know what power or the extent of the power the creature could exert externally perhaps even more important now that he had invited it in as it were he didnt know the limits of his own resistance or if he would be able to resist at all or if he would want to well doubtless he would find out soon enough the hour between midnight and am passed incredibly slowly and as the trysting time approached dragosani began to hope that use would think better of it and stay away she might be sound asleep even now with no intention of meeting him here it could simply be a game she played with all of her fathers guests to make them look and feel foolish in fact she might well feel the same way about men as dragosani until now had been caused to feel about women a halfdozen and more times that thought had come to him that she was making an utter fool of him and each time he had gone to the open window to close it and draw his moonsilvered curtains but on every occasion he had paused something had stopped him and hed snarled silently at his own incompetence in this thing and gone back to sit on his bed in the darkness of the room now at two minutes past the hour cursing himself for a buffoon and rushing to the window yet again he was on the point of slamming it shut when down there in the moonlit farmyard making its way like a shadow amongst shadows a figure dark and gauzy fleeting and use kinkovsis bedroom window open a little way seeming to smile up at him with her face her knowing eyes she was coming god how dragosani needed the old one now and how he did not want him did he need him really butdare he make do without him elation vied with terror in dragosani and was very nearly overwhelmed at the first pass terror born not alone of the tryst itself nor even the purpose of the tryst but perhaps more out of his own ability or inability to carry it through he was a man now yes but in matters such as this still a boy the only flesh he had known whose secrets he had delved had been cold and dead and unwilling but this was live and hot and all too willing revulsion climbed higher in him coursed through him like a flood he had been a boy just a boypictures filled his head in bestial procession which he had thought were forgotten thrust outthe visit to his aunts househis cousinsthe beastthing which he knew had been only a rutting man god that had been a nightmare and was it to be like that all over again and himself the lusting slavering beast impossible he couldnt he heard the creak of a stair down in the bowels of the guesthouse flew to the window and stared wildeyed out into the night another creak closer sent him flying to the light switch she was out there on the landing coming to his door a gust of wind moaned into the room billowing the curtains striking at into dragosanis heart in a moment all fear all uncertainty was gone he stepped out of the moonlight into shadow and waited the door opened silently and she came in trapped in a shaft of moonlight the grey veillike garment she wore was almost transparent she closed the door behind her moved towards the bed herr dragosani she said her voice trembling just a little im here he answered from the shadows she heard but didnt look his way soi was wrong about you she said raising her arms and drawing off the gauzy shift her breasts and buttocks were marble where the moon caressed them yeesss he whispered stepping forward well now she turned to him here i am she stood like a statue carved of milk gazing at him with nothing at all of innocence he came forward a dark silhouette reaching for her in daylight she had thought his eyes a trifle weak a watery blue a soft almost feminine filmstar blue but now the night suited him in the night his eyes were feral like those of a great wolf and as he bore her down on to the bed only then did she feel the first niggling doubt in the back of her mind his strength was enormous i was very very wrong about you she said aahhh said dragosani the following morning dragosani called for his breakfast early he took it in his room where hzak kinkovsi found him looking more fully alive than he had thought possible the country air must really agree with him use on the other hand was not so fortunate dragosani didnt need to enquire after her her father was full of it grumbling to himself as he served up a substantial breakfast on a tray that woman he said my use is a good strong girl or should be but ever since her operation and he had shrugged her operation dragosani had tried not to seem too interested yes six years ago cancer very bad for a young girl her womb so they took it away thats good she lives but this is farming country a man wants a wife wholl give him children you know so shell be an old maid maybe or perhaps shell go and get a job in the city strong sons are not so important there it explained something possibly i see dragosani nodded and carefully but this morning sometimes she doesnt feel too good even now not often but today she really isnt up to much so she stays in her room for a day or two curtains drawn dark room all wrapped up in her bed shivering just like when she was a little girl and sick she says she doesnt want a doctor but he shrugged again i worry about her dont said dragosani i mean dont worry about her eh kinkovsi looked surprised shes a fullgrown woman shell know whats best for her rest quiet a nice dark room those are the right things theyre all i need when im a bit down hmm well perhaps but still its worrying and a lot of work to be done too the english come today oh dragosani was glad that the other had changed the subject maybe ill meet them tonight kinkovsi nodded looked gloomy he gathered up the empty tray difficult i dont know a lot of english what i know i learned from tourists i know some english said dragosani i can get by ah well at least theyll be able to talk to someone anyway they bring good money and money talks eh he managed a chuckle enjoy your breakfast herr dragosani im sure i will beginning to grumble again under his breath kinkovsi left the garret room and made his way downstairs later when dragosani went out both hzak and maura were readying the lower rooms for their expected english guests by midday dragosani had driven into pitesti he did not know why exactly except that he remembered the town had a small but very comprehensive reference library whether or not he would have gone to the library or what he would have done there is academic the question did not arise for he was not given the chance to go there the local police found him first alarmed at first and imagining all sorts of things he calmed down as soon as he found out what the trouble really was that gregor borowitz had been trying to track him down since the day he left moscow and finally had succeeded it was a wonder dragosani hadnt been stopped at the border where hed crossed into romania at reni the local law had tracked him to lonestasi from there to kinkovsis finally to pitesti in fact it was his volga theyd tracked there werent many of those in romania not with moscow plates finally the policeman in charge of the patrol vehicle which had stopped him apologised for any inconvenience and gave dragosani a message which was simply borowitzs moscow telephone number the secure line dragosani went with them at once to the police station and phoned from there on the other end of the line borowitz came right to the point boris get back here asap what is it a member of the staff at the american embassy has had an accident while touring a fatal accident wrecked his car and gutted himself we havent identified him yet not officially anyway but well have to do it soon then the americans will want his body i want you to see him first in your er specialist capacity oh whats so important about him for some time now weve suspected him and one or two others of spying cia probably if hes one of a network its something we should know about so get back quickly will you im on my way back at kinkovsis dragosani tossed his things into the car paid what he owed and a little more thanked hzak and maura and accepted sandwiches a flask of coffee and a bottle of local wine but for all that they gave him these parting gifts it was obvious that hzak had some misgivings about him you told me you were a mortician he complained the police laughed when i told them that they said youre a big man in moscow an important man it seems a great shame that an important man would want to make a fool out of a fellow countryman an unimportant man im sorry about that my friend said dragosani but i am an important man and my job is very special and very tiring when i come home i like to forget my work completely and just take it easy and so i became a mortician please forgive me that seemed to suffice hzak kinkovsi grinned and they shook hands and then dragosani got into his car from behind her drawn curtains use watched him drive away and breathed a sigh of relief it was unlikely shed ever meet another like him and maybe that was as well but her bruises were blooming now but would soon fade and anyway she could always say she had suffered a dizzy bout tripped and fallen the bruises would disappear yes but not the memory of how she had got them she sighed againand shivered deliciously interval one on the top floor of a wellknown london hotel in a suite of private offices alec kyle sat at the desk of his exboss and scribbled frantically in shorthand the ghost which stood facing him across the desk had been speaking rapidly in soft wellmodulated tones for more than two and a half hours now kyles wrist felt cramped his head ached from the myriad weird pictures implanted there he had no doubt at all but that the ghost spoke the truth the whole truth and etc as to how it knew these matters he so fluently related or why he related them who is to say what knowledge such a creature should or shouldnt have and tell but one thing kyle knew for certain was this that the information to which he now found himself privy was vastly important and that he must also consider himself privileged to be the medium through which it was imparted as a pain suddenly shot up his forearm from his wrist causing him to drop his pencil and clutch at his hand as it went into a brief spasm so his unearthly visitor paused it was as good a juncture as any kyle thought and he was grateful he massaged his hand and wrist for a minute then took up a sharpener and renewed the pencils point for what must be the ninth or tenth time at least why not use a pen the ghost asked in such a perfectly natural and inquiring tone that kyle found himself answering without even considering that he talked to something far less substantial than smoke i prefer pencils always have just a quirk i suppose anyway they dont run out of ink im sorry i stopped just then but my wrist feels mangled weve a way to go yet ill manage some how look go and get yourself another coffee have a cigarette i realise how strange all this must be for you its strange for me too but if i were you my nerves would be leaping i think youre doing remarkably well and were getting on fine i was fully prepared before i came here to allow several visits just to let you adjust to me so as you can see were well ahead yes well its time thats worrying me kyle answered lighting up and drawing luxuriously on the smoke saturating his lungs with it you see ive a meeting to attend at pm its then that im to try to convince some rather important people that they keep the branch open and allow me to take over from sir keenan and run it so you see id like to be finished before then dont let it concern you the other smiled his wan smile consider them convinced oh kyle got up and went through into the main office put money into the coffee machine this time the ghost followed him stood behind him when he turned from the machine it was there office furniture visible right through it it was less than a holograph less than a bubble ectoplasm kyle started and slopped a little coffee edged around the other and went back into gormleys office yes the ghost continued back where it had been i believe well be able to sway your superiors in your favour we said kyle the other merely shrugged well see anyway i want to tell you a little more about harry keogh now before returning to dragosani sorry to jump about like this but its better if you see a complete picture anything you say are you ready yes kyle took up his pencil except well its just that i was wondering where you fit into all of this me the ghost raised its eyebrows i suppose id have been disappointed if you hadnt asked since you have if things work out the way i hope ill be your future boss kyles face twitched and he grinned lopsidedly aghost my future boss i thought wed been through that once said the other im not a ghost and never have been though ill admit i came pretty close but well get to that youll see kyle nodded can we get on now and kyle nodded again chapter seven harry keogh was miles away his thoughts lost in the clouds that drifted like puffs of cotton wool on the blue ocean of a summer sky hands behind his head a blade of sweet grass standing straight up like a tiny mast its white tip trapped in his teeth he hadnt said a word since theyd made love seagulls cried where they made white splashes in the shallows diving for fish and their somehow plaintive songs came up off the sea on a breeze that moved the grass on the dunes like a caress a caress too brendas hand where she stroked him even though she no longer commanded the full attention of his flesh in a little while he might want her again but if not it wouldnt matter in fact she liked him like this quiet verging on sleep with all of his strangeness sucked out of him he was strange yes but that was all part of his fascination it was one of the reasons she loved him and sometimes she fancied that he loved her too it was difficult to tell with harry most things were difficult to tell with him harry she said gently tickling his ribs anybody in umm the grass in his teeth gave a feeble twitch she knew he wasnt ignoring her knew that he simply wasnt here not here at all not all of him but somewhere else somewhere very different now and then she would try to find out about that place harrys secret place but so far hed kept mum she sat up buttoned her blouse straightened her skirt brushed sand from its pleats harry you should do yourself up there are people down on the beach if they walked this way theyd see umm he said again she did it for him then curled beside him and kissed his forehead tugging his ear she asked what are you thinking where are you harry you dont want to know that he said its not always a nice place im used to it but you wouldnt like it id like it if you were there she said he turned his face towards her squinted a little frowned seriously he could look very serious she thought sometimes in fact most of the time now he shook his head no you wouldnt like it if i was there he said youd hate it not if i were with you its not a place where you can be with someone he told her which was as close to the truth as he had ever come on this subject its a place for being entirely alone she wanted to know more harry i anyway were here he cut her off nowhere else were here and weve just made love knowing that if she tried to probe deeper he would only retreat she changed the subject youve made love to me she said eight hundred and eleven times i used to do that he said presently it stopped her dead in her tracks after a moments thought she said do what count things anything tiles on a toilet wall you know while i was sitting there she sighed exasperated i was talking about making love harry sometimes i think there isnt an ounce of romance in you there isnt now he agreed you just had it all that was better he was away from his morbid turn that was how brenda thought of it when harry was vague and strange in that way of his a morbid turn she went along with it wrinkled her nose playfully was glad for his humour eight hundred and eleven times she repeated in just three years thats a lot do you know how long weve been going out since we were kids he answered his eyes were on the sky again and she could see he was only half interested in what she was saying there was something on his mind hovering on the periphery of his awareness knowing him she knew it was there maybe one day shed know what it was all she knew now was that it came and went and that this time it seemed to be taking its time going but how long she insisted she caught his chin in a delicate hand turned his face towards hers he stared at her blankly let his eyes focus of their own accord how long four or five years i suppose six she said since you were twelve and i was eleven at twelve you took me to the pictures and held my hand there you go he said making an effort and coming back to earth and you just accused me of being unromantic oh she said but i bet you cant remember the film we saw it was psycho i dont know which of us was the most frightened i was he grinned then she continued when you were thirteen we made a picnic in the field on ellisons bank after we had eaten we fooled about a bit and you put your hand on my leg under my dress i shouted at you and you pretended it was an accident but the next week you did it again and i wouldnt speak to you for a fortnight i should be so unlucky now harry sighed anyway you soon enough came back for more then you started going to school in hartlepool and i didnt see so much of you the winter was a long one but the next summer was a good one for us anyway one day we got a changing tent on the beach at crimdon and went swimming afterwards in the tent when you were supposed to be drying my back you touched me and you touched me he reminded her and you wanted me to lie down with you but you wouldnt not until the next year harry i wasnt even fifteen that was terrible oh it wasnt so bad he grinned not the way i remember it but do you remember that first time of course i do what a mess he chuckled ruefully like trying to pick a lock with a piece of wet blotting paper she had to smile you got good at it very quickly though she said i always wondered where you learned it all i suppose i really wondered if someone else had shown you how he had been smiling but now the smile fell from his face in a moment what do you mean by that he said sharply why another girl of course she was startled by his abrupt change of mood what did you think i meant another girl he was frowning still but slowly his look turned first to a sour smile then an amused grin and at the last a shaky laugh another girl he said again laughing outright now what when i was eleven relieved brenda laughed with him youre funny she said you know he answered it seems that all my life people have been telling me the same thing that im funny im not really you know god sometimes i wish i knew how to be how to have a good laugh its as if i dont have time as if ive never had time did you ever get the feeling that if you dont laugh soon youll scream its a feeling i get i promise you she shook her head sometimes i think ill never understand you and sometimes i think you dont want me to she sighed it would be nice if you wanted me as much as i want you he stood up drew her to her feet and kissed her on the forehead his way of changing the subject come on lets walk all the way along the beach into hartlepool you can catch a bus back to harden from there walk into hartlepool thatll take all day well stop for a coffee on the beach at crimdon he said and we can have a swim from the sands a bit farther along then well go to my place you can stay until this evening if you like unless youve other plans no i havent you know i havent but but suddenly she was upset a touch of anxiety harry whats going to happen to us how do you mean do you love me i think so but dont you know i mean i know i love you they began to walk along the dunes gradually making for the damp sands where the sea was retreating there were people swimming in the sea down there but not many the beach was dirty with all the debris of the coalmines to the north a problem which had been growing for a quarter of a century black lorries trundled at the waterline like great amphibious beetles where their crews shovelled up rounded nuggets of washed seacoal like black gold a few miles south of here it was a little cleaner but as far as seaton carew coal and slag deposits marred the clean white sands farther south still the damage was much less but since the mines were almost exhausted nature would soon begin to put things right again still it would take a long time for the beaches to return to their former beauty perhaps they never would yes harry finally answered i think i do love you i mean i know i do its just that ive a lot on my mind is that what you mean that i dont show it enough see i dont know what you want me to say or i havent the time to think of the right things to say she clung to his arm snuggled closer as they walked oh you dont have to say anything its just that id hate it to end why should it end i dont know but i worry about it we dont seem to be getting anywhere my parents worry too oh he said glumly nodding marriage you mean no not really she sighed again i know how you feel about that not yet you keep saying and were too young i agree with you i think my mother and father do too i know you like to be on your own a lot and youre right we are too young you keep saying that he said but still we end up going round in circles she looked downcast its just thatwell the way you are i never know whats what if only youd tell me what it is that preoccupies you so i know theres something but you wont say he looked about to say something changed his mind brenda held her breath let it go when it became apparent hed backed off she tried elimination i know its not your writing because you were like this long before you started to write in fact as long as ive known you if only brenda he stopped grabbed her in his arms dragged her to a halt he seemed breathless unable to speak to say what he wanted to say it frightened her yes harry what is it he gulped drew breath started to walk again she caught up with him grabbed his hand harry he wouldnt look at her but he said brenda ii want to talk to you but i want you to she said again he stopped walking drew her into an embrace stared out to sea over her shoulder its a queer subject thats all she took the initiative broke away led him by the hand along the beach right we walk you talk i listen queer subject i dont mind there ive done my bit your turn he nodded glanced at her out of the corner of his eye coughed to clear his throat and said brenda have you ever wondered what people think about when theyre dead i mean what their thoughts are when they lie there in their graves she felt gooseflesh come up on her neck and at the top of her spine even with the sun hot on her the utterly emotionless tone of his voice coupled with what he had said chilled her to the marrow have i ever wondered i said it was a queer subject he hurriedly reminded her she didnt know what to say to him how to answer him she gave an involuntary shudder he couldnt be serious could he or was this something he was working on that must be it it was a story he was writing brenda was disappointed a story thats all on the other hand perhaps she had been wrong to neglect his writing as the source of his moodiness maybe he was that way because there was no one to talk to everyone knew that he was precocious his writing was brilliant the work of a mature man was that it was it simply that he had too much bottled up inside and no way to let it out harry she said you should have told me it was your writing my writing his eyebrows went up a story she said thats what it is isnt it he began to shake his head then changed it to a nod and smiling he nodded more rapidly you guessed it he said a story but a weird one im having difficulty pulling it together if i could talk about it but you can to me so lets talk it might give me some more ideas or tell me whats wrong with the ideas ive got now they carried on walking hand in hand right she said and after frowning for a moment happy thoughts eh the dead in their graves i think theyd think happy thoughts that would be the equivalent of heaven you know people who were unhappy in their lives dont think anything he told her matteroffactly theyre just glad to be out of it mostly ah you mean that youre going to have categories of dead people they wont be all the same or think the same thoughts he nodded thats right why should they they didnt think the same thoughts when they were alive did they oh some of them are happy with nothing to complain of but there are others who lie there sick with hatred because they know the ones who killed them live on unpunished harry thats an awful idea what sort of story is it anyway it has to be a ghost story he licked his lips nodded again something like that yes its about a man who can talk to people in their graves he can hear them in his head and know what theyre thinking yes and he can talk to them i still think its terrible she said i mean its horrible but the idea is good and these dead people actually talk to him but why would they want to because theyre lonely see theres no one else like this man as far as he knows hes the only one who can do it they dont have anyone else to talk to wouldnt that drive him mad i mean all those voices in his head at the same time all yammering for his attention harry gave a wry smile it doesnt happen like that he said see normally they just lie there thinking the body goes i mean you know it rots eventually becomes dust but the mind goes on dont ask me how thats something i wont try to explain its simply that the mind is the conscious and the subconscious control centre of a person and after he dies it carries on but only on the subconscious level like hes sleeping and in fact he is sleeping in a way its just that he wont wake up again so you see the necroscope only talks to the people he wants to talk to necroscope thats my name for such a person a man who looks into the minds of the dead i see said brenda frowning at least i think i do so happy people just lie there remembering all the good things or thinking happy thoughts and unhappy people they just switch off something like that malicious people think bad things and murderers think murderous thoughts and so on their own particular sorts of hell if you like but these are the ordinary people with ordinary thoughts i mean their thoughts run on a low level lets say that in life their thoughts were pretty mundane im not putting them down they just werent very bright thats all but there are extraordinary people too creative people great thinkers architects mathematicians authors the real intellectuals and what do you suppose they do brenda looked at him trying to gauge his thoughts she paused to pick up a bright seawashed pebble and in a little while i suppose theyd go on doing their thing she said if they were say great thinkers in their lives then theyd just go on sort of thinking their special thoughts right said harry emphatically thats exactly what they do the bridgebuilders go on building their bridges in their heads beautiful airy things that span entire oceans the musicians write wonderful songs and melodies the mathematicians develop abstract theories and polish them until they are crystal things even a child could understand and yet so astonishing that they hold the secrets of the universe they improve upon what they were doing when they were alive they carry their ideas to the limits of perfection finishing all the unfinished thoughts they never had time for when they lived and no distractions no outside interference no one to bother or confuse or concern them the way you tell it she said it sounds nice but do you think thats how it really is of course he nodded and quickly checked himself in my story anyway i mean how would i know what its really like i was just being silly she told him of course its not really like that anyway i still dont see why these dead people would want to talk to your er necroscope wouldnt he be a distraction wouldnt he annoy them butting in like that on all their great schemes no harry shook his head on the contrary its human nature see whats the good of doing something wonderful if you cant tell or show anyone what youve done thats why they enjoy talking to the necroscope he can appreciate their genius hes the only one who can do that also hes sympathetic he wants to know about their wonderful discoveries the fantastic inventions theyve designed which wont be invented in the real world for a thousand years brenda suddenly saw something in what hed said but thats a wonderful idea harry its not morbid at all as i first thought why the necroscope could invent their inventions for them he could build their bridges make their music write their unwritten masterpieces is that whats going to happen in your story i mean he turned his face away stood gazing far out to sea and said something like that i suppose thats what i havent worked out yet then for a while they were silent and shortly afterwards they came to crimdon and stopped for a coffee in a little cafe at the foot of the beach banks harry lay sleeping on his bed stark naked the sheets thrown back it was a very warm evening and the sun sinking continued to stream its golden fire in through the high windows of his tiny flat seeing the fine sheen of sweat where it made his brow damp brenda drew the thin curtains across the garret windows to cut down on the sunlight as the shadow fell across his face he groaned and mumbled something but brenda couldnt catch what he said quietly dressing she thought back on the day she thought back to other times too allowing her memory full rein as she examined the years she and harry had known each other today had been good and at last harry had talked to her aboutwell about things hed opened up a little and got some of it off his chest and out of his system and since their long talk about his story hed been a lot easier in himself happy almost just what it would take to make him truly happy brenda could hardly imagine the nature of such a thing he said it was that he had a lot on his mind a lot of what his writing possibly but she had never known him to be truly happy or if he had been it hadnt shown much but there shed sidetracked herself she went back to today after crimdon theyd walked on for another mile to a more or less deserted part of the beach where theyd gone swimming in their underwear from a distance no one would be able to tell it would be thought they wore costumes after a little while as they fooled about in the water some old beachcombing tramp had come on the scene and it had been time to go dressing before the old boy could get really close theyd dried out as they covered the last leg of their walk in hartlepool a bus ride from the old part of the town to the new had carried them almost to the door of the threestorey victorian house where harry had his garret flat and there brenda had made sandwiches for them before theyd showered and made love the sex theyd shared had been delicious with both of them still tasting a little of the seas salt all glowing from the sun and radiating their heat and all seeming very right and natural she liked harry best in the summer for then he wasnt so pale and his thin frame seemed somehow more muscular not that he was in any way weak or weedy harry was well able to look after himself and hardly the type to accept sand kicked in his face twice brenda had seen him deal with wouldbe bullies and they had been the ones to go away nursing cuts and bruises she secretly prided herself that on both occasions she had been the spur to his anger harry was indifferent towards jibes aimed at himself he could always ignore them put them down to the ignorance of loutsbut he would not accept insults or insinuations directed at brenda or at himself when she was with him at times like that he seemed almost to become another person a harder faster more capable person entirely and yet even his mastery of selfdefence mystified her it was just another of those things in which he had grown inexplicably expert like his lovemaking and his writing brenda looked at them in that order harry had been sixteen when he first made love to her when they first did it properly anyway but hed been eager for it long before that and as she had pointed out on the beach he had very quickly got to be very good at it innocent in all such things brenda had thought there was only one way to do it but harrys sexual repertoire had seemed inexhaustible and it was perfectly true she had often wondered if someone else had shown him how in the end shed stopped worrying about it putting it down to the fact that he was precocious for some unexplained reason there were skills in which harry keogh excelled in which he excelled naturally without any prior knowledge or intensive instruction his writing harry had once admitted that his english had used to let him down badly it had very nearly stopped him going on to the tech to complete his schooling when hed completely messed up the english examination paper well however much that had been the case then it certainly wasnt so now perhaps it was that hed worked hard at it but when brenda had never seen him studying or swottingup his english he had never seemed to study i anything much and yet here he was eighteen years old and an author and so prolific that he was published under four pseudonyms only short stories so far but three a week at least and all of them snapped up and she knew that he was now working on a novel his battered secondhand typewriter stood on a small table close to the window once when shed dropped in to see him unexpectedly harry had been working it was one of the few occasions when brenda had actually seen him at work coming upstairs she had heard the intermittent clatter of the keys of his machine and creeping into his tiny entrance hall shed poked her head round the door lost in thought smiling to himself even muttering to himself shed fancied harrys chin had been propped in his hands where he sat at the table then he had straightened up to tap out a few more twofingered lines only pausing to nod and smile at some private thought and gaze out of the garret window and across the road then she had knocked on the door startling him and entered the room harry had greeted her put away his work and that had been that except that she had glanced at the sheet of paper in the typewriter and had seen typed at its head diary of a seventeenthcentury rake it was only later that shed wondered what harry could possibly know about the seventeenth century or for that matter rakes she was all done with dressing now and tiptoed across the room to apply a little makeup to her face in front of a wall mirror this took her close to his table and again she glanced at the typewriter and the uncompleted sheet it contained obviously he was still hard at his novel the a sheet was numbered p and in the lefthand upper corner bore the legend diary ofetc brenda wound the sheet up a little and read what written or at least started to then blushing she averted her eyes stared out the window it was hot stuff very polished very stylish extremely randy out of the corner of her eye she glanced at the sheet again she loved seventeenthcentury romances and harrys style was perfect but this wasnt a romance and his material was frankly pornographic only then did she notice what she was looking at through the window the old cemetery across the road the graveyard four hundred years old with its great horsechestnuts glossy shrubbery and flower borders its leaning weathered headstones and generally welltended pebble plots and as she gazed so she wondered at harrys choice of a dwellingplace there were better flats around all over town but he had told her that he liked the view and it was only now that shed realised what the view was oh pretty enough in the summer certainly but a graveyard for all that behind her harry once again mouthed something and turned on his side she crossed to where he lay and smiled gently down on him then drew a sheet over his lower half in the shade now he was starting to shiver a little in any case she would soon have to wake him it was time she got on her way her parents liked her to be in while it was still daylight on those occasions when they didnt know where she was but first she would make some coffee as she began to turn away harry spoke yet again and this time his words were very clear dont worry ma im a big boy now i can take care of myself you can rest easy he paused and even sleeping seemed to adopt an attitude of listening then no ive told you before ma he didnt hurt me why should he anyway i went to auntie and uncle they looked after me now im grown up and very soon now maybe when you know im okay then youll be able to rest easy another pause a brief period of listening and but why cant you ma then more incoherent mumbling before i cant too far away i know youre trying to tell me something butjust a whisper ma i hear some of it butdont know whatmake out what youre saying maybe if i come to see you come to where you are harry was restless now and sweating profusely for all that he shivered looking at him brenda became a little worried was it some kind of fever sweat gathered in the hollow above the middle of his upper lip it formed droplets on his forehead and made his hair damp his hands jerked and twitched beneath the sheet she reached out a hand and touched him harry what he burst awake his eyes snapping open and staring fixedly his entire body going rigid as an iron bar who harry harry its only me you were nightmaring brenda cradled him in her arms and he let her curling up and throwing his arms about her it was about your mam harry listen youre all right now let me go and make some coffee she hugged him tighter for a moment then gently released herself and stood up his eyes still wide open followed her as she moved to the alcove where he had his rudimentary kitchen about my mother he said spooning instant coffee into mugs she nodded she filled the electric kettle and switched it on you called her ma and you were talking to her he uncurled himself and sat up brushing his fingers dazedly through his hair what did i say she shook her head nothing much mainly mumbojumbo you told her you were grown up now and that she should rest easy it was just a nightmare harry by the time the coffee was ready he had dressed himself they said no more about his nightmare but drank their coffees then he walked her down to the busstop for harden where they waited in silence until the bus came at the last before she boarded he kissed her lightly on the cheek see you soon he said tomorrow tomorrow was sunday no during the week ill come up for you bye love she got a seat at the back of the bus and watched harry through the rear window where he stood alone at the stop as the bus began to round a bend he turned on his heel and walked along the pavement away from his flat wondering where he was headed brenda kept watching him as long as she could the last she saw of him was when he turned in through the gates of the cemetery with the suns last rays burning in his hair then the bus was round the bend and harry was out of sight harry did not come to see her during the week and brendas work began to suffer at the ladies hairdressing salon in harden by thursday she was thoroughly worried about him on friday night she cried and her father said she was a fool for him that lads bloody weird he declared our brenda you must be soft and he wouldnt hear of her going down to hartlepool that night not on a friday night my girl when all the lads have their beer money you can go and see your daft harry tomorrow tomorrow seemed ages coming and brenda hardly slept at all but saturday morning bright and early she took a bus in to town and went up to harrys flat she had her own key and let herself in but he wasnt to be found in the typewriter was a sheet of paper with yesterdays date and a simple message brenda ive gone up to edinburgh for the weekend ive people to see up there ill be back monday at the latest and ill see you then promise sorry i didnt see you during the week i had a lot on my mind and wouldnt have been much fun love harry the last two words meant a lot to her and so she forgave him the rest anyway monday wasnt so very far away but who could he possibly have to see in edinburgh he had a stepfather up there who hadnt once seen him since he was a child but who else no one that brenda knew of other relatives that she didnt know of maybe and then there had been his mother except she had been drowned when he was little more than a baby drowned yes but harry had been talking to her in his sleep brenda shook herself why some of her ideas were almost as morbid as harrys all graveyards and death and maggots no of course he wouldnt be going to see his mother for theyd never found her body there would be no grave for him to visit the thought didnt improve brendas state of mind instead it drove her to do something she would never normally consider she carefully went through harrys file of manuscripts checking every story whether it was complete or barely started she didnt really know what she was looking for but by the time she was through she knew what she had failed to find nowhere in all his work had she come across a story about a necroscope so either harry hadnt started the story yet or he was a liar or or what was bothering her was something entirely different as brenda cowell stood in a shaft of morning sunlight in harrys flat pondering the strangeness of the man she was involved with one hundred and twenty miles away harry keogh himself stood in the same sunlight on the banks of a drowsy river in scotland and looked across it at the big house where it stood at the head of a large overgrown garden there had been a time when the place was well maintained but that was a long time ago and harry couldnt remember it he had been too young an infant and there were many things he couldnt remember but he remembered his mother somewhere deep in his subconscious mind he had never forgotten about her and she had never forgotten about him and she still worried about him harry stared at the house for a long time then at the river its waters moved slowly swirling cool and inviting or inviting to most a grassy bank with a few reeds deep green water and just here a pebbly bottom and somewhere down there lodged in the slimeslick pebbles where it had lain for most of harrys years a ring a mans ring a catseye stone set in thick gold harry staggered at the rivers edge he deliberately flopped down to save himself from falling the sun shone on him but he was cold the blue sky reeled became the grey liquid flurry of slushy water he was under the water trying to fight his way up through a hole in the ice then the face seen through the ice its trembling jelly lips turning up at their corners in a grimace or a smile the hands coming down into the water holding him under and on one of them that ring the catseye ring on the second finger of the right hand and harry tearing at those hands clawing at them ripping the strong flesh in his frenzy the gold ring coming loose spiralling down past him into the murk and the icy deeps blood from the torn hands turning the swirling water red red against the black of harrys dying no not his dying hers his mothers waterlogged heshe sank and the current dragging them along under the ice turning and tumbling them and wholl look after harry now poor little harry the nightmare receded its rush and gurgle diminishing in his mind leaving him gasping for air where he clawed at the grassy bank then he curled on his side and was violently ill this was it it was here this was where it had happened this was where she had died where she had been murdered right here but where was she now harry allowed his feet to lead him following the course of the river downstream where the channel narrowed a little he crossed a small wooden bridge and continued on down the bank garden hedges came down close to the rivers edge here so that he walked a narrow often overgrown path between fences on the one hand and reeds and water on the other and in a little while he came to a place where the bank had been worn away forming an overhanging bite not ten feet across above the still water in the pool the path ended where the fence leaned dangerously riverward but harry knew he need look no further this was where she lay anyone watching him from the bank opposite would have seen the beginning of a strange thing then harry sat down with his feet dangling over the shallow muddy pool put his chin in his hands stared deep into the water and minutes later if anyone had been closer he would have been witness to something stranger still tears from this young mans staring unblinking eyes which dripped from the tip of his nose in a steady stream to add their substance to the rivers and for the first time in his adult life harry keogh met his mother talked to her face to face and was able to verify the terrible things his dreams and her restless messages had caused him to more than suspect for so many years and while they talked he cried tears of sadness and some of gladness at first then of remorse and frustration that hed had to wait so long for this day then of white anger as things began to make more sense to him finally he told her what he intended to do upon which the wondering observer had there been one would have seen the strangest thing of all for when mary keogh knew her sons plans she became even more afraid for him and voiced her fears and she made harry promise that he would do nothing rash he couldnt deny her pleading answered with a nod of his head she didnt believe him cried out after him as he stood up and moved away and for a moment the merest second it seemed the bottom of the pool shuddered shaking the water and sending ripples coursing outward from its centre then the pool was still again harry didnt see this for already he was making for the bridge returning to the spot where it had happened all those years ago the place where his gentle mother had been murdered he found a place where the reeds grew tall checked that he was completely alone stripped down to his shorts and stepped to the rivers edge a moment later he was in the water diving deep then making for the middle where the current ran swiftest even there the rivers pull was barely noticeable and after twenty minutes of diving and delving amongst the pebbles of the bottom he found what he was looking for it lay within a few inches of the spot where hed first thought it might be tarnished and a little slimy but unmistakably a ring the gold gleamed through on the instant he rubbed it and the catseye stone held its cold unwinking stare as of old harry had never actually seen the ring before that moment when his groping fingers found it not consciously anyway but he knew it at once it was that familiar nor did it seem odd to him that hed known where to look stranger far if the ring had not been there on the bank of the river he finished cleaning it slid it on to the index finger of his left hand which it fitted a little loosely but was not so slack that he might lose it and turned it thoughtfully between his fingers getting the feel of it it felt cold even under the hot sun cold as the day its owner had lost it then harry dressed and headed for bonnyrigg from there hed catch a bus into edinburgh and take the first train home to hartlepool his work here was done for now now that he had found his mother he would have no trouble reaching her again no matter how far he wandered and he would be able to calm her fears and give her a little of the peace shed sought for so long she would no longer need to worry about little harry before leaving the spot by the river however he paused to look again at the big house where it stood well back from the opposite bank and he stared at its old gables and wild gardens for long long moments his stepfather still lived and worked there he knew yes and it would not be too long before harry paid him a visit but before that there was much he would have to do viktor shukshin was a dangerous man a murderer and harry must be careful how he approached him he intended that his stepfather should pay the price for his mothers death that he must be punished in full but the punishment would have to fit the crime and no use at all to simply accuse the man for what proof was there after all these years no harry must set a trap and bait it and shukshin must find it irresistible but no hurry none at all for harry had time on his side time would allow him to become expert in many things and indeed he had much to learn for what good to be a necroscope if he could make no use of it as to how he would use his talent after he had avenged his mothers death that remained to be seen it would be as it would be but right now his instructors were waiting for him and they were the best in the world yes and they knew far more now than ever they had known when they were alive chapter eight the summer of three years since dragosanis last trip home and only a year short of that time when the old thing in the earth had promised to deliver up his secrets to dragosani the secrets of the wamphyri in return for which dragosani would give him back his life or rather he would return him to renewed undeath to walk the earth again three years and the necromancer had gone from strength to strength until his position as gregor borowitzs righthand man now seemed virtually unassailable when the old man went dragosani would be the one to replace him after that with the entire soviet esp organisation at his command and with all the knowledge of the wamphyri in his hands and mind the possibilities were vast what had once seemed an impossible dream might still come to pass when old wallachia would once more become a mighty nation the mightiest nation of all why not with dragosani to lead the way a mortal man can achieve very little in his short span of years but an immortal man might achieve anything and with that thought in mind a question dragosani had often asked himself cropped up yet again if it was true that longevity meant power and immortality ultimate power why had the wamphyri themselves failed why werent vampires the leaders and rulers of this world dragosani had long since worked out something of an answer right or wrong he could not yet say to man the concept of a vampire is abhorrent the very concept itself if men believed if they were given indisputable proof of vampiric infestation then they would seek the creatures out and destroy them this had been the way of it since time began since a time when men really did believe and it had limited the vampire in his scope he dare not reveal himself must not be seen to be different to be alien he must control as best he might his passions his lusts his natural craving for the sheer power he knows his evil arts could bring him for to have power whether political or financial or of any other sort is to be scrutinised which is the one thing above all others that a vampire dreads for under prolonged scrutiny he must be discovered and destroyed but if a mere man could control a vampires arts a living man as opposed to an undead thing he would suffer no such restrictions having nothing to hide but his dark knowledge itselfwhy he could achieve almost anything that was why dragosani had journeyed yet again to romania conscious of the fact that his duties had kept him away for far too long he wished to speak once more with the old devil and offer him small favours and learn whatever there was to be learned before next summer when the time appointed would be at hand the time appointed yes when all the vampires secrets would lie naked before him open and revealing as an eviscerated corpse three years had flown by since last he was here and they had been busy years busy for dragosani because over that entire period gregor borowitz had driven all of his espers including the necromancer to the limits of their capabilities of course he had to ensure that in the four years leonid brezhnev had allowed him in which he must turn a profit his branch would become so firmly entrenched as to be indispensable and now the premier had seen that it was indeed utterly indispensable whats more it was the most secret of all his secret services and by far the most independent which was the way gregor borowitz wanted it through bbrowitzs advance warning brezhnev had been fully prepared for the fall from grace of his onetime political pal richard nixon in the usa and where watergate might have hindered or even ruined many another russian premier brezhnev had actually managed to reap some benefits from it but only by virtue of borowitzs predictions a pity brezhnev had told borowitz at the time that nixon didnt have you working for him eh gregor similarly and also as predicted the premier now found himself advantageously placed in his dealings with the presidential standin at best a bumbler and before nixons fall as early as knowing in advance that there were american hardliners still to come brezhnev had taken borowitzs advice and signed satellite agreements with the usa moreover and especially since america was so far advanced in space technology he had also been quick to put his signature to the ultimate dйtente coup of his career a joint skylab space venture which even now was coming to fruition indeed the soviet premier had taken the initiative on these and many other espbranch suggestions or prognoses including the expulsion of many dissidents and the repatriation of jews and every step he had taken so far had been completely successful in bolstering his already awesome position as leader and much if not all of the credit due directly to borowitz and his branch so that brezhnev had been pleased to honour his and borowitzs agreement of thus as brezhnev and his regime prospered so prospered gregor borowitz likewise boris dragosani whose loyalty to the branch seemed unquestionable and in fact it was unquestionable for the moment while gregor borowitz had secured the permanence of his branch and climbed in leonid brezhnevs esteem however his relationship with yuri andropov had deteriorated at a directly proportionate rate there was no overt hostility but behind the scenes andropov was as jealous and scheming as ever dragosani knew that borowitz continued to watch andropov closely what the necromancer did not know was that borowitz also watched him oh dragosani was not under any sort of surveillance but there was that in his attitude which had been worrying his boss for quite some time dragosani had always been arrogant even insubordinate and borowitz had accepted that and even enjoyed it but this was something else borowitz suspected it was ambition which was fine as long as the necromancer didnt become too ambitious dragosani too had noticed the change in himself despite the fact that one of his oldest inhibitions his greatest hangup was now extinct he had grown if anything colder still towards members of the opposite sex when he took a woman it was invariably brutally with little or nothing of love in it but purely as a release for his own pentup emotional and physical needs and as for ambition at times he had difficulty controlling his frustration and could hardly wait for the day when borowitz would be out of his way the old man was past it a dodderer his usefulness was on the wane this was not in fact the case but such was dragosanis own energy the rapid acceleration and growth of his drive and character that it seemed that way to him and that was another reason why he had returned this time to romania so that he might obtain the counselling of the thing in the ground for like it or not dragosani had begun to accept the vampire as a sort of fatherfigure who else could he talk to in absolute confidence of his ambitions and his frustrations who else if not the old dragon no one in a way the vampire was like an oraclebut in another way he was not unlike an oracle dragosani could never be sure of the validity of any of his statements which meant that while he had felt himself drawn back here to romania still he must be careful of his dealings with the thing in the ground these were some of the thoughts which passed through his mind as he drove up through the old country from bucharest towards pitesti and as his volga passed a signpost which stated that the town was sixteen kilometres ahead he remembered how three years ago he had been on his way to pitesti when borowitz had recalled him to moscow strangely he had not given thought to the library in pitesti from that day to this but now he felt himself drawn again to visit the place he still knew so very little about vampirism and the undead and what knowledge he did have was dubious in that it had come from the vampire himself but if ever a library was the seat of local lore and legend then surely the reference library in pitesti was that one dragosani remembered the place from his years at the college in bucharest the college had often used to borrow old documents and records concerning wallachian and ancient romanian matters from pitesti for a great amount of historical material had been taken there for safety from ploiesti and bucharest during world war ii in the case of ploiesti this had been a wise move for the city had suffered some of the worst bombing of the war in any case much of the material had not found its way back to the original museums and libraries but remained in pitesti even now certainly it had been there as recently as eighteen or nineteen years ago sothe old thing in the ground could wait a little longer on dragosanis return he would go first to the library in pitesti have lunch later in the town and only then carry on into the heart of his homeland by am dragosani was there had introduced himself to the librarian on duty asked to be allowed to see any documents pertaining to boyar families lands battles monuments ruins and burial grounds or any records at all for the regions comprising wallachia and moldavia and especially local areas circa the midfifteenthcentury the librarian seemed agreeable enough and only too pleased to assist but after he had taken his visitor to the room which housed those old recordsthen dragosani had been able to appreciate the funny side of it for himself in a room of barnlike dimensions he found shelves containing sufficient of books and documents and records to fill several large army trucks all of it relating to his inquiry butisnt it catalogued he asked of course sir the young librarian told him smiling again and he produced an armful of catalogues whose heading alone if dragosani had been willing to contemplate such a task would have taken several days in itself and that without taking down one of the listed items from its shelf but it would take a year or more to sift through this lot he finally complained it has already taken twenty the other told him and that was simply for the purpose of cataloguing or mainly for that purpose but that is not the only difficulty for even if you could afford so much time still you would not be allowed it at last the authorities are splitting it up much is returning to bucharest a large amount is scheduled for budapest even moscow has made application it will be moved most of it some time in the next three months well youre right said dragosani i havent years or months but just a few days soi wonder if theres some way i might narrow my search down ah said the other but then theres the question of language do you wish to see turkish language recordshungariangerman is your interest purely slavicist is it christian or ottoman do you have any specific points of reference landmarks as it were all of the material here is at least three hundred years old but some of it dates back seven centuries and more as im sure youre aware the central span which seems to be the seat of your interest covers many decades of constant flux here are the records of foreign conquerors yes but we also have the records of those who thrust them out are you capable of understanding the texts of these works they are after all half a millennium old if you can understand them then youre a scholar indeed i certainly cant not with any degree of accuracy and ive been trained to read them and then seeing dragosanis look of helplessness he had added sir perhaps if you could be more specific dragosani saw no reason for subterfuge im interested in the vampire myth which seems to have had its roots right here in transylvania moldavia wallachia and dates back so far as is known to the fifteenth century the librarian took a pace back from him lost his smile suddenly he seemed wary but you are surely not a tourist no basically im romanian now living and working in moscow but whats that got to do with it the librarian perhaps three or four years younger than dragosani and obviously a little awed by his almost cosmopolitan appearance seemed to be giving the matter a deal of consideration he chewed his lip frowned and was silent for long moments but at last he said if youll take a look at them youll note that those catalogues i gave you are mainly handwritten and penned in one uniform hand throughout and ive already told you that theres at least twenty years of work in them well the man who did that work is still alive and lives not far away in titu thats towards bucharest about twentyfive miles i know the place said dragosani i drove through here not half an hour ago do you think he could help me oh yes if he wanted to that sounded cryptic well go on the librarian seemed unsure looked away for a moment oh i made a mistake two or three years ago sent a couple of american researchers to see him he wanted no truck with them threw them out a bit eccentric you see since that time im more careful weve had a good many requests of this nature you understand this dracula thing is something of an industry apparently in the west and its this commercial aspect that mr giresci is anxious to avoid thats his name by the way ladislau giresci are you telling me that this man is an expert on vampirism dragosani felt his interest quickening do you mean to say that hes been studying the legends tracing their history through these documents for twentyodd years well among other things yes thats what im saying its been what you might call a hobby or perhaps an obsession with him but a very useful obsession where the library has been concerned then i have to go and see him it might save me a great deal of time and wasted energy the librarian shrugged well i can give you directions and his address butit will be entirely up to him whether or not hell see you it might help if you took him a bottle of whisky hes a great whisky man when he can afford it but the scottish sort and not that filth they brew in bulgaria you just give me his address said dragosani hell see me all right of that i can assure you dragosani found the place just as the librarian had described it on the bucharest road about a mile outside of titu on a small estate of wooden twostorey houses set back from the road in a few acres of woodland ladislau girescis place was conspicuous by its comparative isolation all of the houses had gardens or plots of ground surrounding them and separating them from their neighbours but girescis house stood well away from all others on the rim of the estate lost in a stand of pines hedgerows run wild amid untended shrubbery and undergrowth the cobbled drive leading to the house itself had been narrowed by burgeoning hedges where leafy creepers were throwing their tendrils across the cobbles the gar dens were overgrown and slowly returning to the wilderness the house was visibly affected by dry rot in a fairly advanced state and wore an atypical air of almost total neglect by comparison the other houses on the estate were in good order and their gardens well maintained some small effort had been made at maintenance and repair however for here and there at the front of the house an old board had been removed and a new one nailed in place but even the most recent of these must be all of five years old the path from the garden gate to the front door was likewise overgrown but dragosani persisted and knocked upon panels from which the last flakes of paint were fast falling in one hand he carried a string bag containing a bottle of whisky bought from the liquor store in pitesti a loaf of bread a wedge of cheese some fruit the food was for himself and the bottle as advised for giresci if he was at home as dragosani waited that began to seem unlikely but after knocking again louder this time finally he heard movement from within the figure which finally opened the door to him was male perhaps sixty years of age and fragile as a pressed flower his hair was white not grey but white like a crest of snow upon the hill of his brow and his skin was even paler than dragosanis own with a shine to it as if it were polished his right leg was wooden an old peg as opposed to any sort of modern prosthetic device but he seemed to handle his disability with more than sufficient agility his back was a little bent and he held one shoulder gingerly and winced when he moved it but his eyes were keen brown and sure and as he enquired as to dragosanis business his breath was clean and healthy you dont know me mr giresci said dragosani but ive learned something of you and what ive learned has fascinated me i suppose you could say im something of a historian whose special interest lies way back in old wallachia and ive been told that no one knows the history of these parts better than you hmm said giresci looking his visitor up and down well there are professors at the university in bucharest whod dispute that but i wouldnt he stood blocking the way inside seemingly uncertain but dragosani noted that his brown eyes went again to the string bag and the bottle whisky said dragosani im partial to a drop and its hard stuff to come by in moscow maybe youll join me in a glass while we talk oh giresci barked and who said we were going to talk but again his eyes went to the bottle and in a softer tone scotch did you say of course theres only one real whisky and thats whats your name young man giresci cut him off he still blocked the way into his house but his eyes held a look of interest now dragosani boris dragosani i was born in these parts and is that why youre interested in their history somehow i dont think so from frank and open scrutiny now his eyes took on a look of wary suspicion you wouldnt be representing any foreigners would you americans for example dragosani smiled on the contrary he said no for i know youve had trouble with strangers before but ill not lie to you ladislau giresci my interest is probably the same as theirs was i was given your address by the librarian in pitesti ah said giresci is that so well he knows well enough who ill see and who i wont see so it seems your credentials must be all right but lets hear it from you now from your own lips and no holding back just what is your interest very well i want to know about vampires the other stared hard at him seemed not at all surprised dracula you mean dragosani shook his head no i mean real vampires the vampir of transylvanian legend the cult of the wamphyri at that giresci gave a start winced again as his bad shoulder jumped leaned forward a little and grasped dragosanis arm he breathed heavily for a moment and said oh the wamphyri eh well perhaps i will talk to you yes and certainly id appreciate a glass of whisky but first you tell me something you said you wanted to know about the real vampire the legend are you sure you dont mean the myth tell me dragosani do you believe in vampires dragosani looked at him giresci was watching him keenly waiting almost holding his breath and something told dragosani that he had him oh yes he said softly after a moment indeed i do hmm the other nodded and stood aside then youd better come in mr dragosani come in come in and well talk however dilapidated girescis place might look from outside inside it was as clean and neat as any cripple living on his own could possibly keep it dragosani was pleasantly surprised at the sense of order he felt as he followed his host through rooms panelled in locally crafted oak where carpets patterned in the old slavic tradition kept ones feet from sliding on warmly glowing agepolished pine boards however rustic the place was warm and welcoming on the one hand but on the other girescis penchant his allconsuming hobby or obsession was alive and manifest in every room it saturated the atmosphere of the house in exactly the same way as mummycases in a museum inspire a sense of endless ergs of sand and antique mystery except that here the picture was of bitter mountain passes and fierce pride of cold wastes and aching loneliness of a procession of endless wars and blood and incredible cruelties the rooms were old romania this was wallachia the walls of one room were hung with old weapons swords pieces of armour here was an early sixteenthcentury arquebusier and here a vicious barbed pike a black pitted cannonball from a small turkish cannon held open a door and a pair of ornate turkish scimitars decorated the wall over the fireplace there were terrible axes maces and flails and a badly battered and rusty cuirass with the breastplate hacked almost in half from the top the wall of the corridor which divided the main livingroom from the kitchen and bedrooms was hung with framed prints or likenesses of the infamous vlad princes and with boyar family genealogies there were family crests and motifs too complicated battle maps sketches of crumbling fortifications tumuli earthworks ruined castles and keeps and books shelf upon shelf of them most of them crumbling and many quite obviously valuable but all rescued by giresci wherever he had found them over the years in sales old bookshops and antique shops or from estates fallen into poverty or ruin along with the oncepowerful aristocracy all in all the house was a small museum in itself and giresci the sole keeper and curator this arquebusier dragosani remarked at one point must be worth a small fortune to a museum or a collector possibly said his host ive never looked into the question of value but hows this for a weapon and he handed dragosani a crossbow dragosani took it weighed it in his hand frowned the weapon was fairly modern heavy probably as accurate as a rifle and very deadly the interesting thing was that its bolt was of wood possibly lignum vitae with a tip of polished steel also it was loaded it certainly doesnt fit in with the rest of your stuff he said giresci grinned showing strong square teeth oh but it does my other stuff as you put it tells what was what might still be this crossbow is my answer to it a deterrent a weapon against it dragosani nodded a wooden stake through the heart eh and would you really hunt a vampire with this giresci grinned again shook his head nothing so foolish he said anyone who seeks to hunt down a vampire has to be a madman i am merely eccentric hunt one never but what if a vampire decided to hunt me call it selfprotection if you will anyway i feel happier with it in the house but why would you fear such a thing i mean all right im in agreement with you that such creatures have existed and still do possibly but why would one of them bother itself with you if you were a secret agent said giresci would you be happy would you ever feel safe knowing that some outsider knew your business your secrets of course you wouldnt and what of the wamphyri nowi think that perhaps the risk is a very small one but twenty years ago when i bought this weapon i wasnt so sure i had seen something which would stay with me for the rest of my life such creatures really were yes and i knew about them and the more i looked into their legend their history the more monstrous they became in those days i could not sleep for my nightmares buying the crossbow was like whistling in the dark i suppose it might not keep away the dark forces but at least it would let them know that i wasnt afraid of them even if you were said dragosani girescis keen eyes looked deep into his own of course i was he finally answered what here in romania here under these mountains in this house where ive amassed and studied the evidence i was frightened yes but now now the other pulled a halfdisappointed face well im still here alive after all these years nothing has happened to me has it and so nownow i think that maybe they are after all extinct oh they existed if anyone knows that i do but perhaps the last of them has gone forever i hope so anyway but what about you what do you say dragosani dragosani gave the weapon back i say keep your crossbow ladislau giresci and i say look to its maintenance also i say be careful who you invite into your house he reached into his inside pocket for a packet of cigarettes froze as giresci aimed the crossbow directly at his heart across a distance of only six or seven feet and took off the safety catch but i am careful said the other still staring directly into his eyes we apparently know so much you and i i know why i believe but what of you me inside his jacket dragosani slipped his issue pistol from its underarm holster a stranger in search of a legend apparently but such a knowing stranger dragosani shrugged palmed the grip of his gun began to turn its muzzle towards giresci at the same time he turned slightly to the right perhaps giresci was insane a pity also a pity that there would be a hole right through dragosanis jacket and powder burns on the lining but giresci put on the crossbows safety set it down on a small table too cool by far he laughed for a vampire faced with a wooden stake and you know the pressure on that wooden bolt is set to transfix a man but not pass right through him and out the back that would be no good only when the stake is in place is the creature truly immobilised and his eyes went wide and his jaw dropped grey as death dragosani had taken out his gun applied the safety placed it beside the crossbow on the table the pressure on that he rasped is sufficient to blow your heart right out through your backbone i also saw the mirrors on the walls of the corridor and the way you looked into them as i passed too many mirrors by far i thought and the crucifix on the door and doubtless another around your neck for all the good theyd be well and am i a vampire then old man im not sure what you are the other shook his head but a vampire no not you you came in out of the sun after all but think a man seeking me out specifically desiring to know about the wamphyri even knowing that name wamphyri which few if any others in the whole world know why wouldnt you be cautious dragosani breathed deeply relaxed a little well your caution nearly cost you your life he said bluntly so before we go any further are there any more tricks up your sleeve giresci gave a shaky laugh no no he said no i think we understand each other now come lets leave it at that for the moment and here lets see what else you have in that bag of yours he took the string bag from dragosani and directed him to sit at a dining table close to an open window its shady there he explained cooler the whiskys yours said dragosani the rest was for my lunch except im not sure now that i feel like eating that crossbow of yours is a bloody thing of course you can eat of course you can what cheese for lunch no i wouldnt hear of it ive woodcocks in the oven done to a turn by now a greek recipe delicious whisky as an aperitif bread to soak up the fat of the birds cheese for afterwards good an excellent lunch and while we eat ill tell you my story dragosani the younger man allowed himself to be placated accepted a glass which the other produced from an old oak cabinet allowed him to pour him a liberal whisky then giresci hobbled off for a moment to the kitchen and soon dragosani began to sniff the air as the sweet odour of roasting meat slowly filled it and giresci had been right it was delicious another moment and he was back with a smoking oven tray directing dragosani to get plates from a drawer he tipped a brace of small birds on to his guests plate one on to his own there were baked potatoes too and again dragosani got the lions share impressed by girescis generosity he said thats hardly fair on you tm drinking your whisky the other replied so you can eat my birds anyway i can shoot more any time i want them right out of that window there theyre easy to get but whiskys harder to come by believe me im getting the best of the bargain they began to eat and between mouthfuls giresci started to tell his tale it was during the war he said when i was a boy i hurt my back and shoulder very badly which did away with any question of my being a soldier but i wanted to do my bit anyway and so joined the civil defence civil defence hah go to ploiesti even today all these years later and mention civil defence ploiesti burned night after night it just burned dragosani how does one defend when the sky rains bombs so i simply ran around with hundreds of others dragging bodies out of burning or blasted buildings some of them were alive but most were not and others would have been better off dead anyway but its amazing how quickly you get used to it and i was very young and so got used to it all the more quickly youre resilient when youre young you know in the end all the blood and the pain and the death didnt even seem to matter very much not to me nor to the others who were doing the same job you do it because its there like climbing a mountain except this was one where we could never get to the top so we just kept on running around me running can you picture that but in those days i had both my legs you see and thenthen there was this night when it was very bad i mean it was bad almost every night but this one was he shook his head lost for words outside ploiesti towards bucharest there were a good many old houses they were the homes of the aristocracy from the old days when there really was an aristocracy most of them were run down because people hadnt had the money to keep them going oh the people who lived in them still had some money land but not that much they were just hanging on gradually decaying falling apart along with their old houses and that night thats where a stick of bombs fell i was driving an ambulance a converted threetonner actually between the city and the outskirts where theyd rigged up hospitals in a couple of the larger houses up to then you see most of the bombing had been in the middle of town anyway when that stick fell i was blown right off the road and i thought i was a gonerdone for this is how it happened one minute i was driving along with the old rich houses on my right behind high walls and the sky to the east and the south ruddy where the fire was reflected from the underside of the clouds and the next all hell erupting from the very earth it seemed my ambulance was empty thank god for wed just completed one trip and unloaded a halfdozen badly injured people at one of the makeshift hospitals there was just me and my codriver on our way back into ploiesti the truck bumping over old cobbled roads where debris was piled at every corner and then the bombs came they came marching across the rich old estates thundering like berserker demons blowing everything up into the air in great sheets of blinding light and sprays of brilliant red and yellow fire they would have been awesomely beautiful if they werent so hellishly ugly and they marched yes with the precise paces of soldiers but gigantic three hundreds yards away the first one behind the private estates a dull boom and a sudden glare a volcanic spout of fire and mud and the earth shuddering under my speeding truck two hundred and fifty yards the second flinging blazing trees and earth up to the sky high over the rooftops two hundred and the fireball rising higher than the old stone walls higher than the houses themselves and each time the earth shuddering that much stronger that much closer then the house on my immediate right set back from the road at the head of a cobbled drive seeming almost to jump on its foundations and i knew where the next one would land it would hit the house and what about the one after that and i was right almost for a split second the house was thrown into silhouette lit up from behind and the light so bright that it seemed to burn through stone and all making of the gaunt old building a stony skeleton downstairs behind bay windows a figure stood with its arms held high shaking them as in a great and terrible anger then as the glare of that bomb faded and smoking earth rained out of the night the next one hit the house that was when hell came as the roof was blasted off and the walls flew outward in ruin and belching fire and smoke so the road in front of my truck seemed to bend up and back on itself like a wounded snake whipping cobbles through my windscreen and after thateverything was spinning and everything was burning the ambulance was like a toy in some mad childs fist picked up twirled around and hurled aside off the road blazing i was unconscious only for a couple of seconds maybe not even that perhaps it was only shock or nausea but when i came to my senses and crawled from the blazing vehicle it was with only seconds to spare mere seconds and thenboom as for my partner the man in the truck with me i didnt even know his name or if i ever did ive since forgotten it id met him just that night and now said goodbye in a holocaust he had a hook nose thats all i remember i hadnt seen him in the truck when i got out of there if he was still in there well that was the end of him anyway i never saw him again but the bombs were still raining down and i was shivering miserable shocked and vulnerable you know how vulnerable you really are when youve just lost someone even if you never knew him then i looked towards the house that was hit before the bomb landed on the road in front of me amazingly some of it was still standing the downstairs room with the bay windows was still there no windows just the room or the shell of the room anyway but everything else was gone or soon would be the place was burning furiously and that was when i remembered the angry figure id seen silhouetted in that bay window shaking its arms in fury if the room was still there mightnt the figure mightnt he also be there it was instinct the job the unclimbable mountain i ran towards the house maybe it was selfpreservation too for one bomb had already landed on the house it seemed unlikely that another would follow suit until the raid was over i would be as safe there as anywhere in my dazed condition i hadnt taken into account the fact that the place was burning that its fires would be a beacon for the next wave of planes i got to the house safely climbed through the shattered bays and into what had been a library found the angry man or what was left of him what should have been left of him was a corpse but that wasnt how it was i mean the state he was inwell he should have been dead but he wasnt he was undead now dragosani i dont know how much you know about the wamphyri if you know a great deal then the rest of what i have to say may not surprise you greatly but i knew nothing not then and so what i saw what i heard the whole experience was for me simply terrifying of course you arent the first to hear this story i told it afterwards or rather babbled it and have told it several times since but each time ive been more reluctant knowing that if i do tell it it will only be greeted with scepticism or downright disbelief however since my experience was the initial jolt the shock which set my search research and yes obsession in motion it remains the single dominant memory of my entire lifetime and so must be told although ive drastically narrowed down my possible audiences over the years still it must be told indeed you dragosani will be the first to have heard it for seven years the last one was an american who later wanted to rewrite it and publish it as a sensational true story and i had to threaten him with a shotgun to change his mind for obvious reasons i do not wish to draw attention to myself which is precisely what his scheme would have done anyway i can see how youre growing impatient so let me get on at first i could see nothing in that room but debris and damage i didnt really expect to see anything nothing alive anyway the ceiling had caved in to one side a wall had been split and buckled by the blast and was about to go bookshelves had been tumbled everywhere and scattered volumes lay about in disarray some burning and adding to the smoke and the fumes and the chaos the reek of the bomb was heavy in the air acrid and choking and then there came that groan dragosani there are groans and there are groans the groans of men exhausted to the point of collapse the lifegiving groans of women in childbirth the groans of the living before they become the dead and then there are the groans of the undead i knew nothing of it then these were simply the sounds of agony but such an agony such an eternity of pain they came from behind an old overturned desk close to the blownout bays where i stood i clambered through the rubble hauled at the desk until i could drag it upright on to its short legs and away from the riven wall there between where the desk had been tossed by the blast and the heavy skirtingboard lay a man to all intents and purposes he was a man anyway and how was i to know different you must judge for yourself but let man suffice for now his features were imposing he would have been handsome but his face was contorted by agony tall too a big man and strong my god how strong he must have been this was what i thought when i saw his injuries no man ever suffered such injuries before and lived or if he did then he was not a man the ceiling was of ageblackened beams a common enough feature in some of these old houses where it had caved in a massive beam had snapped and its broken ends had fallen one of these a great splinter of agebrittled pine had driven its point into and through the mans chest through the floorboards beneath him too pinning him down like a beetle impaled on the spent stalk of a match that alone should have killed him must have killed any other but one of his sort but that was not all something the blast it must have been which can play weird tricks had sliced his clothes up the middle like a great razor from groin to ribcage he was naked and not only his clothes had been sliced his belly all trembling a mass of raped and severed nerves was laid back in two great flaps of flesh all the viscera visible his very guts were there dragosani palpitating before my horrified eyes but they were not what i expected not the entrails of any ordinary man eh what i see the questions written in your face what am i saying you ask yourself entrails are entrails guts are guts they are slimy pipes coiled tubes and smoking conduits oddly shaped red and yellow and purple loaves of meat strangely convoluted sausages and steamy bladders oh yes and indeed these things were there inside his ruptured trunk but not alone these things something else was there dragosani listened rapt breathless but while his interest was keen with all his attention focused upon girescis story still his face showed little or no true emotion or horror and giresci saw this ah he said and youre not without strength yourself my young friend for there are plenty who would turn pale or puke at what ive just said and theres a lot more to be said yet very well lets see how you take the rest now ive said there was something else inside this mans body cavity and so there was i caught a glimpse of it when first i saw him lying pinned there and thought my eyes must be playing tricks with me anyway we saw each other simultaneously and after our eyes met for the first time the thing inside him seemed to shrink back and disappear behind the rest of his innards orperhaps i had simply imagined it to be there in the first place eh well as to what i thought i had seen picture an octopus or a slug but big with tentacles twining round all the bodys normal organs centring in the region of the heart or behind it yes picture a huge tumour but mobile sentient it was there it wasnt there i had imagined it so i thought but there was no imagining this mans agony his hideous wounds the fact that only a miracle many miracles had so far saved his life and no imagining that he had more than minutes or even seconds to live either oh no for he was certainly done for but he was conscious conscious think of it and try to imagine his torment if you can i could and when he spoke to me i almost fainted from the shock of it that he could think have any sort of ordered thought process left in him waswell unthinkable and yet he maintained something of control over himself his adams apple bobbed bulged and he whispered pull it out drag it out of me the point of the beam draw it from my body i recovered my senses took off my jacket and put it carefully across his burst gut this was for my good more than for his you understand i could have done nothing while his innards were exposed like that then i took hold of the beam itll do no good i told him nervously licking my lips look this will kill you outright if i can get it out and thats a big if youll die at once i wouldnt be doing you any favours if i told you anything else he managed to nod try anyway he gasped and so i tried impossible three men couldnt have shifted it it was literally jammed right through him and down into the floor oh i moved it a little and when i did great chunks of the ceiling came down and the wall settled ominously worse a pool of blood welled up in the depression in his chest where the beam impaled him at that he started groaning and rolling his eyes to set my teeth grating and his body started vibrating under my jacket like someone had sent a jolt of electricity through him and his feet drumming the ground in an absolute fit of pain but would you believe it even while this was going on his shivering hands came up like claws to grab that splintered stump where it pinned him and he tried to add his own weight to mine as i strained to free him it was all a waste of effort and both of us knew it i told him even if we could draw it out it would only bring the whole place down on you look i have chloroform here i can knock you out so you wont have the pain but i have to be honest with you you wont be waking up no no drugs he gasped at once imimmune to chloroform anyway i have to stay conscious stay in control get help more men go go quickly theres no one i protested who would there be out here if there are any people around theyll be busy saving their own lives their families their property this whole district has been bombed to hell and even as i spoke there came the loud droning of bombers and in the distance the thunder of renewed bombing no he insisted you can do it i know you can youll find help and come back youll be well paid for it believe me and i wont die ill hang on ill wait youyoure my one chance you cant refuse me he was desperate understandably but now it was my turn to know agony the agony of frustration of complete and utter impotence this brave strong man doomed to die here now in this place and looking about me i knew that i wouldnt have time to find anyone knew that it was all over his eyes followed my gaze saw the flames where they were licking up outside the demolished bay windows the smoke was getting thicker by the second as books burned freely setting fire to tumbled shelves and furniture smoke was starting to curl down from the sagging ceiling which even now settled a little more and sent down a shower of dust and plaster fragments iill burn he gasped then for a moment his eyes were wide and bright with fear but then a strange look of peaceful resignation came into them itis finished i tried to take his hand but he shook me off and once more he muttered finished after all these long centuries it was finished anyway i told him your injuriessurely you must have known i was anxious to make it as easy as possible for him your pain was so great that youve crossed the pain threshold you no longer feel it at least theres that to be thankful for at that he looked at me and i saw scorn staring out of his eyes my injuries my pain he repeated hah and his short bark of a laugh was bitter as a green lemon full of acid and contempt when i wore the dragonhelm and got a lance through my visor which broke the bridge of my nose shot through and smashed out the back of my skull that was pain he growled pain aye for part of me the real me had been hurt that was silistria where we crushed the ottoman oh i know pain my friend we are old old acquaintances pain and i in at constantinople it was greek fire i had joined the fourth crusade in zara as a mercenary and was burned for my trouble at the height of our triumph ah but didnt we make them pay for it for three whole days we pillaged raped slew and i in my agony half eaten away burned through almost to the very heart of me i was the greatest slayer of all the human flesh had shrivelled but the wamphyri lived on and now this pinned here and crippled where the flames will find me and put an end to it the greek fire expired at last but this one will not human pain and agony i know nothing of them and care less but wamphyri pain impaled burning shrieking in the fire and melting away layer by layer no that must not be these were his words as best i remember them i thought he raved perhaps he was a historian a learned man certainly but already the flames were leaping the heat intolerable i couldnt stay with him but i couldnt leave him not while he was conscious anyway i took out a cotton pad and a small bottle of chloroform and he saw my intention knocked the unstoppered bottle from my hand its contents spilled were consumed in blue flames in an instant fool he hissed youd only deaden the human part my clothes were beginning to feel unbearably hot and small tongues of fire were tracing their way round the skirtingboard i could barely breathe why dont you die i cried then unable to tear myself away from him for gods sake die god he openly mocked me hah no peace for me there even if i believed no room for me in your heaven my friend on the floor amongst other debris from the desk lay a paperknife one edge of its blade was unusually keen i took it up approached him my target would be his throat ear to ear it was as if he read my mind not good enough he told me it has to be the whole head what i asked him what are you saying then he fixed me with his eyes come here i could not disobey i leaned over him gazed down on him held out the knife he took it from me tossed it away now we will do it my way he said the only sure way i stared into his eyes and was held by them they weremagnetic if he had said nothing but merely held me with those eyes then i would have remained there and burned with him i knew it then and know it i now crippled crushed opened up like a fish for the gutting still he had the power go to the kitchen he commanded a cleaver the big one fetch it go now his words released my limbs but his eyes no his mind remained fastened on my mind i went through gathering smoke and flame and returned i showed him the cleaver and he nodded his satisfaction the room was blazing now and my outer clothes were beginning to smoke all the hair of my head felt singed crisped your reward he said i want no reward but i want you to have it i want you to know who you have destroyed this night my shirt tear it open at j the neck i began to do so and leaning over him thought for a single moment that something other than a tongue moved in the partly open cavern of his mouth his breath in my face was a stench i would have turned away but his eyes held me until the job was done and around his neck on a chain of gold there i found a heavy golden medallion i unclasped it took it placed it in my pocket there he sighed payment in full now finish it i lifted the cleaver in a trembling hand but wait he said listen the temptation is on me to kill you it is what you would call selfpreservation which runs strong in the wamphyri but i know it for false hope the death you offer will be clean and merciful the flames slow and intolerable but for all that still i might strike at you before you strike me or even in the moment of the striking and then both of us would die most horribly thereforestay your blow until i close my eyes then strike hard and true then flee strike and put distance between do you understand i nodded he closed his eyes i struck in the moment the straight shiny blade bit into his neck even before it passed through and the head was severed his eyes shot open but he had warned me and i had taken note as his head shot free and blood spurted from his body i leaped backward the head bounced rolled fell among blazing books but god help me i swear that however it flew at whichever angle those awful eyes turned to follow me full of accusation and oh the mouth his mouth and what it contained that forked tongue like a snakes slithering and flickering over lips that drained in an instant from scarlet to deathly white and as bad or worse than all of this the head itself had changed the skin had seemed to tighten on the skull which in turn had elongated to that of a great hound or wolf the glaring eyes previously dark had turned to the colour of blood the upper teeth had clamped down on to the lower lip trapping the scarlet forked tongue there and the great incisors were curved and sharp as needles it is true i saw it i saw it but only in that moment before the whole head began a swift decomposition it was the heat it could only be that the flesh was blistering and melting but the sheer horror of it sent me stumbling away from it stumbling yes and then leaping away from that staring alien rotting head but likewise from his decapitated body in which there had now commenced the most awful commotion a commotionand a collapse my god yes oh yes youll recall i had lain my jacket across his exposed guts now the jacket was gripped by some invisible force from beneath torn apart and tossed violently in two pieces to the ceiling following it lashing wildly a single tapering tentacle of leprous flesh burst upward from his stomach twisting and writhing in a grim paroxysm like a devilish whip it thrashed the air of the room snaking through the smoke and the flames as if searching as the tentacle fell to the floor and began a systematic if spastic examination of the blazing room only recoiling from the flames themselves i stepped up on to a chair and crouched there transfixed with terror and from that slightly elevated vantage point i saw what was left of the corpse falling in upon itself and becoming first putrefaction then bones with the flesh sloughed off finally dust before my eyes as this happened the tentacle grew leaden retracted drew itself back to where the host body had lain to the dust and the last crumbling relics of centuried bones and all of this you understand taking place in mere moments swifter far than i can possibly tell it so that to this day i could not swear my soul on what i saw only that i believe i saw it anyway that was when the ceiling caved in and hurled me from my chair and the entire area of the room where the horror had been burst into flames and hid whatever remained of it but as i staggered from the place and dont ask me how i got out again into the reeking night air for thats gone now from my memory there rose up from the inferno such a protracted cry of intense agony so piteous and terrible and savagely angry a wailing as ever i had heard and hope never to hear again then the skies rained bombs once more and i knew nothing else until i regained consciousness in a field hospital i had lost a leg and or so they later told me something of my mind shell shock of course and when i saw how futile it was to try to tell them otherwise then i decided simply to let it stand at that mind and body both were merely victims of the bombing ah but amongst my belongings when they released me was that which told the true story and i have it still chapter nine across girescis waistcoat he wore a chain of gold now he took from the lefthand waistcoat pocket a silver fob watch completely out of keeping with the antique chain and from the right the medallion of which he had spoken holding the jewellery up for dragosanis inspection dragosani caught his breath and held it ignored the watch and chain but took hold of the medallion and stared at it on one face of the disc he saw a highly stylised heraldic cross which could only be that of the knights of st john of jerusalem but which had been scored through again and again with some sharp instrument and thoroughly defaced and on the other side somehow dragosani had expected it in harsh almost crude basrelief a triple device that of the devil the bat and the dragon he knew the motif only too well and the question it prompted came out in a rush of breath which surprised him more than giresci have you tracked this down the device its heraldic significance i have tried it has a significance obviously but ive so far failed to discover the origin of this specific coat or chapter i can tell you something of the symbolism in local history of the dragon and the bat but as for the devil motif that is ratherobscure oh i know what i make of it all right but thats a personal thing and purely conjectural with little or nothing to sub no dragosani impatiently cut him off that wasnt my meaning i know the motif well enough but what of the man or creature who gave you the medallion were you able to trace his history he stared at the other eager for the answer without quite knowing what had prompted the question asking it had been an almost involuntary action the words simply springing from his tongue as if theyd been waiting there for some trigger giresci nodded took back the medallion watch and chain its curious i know he said but after an experience like mine youd think id steer clear of all such stuff wouldnt you you certainly wouldnt think it would start me off on all those long years of private search and research but thats what it did and where better to start as you seem to have worked out for yourself than with the name and family and history of the creature i had destroyed that night first his name it was faethor ferenczy ferenczy dragosani repeated almost tasting the word he leaned forward his fingertips white where they pressed down on the table between them the name meant something to him he felt sure but what and his family what giresci seemed surprised at something you dont find the name peculiar oh the surname is common enough ill grant you its chiefly hungarian but faethor what of it giresci shrugged i only ever came across it on one other occasion a ninthcentury white khorvaty prince ling his surname was pretty close too ferrenzig ferenczy ferrenzig thought dragosani one and the same and then he checked himself why on earth should he jump to a conclusion like that and yet at the same time he knew that he had not merely jumped to a conclusion but that he had known the duality of the wamphyri identity for a fact dual identity but surely that too was a conclusion drawn in haste he had meant that the names were the same not the men or man who had borne the names or had he in fact meant more than that if so it was an insane conclusion that those two faethors one a ninthcentury khorvatian prince and the other a modern romanian landowner should be one and the same man or should be insane except that dragosani knew from the old thing in the ground that the concept of vampiric and undead longevity was far from insane what else did you learn of him he finally broke the silence what about his family surviving members i mean and his history other than this tenuous khorvaty link giresci frowned and scratched his head talking to you he growled is an unrewarding even frustrating game i keep getting this feeling that you already know most of the answers that perhaps you know even more than i do its as if you merely use me to confirm your own wellestablished beliefs he paused for a moment and when dragosani offered no reply continued anyway as far as im aware faethor ferenczy was the last of his line none survive him then youre mistaken dragosani snapped he at once bit his lip and lowered his voice i meanyou cant be sure of that giresci was taken aback again you know better than me eh he had been drinking dragosanis whisky steadily but seemed little affected again he poured shots before suggesting let me tell you just exactly what i found out about this ferenczy yes the war was over by the time i got started as for making a living i couldnt complain i had my own place right here and was compensated for my lost leg this plus a small disability pension rounded things off i would get by nothing luxurious but i wouldnt starve or go in need of a roof over my head my wife well she had been another victim of the war we had no family and i never remarried as to how i became engrossed with the vampire legend i suppose it was mainly that i had nothing else to do or nothing else that i wanted to do but this drew me like some monstrous magnet all right i wont bore you i explain all of this simply to put you in the picture and as you know my investigations started with faethor ferenczy i went back to where it had happened talked to people who might have known him most of that neighbourhood had been reduced to rubble but a few houses still stood the actual ferenczy house was just a shell blackened inside and out with nothing at all to show who or what had lived there anyway i had his name from various sources postal services lands and property registry missingbelieveddead list war casualty register etc but other than this handful of responsible authorities no one seemed to know him personally then i found an old woman still living in the district a widow luorni some fifteen years before the war shed worked for ferenczy had been his cleaner lady she went in twice weekly and kept his place in good order shed done that for ten years or more until shed grown disenchanted with the work she wouldnt say why specifically but it was obvious to me that the trouble was ferenczy himself something about him something that had gradually grown on her until she couldnt take any more of it at any rate she never once mentioned his name without crossing herself yes but still she managed to tell me some interesting things about himill try to cut it short for you there were no mirrors in his house i know i dont have to explain the significance of that the widow luorni never saw her employer outside the place in daylight she never saw him outdoors at all except on two occasions both times at evening in his own garden she never once prepared a meal for him and never saw him eat anything not ever he had a kitchen yes but to the old ladys knowledge never used it or if he did then he cleared up after himself he had no wife no family no friends he received very little mail was often away from home for weeks on end he did not have a job and did not appear to do any work in the privacy of his home but he always had money plenty of it when i checked i was unable to discover anything by way of a bank account in his name in short ferenczy was a very strange very secretive very reclusive man but thats not all far from it and the rest is even stranger one morning when she went to clean the old girl found the local police there three brothers a wellknown gang of burglars working out of moreni a brutish lot that the police had been after for years had been apprehended at the house apparently theyd broken into the place in the wee small hours of the morning they had thought the house was empty a bad mistake indeed according to statements they later made to the police ferenczy had been dragging one of them and herding the other two to the cellar when his attention was arrested by the arrival of horsemen outside the house remember in those days the local police still used horses in the more isolated regions it was them all right they had been alerted by reports of prowlers in the area the brothers of course and never were three criminals more glad to be given over into the hands of the law thugs they were by all means but theyd been no match for faethor ferenczy each of them had a broken right arm and a broken left leg and their intended victim was responsible think of his strength dragosani the police were too grateful to him to go into the matter too deeply widow luorni said and after all he had only been protecting his life and property but she was there when the brothers were carted away a few hours later and it was plain to her that her employer had scared the daylights out of them anyway ive said that ferenczy was in the act of taking his captives to the cellar for what purpose a place to detain them until help arrived possibly or a place to keep them like a cool pantry until they wererequired eh said dragosani giresci nodded exactly anyway shortly after that the widow stopped working there hmm dragosani mused it surprises me he let her go i mean she must have suspected something you said yourself that she was disenchanted that a feeling of unease had grown in her until she could take no more wouldnt he worry that shed talk about him ah giresci answered but youve forgotten something dragosani what about the way he controlled me with his eyes and his mind on the night of the bombing the night he died hypnotism said the other at once giresci smiled grimly nodded it is an art of the vampire one of many he simply commanded her that so long as he lived she would remain silent while he lived she would simply forget all about him forget that she had ever seen anything sinister in him i see said dragosani and so strong was his power the other continued that she actually did forget until i questioned her about him all those years later for of course by then ferenczy was dead girescis manner was beginning to irritate dragosani the mans air of selfsatisfaction his smugness his obviously high opinion of his own detective skills but of course this is all conjecture the necromancer finally said you dont know any of it for a certainty oh but i do answered the other at once i know it from the widow herself now dont get me wrong im not saying that she simply volunteered all of this it wasnt that we had a good gossip session or anything like that far from it no for i had to really sit down with her and ask her about him repeatedly until id dug it all out he was dead and his power gone certainly but still something of it lingered over do you see dragosani grew thoughtful his eyes narrowed a little suddenly surprisingly he felt threatened by this man he was too clever by far this ladislau giresci dragosani resented him and at once wondered why he found it hard to understand his own feelings the sudden surge of emotion within it was too enclosed in here claustrophobic that must be it he shook his head sat up straighter tried to concentrate of course the widow is long dead now oh yesyears ago so you and i were the only ones who know anything at all about faethor ferenczy giresci peered at the younger man dragosanis voice had sunk so low that it was little more than a growl almost sinister there seemed something wrong with him even under girescis questioning gaze he gave himself another shake rapidly blinking his eyes thats right giresci answered frowning ive told no one else in oh longer than i can remember no point telling anyone else for whod believe but are you all right my friend are you well is something bothering you me dragosani found himself leaning forward as if drawn towards giresci he deliberately forced himself upright in his chair no of course not im a little drowsy thats all my meal i suppose the good food youve served me also ive driven a long way in the last few days yes thats it im tired youre sure yes quite sure but go on giresci dont stop now please tell me more about ferenczy and his forebears about the ferrenzigs the wamphyri in general tell me anything else you know or suspect tell me everything everything it could take a week longer i have a week dragosani answered damn i believe youre serious i am well now dragosani doubtless youre a nice enough young fellow and its good to talk to someone whos genuinely interested and knows something about ones subject but what makes you think id care to spend a whole week like that at my age times important or maybe you think i have the same kind of longevity ferenczy had eh dragosani smiled but thinly on the point of saying you can talk to me here or in moscow he checked himself that wasnt necessary not yet anyway and it might let borowitz in on his big secret how he came to be a necromancer in the first place then how about the next hour or two he compromised and since youve suggested it we can start with ferenczys longevity giresci chuckled fair enough anyway theres whisky left yet he poured himself another shot made himself comfortable and after a moments thought ferenczys longevity the nearimmortality of the vampire let me tell you something else the widow luorni said she said that when she was a small girl her grandmother had remembered a ferenczy living in the same house and her grandmother before her nothing strange about that though son follows father right there were plenty of old boyar families round here whose names went back to time immemorial there still are whats strange is this to the widows knowledge there had never been any female ferenczys and how does a man pass on his name if he never takes a wife eh and of course you looked into it said dragosani i did records were scarce however for the war had destroyed a great deal but certainly the house had been the seat of the ferenczys as far back as i could trace it and never a woman among em a celibate lot eh without understanding his outrage dragosani suddenly felt that he himself had been insulted or perhaps it was only his natural intelligence which felt slighted celibate he said stiffly i think not giresci nodded in fact he was well aware of the wamphyris rapacious nature no of course not he confirmed dragosanis denial what a vampire celibate ridiculous lust is the very force that drives him universal lust for power flesh blood but listen to this in one bela ferenczy set off across the meridionali to visit a cousin or other relative in the mountains of the northern austrohungarian borders now this much is well documented indeed old bela seems to have gone to a deal of trouble to let people know he was going visiting he installed a man to look after the place while he was away not a local man incidentally but someone of gypsy stock hired a coach and driver for the early stages of the journey made reservations for connections through the high passes and completed all of the preparations necessary to travel in these parts in those days and he put it about locally that this was to be a journey of valediction he had seemed to grow very old very quickly in the last year or two and so it was accepted that he went to say his last farewells to distant relatives now remember we were still very much moldaviawallachia at that time in europe the industrial revolution was in full swing everywhere but here insular as ever we were so backward as to seem almost retarded the lemberggalatz railway skirting the mountains was still more than a decade away news travelled extremely slowly and records were hard to keep i mention this to highlight the fact that in this case there was good communication and that a record did survive case dragosani queried what case are you talking about the case of bela ferenczys sudden death when his coach and horses were hurled into a precipice by an avalanche in one of the high passes news of the accident got swiftly back here the old mans szgany retainer took ferenczys sealed will to the local registrar the will was posted without delay showing that the ferenczy house and grounds were to pass to a cousin one giorg who had apparently already been appraised of the situation and his inheritance dragosani nodded and of course this giorg ferenczy later turned up and took possession he would be or he would appear to be younger far than bela but the family resemblance would be unquestionable good giresci barked you follow my reasoning precisely having lived here for fifty years which would normally make him an old man bela had decided it was high time he died and made way for the next in line and after giorg faethor of course giresci scratched his chin reflectively ive often wondered he said if i had not killed him on the night of the bombing if he had survived that night what his next incarnation would have been would he have shown up after the war in some new ferenczy guise to rebuild the house and carry on as before i think the answer is probably yes they are territorial the wamphyri and so youre convinced that bela giorg and faethor were all one and the same of course i thought that was understood didnt he tell me as much himself when he raved of the battles at silistria and constantinople and before bela there was grigor karl peter and stefan oh and the lord knows how many others all the way back to faethor ferrenzig the princeling and probably beyond this was his territory do you see he held bloody dominion here and in the olden times as princelings or boyars my god but the wamphyri were fierce about their holdings that was why he joined the fourth crusade to keep olden and future enemies off his lands his lands you understand no matter what king or government or system is in power the vampire considers his home ground to be his he fought to protect himself his monstrous heritage and not for a mangy pack of scummy foreigners out of the west youve seen the defaced crusader cross on the reverse of my medallion hah when they dishonoured him he scorned them spat on them and have you actually traced his name that far back to constantinople i mean in something of his awe of the vampire or his envy was evident in dragosanis voice giresci cocked his head a little on one side dragosani hows your history hardly brilliant fair i suppose hmm well many names came down from the fourth crusade but youll be hard put to find a ferenczy or ferrenzig amongst them he was there though be sure of it how do i know well its possible that youre talking to the worlds foremost authority on that particular bloodbath and ive discovered things which im sure many other historians have overlooked of course i had the advantage of knowing what i was looking for my objectives were specific but in the process of tracking down the vampire ive naturally covered a deal of extraneous ground man i could write a book on the fourth crusade certainly from hungary to constantinople and talking of constantinople lord what a hell that must have been what a battle and sure enough right there in the thick of it wherever the fighting raged fiercest there was this man and the brutish horde he commanded he was there too when the city fell when he and his band of mercenary berserkers rampaged utterly out of control yes and his excesses spread like a cancer the entire army joined in they raped pillaged and massacred for three long days pope innocent iii had called the crusade now aghast at what it had turned into he was unable to regain control the crusaders had vowed to take the holy land but innocent and his legate were obliged to absolve them from that vow he as good as washed his hands of the affair but in secret communiquйs he exercised what little control remained to him ordering that those directly responsible for gross acts of excessive and unnatural cruelty must gain neither glory nor rich reward for their barbarism but that their names shall not be mentioned nor shall they be offered respect or high regard well no need to look far for a scapegoat a certain bloodthirsty wallach recruited in zara would fit the bill nicely nor was he blameless at first the crusaders had honoured and elevated him perhaps secretly theyd even envied or feared him but now he found himself stripped of all honours and disgraced and his name was stricken from all records in return he scorned them for their duplicity and defacing the sigil of their campaign the cross on his medallion he took his band and went home proud and fierce under the banner of the devil the bat and the dragon dragosani chewed on his lip for a moment before saying lets assume that to all intents and purposes all of this is true or at least based on the truth to the best of your knowledge still there are several important questions remaining to be answered such as ferenczy was a vampire a vampire takes victims when the hunger is on him hell kill as ruthlessly as a fox kills chickens and just as thoughtlessly yet it seems his sheet was clean how could he possibly live here through all those centuries without once arousing suspicion remember ladislau giresci the blood is the life were there no cases of vampirism around ploiesti none not one not as long as theyve kept records so far as i can discover giresci smiled grimly and leaned forward but if you were a vampire dragosani would you take victims right on your own doorstep no i dont suppose i would dragosani frowned where then north my friend in the meridionali itself where else but the transylvanian alps where all vampire stories seem to have their roots slanic and sinaia in the foothills brasov and sacele beyond the pass and none of them more than fifty miles distant from ferenczys house and all shunned for their evil reputations what even now dragosani feigned surprise but he remembered what maura kinkovsi had had to say on the subject three years ago stories linger down the years dragosani especially ghost stories they take no chances the mountain folk if you die young up there and theres no simple explanation its the stake for you for sure as to actual case histories the last child to die of a vampires bite did so in slanic in the winter of fortythree yes and she was buried with a stake through her heart like a great many innocents before her what there had been eleven that year alone in the villages around in fortythree you say giresci nodded oh yes and i see youve already made the connection thats right it was just a few months before ferenczy died she was his last victim or at least the last we know of of course with the war going on hed be far less restricted his victims more readily disposed of he may well have taken many we dont know about people who simply went missing during airraids in the countryside around and there were plenty of those believe me he paused any more questions you said that those towns you named were up in the mountains fifty miles from ploiesti thats rough country the ground rises rapidly through two thousand feet in places so how did ferenczy do it did he become a bat and fly to his hunting grounds folklore says he has that power bat wolf wraith even flea bug spider buti think not theres no hard evidence anywhere to be found but you ask how did he get to his kill i dont know i have my own ideasbut no proof at all what ideas dragosani asked and waited halfanxiously for giresci to answer he already knew the correct answer to the question or believed he did but now he would discover just how clever giresci really was and how dangerouswhat he once again propped himself upright in his chair what the hell was going wrong with his thought processes a vampire the other slowly answered carefully for mulating his thoughts is not human i saw enough on the night ferenczy died to convince me of that so what is he he is an alien creature a cohabitant of mans body and mind he is at best symbiotic a gestaltcreature and at worst a parasite a hideous lamprey correct dragosani snapped his agreement but silently to himself and at once he felt dizzy and confused he had known for a fact that giresci was right in his assessment of the vampire but how had he known and even as he wondered what was happening to him now dragosani heard himself say but isnt he supernatural surely he would need to be to go about his business and still escape detection down all the years not supernatural no giresci shook his head super human hypnotic magnetic creature of illusion in no way a magician but in every way a great trickster not a bat but silent as a bat not a wolf but swift as a wolf not a flea but a monster with a fleas appetite for blood on a scale unprecedented thats my idea of the vampire dragosani fifty miles to a creature like that a healthy evenings walk he would be able to compel his human shell to excesses of effort undreamed of all correct all of it dragosani mentally agreed and out loud the name ferenczy you say its common enough why being so clever and taking into account all your research and what have you havent you tracked down other ferenczys you say that the vampire is territorial and this region belonged to faethor surely then there must have been other territories and who lords or lorded it over them eh his voice was a rasp harsh as a file once more giresci was a little taken aback why youve preempted me he finally answered shrewd stuff dragosani very astute if faethor ferenczy had singlehandedly held moldavia and eastern transylvania in his thrall for seven hundred years and more what of the rest of romania is that what youre saying romania hungary greece wherever vampires still dwell still dwell dragosani god forbid have it your own way dragosani snapped where they used to dwell then giresci drew back from him a little way a castle ferenczy in the alps blew itself right off the mountain back in the late twenties that was put down to marshgas methane accumulated in the vaults and dungeons an illregarded place no one missed it anyway so far as is known its owner went with it a baron or count or some such his name was janos ferenczy but documentation history records forget it that ones page in history has been erased even more surely than old faethors in the fourth crusade which in my book of course only serves to make him more suspect rightly so dragosani agreed at once he was blown to hell eh old janos good and have you tracked down any other vampires ladislau giresci come tell me now were there no ferenczys who paid for their crimes and were put down in their heyday how say you what of the western carpatii say beyond the oltul eh but that should be familiar ground for you dragosani said the other you were born there after all knowing as much as you do and being so clever in your own right yes and with this keen interest of yours in vampires surely by now youll have made your own investigations and searches dragosani nodded indeed indeed and five hundred years ago in the west there was such a creature he butchered the vile turk in his thousands and was slain for his socalled unnatural zest good giresci thumped the table no longer seeming to notice the change which had come over his guest yes youre right his name was thibor a powerful boyar destroyed in the end by the vlads he had great power over his szekely followers too much power so that the princes feared and were jealous of him also its likely they suspected he was one of the wamphyri its only us modern sophisticated men who doubt such things the primitive and the barbarian they know better what else do you know of this one dragosani growled not much not yet hes to be my next project i know that he was executed murdered dragosani cut in murdered then somewhere west of the river below lonesti and that he was staked and buried in a secret place but and was he decapitated too this thibor eh i found no records to that effect i he was not dragosani hissed from between clenched teeth they weighted him down with silver and iron chains put a stake in his vitals and entombed him but they let him keep his head you of all people should know what that means ladislau giresci he was not dead he was undead he still is giresci struggled upright in his chair finally he had sensed that something was desperately wrong his eyes had been a little glazed but now they came back into focus seeing the snarl on dragosanis face he began to tremble and pant its far too dim in here he gasped tar too close and he reached out a fluttering hand to swing back a shutter on the window the sun at once streamed in dragosani had risen to his feet was leaning forward in a halfcrouch now his hand reached across the table and trapped girescis wrist in a band of steellike fingers his grip was ferocious your next project you old fool and if you had found him found the vampires grave what then eh old faethor showed you how to do it didnt he and would you do it again ladislau giresci what are you mad giresci drew back more yet inadvertently dragging the younger mans hand and arm into the beam of sunlight dragosani at once released him snatched himself upright and reeled away into the rooms cool shadows he had felt the sunlight on his arm like acid and in that moment he had known thibor he spat the word out like a vile taste you man youre ill giresci was struggling to stand up you old bastard you old devil you ancient thing in the earth you would have used me dragosani raved as if to himself but in the back of his mind at the edge of his awareness something chuckled evilly and shrank back shrank down you need a doctor giresci gasped a psychiatrist anyway dragosani ignored him he understood all now he crossed to the small occasional table took up his gun from where hed placed it jammed it firmly into its underarm holster he made to stride from the room stopped and turned back giresci cringed away from him as he approached too much the oldster was babbling you know far too much i dont know who you are but listen to me said dragosani i dont even know what you are dragosani i dragosani backhanded him bruising his mouth and jerking his head round on his scrawny neck listen i said when giresci turned his watering eyes back to dragosani they had gone wide with shock iim listening two things dragosani told him one you will tell no one else about faethor ferenczy or what youve discovered of him two you will never mention the name of thibor ferenczy again or ever attempt to learn more than you already know of him is this understood giresci nodded and in the next second his eyes went wider still y you he said dragosani laughed however shrilly me man if i were thibor youd be dead now no but i know of him and now he knows of you he turned towards the door paused and tossed back over his shoulder its possible youll be hearing from me till then goodbye and giresci mark well what ive said leaving the house and moving into sunlight dragosani groaned and gritted his teethbut the sun did him no harm still he doubted if he would ever feel entirely comfortable under its rays again it was not dragosani who had felt the suns sting in girescis house but thibor the old devil in the ground thibor who in that moment of time had been ascendant in control but even knowing that it was so still dragosani was glad to get out of the direct sunlight and into his car the interior of the big volga was like a furnace but the heat was in no way supernatural as dragosani wound the windows down and pulled away heading for the main road so the temperature dropped and he breathed easier and only then did he reach into his mind to dig out the leechthing which was still hiding there for he knew that if thibor could reach him then surely he could reach thibor oh yes i know your name now old devil he said it was you thibor wasnt it back there at girescis it was you guiding my tongue asking him those questions for a moment there was nothing then i wont deny it dragosani but lets be reasonable did little to hide the fact of my presence and no harm done i was merely you were testing your power dragosani snapped you tried to usurp my mind youve been trying to do so for the last three years and might have succeeded if i hadnt been so far away i see it all now what accusations remember dragosani it was you came to me that time of your own free will you invited me into your mind you asked for my help with the woman and i gave it willingly too willingly dragosani was bitter i hurt that girl or you did through me your lust in my bodyi could barely control it i might easily have killed her you enjoyed it no you enjoyed it i was carried along by it well and maybe she deserved it but i dont deserve you sneaking into my mind like a thief to steal my thoughts and your lust has stayed in my body which you must have known it would my invitation wasnt permanent old dragon anyway ive learned my lesson youre not to be trusted not in any way youre treacherous what the voice in dragosanis head made mock of him treacherous dragosani i am your father father of lies dragosani answered how have i lied in many ways you were weak three years ago and i brought you food i gave you back a measure of your strength you scorned pigs blood and said it was good only for freshening the earth a lie it freshened you it gave you a lasting strength sufficient that you could reach out your mind to me even these three years later and in the full light of day well ill feed you no more also you said sunlight would merely irritate you another lie for ive felt how it burns you and how many other lies have you told to me no thibor you do nothing except for your own advantage i always guessed it but now i know for sure and what will you do about it nothing he answered nothing nothing at all perhaps i made a mistake seeking to be as you were desiring to be one of the wamphyri perhaps ill now go away from here and this time stay away and let the years complete their work on you i may have temporarily given your stinking bones something of flesh something of life but the centuries will take it all back again im sure dragosani no listen i wasnt testing my power i wasnt testing anything do you remember how i told you i was not unique that others of the wamphyri were extant even now i said that for centuries i had waited for them to come and release or avenge me and they came not do you remember that yes what of it why cant you see if our roles were reversed would you have been able to resist you gave me the opportunity to find out about those others to learn what had become of them old faethor who was my father dead at last and janos a brother of mine who always hated me exploded in the gasses of what he kept in his dungeons aye dead and gone both of them and i for one glad of it what didnt they leave me rotting in the earth for half a millennium oh they heard me calling down all those bitter nights be sure of it but did they come to set me free not them so ladislau giresci fancies himself a tracker of vampires does he but i would have shown him how to track them who left me to the dirt and the worms and the seep of centuries when i rise up from this place ah well they are gone now and my vengeance with them dragosani smiled grimly i cant help asking myself thibor why they deserted you and left you to your fate your own father for instance faethor ferenczy who would know you better than him and why did your brother janos hate you so theres more to you than meets the eye eh thibor a black sheep among vampires who ever heard of such a thing but why not you yourself have mentioned your excesses more than once and i have personal recollections of them do the things youve done bother even your conscience or are the wamphyri and you in particular without conscience you make much of very little dragosani oh i dont think so im only just beginning to learn about you thibor when you arent lying outright then youre obscuring the truth its the way you are you dont know any other way the vampire was furious you find it easy to insult me because you know i may not strike you how have i obscured the truth how havent you said that i gave you the opportunity to discover what had become of these kin of yours but in fact you made your own opportunity it wasnt my intention when i started out from moscow to go to the library in pitesti thibor so who put that thought in my head again eh and when you learned of ladislau giresci why i just had to go and see him didnt i listen dragosani no you listen you used me used me just as the vampire of popular fiction uses his human vassals just as you used your szekely serfs five hundred years ago but im no serf thibor ferenczy and thats your big mistake its one youll come to regret too dragosani i ill hear no more talk old dragon not from your forked tongue theres only one thing you can do for me now get yourself out of my mind dragosanis mind was fully developed now trained sharp as one of his own scalpels casehardened by the necromancy which this very vampire had inspired in him its cutting edge was swift and deadly in its action it was keener than an ordinary mans is over that of a mongol but how strong was it now dragosani put it to the test he squeezed with his mind thrusting the monster out driving him away ingrate thibor accused retreating but dont think it ends here one day youll need me and then youll return only dont wait too long dragosani a year at most and after that put aside all thoughts of ever acquiring wamphyri knowledge for youll be too late a year my son and no more than a year ill be waiting and perhaps by then i willhaveforgiven youdragosaaniiii then he was gone dragosani relaxed breathed deeply suddenly felt exhausted it had been no easy thing exorcising thibor the vampire had resisted but dragosani had been stronger the real problem had not lain in getting him out it would lie in keeping him out or perhaps not now that dragosani knew thibor was able to secretly insinuate himself in his being he could maintain a watch for the old devil but as for his romanian holiday that was over before it had begun cursing he savagely applied the brakes and slewed the volga round in a half circle then started back the way he had come he was tired but sleep would have to wait all dragosani wanted now was to put distance between himself and the thing in the ground dragosani stopped just outside bucharest for petrol and tried to raise thibor it was still full daylight but he got something a faint response a shiver in his mind that echoed like a coffin and wriggled like a graveworm in braida in the dusk he tried again the presence was stronger as night drew on thibor was there and might have responded if dragosani had given him the opportunity he did not but closed his mind and drove on at reni after passing through customs he let down all his defences and literally invited thibor in it was full night now but the whisper in his mind was faint as if it came from a million miles away dragosaaaniiii coward you flee from me an old creature trapped in the earth tm no coward old one and im not fleeing but putting myself outside your range where you cant reach me and if you do manage to reach me next time ill know you see thibor you need me more than i need you now you can just lie there and think it over i may come back one day and i may not but when if i do it will be on my terms dragosani i goodbye thibor and behind him thibor ferenczys mental whisper was eaten up along with all the miles and in a little while dragosani felt safe to stop and sleep and dream his own dreams chapter ten the spring of viktor shukshin was running close to broke he had frittered away his inheritance from mary keoghsnaiths estate on various business ventures which had fallen through rates on the big house near bonnyrigg were high the money he made from his private tutoring was insufficient to keep him he would sell the house but it had fallen into such a state of disrepair that it would no longer realise a high price also he needed the seclusion that the place gave him to let some of the rooms would likewise diminish his privacy and in any case the structural and decorative repairs necessary before any letting could even be considered were quite beyond his means his linguistic talent was not the only one he commanded however and so over the period of the last few months he had made several discreet trips into london to follow up and check out certain points of information he had acquired in the years he had been domiciled in the british isles information which should be worth a deal of money to certain very interested foreign parties in short viktor shukshin was a spy or at least it had been intended that he should become one when gregor borowitz first sent him out of the ussr in of course there had been a hardening of eastwest relationships at that time and a general hardening of russias policy towards her dissidents so that it hadnt been too difficult for shukshin to get into great britain in the guise of a political refugee after that and especially after meeting marrying murdering mary keogh shukshin had found himself so wellfixed that he had reneged on his soviet boss and settled to actual citizenship still he had not forgotten his original reason for coming to great britain and as a hedge against the future had long since set about amassing information which might eventually be useful to his mother country it was only recently though because of his financial difficulties that he had begun to realise what a good position he was in if the soviets would not pay him the price he demanded for his information then he could threaten them with the release to the british of his knowledge of a certain russian organisation which was why this sparkling may morning shukshin had written a carefully coded letter to an old penfriend in berlin one who had not heard from him in over fifteen years and had thought never to hear from him again who would forward his letter through east germany and on to gregor borowitz himself in moscow that letter was in the post even now and shukshin had just returned home in his battered ford from the bonnyrigg post office but coming across the river on the stone bridge that led to his driveway shukshin had been startled to feel in himself a strange churning which hed at once recognised of old a weird energy which turned his spine chilly and tugged at his hair like static electricity on the bridge leaning over the parapet and staring into the rivers slow swirl a slim young man in a scarf and overcoat had lifted his head and stared at shukshins car his pale blue serious eyes had seemed to burn right through the cars bodywork touching shukshin with their cold gaze and the russian had known that the stranger was endowed with more than natures ordinary talents that he commanded more than mans normal powers of perception he had known it absolutely for shukshin too was gifted he was a spotter his talent lay in the instant recognition of another espendowed person as to who the youth could be the significance of his appearing here at this time there were several possibilities it could be coincidence an accidental meeting this would not be the first time nor even the fiftieth that shukshin had stumbled across such a person but esp came in a range of strengths and colours and this one had been strong indeed and scarlet a redtinged cloud in shukshins mind or his presence here could be deliberate he may have been sent here the british branch must also have its spotters and shukshin may well have been detected and trailed in the light of his recent trips to london and what he had subsequently discovered of the british espionage branch this theory was by no means farfetched and sent something of a panic surging through him panic and more than panic there was something else in shukshin now something he must control something which made his eyes narrow as he thought how easily he might have swerved his car to crush the stranger against the parapet wall the emotion was hatred the deep and abiding hatred he felt towards all espers his rage slowly subsided and he looked at his hands the knuckles of his fingers were white where he gripped the edges of his desk he forced himself to release his grip and sat back breathing deeply it was always this way but he had learned how to control it almost but if only he had not sent that letter to borowitz that might have been a big mistake perhaps he should have offered his services direct to the british instead perhaps he still should and without delay before they could investigate him any further such were his thoughts when the doorbell rang because they were guilty thoughts he gave a violent start shukshins study was downstairs in a room to the rear of the house that opened through patio windows into its own courtyard now he stood up from his desk passed from bright spring sunshine into gloom as he hurried through the ground floor rooms and corridors towards the front and midway started again as the doorbell once more tore at his nerveendings im coming im coming he called ahead but he slowed down and came to a halt on the interior threshold of the long glazed porch out there beyond the frosted glass stood a wellmuffled figure which shukshin knew at once it was that of the young man from the bridge shukshin knew it in two ways one of which was simple observation and could be in error the other way was more certain as positive as a fingerprint he felt again the surge of rare energyfields and the heat of his instinctive hatred for all such esptalented men again a tide of panic and passion rose up in him which he forcibly put down before moving to the door well he had wondered about the stranger hadnt he now it seemed that he was not to be kept in suspense one way or the other he would soon discover what was going on here he opened the door how do you do said harry keogh smiling and extending his hand you must be viktor shukshin and i believe you give private tuition in german and russian shukshin did not take keoghs hand but simply stood and stared at him for his own part harry stared back and for all that he continued to smile still his flesh crawled in the knowledge that he now stood face to face with his mothers murderer he put the thought aside for the moment it was sufficient to just look at the other and absorb what he could of this stranger who he intended to destroy the russian was in his late forties but looked at least ten years older he had a paunch and his dark hair was streaked with grey his sideburns ran into a neatly trimmed pointed beard beneath a fleshy mouth his dark eyes were redrimmed and deeply sunken in a face lined and grey he did not appear in good health but keogh suspected that there was a dangerous strength in him also his hands were huge his shoulders broad for all that they were a little hunched and if he had stood upright he would be well over six feet tall all in all he was a grotesquely impressive figure of a man and he was a murderer whose blood was cold as ice er you do give language lessons dont you shukshins face cracked into something approaching a smile a nervous tic tugged at the flesh at the corner of his mouth indeed i do he answered his voice liquid and deep retaining a trace of his native accent i take it i was recommended who er sent you to me recommended keogh answered no not exactly ive seen your ads in the papers thats all no one sent me ah shukshin was cautious and you require lessons is that it excuse me if im slow on the uptake but no one seems much interested in languages these days i have one or two regulars thats about it i cant really afford the time to take on anyone else just now also im rather expensive but didnt you get enough of them at school languages i mean not school keogh corrected him college he shrugged its the old story im afraid i had no time for it when it was free and so now ill have to pay for it i intend to do a lot of travelling you see and i thought youd like to brush up on your german eh and my russian alarm bells rang in shukshins mind vying with the pressures already there this was all false and he knew it also there was more to this young man than some weird esp talent shukshin had the odd feeling that he knew him from somewhere oh he finally said then youre a rare one not many englishmen go to russia these days and fewer still want to learn the language is your visit to be business or purely pleasure keogh cut him off may i come in shukshin didnt want him in the house would greatly prefer to slam the door in his face but at the same time he must find out about him he stood aside and keogh entered and the door closing behind him sounded to him like a lid coming down on a coffin he could almost feel the russians animosity could almost taste his hatred but why should shukshin hate him he didnt even know him i didnt catch your name said the russian leading the way to his study keogh was prepared for that he waited a moment following on the others heels until they reached the airy study with its natural light flooding in through the patio windows then said my name is harry harry keoghstepfather in front of him shukshin had almost reached his desk now he froze poised for a moment as if turned to stone then quickly turned to face his visitor keogh had expected a response something like this but nothing quite so dramatic the mans face had turned to chalk in the frame of his darker sideburns and beard his jelly lips trembled with a mixture of fear shockand rage what his voice was hoarse now a gasp whats that you say harry keogh is this some kind of practical but now he looked closer and knew why he had thought hed known this youth before he had been only a child then but the features were the same yes and his mother had had them before him in fact now that he knew who this was the resemblance was remarkable what was more the boy seemed to have acquired something of her wild talent too her talent the boy was a psychic a medium inherited from his mother that was it that was what shukshin could detect in him echoes of his mothers talent stepfather said keogh feigning concern are you all right he offered a hand but the other backed away from it into his desk he clawed his way round the desk flopped into his chair its ashock he said then i mean seeing you here after all these years he got a grip of himself sighed his relief and breathed more deeply more freely a great shock i didnt mean to startle you keogh lied i thought youd be pleased to see me to learn how well im doing also i thought it was time i got to know you i mean youre the only real link i have with my past my early childhood my mother your mother shukshin immediately went on the defensive his face was regaining a little of its former colour as he quickly composed himself obviously his fears that hed been discovered by the british esp agency were unfounded keogh was simply paying him a belated visit returning to his roots he was genuinely interested in his past but if that was so then what was all that rubbish about wanting to learn german and russian he snapped was it really necessary to go through all that just to get to see me oh keogh answered with a shrug yes i admit that was just a ploy to get to see you but it was in no way malicious i just wanted to see if youd recognise me before i told you who i was he kept the smile on his face shukshin was in control of himself again his anger plain and making his face ugly now seemed a good time to drop a second bombshell anyway i speak both german and russian far more fluently than you ever could stepfather in fact i could instruct you shukshin prided himself on his linguistic ability he could hardly believe his ears what was this pup talking about he could instruct him was he insane shukshin had been teaching languages since before harry keogh was born the russians pride took precedence over his churning emotions and the hatred inside him which the presence of any esper invariably invoked hah he barked ridiculous why i was born a russian i took honours in my mother tongue when i was just seventeen i had a diploma in german before i was twenty i dont know where you get your funny ideas harry keogh but they dont make much sense do you honestly think that a couple of gces can match the work of a lifetime or are you deliberately trying to annoy me keogh continued to smile but it was now a smile with hard edges he took a chair opposite shukshin and smiled that hard smile right across the desk and into the others scornful face and he reached out his mind to an old friend of his klaus grunbaum an expow who had married an english girl and settled in hartlepool after the war grunbaum had died of a stroke in and was buried in the grayfields estate cemetery it made no difference that that was one hundred and fifty miles away now grunbaum answered harry spoke to him through him spoke in a rapid fluent german directly across viktor shukshins desk and into his face and hows this for german stepfather youll probably recognise that this is how its spoken around ham burg harry paused and in the next moment changed hisgrunbaums accent or perhaps youd prefer this its hoch deutsch as spoken by the sophisticated elite the gentry and aped by the masses or would you like me to do something really clever something grammatical maybe would that convince you clever shukshin sneeringly admitted his eyes had widened while harry talked but now he narrowed them a very clever exercise in dialectal german yes and quite fluent but anyone could learn a few sentences like that parrotfashion in half an hour russian is a different matter entirely keoghs grin grew tighter he thanked klaus grunbaum and switched his mind elsewhere to a cemetery in nearby edinburgh hed been there recently to spend a little time with his russian grandmother dead some months before hed been born now he found her again used her to speak to his stepfather in his native tongue with natashas unwavering command of the language indeed with her mind he commenced a diatribe on the failure of the repressive communist system only pausing after several astonishing minutes when finally shukshin cried what is this harry more rubbish learned parrotfashion whats the purpose of all this trickery but for all his bluster still shukshins heart beat a little faster a little heavier in his chest the boy sounded so much likelike someone else someone he had detested still using his grandmothers russian but speaking now from his own mind keogh answered oh and could i learn this parrotfashion are you so blind that you cant see the truth when you meet it face to face im a talented man stepfather more talented than you could possibly imagine far more talented than ever my poor mother was shukshin stood up and leaned on his desk and the hatred washed out from him in a tide seeming almost physically to break on keogh like a wave all right so youre a clever young bastard he answered in russian so what and thats twice youve mentioned your mother what are you getting at harry keogh its almost as if you were threatening me harry continued to use shukshins own tongue threatening but why should i threaten you stepfather i only came to see you thats all and to ask a favour what you try to make me look like a fool and then have the audacity to ask favours what is it you want of me it was time for the third bombshell keogh also got to his feet im told that my mother loved to skate he said his russian still perfect theres a river out there down beyond the bottom of the garden id like to come back in the winter and visit you again perhaps youll be less excitable then and well be able to talk more calmly and maybe ill bring my skates and go on the frozen river like my mother used to down there where the garden ends once more ashen shukshin reeled clutched at his desk then his eyes began to burn with hatred and his fleshy lips drew back from his teeth he could no longer contain his anger his hatred he must strike this arrogant pup knock him down he mustmustmust as shukshin began to sidle round the desk towards him harry realised his danger and backed towards the door of the study he wasnt finished yet however there was one last thing he must do reaching into his overcoat pocket he drew something out ive brought something for you he said this time speaking in english something from the old days when i was very small something that belongs to you get out shukshin snarled get out while youre still one piece you and your damned insinuations you want to visit me again in the winter i forbid it i want nothing more of you stepbrat go and make a fool of someone else go now before dont worry said harry im going for now but first catch and he tossed something then he turned and walked through the door into the shadowy house and out of sight shukshin automatically caught what hed thrown stared at it for a second then his mind reeled and he went to his knees long after hed heard the front door slam he continued to stare at the impossible thing in his hand the gold was burnished as if brand new and the solitary catseye stone seemed to stare back at him in a cold speculation all its own from the air the chateau bronnitsy seemed not to have changed a great deal from the old days no one would guess that it housed the worlds finest espionage unit gregor borowitzs ebranch or that it was anything but a tottering old pile but that was exactly the way borowitz wanted it and he silently complimented himself on work well planned and executed as his helicopter fanned low over the towers and rooftops of the place and down towards the tiny helipad which was simply a square of whitewashed concrete emblazoned with a green circle lying between a huddle of outbuildings and the chateau itself outbuildings yes that is what they looked like from up here old barns or sheds long fallen into disrepair and allowed to settle and crumble until they were little more than low humps of masonry dotted about the greater mass of the chateau and this too was precisely to borowitzs specifications they were in fact defensive positions machinegun posts completely functional and fully efficient giving them a total arc of fire to cover the entire open area between the chateau and its perimeter wall other pillboxes had been built into the wall itself whose external face could become an electrical barrier at the throw of a switch second only to the spacebase at baikonur ebranch was now housed in one of the bestfortified installations in the ussr certainly it vied favourably with the joint atomic and plasma research station at gargetya lost in the urals whose chief asset was its isolation but in one major aspect it was superior to both baikonur and gargetya namely it was secret in the fullest sense of the word apart from borowitzs operatives no one but a doublehandful of men even suspected that the chateau in its present form existed and of these only three or four knew that it housed ebranch one of these was the premier himself who had visited borowitz here on several occasions another less happily was yuri andropov who had not visited and never would not on borowitzs invitation the helicopter settled to its pad and as its rotor slowed borowitz slid back his door and swung out his legs a security man ducking low ran in under the whirling vanes and helped him down clutching his hat borowitz let himself be assisted away from the aircraft and through an arched doorway into that area of the chateau which once had been the courtyard now it was roofed over and partitioned into airy conservatories and laboratories where branch operatives might study and practise their peculiar talents in comparative comfort or whatever condition or environment best suited their work borowitz had been late out of bed this morning which was why hed called for the branch helicopter to fly him in from his dacha even so he was still an hour late for his meeting with dragosani passing through the outer complex of the chateau and into the main building then up two flights of timehollowed stone stairs into the tower where he had his office he grinned wolfishly at the thought of dragosani waiting for him the necromancer was himself a stickler for punctuality by now he would be furious that was all to the good his mind and tongue would be sharper than ever setting the stage perfectly for his deflation it did men good to be brought down now and then an art in which borowitz was past master taking off his hat and jacket as he went finally borowitz arrived at the secondfloor landing and tiny anteroom which also served as an office for his secretary where he found dragosani pacing the floor and scowling darkly the necromancer made no effort to alter his expression as his boss passed through with a breezy good morning on the way to his own more spacious office there he deftly kicked the door shut behind him hung up his hat and jacket and stood scratching his chin for a moment or two as he pondered the best way to deliver the bad news for in fact it was very bad news and borowitzs temper was far shorter this morning than appearances might suggest but as everyone who knew him was well aware when the boss of ebranch appeared in a good mood that was usually when he was most deadly borowitzs office was a spacious affair of great bay windows looking out and down from the towers curving stone wall over rough grounds towards the distant woodland the windows of course were of bulletproof glass the stone floor was covered in a fairly luxurious pile carpet burned here and there from borowitzs careless smoking habits and his desk a huge block of a thing in solid oak stood in a corner where it had both the protection of thick walls and the benefit of maximum light from the bays there he now seated himself sighing a little and lighting a cigarette before pressing a button on his intercom and saying come in boris will you but do please see if you can leave your scowl out there thats a good fellow dragosani entered closing the door a little more forcefully than necessary and crossed catlike to borowitzs desk he had left his scowl out there and in its place presented a face of cold barely disguised insolence well he said im here indeed you are boris borowitz agreed unsmiling now and i believe i said good morning to you it was when i got here said dragosani tightlipped may i sit down no borowitz growled you may not nor may you pace for pacing irritates me you may simply stand there where you are and listen to me never in his life had dragosani been spoken to like that it took the wind right out of his sails he looked as if someone had slapped him gregor i he began again what borowitz roared gregor is it this is business agent dragosani not a social call save your familiarity for your friends if youve any left with that snotty manner of yours and not for your superiors youre a long way off taking over the branch yet and unless you get certain fundamentals sorted out in your hot little head you may never take it over at all dragosani always pale now turned paler still ii dont know whats got into you he said have i done something you done something now it was borowitzs turn to scowl according to your work sheets very little not for the last six months anyway but thats something were going to remedy anyway maybe youd better sit down ive quite a lot of talking to do and its all serious stuff pull up a chair dragosani bit his lip did as he was told borowitz stared at him toyed with a pencil finally said it appears were not unique dragosani waited said nothing not at all unique of course weve known for some time that the americans were fooling about with extra sensory perception as an espionage concept but thats all it is fooling about they find it cute everything is cute to the americans theres little of direction or purpose to anything theyre doing in this field with them its all experimentation and no action they dont take it seriously they have no real field agents theyre playing with it in much the same way they played with radar before they came into world war two and look what that got them in short they dont yet trust esp which gives us a big lead on them huh that makes a nice change this is not new to me said dragosani puzzled i know were ahead of the americans so what borowitz ignored him the same goes for the chinese he said theyve got some clever minds over there in peking but they arent using them right can you imagine the race that invented acupuncture doubting the efficacy of esp theyre stuck with the same sort of mental block we had forty years ago if it isnt a tractor it wont work dragosani kept silent he knew he must let borowitz get to the point in his own good time then theres the french and the west germans oddly enough theyre coming along quite well we actually have some of their espers here in moscow field agents working out of the embassies they attend parties and functions purely to see if theyre able to glean anything and occasionally we let them have titbits stuff their orthodox intelligence agencies would pick up anyway just to keep them in business but when it comes to the big stuff then we feed them rubbish which dents their credibility and so helps us keep right ahead of them borowitz was bored now with toying with his pencil he put it down lifted his head and stared into dragosanis eyes his own eyes had taken on a bleak gleam of course he finally continued we do have one gigantic advantage we have me gregor borowitz that is to say ebranch answers to me and me alone there are no politicians looking over my shoulder no robot policemen spying on my spying no tenapenny officials watching my expense account unlike the americans i know that esp is the future of intelligence gathering i know that it is not cute and unlike the espionage bosses of the rest of the world i have developed our branch until it is an amazingly accurate and truly effective weapon in its own right in this in our achievements in this field i had started to believe we were so far ahead that no one else could catch us i believed we were unique and we would be dragosani we would be if it were not for the british forget your americans and chinese your germans and your french with them the science is still in its infancy experimental but the british are a different kettle of fish entirely with the exception of the last everything dragosani had heard so far was old hat obviously borowitz had received disturbing information from somewhere or other information concerning the british since the necromancer rarely got to see or hear about the rest of borowitzs machine he was interested he leaned for ward said what about the british why are you suddenly so concerned i thought they were miles behind us like all the rest so did i borowitz grimly nodded but theyre not i which means i know far less about them than i thought i knew which in turn means they may be even farther ahead and if they really are good at it then how much do they know about us even a small amount of knowledge about us would put them ahead if there was a world war three dragosani and if you were a member of british intelligence knowing about the chateau bronnitsy where would you advise your airforce to drop its first bombs eh where would you direct your first missile dragosani found this too dramatic he felt driven to answer they could hardly know that much about us i work for you and i dont know that much and im the one who always assumed hed be the next head of the branch borowitz seemed to have regained something of his humour he grinned however wrily and stood up come he said we can talk as we go but lets you and me go see what we have here in this old place lets have a closer look at this infant brain of ours this nucleus for it is still a child be sure of it a child now yes but the future brain behind mother russias brawn and shirtsleeves flapping the stubby boss of ebranch forged out of his office dragosani at his heels and almost trotting to keep pace they went down into the old part of the chateau which borowitz called the workshops this was a total security area where each operative as he worked was watched over and assisted by a man of equal status within the branch it might seem to be what the western world would call the buddy system but here in the chateau it was designed to ensure that no single operative could ever be sole recipient of any piece of information and it borowitzs way of ensuring that he personally got to know everything of any importance gone now the padlocks and security guards and kgb men there were none of andropovs lot here now where borowitzs own agents themselves took care of internal security on a rota system and the doors to the espcells were controlled electrically by coded keys contained in plastic cards and only one master card which of course was held by borowitz himself in a corridor lit by blue fluorescent light he now inserted that key in its slot and dragosani followed him into a room of computer screens and wall charts and shelf upon shelf of maps and atlases oceanographical charts finedetail street plans of the worlds major cities and ports and a display screen upon which there came and went a stream of continually updated meteorological information from sources worldwide this might be the anteroom of some observatory or the aircontrollers office in a small airport but it was neither of these things dragosani had been here before and knew exactly what the room held but it fascinated him anyway the two agents in the room had stirred themselves and stood up as borowitz entered now he waved them back to work and stood watching as they took their places at a central desk spread out before them was a complex chart of the mediterranean upon which were positioned four small coloured discs two green and two blue the green ones were fairly close together in the tyrhennian sea midway between naples and palermo one of the blue ones was in deep water three hundred miles east of malta the other was in the ionian sea off the gulf of taranto even as borowitz and dragosani watched the two espers settled down again to their work sitting at the desk with their chins in their hands simply staring at the discs on the chart do you understand the colour code borowitz hoarsely whispered dragosani shook his head green is french blue is american do you know what theyre doing charting the location and the movement of submarines said dragosani lowvoiced atomic submarines borowitz corrected him part of the wests socalled nuclear deterrent do you know how they do it dragosani again shook his head hazarded a guess telepathy i suppose borowitz raised a bushy eyebrow oh just like that mere telepathy you understand telepathy then do you dragosani its a new talent of yours is it yes you old bastard dragosani wanted to say yes and if i wanted to right now i could contact a telepath you just wouldnt believe and i dont need to chart his course because i know he isnt going anywhere but out loud he said i understand it about as much as theyd understand necromancy no i couldnt sit there like them and stare at a chart and tell you where killer subs are hiding or where theyre going but can they slice open a dead enemy agent and suck his secrets right out of his raw guts each to his own skills comrade general as he spoke one of the agents at the desk gave a start came to his feet and went to a wall screen depicting an aerial view of the mediterranean as seen from a soviet satellite italy was covered in cloud and the aegean was uncharacteristically misty but the rest of the picture was brilliantly clear if flickering a little the agent tapped keys on a keyboard at the base of the screen and a green spot of light simulating the location of the submarine to the east of malta began to blink on and off he tapped more keys and as he worked borowitz said as borowitzs way of ensuring that he personally got to know everything of any importance gone now the padlocks and security guards and kgb men there were none of andropovs lot here now where borowitzs own agents themselves took care of internal security on a rota system and the doors to the espcells were controlled electrically

aegean was uncharacteristically misty but the rest of the picture was brilliantly clear if flickering a little the agent tapped keys on a keyboard at the base of the screen and a green spot of light simulating the location of the submarine to the east of malta began to blink on and off he tapped more keys and as he worked borowitz said that froggie sub has just changed course hes putting the new course coordinates into the computer he isnt much on accuracy however but in any case well be getting confirmation from our satellites in an hour or so the point is we had the information first these men are two of our best but only one of them picked up the course alteration dragosani commented why didnt the other see said borowitz you dont know it all do you dragosani the one who picked it up isnt a telepath at all hes simply a sensitive but what hes sensitive to is nuclear activity he knows the location of every atomic power station every nuclear waste dumping ground every atomic bomb missile and ammo dump and every atomic submarine in the world with one big exception ill get on to that in a minute but locked in that mans mind is a nuclear map of the world which he reads as clearly as a moscow street map and if something moves on that map of his its a sub or its the americans shuffling their rockets around and if something begins to move very quickly on that map towards us for instance borowitz paused for effect and after a moment continued its the other one whos the telepath now hell concentrate on that single sub see if he can sneak into its navigators mind try to correct any error in the course his partner has just set up on the screen they get better every day practice makes perfect if dragosani was impressed his expression didnt register it borowitz snorted moved towards the door said come on lets see some more dragosani followed him out into the corridor what is it thats happened comrade general he asked why are you filling me in on all these fine details now borowitz turned to him if you more fully understand what we have here dragosani then youll be better equipped to appreciate the sort of outfit they might have in england emphasis on might at least the emphasis used to be on might he suddenly grabbed dragosanis arms and pinioned them to his sides saying dragosani in the last eighteen months we havent had a single british polaris sub on those screens in there we just dont know where they go or what they do oh the shieldings good on their engines no doubt about it and that would explain why our satellites cant track them but what about our sensitive in there what about our telepaths dragosani shrugged but not in a way that might cause offence he was genuinely mystified no less than his boss you tell me he said borowitz released him what if the british have got espers in their ebranch who can blank out our boys as easy as a scrambler on a telephone for if thats the case dragosani then they really are ahead do you think its likely now i do yes it would explain a lot of things as to what it is thats brought all this to a head ive had a letter from an old friend of mine in england i use the term loosely when we go back upstairs ill tell you all about it but first let me introduce you to a new member of our little team i think youll find him very interesting dragosani sighed inwardly his boss would eventually arrive at the matter in hand the necromancer knew that it was just that he was so devious in everything he did including coming to a point sobetter to relax and suffer in silence and let things happen in borowitzs own good time now he let the older man usher him in through another door and into a cell considerably larger than the last little more than a week ago this had been a storeroom dragosani knew but now there had been a number of changes the place was much more airy for one thing windows had been let into the far wall and looked out just above basement level onto the grounds of the chateau also a good ventilation system had been installed to one side in a sort of anteroom just off the main cell a minioperating theatre had been set up such as was used by veterinary surgeons and indeed about the walls of both rooms small cages stood on steel shelves and displayed a variety of captive animals there were white mice and rats various birds even a pair of ferrets talking to these creatures as he moved from cage to cage a whitesmocked figure not more than five feet three or four chuckled and joked and called them pet names tickling them where he could with his stubby fingers through the bars as dragosani and borowitz approached he turned to face them the man was slanteyed his skin a light yellowyolive colour heavyjowled still he managed to look jolly when he smiled his entire face seemed wreathed in wrinkles out of which incredibly deep green eyes sparkled with a life of their own he bowed from the waist first to borowitz and then to dragosani when he did so the ring of fluffy brown hair round the bald dome of his head looked for all the world like a halo which had slipped a little there was something monkish about him thought dragosani he would exactly suit a brown cassock and slippers dragosani said borowitz meet max batu who claims he can trace his blood right back to the great khans dragosani nodded and reached out a hand a mongol he said i suppose they can all trace their blood back to the khans but i really can comrade dragosani said batu his voice soft as silk he took dragosanis hand gave it a firm shake the khans had many bastards so as not to be usurped they gave these illegitimates wealth but no position no power no rank without rank they could not aspire to the throne also they were not allowed to take wives or husbands if they in their turn did manage to produce offspring the same strictures were placed upon them the old ways have come down the years when i was born they still obey the old laws my grandfather was a bastard and my father and so am i where i have a child it too will be a bastard yes and there is more than this in my blood among the khans bastards were great shamans they knew things those old wizards they could do things he shrugged i do not know a lot for all that i am told i am more intelligent than others of my race but there are certain things i can do er max has a very high iq said borowitz smiling wolfishly he was educated in omsk opted out of civilisation and went back to mongolia to herd goats but then he had an argument with a jealous neighbour and killed him he accused me of putting a spell on his goats batu explained so that they died i could have done it certainly but i did not i told him so but he called me a liar that is a very bad thing in those parts so i killed him oh dragosani tried hard not to smile he couldnt imagine this inoffensive little fellow killing anyone yes said borowitz i read about it and was interested in the er nature of the murder that is in the method max employed his method dragosani was enjoying this he threatened his neighbour who at once laughed himself to death is that it no comrade dragosani batu answered for himself his smile fixed now square teeth gleaming yellow as ivory that was not how it happened but your suggestion is very very amusing max has the evil eye boris said borowitz dropping the surname at last which in itself would normally warn dragosani that something unpleasant was coming warning bells did ring but not quite loudly enough the evil eye dragosani tried to look serious he even managed to frown at the little mongol precisely borowitz nodded those green eyes of his did you ever see such a green boris they are purest poison believe me i intervened in the trial of course max was not sentenced but came to us instead in his way hes as unique as you are max he spoke directly to the mongol could you give comrade dragosani something by way of a demonstration certainly said batu he fixed dragosani with his eyes and borowitz was right they were absolutely exquisite in their depth in the completely solid nature of their substance it was as if they were made of jade with nothing of flesh about them and now the warning bells rang a little louder comrade dragosani said batu observe please the white rats he pointed a stubby finger at a cage containing a pair of the animals they are happy creatures and so they should be she on the left is happy because she is well fed and has a mate he is happy for the same reasons also because he has just had her see how he lies there a little spent dragosani looked glanced at borowitz raised an eyebrow watch borowitz growled his own eyes fixed firmly on what was happening first we attract his attention said batu and immediately he fell into a grotesque crouch resembling nothing so much as a great squat frog where he confronted the cage halfway across the room the male rat at once sprang upright its pink eyes wide in terror it made a leap at the bars of its cage clung there staring at batu and then said the mongol then we kill batu had squatted even lower almost in the stance of a japanese wrestler before the charge dragosani standing sideon to him saw his expression change his right eye seemed to bulge outward until it almost left its orbit his lips drew back from his teeth in an utterly animal snarl of sheer bestiality his nostrils gaped into yawning black pits in his face and great cords of sinew stood out on his neck and up under his jaw and the rat screamed it screamed an almost human scream of terror and agony and vibrated against the bars as if electrocuted then it released its hold shuddered flopped over on to its back on the floor of the cage there it lay perfectly still blood seeping from the corners of its glazed bulging pink eyes the rat was quite dead dragosani knew it for a certainty without closer examination the female scurried forward and sniffed the corpse of her mate then peered out through the bars uncertainly at the three human beings dragosani did not know how or why the male rat had died the words which now sprang to his lips were more a question than a statement of fact or any sort of accusation itit has to be a trick borowitz had expected that it was typical of dragosani leap before looking to rush in where angels might well fear to tiptoe the boss of ebranch stepped well back as batu still crouching swivelled to face the necromancer the mongol was smiling again holding his head questioningly on one side a trick he said i meant only dragosani hastily began that is almost the same as calling me a liar said batu and his face at once underwent its monstrous transformation now dragosani got the full frontal view of what borowitz had termed the evil eye and without the slightest shadow of a doubt it was evil it was as if dragosanis blood congealed in his veins he felt his muscles stiffening as if rigor mortis were already setting in his heart gave a massive lurch in his chest and its pain caused him to cry out and sent him staggering but the necromancers reflexes were lightning itself even as he reeled back against the wall his hand slid inside his jacket came out grasping his pistol he now knew or at least thought that this man could kill him and survival was uppermost in dragosanis mind quite simply he must kill the mongol first borowitz stepped between them thats enough he snapped dragosani put it away that bastard almost finished me the necromancer gasped his body trembling with reaction he tried to move borowitz out of his line of fire but the older man was like stone i said thats enough he repeated what would you shoot your partner my what dragosani couldnt believe his ears my partner i dont need a partner what sort of partner is this some sort of joke borowitz reached out a hand and carefully took dragosanis gun there he said thats better and now we can go back to my office on their way out as he herded a shaken dragosani before him he turned to the mongol and said thank you max my pleasure said the other his face once more wreathed in a smile he bowed from the waist as borowitz closed the door on him out in the corridor dragosani was furious he snatched back his gun and put it away you and your damned weird sense of humour he snarled man i nearly died in there no you didnt borowitz seemed unperturbed not even nearly if you had a weak heart it would have killed you just as it killed his neighbour or if you were old and infirm but youre young and very strong no no i knew he couldnt kill you he himself told me that he couldnt kill a strong man it takes a lot out of him to do what he does so much indeed that he would be the one to die not you if he really tried it on so you see i had faith in your strength you had faith in my strength you crazy old sadist and what if youd been wrong but i wasnt wrong said borowitz starting back the way they had come dragosani wouldnt be placated he still felt shaken weak at the knees staggering after borowitz he said what happened back there was a deliberate setup and you bloody well know it his boss whirled and pointed directly at dragosanis chest his grin was savage as a snarl but now you believe yes now you have seen and you have felt now you know what he can do you no longer think its a trick its a new talent dragosani and one we havent seen before and whos to say what other talents there are throughout the world eh but why did you let me no make me go up against something like that it makes no sense borowitz turned and hurried on it makes lots of sense its practice dragosani and like im always telling you practice makes perfect i know but practice for what i only wish i knew borowitz tossed over his shoulder who can say what youll come up against in england what dragosanis jaw dropped he chased after the older man england what about england and you still havent told me what you meant when you said batu was my partner gregor i dont understand any of this they had reached borowitzs offices borowitz swept through the anteroom and turned on his heel just across the threshold of his private room dragosani came to a halt facing him stared at him accusingly what is it youve got up your sleeve comrade so youre still accusing people of trickery eh boris said the other will you never learn your lesson the first time around i dont need to resort to trickery my friend i give orders and you obey this is my next order youre going back to school for a few months to brush up on your english not only the language but the entire english system that way youll fit better into the embassy over there max will go with you and ill bet he learns faster too after that when weve made certain arrangements a little field trip to england exactly you and your partner theres a man over there called keenan gormley exmi sir keenan gormley no less now hes the boss of their ebranch i want him dead thats maxs job for gormley has a bad heart after that dragosani saw it all now you want him interrogated he said you want him emptied of secrets you want to know all about him and his ebranch down to the last detail right first time borowitz gave a sharp nod of his head and thats your job boris youre the necromancer inquisitor of the dead its what you get paid for and before dragosani could answer completely expressionless for once borowitz closed the door in his face a saturday evening in the early summer of sir keenan gormley was relaxing with a book in his study at home in south kensington an afterdinner drink on the occasional table before him when the telephone rang in the house proper he heard it and a few moments later his wifes voice calling darling its for you coming he called and sighing put down his book and went through as he took the telephone from her his wife gave him a smile and returned to her own reading gormley carried the telephone to a wicker chair and sat down before glass doors which stood open on a large secluded garden gormley here he said into the mouthpiece sir keenan this is harmon jack harmon in hartlepool hows the world been treating you ail these years harmon jack how the devil are you my god how longs it been it must be twelve years at least thirteen came the answer tinny with the effects of static last time we spoke was at that dinner they threw for you when you left shhh you know who and that was back in sixtythree thirteen years gormley breathed amazed where does time go to eh where indeed retirement hasnt killed you off then gormley chuckled dryly ah well i only halfretired as i believe you know i still do this and that in the city and you are you still stout as ever i seem to remember youd got yourself the heads job at hartlepool tech thats right and im still there headmaster christ it was easier in burma gormley laughed out loud its very good to hear from you again jack especially since you seem in such good health now then what can i do for you there was something of a pause before harmon finally answered actually i feel a bit of a fool ive been on the point of calling you several times in the last week or so but always changed my mind its such a damned strange business gormley was at once interested hed been dealing with strange businesses for many years now his own finetuned talent told him that something new was about to break and maybe it was something big his scalp tingled as he answered go on jack what is it and dont worry that i may think it daft i remember you for a very levelheaded chap yes but this is very you know difficult to put into words i mean im close to this thing ive seen it with my own eyes and yet jack gormley was patient do you remember the night of that dinner how you and i got talking afterwards id had quite a bit to drink that night too much maybe and i seem to remember mentioning things i shouldnt have it was just that you seemed so wellplaced i mean as a headmaster and all but thats exactly why im calling you now harmon answered because of that chat of ours how on earth could you possibly know that gormley chuckled call it intuition he said but do go on well you said that id be seeing a lot of youngsters pass through my hands and i should keep my eyes open for any that i thought were ratherspecial gormley licked his lips said hang on a moment jack theres a good chap he called out to his wife jackie be a love and fetch me my drink would you and to the telephone sorry jack but im suddenly quite dry and now youve found a kid whos a bit different have you a bit harry keoghs a lot different you can take my word for it frankly i dont know what to make of him well then tell me and lets see what i can make of him harry keogh harmon began isone hell of a weird fellow he was first brought to my attention by a teacher at the boys school in harden a little farther up the coast at that time he was described to me as an instinctive mathematician in fact he was a near genius anyway he sat a form of examination and passed it hell he flew through it and so came to the tech but his english was terrible i used to get on to him about it anyway when i spoke to this fellow up at harden the young teacher i mean a fellow called george hannant i somehow got the impression that he didnt like keogh or maybe thats a bit strong maybe keogh simply made him uneasy well ive recently had cause to speak to hannant again and thats how the whole thing came to light by that i mean that hannants observations of five years ago match mine exactly he too at that time believed that harry keoghthat he that he what gormley urged whats this lads talent jack talent my god thats not how i would describe it well let me tell it my way its not that im shy of my conclusions you understand just that i believe the evidence should be heard first ive said that keoghs english was bad and i used to urge him to do better well he improved rapidly before he left the school two years ago hed sold his first short story since then there have been two books full of them theyve sold right across the englishspeaking world its a bit offputting to say the least i mean ive been trying to sell my stories for thirty years and heres keogh not yet nineteen and and is that your concern gormley cut him off that hes become a successful author so young eh heavens no im delighted for him or at least i was i still would be if onlyif only he didnt write the damn things that wayhe paused what way hehe has well collaborators something about the way hannant said the last word made gormleys scalp tingle again collaborators but surely a lot of writers have collaborators at eighteen years of age i imagine he probably needs someone to tidy his stuff up for him and so on no no said the other with an edge to his voice that hinted of frustration of wanting to say something outright but not knowing how to no thats not what i meant at all actually his short stories dont need tidying up theyre all jewels i myself typed the earliest of them for him from the rough work because he didnt have a machine i even typed up a few after hed bought a typewriter until he got the idea of how a good manuscript should look since then hes done it all himself until recently his new work which hes just completed is a novel hes called it of all things diary of a seventeenthcentury rake gormley couldnt suppress a chuckle so hes sexually precocious too is he actually i think he is anyway ive worked with him quite a bit on the novel too that is ive arranged it into chapters for him and generally tidied it up nothing wrong with keoghs history or his use of the seventeenthcentury language in fact its amazingly accurate but his spelling is still atrocious and on this book at least he was repetitive and disjointed but one thing i can promise you it will earn him an awful lot of money now gormley frowned how can his short stories be jewels while his novel is repetitive and disjointed does that follow logically nothing follows logically in keoghs case the reason the novel differs from the shorter works is simple his collaborator on the shorts was a literary type who knew what he was doing whereas his collaborator for the novel was quite simplya seventeenthcentury rake eh gormley was startled i dont follow no i dont suppose you do i wish to god i didnt listen there was a very successful writer of short stories who lived and died in hartlepool thirty years ago his real name doesnt matter but he had three or four pseudonyms keogh uses pseudonyms very close to the originals the originals i still dont as for the seventeenthcentury rake he was the son of an earl very notorious in these parts between and finally an outraged husband shot him dead he wasnt a writer but he did have a vivid imagination these two menthey are keoghs collaborators gormleys scalp was crawling now go on he said ive talked to keoghs girlfriend harmon continued shes a nice kid and dotes on him and she wont hear a word against him but in conversation she let it slip that he has this idea about something called a necroscope its something he presented to her as fiction a figment of his own imagination a necroscope he told her is someone who can look in on the thoughts of the dead gormley cut in yes the other sighed his relief exactly a spirit medium what why yes i suppose you could say that but a real one keenan a man who genuinely talks to the dead i mean its monstrous ive actually seen him sitting there writing in the local graveyard have you told anyone else gormleys voice was sharp now does keogh know what you suspect no then dont breathe another word about this to a soul do you understand yes but no buts jack this discovery of yours might be very important indeed and im delighted you got in touch with me but it must go no farther there are people who could use it in entirely the wrong way you believe me then about this terrible thing the others relief was plain i mean is it even possible possible impossible the longer i live the more i wonder just what might or mightnt be anyway i can understand your concern and its right that you should be concerned but as for this being a terrible thing im afraid i have to reserve my judgement on that if you are correct then this harry keogh of yours has a terrific talent just think how he might use it i shudder to think what and you a headmaster shame on you jack im sorry im not quite sure i but wouldnt you yourself like the chance to talk to the greatest teachers theorists and scientists of all time to einstein newton da vinci aristotle my god the voice at the other end of the line almost choked but surely that would be i mean quite literally utterly impossible yes well you just keep believing that jack and forget all about this conversation of ours right but you right jack very well what do you intend to jack i work for a very queer outfit a very funny crowd and even telling you that much is to tell you too much however you have my word that ill look into this thing and i want your word that this is your last word on it to anyone very well if you say so thanks for calling youre welcome i goodbye jack we must talk again some time yes goodbye thoughtfully gormley put the phone down chapter eleven dragosani had been back to school for over three months brushing up on his english now it was the end of july and he had returned to romania or wallachia as he now constantly thought of his homeland his reason for being here was simple despite any threats he made when last he visited still he was aware that a year had passed and that the old thing in the ground had warned him that a year was all the time allowed what he had meant exactly was beyond dragosani to fathom but of one thing he was certain he must not let thibor ferenczy expire through any oversight on his part if such an expiry was imminent then the vampire might now be more willing to share a few more secrets with dragosani in exchange for an extension on his undead life because it had been getting late in the day when he drove through bucharest dragosani had stopped at a village market to purchase a pair of live chickens in a wicker basket these had gone under a light blanket on the floor in the back of his volga he had found lodgings in a farm standing on the banks of the oltul and having tossed his things into his room had come out immediately into the twilight and driven to the wooded cruciform ridge now at last light he stood once more on the perimeter of the circle of unhallowed ground beneath the gloomy pines and surveyed again the tumbled tomb cut into the hillside and the dark earth where grotesquely twisted roots stood up like a writhing of petrified serpents past bucharest he had tried to contact thibor to no avail for all that hed concentrated on raising the old devils mind from the slumber of centuries there had been no answer perhaps after all he was too late how long might a vampire lie undead in the earth without attention for all dragosanis many conversations with the creature and for all that he had learned from ladislau giresci still he knew so little about the wamphyri that was restricted knowledge thibor had told him and must await the coming of dragosani into the fraternity oh the necromancer would see about that thibor are you there he now whispered in the gloom his eyes attuned to the shadows and penetrating the dusty miasma of the place thibor ive come back and i bring gifts at his feet the chickens huddled in their basket their feet trussed but no unseen presence moved in the darkness now no cobweb fingers brushed his hair no eager invisible muzzles sniffed at his essence the place was dry desiccated dead dangling twigs snapped loudly at a touch and dust swirled where dragosani placed his feet on the accumulated vegetable debris of centuries thibor he tried again you told me a year the year is past and ive returned am i too late ive brought you blood old dragon to warm your old veins and give you strength again nothing dragosani grew alarmed this was wrong the old thing in the ground was always here he was genius loci without him the place was nothing the cruciform hills were empty and what of dragosanis dreams was that knowledge he had hoped to glean from the vampire gone forever for a moment he knew despair anger frustration but then the trussed chickens in their basket stirred a little and one of them made a low worried clucking sound a breeze whirred eerily in the higher branches over dragosanis head the sun dipped down behind distant hills and something watched the necromancer from behind the gloom and the dust and the old brittle branches nothing was there but he felt eyes upon him nothing was different but it seemed now that the place breathed it breathed yes but a tainted breath which dragosani liked not at all he felt threatened felt more in danger here than ever before he picked up the basket and took two paces back from the unhallowed circle until he brought up against the rough bark of a great tree almost as old as the glade he felt safer there more solidly based with that tough old tree behind him the sudden dryness went out of his throat and he swallowed hard before enquiring again thibor i know youre there its your loss old devil if you choose to ignore me again the wind soughed in the high branches and with it a whisper crept into the necromancers mind dragosaaaniiii is it you ahhhh its me yes he eagerly answered ive come to bring you life old devil or rather to renew your undeath too late dragosani too late my time is come and i must answer the call of the dark earth even i thibor ferenczy of the wamphyri my privations have been many and my spark has been allowed to burn too low now it merely flickers what can you do for me now my son nothing i fear it is finished no i cant believe that ive brought life for you fresh blood tomorrow therell be more in a few days youll be strong again why didnt you tell me things were at such a pass i was sure you cried wolf how could you expect me to believe when all youve ever done is lie to me perhaps in that i was mistaken after all the thing in the ground answered in a little while but when even my own father and brother hated mewhy should i trust a son and a son by proxy at that there is no real flesh between us dragosani oh we made promises you and i but too much to believe that anything could come of them still you have prospered a little through your knowledge of necromancy and at least i tasted blood again however vile so let it be peace between us am too weak now to care dragosani took a step forward no he said again there are still things you can teach me show me wamphyri secrets he moved back against the tree the voice in his mind sighed it was the sigh of one who wearies of all earthly things of one impatient for oblivion and dragosani forgot that it was the lying sigh of a vampire ah dragosani dragosani youve learned nothing did i not tell you that the lore of the wamphyri is forbidden to mortals did i not say that to become is to know and that there is no other way begone my son and leave me to my fate what and should i give you the power to rule a world while i lie here and turn to dust what is that for justice where is the fairness in that dragosani was desperate then accept the blood ive brought you the sweet meat grow strong again i will accept your terms if i must become one of the wamphyri to learn all of their secrets then so be it he lied but without you i cannot the thing in the ground was silent for long moments while dragosani breathlessly waited he fancied that the earth trembled again however minutely beneath his feet but that could only be his imagination the knowledge that something ancient and evil rotten and undead lay buried here behind his back the tree stood seemingly solid as a rock so that dragosani hardly suspected it was eaten away at its heart but indeed it was hollow and now something gradually eased its way up through the earth and into the dry wormeaten wood perhaps in another moment dragosani might have sensed movement but in that precise instant of time thibor spoke to him again and his attention was distracted did you say you hada gift for me there was interest in the vampires mental voice now and dragosani saw a ray of hope yes yes here at my feet fresh meat blood he snatched up one of the birds and squeezed its throat so that its squawking ceased at once and in another moment he had taken a sickle of bright steel from his pocket and sliced the chickens gizzard red blood spurted and the carcass flopped a little where he tossed it while feathers fluttered silently to the black earth the leafmould soaked up the birds blood as a sponge soaks water but behind dragosanis back a pseudopod of putrefaction slid swiftly up inside the hollow tree its leprous white tip finding a knothole where a branch had decayed and poking through into view not eighteen inches above his head the tip throbbed glistening with a strange life of its own filled with an alien foetal urgency dragosani took up the second bird by its neck stepped two paces forward to the very rim of the safe area and theres more thibor right here in my hand only show a little trust a little faith and tell me something of the powers ill command when i become as you ii feel the red blood soaking into the ground my son and it is good but still i think you came too late well i will not blame you we were at odds with one another i was as much to blame as you and so let the past be forgotten aye and would not have it end without showing you at least a small measure of what ive come to feel for you without sharing at least one small secret im waiting dragosani eagerly answered go on in the beginning said the thing in the ground all things were equal the primal vampire was a thing of nature no less than the primal man and just as man lived on the lesser creatures about him so too lived the vampire we both you see were parasites in our way all living things are but whereas man killed the creatures he fed upon there the vampire was kinder he simply took them for his host they did not die indeed they became undead in this fashion a vampire is no less natural a creature than the lamprey or the leech or even the humble flea except his host lives becomes near immortal and is not consumed as in the normal manner of massive parasitic possession but as man evolved into the perfect host so evolved the vampire and as man became dominant so the vampire shared his dominance symbiosis said dragosani i can read the meaning of the word in your mind said thibor and yes that is correct except the vampire soon learned to keep himself secret for along with evolution came a singular change where before the vampire could live apart from his host now he was totally dependent upon him just as the hagfish dies without its host fish so the vampire must have his host simply to exist and if men discovered a vampire in one of their own sort why they would simply kill him worse they learned how to kill the greater being within nor was this the last of the vampires problems nature is a strange one when it comes to correcting errors and quite ruthless she had not intended that any of her creations should be immortal nothing she makes is allowed to live for ever and yet here was a creature which seemed to defy that rigid dictum a creature which barring accidents might just survive indefinitely and furious she took her spite on the wamphyri as the centuries waxed and waned and the earth grew through all the ages towards the present day so my vampire ancestors developed within themselves a weakness it was bred into them it came down the generations down all the years it was a stricture of nature and it was this that since vampires died so very rarely she would allow them only rarely to be born which is why said dragosani youre dying out as a race as individuals we may only reproduce once in a lifespan no matter the great length of that span but youre so potent i cant see that the fault lies with your males is it that your females are infertilei mean that they only have the one opportunity to reproduce our males dragosani said the voice in dragosanis mind with a sardonically inquisitive edge that he didnt like our females and once again the necromancer stepped back against the tree what are you saying males and females oh no dragosani if nature had saddled us with that problem then surely were we long extinct but you are a male i know you are my human host was a male dragosanis eyes were now very wide in the dark something inside urged him to flee but from what he knew that the thing in the ground could not dared not harm him thenyoure a female i thought i had explained adequately i am neither one nor the other dragosani wasnt sure of the term hermaphrodite no then asexual agamic a pearly droplet was forming on the pallid pulsating tip of the leprous tentacle where it protruded from the hole in the tree above dragosanis head as it grew it became pearshaped hung downward began to quiver above it a crimson eye formed gazed lidlessly full of rapt intent but what of your lust on the night we took the girl your lust dragosani and all the women you had in your life my energy but my hosts lust but ahhhh the voice in dragosanis mind suddenly gave a great groan my son my son it is nearly finished it is almost over alarmed the necromancer advanced yet again to the edge of the circle the voice was so weak so despairing so filled with pain what is it whats wrong here more food he slit the second birds throat threw its twitching corpse down the red blood was sucked up by the earth the thing in the ground drank deep dragosani waited and ahhhh but now the necromancers scalp fairly tingled for suddenly he sensed great strength in the vampire and even greater cunning quickly he stepped back and in that same instant of time the pearly droplet overhead turned scarlet and fell it landed on the back of dragosanis neck just below the high collarline he felt it it could have been a drop of moisture fallen from the tree except it was totally dry here or it could be a bird dropping if he had ever seen a bird in this place in any case his hand automatically went to his neck to wipe it away and found nothing the vampire egg needed no ovipositor like quicksilver it had soaked straight through the skin now it explored the spinal column in the next moment dragosani felt the pain and bounded from the tree he found himself within what he had thought to be the danger area bounded again as the pain increased this time he was incapable of directing himself he ran from the circle blindly colliding with the boles of trees where they stood in his path he tripped and fell rolling headlong and always the pain in his skull the pressure on his spine the fire lancing through his veins like acid panic gripped him the worst panic he had ever known in his entire life he felt that he was dying that his seizure whatever its cause must surely kill him it felt as though his internal organs were bursting as though his brain were on fire within him the vampire seed had found a resting place in his chest cavity it ceased exploring settled to sleep its initial fumblings had been the spastic kicking of the newborn but now it was warm and safe and desired only to rest the agony went out of dragosani in an instant and so great was his relief that his system completely lost its balance drowning in the sheer pleasure of painlessness he blacked out harry keogh lay sprawled upon his bed sweat plastering his sandy hair to his forehead his limbs twitching fitfully now and then in response to a dream which was something more than a dream in life his mother had been a psychic medium of some repute and death had not changed her if anything it had improved her talent often over the years shed visited harry in his sleep even as she visited him now harry dreamed that they stood in a summer garden together the garden of the house in bonnyrigg where beyond the fence the river swirled its sluggish way between banks grown green with the hot sun and lush from the richness of the river it was a dream of sharp contrasts and vivid colours she was young again a mere girl and he might well be her young lover rather than her son but in his dream their relationship was distinct and as always she was worried for him harry your plan is dangerous and it cant possibly work she said anyway dont you realise what youre doing if it does work it will be murder harry youll be no better thanthan him she turned her head of golden tresses and gazed fearfully at the house through eyes of blue crystal the house was a dark blot against a sky so blue that it hurt the eyes it stood there like a mass of ink frozen against a green and blue background as if fresh spilled in a childs picturebook and like a black hole of interstellar physics no light shone out of it and nothing at all escaped its gaping aching void it was black because of what it housed as black as the soul of the man who lived there harry shook his head dragging his own eyes from the house only with a great effort of will not murder he said justice something hes escaped for almost fifteen years i was little more than a baby a mere infant when he took you from me hes got away with it until now but now im a man how much of a man will i be if i let it go at that but dont you see harry she insisted taking your revenge wont put it right two wrongs never make a right they sat down on the grass and she hugged him stroking his hair harry had used to love that as a baby he looked again at the inkblot house and shuddered and quickly looked away its not just that i want revenge mother he said i want to know why why did he murder you you were beautiful his young wife a lady of property and talent he should have adored you and yet he killed you he held you under the ice and when you were too weak to fight let you go with the river he killed you as coldly as if you were an unwanted kitten the runt of the litter he tore you from life like a weed from this very garden except he was the weed and you a rose what made him do it why she frowned and shook her golden head i dont know harry ive never known thats what i have to find out i cant find out while hes alive for i know hell never admit it so ill have to find out when hes dead the dead never refuse me anything which meansi have to kill him and ill do it my way its a very terrible way harry it was her turn to shudder i know he nodded his eyes cold yes you do and thats why it must be that way she was fearful again and clutched him to her but what if something goes wrong just knowing youre all right i can lie easy harry but if anything should happen to you nothing will happen it will be just the way i plan it he kissed her worried brow but still she clung to him hes a clever man harry this viktor shukshin clever and evil sometimes i could sense it in him and it fascinated me what was i after all but a girl and him he was magnetic the russian in him which was there in me too the brooding darkness of his mind the magnetism and the evil we were opposing magnetic poles and we attracted i know that i loved him at first even though i sensed his dark heart but as for his reason for killing me yes again she shook her head her blue eyes cloudy with memory it was somethingsomething in him some madness some unspeakable thing he couldnt control that much i know but what exactly and once more she shook her head its what i have to find out harry repeated for until then i wont rest easy either shhh she suddenly gasped clutched him hard look harry looked a smaller inkblot had detached itself from the great black mass of the house manlike it came down the garden path peering here and there worriedly wringing its hands in its black blot of a head twin silver ovals gleamed eyes which led it towards the fence at the bottom of the garden harry and his mother huddled together but for the moment the shukshin apparition paid them no heed he passed by paused briefly and sniffed suspiciously almost like a dog then moved on at the fence he stopped leaned on the top rail for long moments peered at the rivers slow swirl i know whats on his mind harry whispered shhh his mother repeated her warning he can sense things viktor shukshin he always could the inkblot now returned pausing every now and then sniffing in that strange way close to the pair the shukshinthing seemed to stare right through them with its silver eyes then the eyes blinked and it moved on back towards the house wringings its hands as before as it merged with the house a door slammed echoingly the sound repeated in harrys head reverberating metamorphosing from a slam to a knock to a series of knocks repeating rattattat rattattat you have to go said his mother be careful harry poor little harry he jerked awake in his flat from the slant of the sunlight through the window he knew that time turned towards evening hed slept for three hours at least more than hed intended he started as the knock came again at the door rattattat who could this be brenda no for he wasnt expecting her although it was a saturday she was putting in some overtime dolling up the hair of some of hardens more fashionable ladies who then rattattot insistently stiffly harry swung his legs off the bed stood up and went to the door his hair was tousled his eyes full of sleep visitors were rare and he liked it that way this was an intrusion something to be dealt with swiftly and decisively he zipped up his trousers shrugged into a shirt and the knock came yet again outside the door sir keenan gormley waited knowing that harry keogh was in there he had known it coming down the street had felt it climbing the stairs keoghs esp signature was written in the very air of the place as unmistakably as a fingerprint on clear glass for like viktor shukshin and gregor borowitz this was gormleys one great talent he too was a spotter he instinctively knew when he stood in the presence of an esper and keoghs espaura was more powerful than any he had ever sensed before so that he felt he was close to some great generator as he stood there at the door on the landing at the head of the stairs and now harry keogh himself opened that door gormley had seen keogh before but never so close over the last three weeks while he had been staying with jack harmon hed seen him often gormley and harmon following keogh on occasion had kept the youth under close but discreet observation likewise on the two occasions when george hannant had accompanied them and gormley had not taken long to agree with both harmon and hannant that indeed keogh was something special quite obviously they were correct about him he was a necroscope he did have the power of intelligent intercourse with the dead gormley had given keoghs weird talent a lot of thought over the last three weeks it was one which he would dearly love to have under his control now he must somehow find a way to put that idea to keogh blinking the sleep from his eyes harry keogh looked his visitor up and down he had intended to be brusque no matter who it was to deal with the problem and be done with it but one look at gormley had told him this was something which wasnt going to go away there was a quiet air of unassuming but awesome intellect about this man and coupled with his charming smile and demanding outstretched hand it formed a combination which was totally disarming harry keogh said gormley knowing of course that it was keogh and insisting that the other take his hand by shoving it even farther forward im sir keenan gormley you wont have heard of me but i know quite a bit about you in fact why i know just about everything about you the landing was illlit and harry couldnt quite make out the others features just indistinct impressions finally briefly he took gormleys hand then stepped aside and let him in the contact however brief had told him a lot gormleys hand had been firm and yet resilient cool but honest it had promised nothing but neither had it threatened it was the hand of someone who could be a friend except you know everything about me harry wasnt sun he liked the sound of that well that wont come to much theres not a lot to know oh i disagree with you said the other youre far too modest now in the brighter light from the windows keogh looked at his visitor more closely his age could be anything between fifty and sixty but probably at the top end his green eyes were a little muddied and his skin full of small wrinkles his wellgroomed hair was grey on a large highdomed head about fiveten in height his welltailored jacket just failed to hide slightly rounded shoulders sir keenan gormley had seen better days but harry keogh would think he had a way to go yet what do i call you he said it was the first time hed spoken to a sir keenan will do since were to be friends youre sure of that that were to be friends i mean i must warn you i dont make many i dont think we have any choice gormley smiled we have too much in common anyway the way i hear it you have lots of friends then youve heard it wrong harry frowned shook his head i can count my real friends on one hand gormley believed he might as well get straight to the point and anyway he wanted to see keoghs reaction if he was caught off balance it might just provide the final ounce of proof those are the live ones he quietly answered easing the smile gradually off his face but i think the others are rather more numerous it hit harry like a grenade hed often wondered how he would feel if anyone should ever confront him like this and now he knew he felt ill he reeled found a rickety easy chair sank down into it pale as death he shivered gulped gazed at gormley through the eyes of a cornered animal i dont know what youre he finally began to croak his denial only to have gormley cut him off with yes you do harry you know very well what im talking about youre a necroscope and youre probably the only real necroscope in the entire world you have to be crazy harry gasped desperately coming in here and accusing me ofof things a necroscope theres no such thing everyone knows you cantcant trapped he faltered to a halt cant what harry talk to the dead but you can cant you clammy sweat broke out on harrys forehead he gasped for air he was caught and he knew it trapped like a ghoul with a dripping heart in his hands like a rapist in the beam of a policemans torch gasping between his battered victims thighs it hadnt felt like a crime before hed never hurt anyone but now gormley stepped forward took his shoulders shook him where he sat snap out of it man you look like a grubby little boy caught masturbating youre not sick harry this thing you do isnt an illness its a talent its a secret thing he protested weakly his face shining ii dont hurt them i wouldnt do that without me who would they have to talk to theyre so lonely he was almost babbling now convinced that he was in deep trouble and trying to talk his way out the last thing gormley wanted was to alienate him its okay son its okay take it easy no ones accusing you of anything but its a secret thing harry insisted gritting his teeth growing angry now or at least it was but now if people know about it they wont get to know you know its my business to know these things son i keep telling you youre not in trouble not with me he was so persuasive so quiet was he a friend a real friend or was he something else harry couldnt control his panic the shock of knowing that someone else knew his head whirled could he trust this man dared he trust anyone and if gormley meant the end of him as a necroscope what of his revenge on viktor shukshin nothing must interfere with that he reached out desperately with his mind contacted a confidence trickster he knew in the cemetery in easington gormley felt the power that washed out from harry at that moment a raw alien energy like nothing hed felt before which set his scalp tingling and quickened his heart alarmingly this was it this was the necroscopes talent in action gormley knew it as surely as he was born in his chair harry had gradually squeezed himself into a more compact mass hunching down he had been the colour of drifted snow dripping sweat like a faulty tap but now he sat up bared his teeth and grinned a wild grin tossed back his head and sent beads of sweat flying he uncoiled like a spring all of the panic going out of him in a moment his hand hardly trembled at all as he brushed damp hair back from his forehead colour rapidly returned to his face thats it he said still grinning interviews over what gormley was amazed at the transformation certainly thats what this is all about isnt it you came here to find out about harry keogh the author someone mentioned to you the theme of a new story im writing which no ones supposed to know about incidentally and you just hit me with it to get my reaction its a horror story and youve heard i always act out what i write so when i act out the part of the necroscope which is a word of my own coining by the way naturally i do it with authority im a good actor see well youve had your free show and ive had my fun and now the interviews over the grin fell abruptly from his face and left it sour sneering you know where the door is keenan gormley slowly shook his head at first hed been stunned but now his instinct took over and it was his instinct that told him what was happening here thats clever he said but nowhere close to clever enough who are you talking to now harry or rather who is it talking through you for a moment defiance continued to shine in harry keoghs eyes but then gormley once more felt the flow of weird energies as the youth broke the link with his clever dead unknown friend his face visibly changed sarcasm drained away and harry was himself again but at least he retained something of composure his panic had passed what do you want to know he said his voice flat and emotionless everything gormley answered at once i thought you already knew everything you said you did but i want to hear it from you i know you cant explain how you do it and i certainly dont want to know why its enough to say that you found yourself with a talent you could use to improve your own life thats understandable no its the facts i want the extent of your talent for instance and its limitations until a moment ago i didnt know you could use it at a distance that sort of thing i want to know what you talk about what interests them do they see you as an intruder or do they welcome you like i said i want to know everything or else gormley shook his head that doesnt even come into itnot yet harry gave a sour smile so were to be friends are we gormley drew up a chair and sat down facing him harry no one else is going to know about you thats a promise and yes we are going to be friends thats because we need each other and because we in turn are needed okay you probably think you dont need me that im the last thing you need but thats only for now you will need me i assure you harry looked at him through narrowed eyes and just why do you need me i think before i tell you anything before i even admit anything that there are one or two things youd better tell me gormley had expected nothing less he nodded stared straight into the others wary questioning eyes drew a deep breath fair enough i will you know who i am so now ill tell you what i am and what i do for a living more importantly ill tell you about the people i work with he did he told harry about the british ebranch and what little he knew about the american french russian and chinese equivalents he told him about telepaths who could speak to each other across the world without a telephone with their minds alone about precognition the ability to pierce the future and tell of events yet to happen about telekinesis and psychokinesis and men who could move solid objects with their will alone and without resorting to simple physical strength he spoke about farseeing and about a man he knew who could tell you what was happening anywhere in the world at this precise moment of time about psychic healing and a doctor who could conjure the supreme power of life into his naked hands banishing diseases without the benefit of any form of conventional treatment about the entire range of espers under his command and how there was a place there too for harry and he told it all in such a way with such understanding and clarity and sheer conviction that harry knew he spoke the truth so you see gormley finally came to a close youre not a freak harry your talent may well be unique but you as an esper are not your grandmother was one before you and passed it down to your mother she in turn passed a large dose of it down to you god only knows what your children will be capable of harry keogh after a long while and as all he had been told sank in harry said and now you want me to work for you in a nutshell yes what if i refuse harry i found you im a spotter i have no real esp talent myself but i can spot an esper a mile away i suppose that in itself is a talent but thats all i have the one thing i know for sure is that there are others like me one of them is the boss of the russian branch now ive come to you and put my cards on the table ive told you things i didnt even have the right to tell you thats because i want you to trust me and also because i think i can trust you youve nothing to fear from me harry but i cant promise the same for the other side you meanthey might find me too they get cleverer all the time harry gormley shrugged just as we do they have at least one man in england ive not met him but ive sensed him close to me i know he was looking at me watching me hes probably a spotter too what im saying is this i found you so how long before they do the difference is this with them youll not get a choice and with you i have a choice right of course you do its entirely in your hands you join us or you dont join us thats your choice so take your time harry and think about it but not for too long like i said we need you the sooner the better harry thought about viktor shukshin he couldnt know it but shukshin was the man gormley had sensed watching him there are things i have to do first he said before making any final decision of course i can understand that it may take some time maybe five months gormley nodded if it has to be i think it has to be yes for the first time harry smiled his natural shy smile hey im dry would you like a coffee very much gormley smiled back and while we drink it maybe youd like to tell me about yourself eh harry felt a great weight lifted from his shoulders yes he sighed i think maybe i would it was a fortnight later that harry keogh finished his novel and went into training for viktor shukshin an advance on the book gave him the financial stability he would need for the next five or six months until the job was done his first step was to join a group of crazy allweather swimming enthusiasts who made a habit of bathing in the north sea at least twice a week all the year round including christmas and new years day they had something of a reputation for breaking the ice on hardens reservoir to do charity plunges for the british heart foundation brenda a levelheaded girl on any other subject except harry himself thought he was crazy of course its fine in the summer harry he remembered her telling him one late august evening as they had lain naked in each others arms in his flat but what about when it starts to get cold i cant see you breaking the ice to go for a swim what is this swimming craze anyway its just a way of staying fit and healthy he had told her kissing her breasts dont you like me healthy sometimes she had answered turning more fully towards him as he grew hard again in her hand i think youre far too healthy in fact she had been happier than at any time in more than three years harry was much more open now less given to brooding more lively and exciting nor was his sudden interest in sports confined to swimming hed also taken up selfdefence and joined a small hartlepool judo club after only a week his coach there had been calling him a natural and telling him he expected big things of him he hadnt known of course that harry had another coach a man who had once been the judo champion of his regiment who now had nothing better to do than pass on all his expertise to harry but as for harrys swimming hed always considered himself a fair swimmer now it appeared that was all he had been at first the rest of the group were way in front of him at least until he found himself an exolympic silver medallist who had died in an automobile accident in a fact recorded on his headstone in stocktons st marys graveyard harry was enthusiastically received and his new friend joined in the fun and games with great aplomb even with this sort of advantage however there was still the physical side to overcome harry might let the professional swimmers mind guide his technique but it couldnt help with his lack of muscle only practice could do that nevertheless his progress was rapid by september the craze was underwater swimming that is seeing just how long he could stay underwater on one breath and how far he could swim before surfacing the first time he did two complete lengths of the pool submerged was a redletter day for harry everyone in the place had stopped swimming to watch him that was at the swimming baths at seaton carew where afterwards an attendant had sidled up to ask him his secret harry had shrugged and answered its all in the mind willpower i suppose which was fair enough what he did not say was that while it had certainly been his willpower it had not entirely been his mind by the end of october harry had let his judo training fall off a little his progress had been too rapid and his instructors at the club were growing wary of him anyway he was satisfied that he could now look after himself perfectly well even without sergeant graham lanes assistance by that time too he had taken up ice skating the final discipline in his itinerary brenda herself quite capable on the ice was astonished she had often tried to get harry to accompany her to the ice rink in durham but he had always refused that was hardly unnatural she knew something of how his mother had died it was just that she believed he should face up to his fear she couldnt know that the fear wasnt entirely his but his mothers in the end though mary keogh was made to see the sense in harrys preparations and at last came gladly to his aid at first she was frightened the ice the memory the sheer horror of her death lingered still but in a very little while she was enjoying her skating again as much as ever she had in life she enjoyed through harry and in his turn he received the benefit of her instruction so that soon he was able to lead brenda a merry dance across the ice much to her amazement one thing i can definitely say about you harry keogh she had breathlessly told him as he expertly waltzed her round and round the rink while their breath plumed fantastically in the cold air is that theres never a dull moment why youre an athlete and at that moment it had dawned on harry that he really could be if there werent other matters more pressing but then in the first week in november as winter crept in his mother had dropped something of a bombshell harry was feeling better than he had ever felt in his life before capable of taking on the entire world the night she had come to him in his dreams in his waking hours he must always contact her if he wished to speak to her but when he slept it was different then she had instant access normally she respected his privacy but on this occasion there was something she must talk over with him something which could not wait harry shed stolen into his dream walking with him through a misty graveyard of great looming tombstones standing as high as houses harry can we talk do you mind no ma i dont mind hed answered what is it she took his arm held it tightly and knowing now that she had firmly established rapport let her fears and her urgency spill out of her in a veritable torrent of words harry ive been speaking to the others theyve told me theres terrible danger for you danger in shukshin and if you should destroy him terrible danger beyond him oh harry harry im so dreadfully worried for you danger in my stepfather he held her close tried to comfort her of course there is weve always known that but danger beyond him what others have you been talking to ma i dont understand she drew back from him to arms length grew angry with him in a moment yes you do understand she accused or would if you wanted to where do you think you got your talent in the first place harry keogh if not from me i was talking to the dead long before you came along oh not as well as you do it no but well enough all i ever managed were vague impressions echoes memories that lingered over while you actually talk to them learn from them invite them into yourself but things are different now ive had fifteen years to practise my art harry and im much better at it now than when i was alive i had to practise it you see for your sake how else was i going to be able to watch over you he drew her close again and wrapped his arms about her staring deep into her anxious eyes dont fight with me ma theres no need but tell me now what others are you talking about others like myself people who were mediums in life some like me are dead only recently in the scale of time but others have been lying in the earth a very long time indeed in the old days they were called witches and wizards and sometimes they were called worse than that many of them died for it these are the ones ive been speaking to even dreaming harry found the idea chilling dead people talking to other dead people communicating between their graves considering events in a waking living world from which they themselves had departed for ever he shuddered a little and hoped she didnt notice and what have they been telling you these others they know you harry she answered at least they know of you youre the one who befriends the dead through you the dead have a future some of us anyway through you theres a chance some of us can finish the things we never finished in life they look to you as a hero harry and they too worry for you without you theres nothing left for their hopes you see theythey beg you to give up this obsession this vendetta harrys mouth hardened you mean shukshin i cant do that he put you where you are ma harry its notnot so bad here im not lonely any more not now he shook his head and sighed that wont work ma youre only saying that for my sake it only makes me love and miss you more lifes a gift and shukshin stole it from you look i know its not a good thing im doing but neither is it unjust after this it will be different i have plans you did give me a talent yes and when this is finished ill use it well thats a promise but this thing with viktor comes first it has to thats your last word yes she nodded sadly freed herself and stepped away from him i told them that would be your answer all right harry i wont argue it any further ill just go now and let you do what you must but you should know this there will be warnings two of them and they wont be pleasant one comes from the others and youll find it here in this dream the other waits in the waking world two warnings harry and if you fail to heed themit will be on your own head she began to drift away from him between the towering headstones the mist lapping at her ankles her calves he tried to follow her but couldnt invisible dreamstuff stood between his feet seemed welded to the gravel chips forming the graveyards paths warnings what sort of warnings follow that path she pointed and youll find one of them there the other will come from someone youd do well to trust both are indications of your future the futures uncertain ma he called after her mistwreathed ghost no one sees it clearly no one knows for sure then call it your probable future she answered yours and also the futures of two others someone you love and someone who asked for your help harry wasnt sure hed heard right what he yelled at the top of his voice whats that ma but her voice and figure and mind had already merged with the swirling mist of the dream and she was gone harry looked the way she had pointed the headstones marched like giant dominoes towering markers whose tops were lost in billowing clouds of fog they were ominous brooding and so was the path between them which harrys mother had pointed out to him as for her warnings maybe it was better if he didnt know maybe he shouldnt walk that way at all but he didnt have to walk his dream was taking him that way anyway harry drifted unresisting along the gravel path between ranks of mighty tombstones drawn by some dreamforce which he knew could not be denied at the end of the avenue of markers there was an empty space where the mist alone swirled and eddied a cold and lonely place and beyond that three more markers but somehow more ominous than all the others put together harry drifted across the empty space straight towards them and as he approached them where they towered up out of the earth so the dreamforce gently set him down and gave him back his volition he looked at the headstones and the mist which halfobscured them slowly lifted and harry read the warning his mothers others had left for him carved in deep geometrically rigid characters in their surfaces the first stone said brenda cowell born soon to die in childbirth she loved and was loved greatly the second one said sir keenan gormley born soon to die in agony first and foremost a patriot and the third one said harry keogh born the dead shall mourn him harry opened his mouth and shouted his denial no he stumbled back from the looming markers tripped threw wide his arms to break his fall and knocked over a tiny bedside table for a long moment he lay there shocked from sleep his heart hammering against his ribs then gave a second great start as his telephone rang it was keenan gormley harry flopped shivering into a chair with the phone to his ear oh he said you am i that much of a disappointment harry the other asked but with no trace of humour in his voice no but i was sleeping you sort of shocked me awake oh well im sorry for that but time is passing us by and yes said harry on impulse eh gormley sounded surprised did you say yes i mean yes ill join you at least ill come to see you well talk some more about it harry had been considering gormleys proposition for some time just as he had promised he would but in fact it was his dream which of course had been more than just a dream that finally decided him his mother had told him there was someone hed do well to trust someone who had asked for his help who could that be but gormley until now his joining gormleys espers had been fiftyfifty he might and he might not but now if there was any way he could change what mary keogh had called his probable future his and brendas and gormleys then but thats wonderful harry gormleys excitement was obvious when will you come down there are so many people you must meet weve so much to show you and so much to do but not just yet harry tried to put the brakes on i mean ill come down soon when i can when you can now gormley sounded disappointed soon harry said again as soon as ive finishedwhat i have to do very well said the other a little deflated that will have to do but harry dont leave it too long will you no i wont leave it too long he put the phone down the phone was no sooner in its cradle than it rang again even before harry could turn away he picked it up harry it was brenda her voice very small and quiet brenda listen love he said before she could speak i thinki mean i would likewhat im trying to say isoh hell lets get married oh harry she sighed into her end the sound and the feeling of her relief very close and immediate in his ear im so glad you said that before before lets do it soon he cut her short trying hard not to choke on his words as once more he saw in his minds eye the legend on brendas marker as it had appeared to him in his dream but thats why i called you she said thats why im glad you asked me you see harry it was looking like we were going to have to anyway which came as no surprise at all to harry keogh chapter twelve it was middecember following one of the longest hottest summers on record now nature was trying to even up the score already it promised to be a severe winter boris dragosani and max batu were coming to england from a place far colder however and in any case climate had no part in their scheme of things it was not a consideration if anything the cold suited them it matched precisely the emotionless iciness of their hearts the subzero nature of their mission which was murder pure and simple all through the flight not too comfortable in the rather stiff unyielding seats of the aeroflot jet dragosani had sat and thought morbid thoughts some of them angry and some fearful or at best apprehensive but all uniformly morbid the angry thoughts had concerned gregor borowitz for sending him on this mission in the first place and the fearful ones were about thibor ferenczy the thing in the ground now lulled by the jets subdued but allpervading engine noise and by the hiss of its airconditioning he sank down a little farther into his seat and again turned over in his mind the details of his last visit to the cruciform hills he thought of thibors story of the symbiotic or lampreylike nature of the true vampire and he thought of his agony and his panicflight before merciful oblivion had claimed him halfway down the wooded slope that was where he had found himself upon regaining consciousness in the dawn light sprawled under the trees at the edge of the overgrown firebreak and yet again he had cut short a visit to his homeland returning at once to moscow and putting himself directly into the hands of the best doctor he could find it had been a complete waste of time it appeared he was perfectly healthy xray photographs disclosed nothing blood and urine samples were one hundred per cent normal bloodpressure pulse and respiration were exactly what they should be was there any condition that dragosani was aware of there was not had he ever suffered from migraine or asthma no then perhaps it had been the altitude had his sinuses been causing him any concern no had he perhaps been overworking himself hardly that did he himself have any idea as to the source of the trouble no yes but it didnt bear thinking about and couldnt be mentioned under any circumstances the doctor had given him a painkilling prescription against the possibility of a recurrence and that had been that dragosani should have been satisfied but was not far from it he had attempted to contact thibor at long range perhaps the old devil knew the answer even a lie might contain some sort of clue but nothing if thibor could hear him he wasnt answering he had gone over for the hundredth time the events leading up to his terrible pain his flight his collapse something had splashed on his neck from above rain no it had been a fine night bone dry a leaf a piece of bark no for it had felt wet some filthy birds dropping then no for his hand had come away clean something had landed on the top of his spine and moments later both spine and brain had been gripped and squeezed by something unknown butwhat dragosani believed he knew and still hardly dared to give it conscious thought certainly it had invaded his sleep bringing him endless nights filled with bad dreams recurrent nightmares he could never remember in his waking moments but which he knew were terrible when he dreamed them the whole thing had become a sort of obsession with him and there were times when he thought of little else it had to do not only with what had happened but also with what the vampire had been telling him when it happened and it also had to do with certain changes hed noticed in himself since it happened physiological changes inexplicable changes or if there was an explanation still dragosani was not yet ready to face up to it dragosani my boy borowitz had told him not a week ago youre getting old before your time am i working you too hard or something maybe im not working you hard enough yes thats probably it not enough to keep you occupied when did you last bloody your oh so delicate fingers eh a month ago wasnt it that french doubleagent but look at you man your hairs receding your gums too by their look and with that pallid complexion of yours and your sunken cheeks why you could almost be anaemic maybe this jaunt to england will do you good borowitz had been trying to get a rise out of him dragosani knew but for once he had not dared rise to the bait that would only serve to draw more attention to himself which was the last thing he wanted no for in fact borowitz was more nearly correct than he could possibly guess his hair did seem to be receding true but it was not a small birthmark on dragosanis scalp close to the hairline told him that much its position relative to his hair had not changed in ten years at least ergo his hair was not receding the change was in the skull itself which if anything seemed to have lengthened at the rear the same was true of his gums they were not receding as borowitz had suggested but his teeth were growing longer particularly the incisors top and bottom as for anaemia that was purely ridiculous pale he might be but not weak indeed he felt stronger more vital in himself than ever before in his life physically anyway his pallor probably resulted from a fastdeveloping photophobia for now he literally shunned the daylight and would not go out even in dim light without wearing dark glasses physically fit yes but his dreams his nameless fears and obsessions his neuroses quite simply he was neurotic it shocked dragosani to have to admit it even though he only admitted it to himself one thing at least was certain no matter the outcome of this british mission when it was finished dragosani intended to return to romania at his earliest opportunity there were matters questions which must be resolved and the sooner the better thibor ferenczy had had things his own way for far too long beside dragosani in the cramped threeabreast seats but with a dividing arm up to accommodate his girth max batu chuckled comrade dragosani the squat little mongol whispered i am supposed to be the one with the evil eye had you perhaps forgotten our roles whats that said dragosani starting up in his seat as batu commenced speaking he glared at his grinning companion what do you mean i dont know what you were thinking about just then my friend but im certain it bodes no good for someone batu explained the look on your face was very fierce oh said dragosani relaxing a little well my thoughts are my own max and none of your business you are a cold one comrade said batu both of us are cold ones i suppose but even i can feel your chill it seeps right into me as i sit here the grin slowly faded from his face have i perhaps offended you only with your chatter dragosani grunted thats as may be the other shrugged but chatter we must you were supposed to brief me tie up those loose ends which gregor borowitz left dangling it would be a good idea if you did it now we are alone here even the kgb have not yet bugged aeroflot also we have only one hour before we arrive in london in the embassy such a conversation might prove difficult i suppose youre right said dragosani grudgingly very well then let me put the pieces together for you it is perhaps preferable that youre fully in the picture borowitz first conceived of ebranch about twentyfive years ago at that time a large russian group of socalled fringescientists were starting to take a real interest in parapsychology still largely frowned upon in the ussr borowitz was interested had always been interested in esp despite his very much downtoearth military background and otherwise mundane persuasions strangely talented people had always fascinated and attracted him in fact he was himself a spotter but hadnt realised it when finally he did realise that he had this peculiar talent he at once applied for a position as head of our espionage school it was initially a school you see with no real application in the field the kgb werent interested all brawn and bulletproof vests esp was far too esoteric for them anyway since his army service was coming to a close and because he had good connections not to mention his own not inconsiderable talent he got the job a few years later he found another spotter but in very peculiar circumstances it came about like this a female telepath one of the few girls on borowitzs team whose talent was just beginning to blossom was brutally murdered her boyfriend a man called viktor shukshin was charged with the crime his defence was that hed believed the girl was possessed of devils he could sense them in her of course borowitz was very much interested he tested shukshin and discovered that he was a spotter more than that the espaura of psychically endowed persons actually disturbed shukshin unbalanced him and drove him to homicidal acts usually directed at the esper him or herself on the one hand shukshin was drawn to espers and on the other he was driven to destroy them borowitz saved shukshin from the salt mines in much the same way he saved you max and took him under his wing he thought he might exorcise the mans homicidal tendencies but at the same time save his talent for spotting in shukshins case however brainwashing didnt work if anything it only served to aggravate the problem but gregor borowitz hates waste he looked for a way to use shukshins aggression at that time the americans were also greatly interested in esp as a weapon more recently theyve taken it up again though not nearly to the extent that we have in england however a rudimentary espsquad already existed and the british were rather more inclined towards the serious study and exploitation of the paranormal so shukshin was put through a long term of spyschool in moscow and finally released upon the british his cover was that of a defector he was sent over to kill british espers batu whispered that was the idea to find them to report on their activities and when the psychic stress became too great for him to kill them if and when he had to but after hed been in england only a few months then viktor shukshin really did defect to the british no to the country of the british to their political system to safety shukshin didnt give a damn for mother russia anyway and now he had a new country almost a new identity he wasnt going to make the same mistake twice do you see in russia hed come close to life imprisonment for murder should he do the same thing in england he could make a decent living there a fresh start he was a linguist topflight qualifications in russian german english and more than a smattering of halfadozen other languages no he didnt defect to anyone he defected from the ussr he ran escaped to freedom you sound almost as if you approve of the british system the mongolian grinned dont worry about my loyalties max dragosani grated you wont find a man more loyal than i am to romania to wallachia well thats good to know the other nodded it would be nice if i could say the same but im a mongol and my loyalties are different actually im only loyal to max batu then you probably resemble shukshin a great deal i imagine thats how he felt anyway gradually over the months his reporting fell off and finally he dropped out of sight it put borowitz on the spot but there wasnt a thing he could do about it since shukshin was a defector hed been granted political asylum borowitz couldnt very well ask for him back all he could do was keep tabs on him see what he was up to he feared hed join the british espers eh not really no shukshin was psychotic remember anyway borowitz wasnt taking any chances and eventually he tracked him down shukshins plan was simple hed got himself a job in edinburgh bought a tiny fishermans cottage in a place called dunbar made official application for british citizenship he kept himself to himself and settled down to leading a normal life or at least he tried to it didnt work out batu was interested for a while but then he married a girl of old russian stock she was a psychic medium the real thing and naturally her talent was like a magnet to him perhaps he tried to resist her but to no avail he married her and he killed her at least thats how gregor borowitz sees it after that nothing he got away with it the verdict was accidental death drowning borowitz knows more about it than i do anyway its incidental but shukshin inherited his wifes money and house he lives there still and now we are on our way to kill him batu mused can you tell me why dragosani nodded if he had simply continued to keep a low profile and stay out of our hair that would have been okay oh borowitz would catch up with him eventually but not immediately but shukshins fortunes have changed max hes short of cash generally down at heel its been the downfall of many another before him so now after all these years finally hes turned blackmailer he threatens borowitz ebranch the entire setup one man poses so great a threat batu raised his eyebrows again dragosanis nod the british equivalent of our branch is now an effective force how effective were not sure but they may even be better than we are we know very little about them which in itself is a bad sign it could well be that they are clever enough to cover themselves entirely give themselves one hundred per cent esp security and if theyre that clever then how much do they know about us eh thats right dragosani looked at his companion with a little more respect they might even know that we two are aboard this plane right now and our mission god forbid batu smiled his moonish ivory smile i dont believe in any god he said only in the devil so the comrade general fears that if shukshin isnt silenced he might after all talk to the british thats what shukshin has threatened him with yes he wants money or hell tell british ebranch all he knows mind you that wont amount to much after all this time but even a little knowledge about our ebranch is far too much for gregor borowitzs liking max batu was thoughtful for a moment but if shukshin did talk surely he would be giving himself away too wouldnt he be admitting that he came to england in the first place as an espagent of the ussr dragosani shook his head he doesnt have to give himself away a letter is perfectly anonymous max even a telephone call and even though twenty years have gone by still there are things he knows which borowitz wants kept secret two things in particular which might prove valuable beyond measure to the british espers one the location of the chateau bronnitsy two the fact that comrade general gregor borowitz himself is head of russian espionage that is the threat which shukshin poses and that is why hell die and yet his death is not our prime objective dragosani was silent for a moment then said no our prime objective is the death of someone else someone far more important he is sir keenan gormley head of their espers his deathand his knowledge all of it that is our prime objective borowitz wants both of them dead and stripped of their secrets you will kill gormley in your own special way and i shall examine him in mine before that we shall already have killed viktor shukshin who also shall have been examined actually he should not present too much of a problem his place is lonely out of the way well do it there and you can really empty them of secrets after they are dead i mean batu seemed to have doubts yes i really can more surely than any torturer could when they were alive i shall steal their innermost thoughts right out of their blood their marrow their cold and lonely bones a dumpy stewardess appeared at the cabin end of the central aisle fasten your seatbelts she intoned like a robot and the passengers equally robotic complied what are your limitations batu asked strictly out of morbid curiosity of course limitations how do you mean what if a man has been dead for a week for example dragosani shrugged it makes no difference what if he has been dead for a hundred years a driedup mummy you mean borowitz wondered the same thing we experimented it was all the same to me the dead cannot keep their secrets from a necromancer but a corpse rotting batu pressed say someone dead for a month or two that must be quite awful it is said the other but im used to it the mess doesnt bother me so much as the risk the dead teem with disease you know i have to be very careful its not a healthy business ugh said batu and dragosani actually saw him give a small shudder londons lights were gleaming in the dark distance on the curve of nights horizon the city was a hazy glow beyond the small circular windows and you said dragosani does your talent have its limitations max the mongol gave a shrug it too has its dangers it requires much energy it saps my strength it is debilitating and as you know it is only effective against the weak and infirm there is supposed to be one other small handicap too but that is a matter of legend and i do not intend to put it to the test oh yes there is a story told in my country of a man with the evil eye its an old story going back a thousand years this man was very evil and used his power to terrorise the land he would ride with his bandits into villages and rape and plunder then ride out again unscathed and no one dared hold up a hand against him but in one village there lived an old man who said he knew how to deal with him when the robber band was seen riding that way the villagers took all their corpses and gave them spears and propped them on the walls the robbers came and in the dusk their leader saw that the village was protected he cast his evil eye upon the watchers at the walls but of course the dead cannot die twice the spell rebounded and struck him down he was shrivelled up no larger than a roasted piglet dragosani liked the story and the moral he asked batu grunted and shrugged again doesnt it speak for itself one must never curse the dead i suppose for they have nothing to lose in any argument they must always win in the end dragosani thought of thibor ferenczy and what of the undead he wondered do they too always win if so then its about time someone changed the rules they were met and whisked through customs by a man from the embassy their baggage delivered as if by magic to a black mercedes bearing diplomatic plates as well as their coldeyed escort there was also a silent uniformed driver on their way to the embassy their escort sat in the front passengers seat his body halfturned towards them his arm draped casually along the back of the drivers seat he made smalltalk in a frigid mechanical fashion trying to assume an air of friendly interest he didnt fool dragosani for a minute your first time in london comrades youll find it an interesting city im sure decadent of course and full of fools but interesting for all that i er didnt have time to check on your business here how long do you plan to stay until we go back said dragosani ah the other smiled thinly patiently very good you must excuse me comrade but for some of us curiosity is shall we say a way of life you understand dragosani nodded yes i understand youre kgb the mans thin face went icy in a moment we dont use that term much outside the embassy what term do you use smiled max batu his voice a deceptive whisper shitheads what the escorts face slowly turned white my friend and i are here on business which is no concern of you or yours said dragosani in a level tone we have the very highest authority let me make that clear the very highest authority any interference will be very bad for you if we need your help we will ask for it apart from that youll leave us alone and not bother us the escort pursed his lips drew one long slow breath people dont usually talk to me like that he said his words very precise of course if you persist in obstructing us dragosani continued without changing his tone of voice i can always break your arm that should keep you out of the way for two or three weeks at least the other gasped you threaten me no i make you a promise but dragosani knew he wasnt getting anywhere this was a typical kgb automaton the necromancer sighed said look if you have been tasked to us im sorry for you your job is impossible moreover its dangerous this much ill tell you and this much only were here to test a secret weapon now ask no more questions a secret weapon said the other his eyes widening ah he looked from dragosani to batu and back again what weapon dragosani smiled grimly well he had warned the fool max he said carefully turning his face away a small demonstration perhaps shortly after that they arrived at the embassy in the grounds of the place dragosani and batu stepped down from the car and took their luggage from the boot they looked after their own cases the driver attended to their escort the last they saw of him was as he staggered away leaning on the drivers arm he looked back at them only once stared roundeyed and fearfully at max batu before stumblingly disappearing inside the gloomily imposing building and that was the last they saw of him after that no one bothered them again the second wednesday after new year viktor shukshin had known this feeling of encroaching doom for well over a fortnight now a leaden psychic depression which had lifted only marginally upon the arrival of gregor borowitzs fourth monthly registered letter containing one thousand pounds in large denomination notes in fact it worried shukshin that borowitz had surrendered so readily that he had made no counter threats of his own today had been especially bad the skies were overcast and heavy with snow the river was frozen over with thick grey ice the big house was cold and seemed invaded by icy draughts that followed shukshin everywhere and for the first time in as long as he could remember or at least the first time that he had noticed it there was a strange and ominous quiet about everything so that sounds seemed muffled as if by deep snow though little had fallen as yet the ticking of an old grandfather clock sounded heavy dull even the warped floorboards seemed to creak a little less volubly and all in all it had put shukshins nerves in a very bad way it was as if the house held its breath and waited for something that something came at pm just as shukshin poured himself a glass of iced vodka and sat down in his study before an electric fire looking gloomily out through neglected flyspecked windows on a garden frozen into white crystal it came with the nervejangling clamour of his telephone heart hammering he put down the drink hed almost spilled snatched up the handset and said shukshin stepfather harry keoghs voice seemed very close its harry here im in edinburgh staying with friends howve you been keeping shukshin choked back the anger which came on the instant boiling to the surface so that was it this damned spawn of an esper was here close at hand sending out his psychic aura to crush shukshins sensitive spirits he bared his teeth glared at the telephone in his hand fought down the urge to curse and rage harry is that you in edinburgh you say how thoughtful of you to call me you bastard your mutant aura is hurting me but you sound so well the other sounded surprised when i saw you last you seemed so yes i know shukshin tried not to snarl i hadnt been too well harry but im fine now was there something you wanted i could eat your heart you unnatural little swine why yes i wondered if perhaps i might come to see you maybe we could talk a little about my mother also ive got my skates with me if the rivers frozen i could do some skating im only up here for a few days more you see and i no shukshin snapped and at once checked himself why not get it over with why not get this shadow from the past out of the way once and for always whatever it was that keogh knew or suspected however he had come by shukshins ring which the russian had believed lost in the river and whatever the psychic link between this youth and his mother which apparently bound them still why not bring it to an end right here and now commonsense stood no chance against the bloodlust which surged in shukshin now stepfather i meant only harry my nerves still arent up to much im afraid living here all alone you know im not used to company of course id like to see you and the river is perfect just now for skating but i really couldnt do with a houseful of young people harry oh no stepfather i didnt intend bringing anyone with me i wouldnt think of imposing on you to that extent why my friends dont even know i have a relative up here no chiefly id just like to visit the house again and go on the river id like to skate where my mother used to skate thats all that again the bastard did know something or at least suspected something definitely so he wanted to skate did he on the river where his mother skated shukshins face twisted into a leer well in that casewhen can i expect you in about oh two hours came harrys answer very well said shukshin about to pm then i shall look forward to it harry and he put the phone down before an utterly animal growl of hatred could burst from his writhing mouth and betray his true feelings oh how i shall lookforward to it harry keogh wasnt nearly so far away as edinburgh in fact he was in the foyer of the hotel where hed been staying the past few nights in bonnyrigg itself after speaking to shukshin on the phone he shrugged into his overcoat and went out to his car a battered old morris hed bought on the cheap especially for this trip he had passed his driving test the first time around or at least an exdriving instructor in the cemetery in seaton carew had passed it for him now he drove on icy roads to the top of a hill some quarter of a mile from the old house and overlooking it where he parked and got out of the car there was no one about the scene was bleak and bitter shivering harry carried binoculars to a stand of trees rising starkly naked against the sky from behind the bole of one of them he trained the glasses on the house and waited for no more than a minute or two shukshin came out through the studys patio doors and hurried through his courtyard garden finally emerging from a door in the wall facing the river in his hand he carried a pickaxe harry drew breath sharply let it out slowly to plume in the frosty air shukshin scrambled through brittle shrubbery and brambles down to the rivers rim he let himself down carefully on to the ice tested it sprang up and down at its very edge then he turned and looked all about the place was quite deserted he walked to the centre of the greyshining expanse of ice and bounded again and once more seemed satisfied and now harrys eyes were riveted to the scene that monochrome tableau which he almost felt hed watched before and the act which he was absolutely certain shukshin had performed before for the figure trapped and enlarged in the lenses of his binoculars now crouched down took his pickaxe and swung it in a wide circle scoring a boundary a demarcation in the crusty surface of the ice and all around that etched circle he strode hacking periodically with all the strength and passion of a madman until spouts of water jetted up each time the point of the pick struck home so that in a matter of minutes a great disc of ice nine or ten feet across floated free in a pool of its own then the final touch once more pausing to peer all about finally shukshin walked the perimeter of the circle using his feet to brush icy debris from his assault back into the gap the water would freeze over again of course but it would not be safe for hours yet certainly not before tomorrow morning shukshin had set his trap but he didnt know that the intended victim had watched him do it harry could scarce control his shivering now the trembling in all his limbs which had little or nothing to do with the actual temperature no it had more to do with the mental condition of that hunched figure down there on the ice the binoculars were not powerful enough to bring the figure really close but still harry was sure that hed seen its face working hideously through all the hacking the face of a lunatic who for some reason lusted after harrys life as once he had lusted after and taken his mothers harry wanted to know why would not rest until he had the answer and there was only one way to get it feeling physically and mentally weary and yet knowing that his work wasnt over yet viktor shukshin returned to the house inside the walled courtyard he dragged his pickaxe behind him across frosted flags letting its haft fall clattering from his fingers before he stepped through the open patio doors and into his study head down and arms dangling at his sides he took two more paces into the room and froze what was keogh here already the entire house felt filled with strange forces it reeked of espaura its very atmosphere seeming to vibrate with alien energies instantly inflamed now shukshin sensed movement the patio doors clicking shut behind him he whirled saw and his jaw fell open who what he choked two men faced him stood there in his own study where they had waited for him and one of them held a gun pointed straight at shukshins heart he recognised the weapon as russian service issue recognised the coldly emotionless looks of the two men and felt doom closing its fist on him but in a way it was not entirely unexpected he had thought there might be some sort of visit one day but that it should be now of all illomened moments sit down comrade said the tall one his voice harsh as a file on shukshins ragged nerves max batu pushed a chair forward and shukshin very nearly collapsed into it batu moved to stand behind him where he sat facing dragosani the espaura washed all about shukshin now as if his mind swam in bile oh yes they were from the chateau bronnitsy these two the blackmailers face was ravaged eyes sunken deep in black sockets looking over his head at dragosani finally batus round face cracked into a grin comrade dragosani he said i had always thought you looked ill until now espers shukshin spat the word out borowitzs men what do you want of me he has every reason to look ill max dragosanis voice was deep as a pit a traitor a blackmailer probably a murderer shukshin looked as if he might spring to his feet batu placed heavy stubby hands on his shoulders i asked shukshin grated what you want of me your life said dragosani he took a silencer from his pocket screwed it tightly to the muzzle of his weapon stepped forward and placed it against shukshins fore head only your life shukshin felt max batu step carefully to one side behind him and he knew they were going to kill him wait he croaked youre making a mistake borowitz wont thank you for it i know a lot about the british side ive been giving it to borowitz bit by bit but theres a lot he doesnt know yet also im still working for you in my way why im on a job now yes right now what job said dragosani it had not been his intention to shoot shukshin merely to frighten him maxs getting out of the line of fire had only been a natural reaction shooting was messy and made for bad necromancy the way dragosani had planned shukshins death was much more interesting when he had obtained all he could get this way by simple questioning then they would take shukshin to the bathroom and bind him they would put him in a bath half full of cold water and dragosani would use one of his surgical sickles to slit his wrists as he lay there in water rapidly turning red as his life leaked out then dragosani would requestion him the promise would be that if shukshin told all his wounds would be bound and hed be released dragosani would show him bandages surgical tape but of course shukshin would only have so much time to respond all the time the water was darkening with his blood until he lay in a cold crimson soup it would have been a warning a promise that if shukshin continued to give them trouble then dragosani and batu or others like them would be back to finish the job that is what they would tell shukshin but of course the job would be finished right there and then even so still shukshin might hold something back something perhaps which he did not consider important something forgotten maybe something too damning to tell maybe for instance he was already working for the british but whatever he said it would make no difference when he was dead they would flush his drained corpse with fresh water take him out of the bath and then then dragosani would continue to question now dragosani took the gun away from shukshins forehead sat down facing him im waiting he said what job shukshin gulped tried to force his fear of these men and his hatred of their weird esp talents to the back of his mind it was there it wouldnt go away but for now he must try to ignore it his life hung by a thread and he knew it he must get his thoughts in order lie as hed never lied before some of it would be the truth anyway and of that much at least he could speak with absolute conviction you know im a spotter of course its why borowitz sent you here to find them and kill them you havent been too successful apparently dragosanis sarcasm was acid shukshin ignored that too when i came in here a moment ago the moment i stepped into this room i knew you were here i could almost taste your presence youre powerful espers both of you especially you he glared at dragosani theres a terrific a monstrous talent in you itit hurts me yes borowitz told me that dragosani answered dryly but we know about spotters shukshin so stop stalling and get on with it i wasnt stalling i was trying to explain about the man im going to kill today dragosani and batu exchanged glances batu looked down on the top of shukshins head and said you were going to kill a british esper why and who is he it was my way of getting back into borowitzs good books shukshin lied the mans name is harry keogh he is my stepson he got his talent whatever it is from his mother sixteen years ago i killed her too shukshin continued to glare at dragosani she fascinated me and she infuriated me is she the one you meant when you said i was probably a murderer no probably about it oh i killed her all right like all espers she hurt me her talent drove me mad never mind her snapped dragosani what about this keogh thats what i was trying to tell you with you two powerful as you are still i had to actually enter the house to know you were here but with harry keogh yes shukshin shook his head hes different his talent isvast i know it is you see the bigger it is the more it hurts so im not only killing him for borowitz but also for myself dragosani was interested he could always finish this thing with shukshin later but if harry keogh was that powerful he would like to know more about him and in any case if he was a member of the british ebranch it would be like killing two birds with one stone as his interest expanded he forgot to ask shukshin the important question was keogh a member of the british ebranch and that was something the other wasnt going to volunteer i think we might be able to accommodate you dragosani finally said its always good when you can reach an understanding with old friends he put away his gun when exactly were you going to kill this man and how and shukshin told him after shukshin had gone back to the house harry returned to his car and drove it to the foot of the hill in the direction of bonnyrigg down there he parked again off the road then made his way on foot across a field to the river frozen over the area was unfamiliar and made more so by the first feathers of snow where they drifted down from the leaden skies everything began to take on the soft misty aspect of a winter painting harry began to make his way upriver his mothers resting place was up there somewhere he couldnt say where exactly that was one of the reasons hed come again to this place to make sure he knew exactly where she was that he could find her under any and all circumstances walking on the frozen water he reached out his mind ma can you hear me she was there immediately harry is that you so close and at once her apprehension her agony of fear for him harry is itnow its now ma but dont give me any more problems than i have already i need your help not arguments i dont need anything to trouble my mind oh harry harry what can i say to you how am i supposed to stop worrying about you im your mother then help me dont say anything just be still i want to see if i can find you blind blind i dont ma please she was silent but her worry gnawed at him in his head like the pacing of a troubled loved one in a small room he kept walking closed his eyes and went to her a hundred yards maybe a little more and he knew he was there he stopped walking opened his eyes he stood in the curve of the overhanging bank on the thick white ice which formed his mothers headstone her marker and his marker too now he knew he could always find her im here ma he crouched down on the ice scuffed away a thin layer of snow looked at the heavy jackhandle in his gloved hand that was the second reason he had come as he began to batter at the ice she said i see it all now harry youve been lying to me deceiving me she reproached him you think there will be problems after all no i dont ma im much stronger now in many ways but if there is a problemwell id be a fool not to cover all the possibilities here close to the bank the ice was a little thicker harry began to perspire but soon hed made a hole almost three feet across he cleared as much as he could of the broken ice fragments from the hole and straightened up down there the water swirled blackly and under the water under the cold silt and mud all done now harry must go and quickly no good to let his sweat grow cold on him also it was beginning to snow a little heavier it began to get dark as the early winter dusk came with the snow he had time now for a brandy at the hotel and then then it would be time for his showdown with viktor shukshin harry his mother called after him one last time as he hurried back across the field to his car harry i love you good luck son one hour later dragosani and batu stood behind a clump of young conifers on the river bank twentyfive or thirty yards upstream of shukshins house they had been there for a little less than half an hour but already were beginning to feel the cold biting through their clothing batu had commenced a rhythmic swinging of his arms across his chest and dragosani had just lit a cigarette when at last the yellow light above the door to shukshins courtyard snapped into life his signal to them that the scene was now set for murder and two figures came out into the evening in real time it was not yet night but the winter darkness was almost that of night and but for the stars and a rising moon visibility would be poor the clouds so dense only an hour ago had now drifted away and no more snow had fallen but to the east the sky was black with a heavy burden and what little wind there was came front that direction it would yet snow tonight and heavily but for the moment the stars lit the scene with their cold soft light and the rising moon made a silver ribbon of the winding river of ice as the figures from the house picked their way down to the river dragosani took a last drag on his cigarette behind cupped hands threw it down and ground it out beneath his heel batu stopped swinging his arms they both stood like stone and watched the play unfold at the rivers rim the two figures shrugged out of their overcoats and placed them on the bank then adopted kneeling positions as they put on their skates there was a little conversation but it was low and the wind was in the wrong direction only snatches of talk drifted back to the hidden watchers shukshins voice dark and very deep sounded openly aggressive to dragosani and wolfish like the growling of a great dog and he wondered why keogh didnt take fright or at least show something of suspicion but no the younger mans voice was flat and even almost carefree as the two glided out on to the ice and began to skate at first they went to and fro almost side by side but then the slighter figure took the lead and moving with some skill he rapidly picked up speed to come skimming upriver towards the spot where the watchers were hiding dragosani and batu crouched down a little then but at the last moment before he drew level with them keogh turned in a wide loop which took in the entire breadth of the river and headed back the other way behind him shukshin had almost slowed to a halt as keogh made his run the older man was far less certain on the ice seemed awkward and even clumsy by comparison but as keogh sped back towards him he now turned to skate in the same direction but in such a way as to impede the faster man keogh leaned over in a slalom at such an angle that his skates threw up a sheet of snow and ice as he missed the other by inches then threw himself over the other way at a similar angle to bring himself back on course and a scant twelve inches away his skates carved ice on the very rim of the sabotaged circle where freshformed ice barely held the central disc in place and shukshin was so close on his heels that he too must swerve wildly his arms windmilling to avoid his own trap careful stepfather keogh called back over his shoulder as he sped away i almost collided with you then dragosani and batu heard batu said a fortunate young man this one so far oh dragosani wasnt so sure fortune had anything to do with it shukshin had been unable to specify keoghs talent what if he was a telepath he would have the power to pluck his stepfathers treacherous thoughts right out of his head myself i think our blackmailer will find this more difficult than he thought shukshin had come to a halt now standing still on the ice in a peculiar hunched stance and watching keogh intently where he continued to skate the russians shoulders and chest rose and fell spasmodically and his body visibly shook as if he were in pain or suffering from great emotional stress this way harry he called harshly this way youre too good for me im afraid why you could skate circles around me keogh came back circled the others hunched figure and again and with each sweep his skates went inches closer to disaster shukshin held out his arms and keogh took his hands spinning round the older man and turning him on his own axis and now max batu whispered to dragosani where they looked on the coup de grace suddenly shukshin stopped turning and appeared to stumble into keogh keogh twisted his body to avoid him their hands were still locked one of keoghs skates dug in where it cut through a skim of powdery snow and into the groove of the channel hacked by shukshin he was jerked to a halt and only shukshins grip on his wrists kept him from falling on to the infirm disc of ice shukshin laughed then a crazed baying laugh and thrust keogh away from him thrust him towards death but keogh held tight to the sleeves of shukshins coat and as he was pushed so he pulled caught off balance shukshin jerked forward keogh bent to one side and threw him over his hip but when he released shukshin still the russian held fast to him with a cry of outrage the older man fell inside his own circle dragging keogh after him both of them crashed down in a tangle on ice which at once shifted beneath them the circle made cracking sounds at its rim like small gunshots water spouted up in black jets as the disc tilted and broke in two halves shukshin gave a cry of horror a strange mad cry like a wounded beast as the semicircle of ice supporting him and keogh stood on end and tipped them into the freezing gurgling water quick max dragosani snapped we cant afford to lose both of them he charged from behind the cover of the conifers with batu close on his heels who would you prefer to save the mongol rasped as they jumped down onto the ice keogh he answered at once if its possible hell know more about the british organisation than shukshin and he has this talent of his whatever it is even as he spoke those words a fantastic idea had come to dragosani one he had never even considered before if he could learn necromancy from an undead thing and with it steal the thoughts and secrets of the dead mightnt he also steal their talents at the chateau bronnitsy the agents were all allies working on the same side towards the same end but here in england the espers were enemies why not steal keoghs as yet unknown talent itself and use it to his own ends from the hole in the river where cakes of ice churned in dark frenzied water a great grunting and gasping sounded as batu and dragosani drew closer but as they more cautiously approached the rim itself all sounds ceased and they were greeted only by the gurgle and slap of water moving under and against ice for a moment a clutching hand shot dripping into view and clawed at the rim but before they could make a move to grab it the hand was gone sucked under this way dragosani gasped follow the course of the river you think theres a chance batu obviously thought not a very slim one said dragosani they ran on the ice as best they could under a cold and silent moon beneath the ice tumbled and turned by the current harry keogh somehow got his jacket off and let it go under his shirt he wore a rubber wetsuit vest but still the cold was terrific it must surely finish shukshin who was completely unprotected harry started to swim kept his head turned sideways with his face against the ice actually found places where cold air was trapped in shallow pockets he swam towards his mother following her stream of troubled thoughts just as he had followed them unerringly two hours ago with his eyes closed except then there had been plenty of air to breathe and he had been warm panic gripped him momentarily but he put it out of mind his ma was over there that way he began to swim more strongly and something grasped at his feet his legs something fastened its grasp on him and clung to his trousers shukshin the river was bobbing them along in tandem like matches down a drain gluing them together through sheer gravitational attraction harry swam more desperately yet with his arms with one leg he swam as never before his lungs bursting his heart a great gong clanging away in his chest and shukshin clawing his way up his body his hands like the pincers of some great crab snatching at harry as if to pull him to pieces this was it he could swim no more the water was the black blood of some giant alien into whose veins harry had been injected where shukshin was an alien antibody bent on his destruction ma ma help me harry cried out with his mind as at last he was forced to draw breath but drew only icy water which gushed into his straining jaws and nostrils harry she answered at once loudly close at hand her own voice frantic in his head harry youre here he kicked backwards lashed out with both feet at shukshin and thrust upward with his back and head crashing himself against the ice cover which immediately mercifully shattered into thin shards as his head and shoulders emerged into air and suddenly the water was still and his feet touched a muddy bottom five feet down and even before his eyes had focused and his battered senses stopped spinning harry knew he had made it now he summoned his last reserves threw out his hands and grasped at tough roots where they projected from the overhanging bank and slowly he began to draw himself up and out beside him the water swirled and gurgled as from some hidden commotion harry halfturned and terror drew his lips back from his teeth as shukshins mad face came surging up alongside him choking and gagging the madman saw him spewed water and a babbling scream of rage into his face clutched at his throat with hands like steel grapples harry brought his knee up into the maniacs groin bones broke but still shukshin hung on he dragged harry inexorably back slavered into his face for a long moment harry thought he meant to bite him savage him like a rabid dog he fought shukshin slammed his clenched fists again and again into his ghastly face to no avail the madman would win harry was about to go under he reached out again for the tough roots in the river bank but shukshins hands at his throat were shutting off the air shutting off life itself ma harry silently cried you were right ma i should have listened im sorry no came her denial of defeat no shukshin had killed her but he must not be allowed to kill her son and again the bitter water gurgled and churned but more blackly yet dragosani skidded to a halt not fifteen feet away grabbed at batu and drew him also to a standstill panting their breath forming fragile feathers of snow in the air they looked they saw and their jaws fell open two men had gone down under the ice back there had been washed downstream to this hole and until a moment ago two figures had fought and torn at each other here in the still water beneath the river bank but now there were three figures there in the water and the third one was as terrible a thing as ever dragosani had heard of or imagined or seen in his blackest nightmares it wasnot alive and yet it had the mobility of life the authority of life and it had purpose it clung to shukshin wrapped itself about him put its mudandbones arms around him and its algae and plasteredhair skull against his of eyes there were none but a putrid glow shone out from empty sockets with a semblance of sight and where before shukshin had only howled and gibbered and laughed like a madman now he quite literally went mad shriek after shriek pealed out from him as he fought with the awful thing the shrillest lunatic screeching that dragosani and batu had ever thought to hear and at the very end just before the horror dragged him under words which at last the petrified watchers could understand not you shukshin babbled oh god oh no not you then he was gone and the thing of bones and mud and weeds and death with him and harry keogh was left to scramble out on to the river bank batu might perhaps have gone blindly numbly after him but dragosani still clutched at his arm he clutched it almost for support batu began to adopt his killing crouch but dragosani stopped that too no max he hoarsely whispered we dont dare weve seen something of what he can do but what other talents does he possess batu understood relaxed drew himself upright on the bank above them harry keogh became aware of their presence for the first time he turned his face towards them found them stared at them his eyes focused on them at last and he looked as though he might speak but he said nothing for long moments they simply stared at each other all three and then keogh glanced back at the jagged patch of black water thanks ma he said simply dragosani and batu watched as he turned staggered stumbled and then began to run weavingly back towards shukshins house they watched him go and made no attempt to follow not yet when he was out of sight batu hissed but that thing comrade dragosani it wasnt couldnt be human so what was it dragosani shook his head he believed he knew the answer but wouldnt commit himself now im not sure he said it had been human once though one thing is certain when keogh needed help it came to him thats his talent max the dead answer his call and he turned to the other his eyes darker still in sunken orbits they answer his call max and there are a lot more of the dead than there are of the living chapter thirteen on thursday morning harry went back to the river back to the place where his mother lay once more locked in mud and weed except that there were two of them there now and he had not gone to talk to her but to viktor shukshin he took a cushion from the car and carried it down to the river bank putting it down in snow six inches deep before seating himself and hugging his knees below where he sat the ice had crusted over again and snow had settled on the place where hed cut his escape hole so that only an outline showed through after sitting in silence for a while he said stepfather can you hear me yes came the answer in a little while yes i can hear you harry keogh i hear you and i feel your presence why dont you go away and leave me in peace be careful stepfather mine might be the last voice you ever hear if i go away and leave you in peace wholl speak to you then so thats your talent is it harry you speak to the dead youre a corpse rabblerouser well i want you to know that it hurts me like all esp hurts me but last night for the first time in many long years i lay here in my freezing bed and slept soundly and there was no pain wholl speak to me i dont want anyone to speak to me i want peace what do you mean it hurts you harry pressed how can my just being here hurt anything shukshin told him and thats why you killed my mother yes and its why i tried to kill you but in your case it might also have served to save my own life and now he told harry about the men borowitz had sent to kill him dragosani and batu harry wasnt satisfied he wanted to know it all from the beginning right to the present tell me about it he said all of it and i swear i wont bother you again and so shukshin told him about borowitz and the chateau bronnitsy about the russian espers where they worked for world conquest through esp in their secret den in the heart of the ussr he told of how borowitz had sent him out of russia to england to find and kill british espers and how he had broken away and become a british citizen and he told him again about the curse that dogged him how esptalented people rubbed his nerves raw and brought on the madness in him and at last harry understood and might almost have pitied shukshin were it not for his mother and as shukshin talked so harry thought of sir keenan gormley and the british ebranch and he remembered his promise to go and see gormley and perhaps join his group when all of this had been sorted out well now it was sorted out and now harry knew that he must go and see gormley for viktor shukshin wasnt the only guilty one there were others far worse than he could ever be the one who had sent him out on his murderous mission in the first place for instance for if shukshin had never come here harrys mother would still be alive and at last harry was satisfied until now his life had seemed greatly aimless unfulfilled his one ambition had been to kill shukshin but now he knew that it was bigger than that and suddenly he felt small in view of the task which still awaited him all right stepfather he finally said ill leave you now and let you rest but its a peace you dont deserve i cant and wont forgive you i dont want your forgiveness harry keogh just your promise that youll leave me alone here shukshin told him and youve given me that so now go and get yourself killed and let me be harry climbed stiffly to his feet every bone in his body ached his head too and he felt completely sapped of strength it was partly physical but mostly emotional it was the calm which follows on the storm and although he couldnt yet know it it was also the lull before the greater storm still to come but now he shrugged himself upright left the cushion lying there forgotten in the snow headed back towards his car behind him and yet with him a voice said in his mind goodbye harry but it wasnt shukshins voice goodbye ma he answered and thanks ill always love you and ill always love you harry what now came shukshins horrified mental gasp what keogh whats this i saw you raise her up but harry didnt answer he let mary keogh do it for him hello viktor no youre wrong harry didnt raise me up i raised myself up for the sake of love which is something you cant understand but thats over now and ill not do it again my harry has others to look after him now so ill just lie here lonely in the mud except maybe it wont be so lonely now keogh shukshin frantically called out after harry again keogh you promised me you said you were the only one who could talk to me but now she is talking to me and she hurts me most of all harry kept on walking now now viktor he heard his mothers answer as if she spoke to a small child that will get you nowhere did you say you want peace and quiet oh but youll soon get bored with peace and quiet viktor keogh shukshins voice was a diminishing mental shriek now keogh you have to get me out of this dig me up tell them where to find my body only dont leave me here with her actually viktor mary keogh remorselessly continued i think ill rather enjoy talking to you youre so close to me here that its no effort at all keogh you bastard come back ohpleasecomeback but harry kept on walking by pm harry was back in hartlepool the roads were nightmarish layered with compacted snow for more than half the journey so that in the main he was driving on his nerves this only served to drain more of his strength and when at last he got home it was as much as he could do to drag himself upstairs brenda his wife of eight weeks was bright and chirpy about the flat which had undergone some fantastic and inexplicable metamorphosis since she had moved in after their registry office wedding she was less than three months pregnant but already blooming harry too had been in fine fettle when last she had seen him but now in complete contrast he barely managed the effort of kissing her on the cheek was asleep almost before his head hit the pillows he had been away for three days doing research she knew for a new book he was planning what and where exactly hed never bothered to say well that was harry and she should be used to it by now but she was not used to him turning up looking like hed spent three days in a concentration camp after he had slept right through the afternoon and seemed to have developed a fever she called a doctor who visited at about pm harry didnt bother to wake up for his visit the doctor thought it might be pneumonia though the symptoms werent quite right he left pills instructions and his telephone number if harry got worse during the night especially if his breathing became irregular or he started coughing or if his temperature went up appreciably brenda was to call him at once but harry got no worse through the night and in the morning he was able to have a bite of breakfast following which he engaged brenda in a peculiar guarded conversation which she was dismayed to find as depressing and morbid as any talk shed ever had with him during his gloomy or morose periods of previous less happy times after listening to him for a little while when he began to talk about making a will leaving everything to her or to their child in the event she was unable to make use of it then she rounded on him and laughed out loud harry she said taking his hands where he sat on the edge of the bed with his shoulders slumped what is this all about i know youve had a bug of some sort or other and that youre still feeling low and i know that when youre a bit down in the mouth it really seems like the end of the world to you but here we are married for just eight weeks and you sound as if you expect to be dead by the spring yes and me shortly after ive never heard anything so silly just a week ago you were swimming fighting skating full of life so what is it thats suddenly bothering you at that he decided he really couldnt hedge any longer anyway she was his wife now and it was only right that she should know and so he sat her down and told her everything with the exception of his dream of the tombstones and of course excluding the death of viktor shukshin he passed off his aggressive exercising of the past few months as simply a means of ensuring his fitness for work still to come work which could well prove dangerous which in turn led him to speak of the british esp organisation but not in any depth it was sufficient she should know that he wasnt the only strangely talented person that in fact there were many more and that there were foreign powers ranged against the free world who were not above using such talents to its detriment part of harrys work with the organisation would be to ensure that these alien powers failed in their objectives his talent as a necroscope would be used as a weapon against them the future therefore seemed at bestuncertain his talk of wills and such had been simply an expression of this uncertainty he thought it was best to be prepared for any eventuality even telling her all of this and while not being too specific on any point still he wondered if perhaps he was making a mistake if it would have been better to keep her entirely in the dark and he wondered at his own motives was he really confiding in her in order to prepare her forfor whatever or was it that she was right that he was feeling at a low ebb and so needed someone to share the load or there again was it guilt he had a course to run now and must pursue it the chase was not at an end shukshin had merely been a faltering step in the right direction did he feel that because he chose to go in that direction brenda was at risk the dream epitaph his mothers warning had said nothing about brenda dying as a result of anything harry was yet to do he had impregnated her yes which would result in a birth but how could any course he took now influence the physical event of the birth itself and yet a nagging voice in the back of his mind told him that indeed it could and so it seemed to him that his motive for telling her was chiefly one of guilt and also because he needed to tell someone needed to tell a friend the trouble was that he seemed to be leaning on the very one he endangered which aggravated and magnified the guilt aspect out of all proportion it was all very confusing and abstruse and trying to muddle through it made him more tired than ever so that when he was done talking he was glad to sit back and let her think it over strangely she accepted everything he said almost as a matter of course indeed with visible relief and at once set about to explain why harry i know im not as clever as you but im not stupid either ive known there was something in the air ever since you told me that story of yours about the necroscope i sort of sensed that you hadnt finished it that you wanted to say more but you were scared to also thereve been times up in harden when mr hannant has stopped me and asked after you the way he talked i knew he thought there was something strange about you too hannant he frowned suspiciously what did he oh nothing to be concerned about in fact i think hes more than a little frightened of you harry ive listened to you talking to your poor dead ma in your sleep and i knew you were holding real conversations and there were so many other things your writing for instance i mean how come you were suddenly a brilliant author ive read your stories harry and theyre not you oh theyre wonderful stories all right but you just arent that wonderful not the real you the real you is ordinary harry oh i love you of course i do but im nobodys fool and your swimming your skating your judo did you think id believe you were a super man i promise you its easier to believe youre a necroscope its a relief to know the truth harry im glad youve finally told me harry shook his head in open astonishment talk about levelheaded finally he said but i havent told you everything love oh i know that she answered of course you havent if youre to be working for your country why obviously therell be things you need to keep secret even from me i understand that harry it was as if someone had lifted a great weight off his chest he breathed deeply lay back again let his head link into his pillows brenda im still very tired he yawned just let me sleep now theres a love tomorrow im to go down to london all right my love she leaned over him to kiss his forehead and dont worry i wont ask you to tell me a thing about it harry slept right through until evening then got up and ate a meal they went out about pm just to walk for an hour in the crisp night air until brenda started to feel the cold then they hurried home took hot showers and made love and afterwards both of them slept right through the night it was the least harry had done in any single day in his life later he would have reason to recall it as the most wasteful day in his life sir keenan gormley was thoughtful as he left esp hq took the lift down to the tiny lobby and went out into the cold london night several things had given him cause for concern just recently not the least of them being harry keogh for keogh had not yet contacted him and with each day that passed gormley felt the time weighing on him like lumps of lead it was just after nine oclock as gormley walked the streets heading for westminster tube station and two hundred and twentyfive miles away harry keogh himself was just making love to his wife before settling to a nights sleep as for gormleys other causes for concern there were two of them one was the way his second in command kept enquiring after his health which might seem silly if his second in command werent alec kyle and if alec kyle wasnt a very talented seer a man whose by no means negligible talent lay in foretelling the future kyles concern for his boss over the last week or ten days had been pretty obvious no matter how carefully hed tried to hide it if there was anything specific gormley knew that kyle would tell him that was why he hadnt pressed him about it but it was worrying anyway and finally there was the other thing the big thing over the period of the last six or seven weeks there had been at least a dozen different occasions when gormley had known that there were espers about when hed spotted them in his mind he had never come face to face with one had never been able to pin one down but hed known they were there anyway at least two of them it had got so he could recognise them almost as easily as he recognised his own men but these were not his men their auras were strange and always they watched him from the safety of crowds in the busy places never where he could tie a face to a feeling he wondered how long they would go on watching and if that was all they would do and as he reached the underground and went down to the trains he patted the bulge of his mm browning through his overcoat and jacket at least that was a comfort there wasnt an esper in the world who could think himself out of the way of a bullet not that gormley knew of anyway there were only a few people on the platform and fewer in the compartment where gormley picked up a discarded copy of the daily mail to keep him company during the journey he found it mildly alarming that the headlines seemed completely alien to him was he really that much out of touch yes he probably was his work had been putting a lot of strain on him and taking up far too much of his time this was the third night in a row hed worked late he couldnt remember the last time hed really read a book right through or entertained friends maybe kyle was right to be concerned about him and on a purely personal level at that not from the point of view of an esper maybe it was time he took a break and left his second in command to mind the shop god only knew he would have to sooner or later and he made himself a promise that he would take a breakjust as soon as hed initiated young harry keogh into the fold keogh gormley had given a lot of thought to keogh had considered some of the ways his talent might be put to use fantastic ways all in the mind for now but fascinating anyway he would have started to go over them again but just as it crossed his mind to do so the train pulled into st jamess and gormley found himself distracted by an incredibly pretty pair of legs in a tiny skirt that passed directly in front of his eyes and out of the twin doors it was a wonder the lovely creature didnt freeze to death he thought and wouldnt that be a loss gormley grinned at his own thoughts his wife god bless her was always complaining he had an eye for the girls well his heart might be tricky but the rest of him seemed to be in working order an eye wouldnt be all he had for that young lady if he were thirty years younger he coughed loudly returned to his newspaper and tried to get himself reacquainted with the world a brave effort but he lost interest halfway down the second column it was pretty mundane stuff after all compared with his world a world of fortunetellers telepaths and now a necroscope harry keogh again there was a game gormley played with kyle it was a wordassociation game sometimes it startled kyles futureoriented mind into action opening a window for him a window on tomorrow normally kyles talent worked independent of conscious thought he usually dreamed his predictions if he consciously tried for results they wouldnt come but if you could catch him unawares they had played their game just a few days ago gormley had had keogh on his mind and had wandered into kyles office and seeing the esper sitting there hed smiled and said game kyle had understood go right ahead its a name gormley had warned to which kyle had nodded his head im ready hed said sitting up and putting down whatever he was working on gormley paced a while then turned quickly and faced the other where he sat at his desk harry keogh he had snapped then mobius answered kyle at once maths gormley frowned spacetime now kyle went white scaredlooking and gormley had known theyd got something he gave it one last shot necroscope necromancer the other shot back at once what necromancer gormley had repeated but kyle was still working vampire hed shouted then starting to his feet then he was swaying trembling shaking his head saying thatthats enough sir whatever it was itits gone now and that had been that gormley came back to the present he looked up and found theyd passed through victoria and that the train was almost empty already they were midway to sloane square and that was when he began to feel a strange depression settling over him he felt that there was something wrong but he couldnt just put his finger on it it might simply be the trains emptiness and that he missed the bustle of life and contact with other human beings but he didnt think so then as the train pulled into the station he knew what it was it was his talent working the doors sighed open and a middleaged couple got out leaving gormley quite alone but just before the doors hissed shut again two men got in and their espaura washed over him like a wave of icy water yes and now he could put faces to feelings dragosani and batu sat directly opposite their quarry stared straight at him with cold expressionless faces they made a strange pair he thought not designed with any degree of compatibility not outwardly anyway the taller one leaned forward his sunken eyes reminding gormley yet again of harry keogh yes they were like keoghs eyes in a way probably in their colour and intelligence and that was especially strange for set in this face one got the impression that by rights they should be feral or even red and that the intelligence behind them was barely human at all but that of a beast you know what we are sir keenan the stranger said in a voice deep as it was dark whose russian accent he made no attempt to disguise if not who we are and we know who and what you are therefore it would be childish simply to sit here and pretend that we were ignorant of each other dont you agree your logic leaves little room for argument gormley nodded imagining that his blood was already beginning to cool in his veins then let us continue to be logical said dragosani if we wanted you dead you would be dead we have not lacked the opportunity as im sure you know and so when we leave the train at south kensington you will not attempt to run or make a fuss or bring unnecessary attention to yourself or to us if you do then we will be forced to kill you and that would be unfortunate of benefit to no one is this understood and agreed gormley forced himself to remain calm raised an eyebrow and said youre very sure of yourself mr er dragosani said the other at once boris dragosani yes i am very sure of myself as is my friend here max batu for a stranger in this country i was about to say gormley continued it seems to me that im about to be kidnapped but are you sure you know all you need to know about my habits mightnt there be something youve overlooked something your logic hasnt taken into account he quickly nervously took out a cigarette lighter from his righthand overcoat pocket and placed it in his lap patted his pockets as if he searched for a packet of cigarettes finally started to reach inside his overcoat no said dragosani warningly as if from nowhere he produced his own weapon and held it before him at arms length pointing it directly into gormleys face so that the older man looked straight down the rifled barrel of the stubby black silencer no nothing has been overlooked max could you see to that please batu got up eased himself on to the seat next to gormley drew the others hand slowly back into the open and took the browning from gormleys trembling fingers the safety catch was still on batu released the magazine and pocketed it gave the automatic back to gormley nothing at all dragosani continued unfortunately however that was the last wrong move youll be allowed to make he put away his gun folded his slim fingers into his lap his posture was unnatural gormley decided very sinuous almost feline very nearly female he didnt know what to make of dragosani at all any more heroics dragosani continued will result in your death immediately and gormley knew he wasnt bluffing carefully he pushed the useless automatic back into its holster said what is it you want with me we want to talk to you said dragosani i wish toto put some questions to you ive had questions put to me before gormley answered forcing a tight smile i imagine theyll be very searching questions eh ah said dragosani now he smiled and it was ghastly gormley felt physically repulsed his mans mouth gaped like a panting dogs where elongated teeth gleamed sharply white ah no therell be no bright lights in your eyes sir keenan if thats what you mean said dragosani no drugs no pincers no hose to fill your belly with water oh no nothing like that but you will tell me everything i want to know of that i can assure you the train was slowing as it pulled into south kensington gormleys heart gave a little lurch in his chest so close to home and yet so far dragosani had a light overcoat folded over his arm he showed gormley the silencer of his weapon let it peep out of the folds of the overcoat for a moment and reminded him no heroics there was a handful of people on the platform young people mainly and a pair of downandouts with a bottle in a paper bag between them even if gormley looked for help he couldnt find much here just leave the station by the same route you take every night said dragosani at gormleys shoulder gormleys heart was hammering now he knew full well that if he went with these men it was all up with him he was an older hand at this game than the two foreign agents when dragosani had told him his and his squat little companions names that had been as good as saying but it wont do you any good for you wont be around to tell anyone and so he must escape from them but how they left the underground onto pelham street walked down the brompton road to queens gate i cross here at the lights gormley said but as they reached the parking lanes straddling the central reservation dragosanis grip tightened on his arm we have a car here he said drawing gormley to the right and along the line of parked vehicles towards an anonymouslooking ford dragosani had bought the car secondhand and cash down no questions asked it would last only as long as his and max batus visit then it would be found burnedout in some suburban lane but it was then as they approached the car that gormley saw his chance not twentyfive yards away a police patrol car pulled into an empty space and a uniformed constable got out and began checking the doors of the parked cars a routine check gormley guessed or more properly where he was concerned a miracle dragosani felt the sudden tension in gormley sensed his move before he could begin to make it batu had just opened the nearside front and rear doors of the ford was turning back towards dragosani and gormley when his partner hissed now max unprepared still batu instantly adopted his killing crouch his moon face undergoing its monstrous metamorphosis dragosani maintained his grip on gormley looked away at the last moment gormley had opened his mouth to yell for help but all that came out was a croak he saw batus face silhouetted against the night and one eye which was a yellow slit while the other was round and green and throbbing as if filled with sentient pus something passed from that face to gormley as fast as the thrust of a mental knife its razor edge located his spirit his very soul and opened them up except for what little traffic passed in the street all was quiet and yet gormley heard the cacophonic gonging of some great cracked bell from deep inside himself and knew it was his heart with that it should have been finished but not quite thrown backward by the shock of batus awful power gormley slammed loudly against the wing of a car parked behind the ford along the street the constables face turned enquiringly in their direction as a second policeman got out of the patrol car worse another vehicle a blue porsche pulled in with a screech of brakes its headlights dazzling where they picked the three figures out and pinned them against the darkness in another moment the porsche seemed to eject a tall young man into the street his strong face concerned as he grabbed hold of gormley to steady him uncle he said staring into the others bulging eyes his blue face my god it must be his heart the two policemen were already hurrying to see what was happening dragosani found himself almost paralysed by the changing situation everything was going wrong he made an effort to regain control whispered to max batu get into the car then he turned to the stranger by now the policemen were on hand offering assistance what happened here one of them asked dragosani thought fast we saw him stumble he said i thought maybe he was drunk anyway i went to help asked if there was anything i could do he said something about his heart i was about to take him to a hospital but then this gentleman arrived and tm arthur banks said the man in question this is sir keenan gormley my uncle i was on my way to meet him at the station when i saw him with these two but look this isnt the time or place for explanations he has a bad heart we have to get him to a hospital and i mean right now the policemen were galvanised into action one of them said to dragosani perhaps youll give us a ring later sir just so we can get a few more details thanks he helped banks get his uncle into the porsche while his driver ran back to the patrol car and got the blue light going then as banks pulled away from the kerb and swung the porsche around in a screeching half circle the constable yelled just follow us sir well have him under care in two shakes a moment later and he had joined his colleague in the patrol vehicle by which time the siren was blaring its deedah deedah warning to traffic in a sort of numb disbelief dragosani watched as the two cars moved off in tandem he watched them out of sight then slowly unsteadily got into the ford and sat there beside batu trembling with rage the door was still open finally dragosani grabbed its handle and slammed it shut slammed it so hard that it almost sprang from its fixings damn he snarled damn the british sir keenan gormley his nephew their bloody ohsocivilised police everything things are not going well max batu agreed and damn you too said dragosani you and your bloody evil eye you didnt kill him allow me to know my business batu quietly answered i killed him all right i felt it it was like crushing a bug dragosani started the engine pulled away i saw him looking at me i tell you hell talk no batu shook his head he wont have strength for talking hes a dead man comrade take my word for it at this very moment a dead man and in the porsche suddenly gormley choked out a single word dragosani which meant nothing at all to his horrified nephew and slumped down in his seat with spittle dribbling from the corner of his mouth max batu was right he was dead on arrival harry keogh arrived at gormleys house in south kensington at about pm the following day meanwhile arthur banks had been a very busy man it seemed a year but in fact it was only yesterday when hed driven up from chichester with his wife gormleys daughter on a flying visit then there had been his uncles heart attack since when the entire world seemed to have gone stark staring mad and horribly so first there had been the awful business of phoning his aunt jacqueline gormley from the hospital and telling her what had happened then her breakdown when she arrived at the hospital and her daughter consoling her all through the long night when she had broken her heart as she wandered to and fro through the house looking for her husband this morning shed stayed at the house until they brought sir keenan from the hospital morgue the mortician there had done a pretty good job with him but still the old mans face had been twisted in a dreadful rictus funeral arrangements were swift that was the way gormley had always said he would want it a cremation tomorrow until when he would lie in state at his home jackie couldnt stay there however not with him looking like that why it didnt look like him at all so she had had to be taken to her brothers place on the other side of london that too had been banks job and finally he had driven his wife to waterloo so that she could go back to chichester to the children shed be back for the funeral until then he was stuck at the house on his own or rather in the company of his dead uncle aunt jackie had made him promise he wouldnt leave sir keenan on his own and of course he hadnt refused her that but when he got back to the house after putting his wife on the chichester train that had been the worst of all it had been mindless ghoulish unbelievable and for all that it had been fifteen minutes ago he was still reeling still sick numb to his brain with shock and horror when harry keoghs ring at the doorbell took him staggering to the front door tin harry keogh said the young man on the door step sir keenan gormley asked me to come and see hhelp banks whispered choking the word out as if there was no wind in him as if all the spit had dried up in him god jesus christ whoever you are hhelp me harry looked at him in amazement grabbed him in order to hold him up what is it whats happened this is sir keenan gormleys house isnt it the other nodded he was slowly turning green about to throw up again at any moment ccome in hes inin there in the livingroom of all bloody places but dont go in there i have tohave to call the police somebody has to anyway his legs began to buckle and harry thought he would fall before that could happen he pushed him backwards and down into a chair in the lobby then he crouched down beside him and shook him is it sir keenan whats happened to him even before the answer came harry knew soon to die in agony first and foremost a patriot banks looked up stared at harry from a greentinged face did youdid you work for him i was going to banks baulked burst to his feet staggered to a tiny room to one side of the lobby he died last night he managed to gulp the words out a heart attack he was to be cremated tomorrow but now he yanked open the door and the odour of fresh vomit welled out the room was a toilet and it was obvious that hed already used it harry turned his face away grabbed a mouthful of fresh air from the open front door before quietly closing it then he left banks retching and walked through into the livingroom and saw for himself what was wrong with banks and what was wrong with sir keenan gormley a heart attack banks had said one look at the room told harry thered been an attack all right but what sort didnt bear thinking about he fought down the bile which at once rose up and threatened to swamp him went back to banks where he crouched weakly at the bowl of the toilet in the small room call the police when you can he said sir keenans office too if anyones on duty there im sure he would want them to know aboutthis ill stay here with you with him for a little while ththanks said banks without looking up im sorry i cant be more help right now but when i came in and found him like that i understand said harry ill be ok in a minute im working on it of course harry went back to the other room he saw everything began to catalogue the horror then stopped what stopped him was this a queen anne chair with claw feet lay on its side on the floor one of its wooden legs was broken off just below the platform of the seat embedded in the clublike foot was a tooth other teeth wrenched out lay scattered on the floor the mouth of the corpse had been forced open and now gaped like a black shaft in the wildly distorted frozen grimace of the face harry gropingly found himself a seat another chair but one free of debris and collapsed into it he closed his eyes pictured the room as it must have looked before this sir keenan in his coffin on an oak table draped in black rosescented candles burning at head and feet and then as he lay here alone theintrusion but why why keenan he asked noooo no keep off came the answer at once causing harry to rock back in his chair with its force its fear its freezing terror dragosani you monster no more for gods sake have pity man dragosani harry reached out soothing mental fingers this isnt dragosani keenan its me harry keogh what the single word was a gasp in his mind keogh harry then a sigh a sob of relief thank god thank god its you harry and notnot him was this dragosani harry gritted his teeth but why is he insane he would have to be totally no gormleys vigorous denial cut him off oh he is crazy of course he is but crazy like a fox and his talent ishideous suddenly the answer or what he thought was the answer came to keogh in a flash he felt the blood draining from him he came to you after you died he gasped hes like me a necroscope no absolutely not again gormleys denial not like you at all harry im talking to you because i want to all ofof us talk to you youre the bringer of warmth of peace youre contact with the dream that went before and which now has faded youre a chance the one last chance that something worthwhile might linger over might even be passed on a light in the darkness harry thats what you are but dragosani what is his talent hes a necromancer and thats a different thing entirely harry opened his eyes a crack and glanced once more at the state of the room but as the horror welled up again he closed his eyes and said but this is the work of a ghoul that and worse gormley shuddered and harry felt it felt the dead mans shudder of absolute terror shaking his spirit hehe doesnt just talk harry he doesnt ask doesnt even try he just reaches in and takes steals you cant hide anything from him he finds his answers in your blood your guts in the marrow of your very bones the dead cant feel pain harry or they shouldnt but thats part of his talent too when boris dragosani works he makes us feel it i felt his knives his hands his tearing nails i knew everything he did and all of it was hell after one minute i would have told him everything but thats not his way its not his art how could he be sure i told the truth but his way he knows its the truth its written in skin and muscle in ligaments and tendons and corpuscles he can read it in brain fluid in the mucus of the eye and ear in the texture of the dead tissue itself harry kept his eyes closed shook his head felt sick and dizzy and totally disoriented as if this were all happening to someone else at last he said this cant mustnt happen again he has to be stopped i have to stop him but i cant do it alone oh yes he has to be stopped harry especially now you see he took everything he knows it all he knows our strengths our weaknesses and all of it is knowledge he can use him and his master gregor borowitz and you may well be the only one who can stop him with another part of his awareness harry heard banks on the telephone in the lobby time was now short and there was so much gormley must tell him listen keenan we have to hurry now ill stay with you a little while longer and then ill find a hotel in the city but if i stay here now the police will want to talk to me anyway ill find a place and from now until you he realised what he had almost said and bit the words off unspoken but not unvisioned until im cremated yes said gormley and harry could picture him nodding understandingly it was to have been soon but now it will probably be delayed ill stay in touch harry said theres still a lot i dont know about our organisation theirs how to go about tracking them down many things do you know about batu again gormleys fear was apparent the little mongol harry do you know about him i know hes one of them but he has the evil eye he can kill with a glance my heart attack he brought it on he killed me harry max batu that face of his that evil eye it generates mental poison his power bites like acid melts the brain the heart he killed me then hes another i have to settle with harry answered cold determination stiffening his resolve but be careful harry i will i think the answers are in you my boy and god only knows how much i pray you can find them just let me give you this warning when dragosani waswith me i sensed something else in him it wasnt just his necromancy harry theres an evil in that man thats older than time with him loose in the world nothing no one is safe not even the people who think they control him harry nodded ill be watching out for him he said and ill find the answers keenan all of them with your help for as long as you can give me that help anyway ive thought about that harry said the other and you know i dont think itll be the end i mean this isnt me what you see here used to be me it was me but so was a baby born in south africa and so was a young man who joined the british army when he was seventeen and so was the head of ebranch for thirteen years theyve all gone now and after my funeral pyre this part will also be gone but me ill still be here somewhere i hope so said harry opening his eyes and standing up and avoiding looking at the room find yourself a hotel then said gormley and get back to me when you can the sooner we get started the better and afterwards i mean when all of this is over and done if it ever is yes well it would be nice if you could look me up some time you see unless im mistaken youre the only one wholl ever be able to and you know youll always be welcome an hour later harry locked himself in his cheap hotel room and got in touch with gormley again as always having already been in contact with him it came very easy the exboss of ebranch was waiting for him had been considering what to tell him and gave the information in order of priority they started with ebranch itself a deeper view of the branch and the people who worked in it and went on to the reasons why at this stage harry should not approach gormleys second in command or in any way attempt entry into the organisation it would be too timeconsuming gormley explained oh there would be benefits of course for one thing youd be funded any necessary expenses would be covered but at the same time theyd want to give you a good close goingover and naturally theyd be eager to test your talent especially now that im gone and when it comes out what someone has done to my corpse you think id be suspect what a necroscope of course youd be suspect i do have a file on you true but its pretty sketchy and obviously incomplete and actually im the only one who could have vouched for you so you see by the time our side had cleared you the other side would have raced ahead time is of the essence harry and not to be wasted so what i propose is this you wont attempt to join ebranch right now but work on your own after all the only ones who know anything at all about you at this time are dragosani and batu the trouble with that of course is that dragosani knows everything about you for he stole it directly from me what we must ask ourselves is this why did borowitz send these two here why now whats brewing or is he just stretching his tentacles a bit oh hes had agents here before certainly but they were only intelligence gatherers they were enemy and they sought information but they werent killers so what has happened that borowitz has decided to turn a cold esp war into a hot one harry told him about shukshin gave him a brief overview of things as he saw and understood them gormleys thoughts were wry indeed when he answered so youve been working for us for some time it appears what a pity i didnt know all of this that time i came to see you we could have done the job that much more quickly shukshin might have been import ant to you harry but in reality he was very small fry we might even have been able to use him i wanted him for myself said harry viciously i wanted him used up anyway i didnt know there was any connection i only found that out after i killed him but thats done with and now we have to get on soyou want me to work on my own but theres the rub see i dont have the foggiest idea of how to be an agent i know what i want to do i have to kill dragosani batu borowitz that is my priority but i cant even begin to think how to go about it gormley seemed to understand his problem thats the difference between espionage and espionage harry we all understand the first all the cloakanddaggery the thudandblundering the dtb or dirty tricks brigade its all old hat but none of us really knows a lot about the second you do what your talent tells you to do you find the best possible ways to use it thats all any of us can do for some of us its easy we dont have sufficient talent to worry about we cant expand it myself for example i can spot another esper a mile away but thats it end of story in your case however harry began to grow frustrated his task seemed huge impossible he was one man one mind one barely mature talent what could he do gormley picked him up on that you werent listening harry i said you have to find the best way to use your talent until now you havent been doing that lets face it what have you achieved ive talked to the dead harry snapped thats it its what i do im a necroscope gormley was patient youve scratched the surface harry and thats all look youve written the stories a dead man couldnt finish youve used the formulae that a mathematician never had time to develop in life dead men have taught you how to drive how to speak russian and german theyve improved your swimming and your fighting and one or two other things but what do you personally reckon all of this amounts to nothing harry answered after only a moments thought right nothing because youve been talking to the wrong people youve been letting your talent guide you instead of you guiding your talent now i know these are probably bad examples but youre like a hypnotist who can only hypnotise himself or a clairvoyant who forecasts his own death for tomorrow you have a groundbreaking talent but youre not breaking any ground the problem is that youre entirely selftaught so in a way youre ignorant like a heathen at a banquet stuffing yourself full of everything and savouring none of it and not recognising the good stuff because of the way its dressed up but if im right you had the answer at your fingertips way back when you were a kid except your kids mind failed to see the possibilities but youre a man now and the possibilities should be starting to make themselves obvious not obvious to me but to you after all its your talent you have to learn how best to use it thats all what gormley said made sense and harry knew it but where do i start he was desperate i have what might just be a clue for you gormley was careful not to be too optimistic the result of an esp game i used to play with alec kyle my second in command i didnt mention it before because there might not be anything in it but if we have to have a starting point go on said harry and with his mind gormley drew him this mental picture what the hells that harry was nonplussed its a mobius strip said gormley named after its inventor august ferdinand mobius a german mathematician just take a thin strip of paper give it a halftwist and join up the ends it reduces a twodimensional surface to only one it has many implications im told but i wouldnt know for im not a mathematician harry was still baffled not by the principle but by its application and this is supposed to have something to do with me with your future your immediate future possibly gormley was deliberately vague i told you there mightnt be anything in it anyway let me tell you what happened he told harry about his and kyles wordassociation game so i started off with your name harry keogh and kyle came back with mobius i said maths and he answered spacetime spacetime harry was at once interested now that might well fit in with this mobius strip thing it seems to me that the strip is only a diagram of warped space and space and time are inextricably linked oh said gormley and harry pictured his surprised expression and is that an original thought harry or do you haveoutside help this gave harry an idea wait he said i dont know your mobius but i do know someone else he got in touch with james gordon hannant in the cemetery in harden showed him the strip sorry cant help you harry said hannant his thoughts clipped and precise as ever ive gone in an entirely different direction i was never into curves anyway by that i mean that my maths was is all very practical different but practical but of course you know that if it can be done on paper i can probably do it im more visual if you like than mobius a lot of his stuff was in the mind abstract theoretical now if only he and einstein could have got together then we really might have seen something but i have to know about this harry was desperate cant you suggest anything hannant sensed harrys urgency raised a mental eyebrow in that emotionless calculating fashion of his he said but isnt the answer obvious harry why dont you ask him mobius himself after all youre the only one who can suddenly excited harry crossed back to gormley well he told him at least i have a place to start now what else came out of this game of yours with alec kyle after he came up with spacetime i tried him with necroscope said gormley he immediately came back with necromancer harry was silent for a moment then said so it looks like he was reading your future as well as mine i suppose so gormley answered but then he said something thats got me stumped even now i mean even assuming that all weve just mentioned is somehow connected what on earth am i supposed to make of vampire eh cold fingers crept up harrys spine what indeed finally he said keenan can we stop there ill get back to you as soon as possible but right now there are one or two things i have to do i want to give my wife a call find a reference library check some things out and i want to go and see mobius so ill probably be booking a flight to germany also im hungry andi want to think about things alone i mean i understand harry and ill be ready when you want to start again but by all means see to your own needs first lets face it they have to be greater than mine so go ahead son you see to the living the dead have plenty of time also harry told him theres someone else i want to speak to but thats my secret for now gormley was suddenly worried for him dont do anything rash harry i mean you said i should go it alone do it my way harry reminded him he sensed gormleys nod of acquiescence thats right son lets just hope you do it right thats all which was one sentiment harry could only agree with late that same evening at the russian embassy dragosani and batu had finished their packing and were looking forward to their morning flight out dragosani had not yet started to commit his knowledge to paper this was the last place for that sort of undertaking one might as well write a letter direct to yuri andropov himself the two russian agents had rooms with a linking door and only one telephone which was situated in batus apartment the necromancer had just stretched himself out on his bed lost in his own strange dark thoughts when he heard the phone ring in batus room a moment later and the squat little mongol knocked on the joining door its for you his muffled voice came through the stained dingy oak panels the switchboard something about a call from outside dragosani got up went through into batus room sitting on the bed batu grinned at him ho comrade and do you have friends here in london someone seems to know you dragosani scowled at him snatched up the telephone switchboard this is dragosani whats all this about a call for you from outside comrade came the answer in a cold nasal female voice i doubt it youve made a mistake im not known here he says youll want to speak to him said the operator his name is harry keogh keogh dragosani looked at batu raised an eyebrow ah yes yes i do know of him put him through very well remember comrade speech is insecure there came a click and a buzzing then dragosani is that you the voice was young but strangely hard it didnt quite fit the gaunt almost vacant face that dragosani had seen staring at him from the frozen river bank in scotland this is dragosani yes what do you want harry keogh i want you necromancer said the cold hard voice i want you and im going to get you dragosanis lips drew back from his needle teeth in a silent snarl this one was clever daring brash dangerous i dont know who you are he hissed but youre obviously a madman explain yourself or get off the phone the explanations simple comrade the voice had grown harder still i know what you did to sir keenan gormley he was my friend an eye for an eye dragosani and a tooth for a tooth thats my way as youve already seen youre a dead man oh dragosani laughed sardonically im a dead man am i and you too have ways with the dead dont you harry what you saw at shukshins was nothing comrade said the icy voice you dont know all of it not even gormley knew all of it bluff harry said dragosani ive seen what you can do and it doesnt frighten me death is my friend he tells me everything thats good said the voice for youll be speaking to him again soon but face to face so you know what i can do do you well think about this next time ill be doing it to you a challenge harry dragosanis voice was dangerously low full of menace a challenge the other agreed and the winner takes all dragosanis wallach blood was up he was eager now but where im already beyond your reach and tomorrow therell be half a world between oh i know youre running now said the other contemptuously but ill find you and soon you and batu and borowitz again dragosanis lips drew back in a hiss perhaps we should meet harry but where how youll know when its time said the voice and know this too it will be worse for you than it was for gormley suddenly the ice in keoghs voice seemed to fill dragosanis veins he shook himself pulled himself together said very well harry keogh whenever and wherever ill be waiting for you and the winner takes all said the voice a second time there came a faint click and the dead line began its intermittent staccato purring for long moments dragosani stared at the receiver in his hand then hurled it down into its cradle oh i surely will he rasped then be sure ill take everything harry keogh chapter fourteen back at the chateau bronnitsy in the middle of the following afternoon dragosani found borowitz absent his secretary told him that natasha borowitz had died just two days ago gregor borowitz was in mourning at their dacha keeping her company for a day or two he did not wish to be disturbed dragosani phoned him anyway ah boris the old mans voice was soft for once empty so youre back gregor im sorry said dragosani observing a ritual he didnt really understand but i thought youd like to know i got what you wanted more than you wanted shukshin is dead gormley too and i know everything good said the other without emotion but dont talk to me now of death boris not now i shall be here for another week after thatit will be a while before im up to much i loved this argumentative tough old bitch she had a tumour they say in her head suddenly it grew too big very peaceful at the end i miss her a lot she never knew what a secret was that was nice im sorry dragosani said again at that borowitz seemed to snap out of it so take a break he said get it all down on paper report to me in a week ten days and well done dragosanis hand tightened on the telephone a break would be very welcome he said i may use it to look up an old friend of mine gregor can i take max batu with me he too has done his work well yes yes only dont bother me any more now goodbye dragosani and that was that dragosani didnt like batu but he did have plans for him anyway the man made a decent travelling companion he said very little kept himself more or less to himself and his needs were few he did have a passion for slivovitz but that didnt present a problem the little mongol could drink the stuff until it came out of his ears and still he would appear sober appearance was all that mattered it was the middle of the russian winter and so they went by train a much interrupted journey which didnt see them into galatz until a day and a half later there dragosani hired a car with snow chains which gave him back something of the independence he so relished eventually on the evening of that second day in the rooms which dragosani found for them in a tiny village near valeni finally the necromancer grew bored with batus silence and asked him max dont you wonder what were doing here arent you interested to find out why i brought you along no not really answered the moonfaced mongol ill find out when youre ready i suppose actually it makes no difference i think i quite like travelling perhaps the comrade general will find more work for me in strange parts dragosani thought no max therell be no more work for you except through me but out loud he said only perhaps night had fallen by the time they had eaten and that was when dragosani gave batu the first hint of what was to come its a fine night tonight max he said bright starlight and not a cloud in sight thats good for were going for a drive theres someone i want to talk to on their way to the cruciform hills they passed a field where sheep huddled together in a corner where straw had been put out for them there was a thin layer of snow but the temperature was at a reasonable level dragosani stopped the car my friend will be thirsty he explained but hes not much on slivovitz still i think its only fair we should take him something to drink they got out of the car and dragosani went into the field scattering the sheep that one max he said as one of the animals strayed close to the mongol where he leaned on the fence dont kill it merely stun it if you can max could he crouched his face contorting where he directed his gaze through the bars of the fence dragosani averted his face as the sheep a fine ewe gave a shrill cry of terror he looked back in time to see the animal bound as if shot and collapse in a shuddering heap of dense wool together they bundled the animal into the boot and went on their way after a little while batu said your friend must have the strangest appetite comrade he does max he does and then dragosani told the other something of what he could expect batu thought about it for some minutes before he spoke again comrade dragosani i know you are a strange man indeed we are both strange men but now i am tempted to believe you must be mad dragosani bayed like a hound finally brought his booming laughter under control you mean you dont believe in vampires max oh indeed i do said the other if you say so i dont mean that youre mad to believe but you are certainly mad to want to dig the thing up we shall see what we shall see dragosani growled more soberly now theres just one thing max what ever you hear or see no matter what may happen you are not to interfere i dont want him to know youre even here not yet anyway do you understand what im saying youre to stay out of it youre to be so still and quiet that even i forget youre there as you will the other shrugged but you say he reads your mind perhaps he already knows im with you no said dragosani for i can sense when hes trying to get at me and i know how to shut him out anyway hell be very weak by now and not up to fighting with me not even mentally no thibor ferenczy has no idea that im here max and hell be so delighted when i speak to him that he wont think to look for treachery if you say so and batu shrugged again now said dragosani you have said i must be mad far from it max but you see this vampire has secrets that only the undead know they are secrets i want and one way or the other i intend to get them especially now that theres this harry keogh to deal with so far thibor has frustrated me but not this time and if i have to raise him up to get at these secretsthen so be it and do you know how to raise him up i mean not yet no but hell tell me max be sure of that they were there dragosani parked the car off the road under the cover of overhanging trees and in the cold bright light of the stars they trudged slowly up the overgrown fire break together snaring the burden of the twitching sheep between them approaching the secret glade dragosani took the animal on his shoulder and whispered now max youre to stay here you may follow a little closer if you wish and watch by all means but remember keep out of it the other nodded came a few paces closer huddled down and wrapped his overcoat tightly about himself and alone dragosani went on under the trees and up to the tomb of the thing in the ground he paused at the rim of the circle but farther out than when last hed visited how now old dragon he softly said letting the trembling halfdead ewe thump to the hard ground at his feet how now thibor ferenczy you who have made a vampire of me he spoke softly so that max batu could not hear for as always he found it easier to speak out loud than merely think his conversation at the vampire ahhhh came the mental hiss drawn out and sighing like the waking breath of one roused from deepest dreams and is it you dragosani ho and so youve guessed have you it didnt take much guesswork thibor it has been only a matter of months but im a changed man indeed not entirely a man but no rage dragosani no fury why it seems to me that this time you come almost humbly why is that i wonder oh you know why old dragon i want rid of this thing ah no unfortunately not that is quite impossible you and he are one now dragosani and did i not call you my son right from the very beginning it is only fitting i think that my real son now grows within you and he laughed in dragosanis mind dragosani couldnt afford the luxury of anger not yet son he pressed this thing you put in me son another lie old devil who was it told me that your sort have no sex i think you never listen dragosani the vampire sighed you his host have determined his sex as he grows and becomes more properly part of you so you become more like him in the end it is one creature one being but with his mind with your mind but subtly altered your mind and your body too but both changed a little your appetites will besharper your needsdifferent listen as a man your lusts passions and rages were limited by a mans strength a mans capabilities but as one of the wamphyriwhat end would it serve to have that great engine in you with nothing to drive but a bundle of soft flesh and brittle bones what a tiger with the heart of a mouse which was more or less what dragosani had expected from the monster but before coming to a final perhaps irrevocable decision he tried one last time made one last threat then i shall go away and give myself into the hands of physicians theyre a different breed to the doctors you knew in your day thibor and i shall tell them a vampire is in me theyll examine discover cut the thing out they have tools you wouldnt dream of when they have it theyll cut it open study it discover its nature and theyll want to know how and why i shall tell them about the wamphyri oh theyll laugh measure me up for a straitjacket but they wont be able to explain it away and so i shall bring them here show them you it will be the end of you of your son of an entire legend and wherever the wamphyri are men will seek them out and destroy them well said dragosani thibor was dryly sardonic bravo dragosani waited and after a moment is that all you have to say it is i dont converse with fools explain yourself now the voice in his mind grew extremely cold and angry a controlled anger now but real and frightening for all that you are a vain and egotistical and stupid man boris dragosani said thibor ferenczy always it is tell me this and show me that and explain i was a power in the land for centuries before you were even spawned and even that would not have happened but for me and here i must lie and let myself be used well all that is at an end very well i will explain myself as you demand but for the very last time for after thatthen it will be time for proper discussion and proper bargaining im tired of lying here inert dragosani as you well know and you have the power to get me up out of here that is the only reason ive been patient with you at all but now my patience is no more first let us deal with your assessment of your situation you say that you will give yourself into the hands of physicians well by now certainly the vampire will be discernible in you it is there physically and tangibly a real organism existing with you in a son of symbiosis a word you taught me dragosani but cut it out exorcise it skilled your doctors may well be but not that skilled can they cut it from the individual whorls of your brain from the fluids of your spine from your tripes your heart itself can they wrest it from your very blood even if you were fool enough to let them try the vampire would kill you first it would eat through your spine leak poison into your brain surely by now you have come to understand something of our tenacity or did you perhaps think that survival was a purely human trait survival hah you do not know the meaning of the word dragosani was silent we made promises you and i the thing in the ground finally continued i have kept my part of the bargain now then what of yours is it not time i was paid dragosani bargain dragosani was taken aback are you joking what bargain have you forgotten you wanted the secrets of the wamphyri very well they are yours for now you are a wamphyri as he grows within you so the knowledge will come he has arts which you will learn together what dragosani was outraged my impregnation by a vampire with a vampire was your part of the bargain what the hell was that for a bargain i wanted knowledge wanted it now thibor for myself not as the black rotten fruit of some unnatural unwanted liaison with a damned parasite thing you dare spurn my egg for each wamphyri life there is but one spawning one new life to move on down through the centuries and i gave mine to you dont act the proud father with me thibor ferenczy dragosani raged dont even try and make out ive hurt your pride i want rid of this bastard thing in me do you tell me you care for it but i know you vampires hate one another even worse than men hate you the thing in the ground knew that dragosani had seen through him proper discussion proper bargaining he said coldly the hell with bargaining i want rid of it dragosani snarled tell me howand then ill raise you up for long moments there was silence then you cannot do it your doctors cannot do it only i can abort what i put there then do it what while i lie here in the ground impossible raise me upand it shall be done now it was dragosanis turn to ponder the vampires proposition or at least to pretend to ponder it and finally very well how do i go about it thibor was eager now first do you do this of your own free will you know i do not dragosani was scornful i do it to be free of the hag in me but of your own free will thibor insisted yes damn you good first there are chains here in the earth they were used to bind me but have long since worked loose of wasted tissues you see dragosani there are chemical ingredients which the wamphyri find intolerable silver and iron in the correct proportions paralyse us even though much of the iron has rusted away its essence remains in the ground and the silver is here too first then you must dig out these silver chains but i havent the tools you have your hands you wish me to grub in the dirt with my hands how deep not deep at all but shallow through all the long centuries ive worked these silver chains to the surface hoping someone would find them and take them for treasure is silver precious still dragosani more than ever then take it with my blessing come dig but how long will it take the entire process i mean and what does it involve we start it tonight said the vampire and tomorrow we finish it i cant actually bring you up out of the ground until tomorrow dragosani tried not to show too much relief not until then no i am too weak dragosani but i note youve brought me a gift that is very good i shall derive a little strength from your offeringand after you have taken away the chains very well said the necromancer where do i dig come closer my son come to the very centre of this place there there now you can dig the flesh crept on dragosanis back as he got down on hands and knees and tore at the dirt and leafmould with his fingers cold sweat started to his brow but not from his effort as he remembered the last time he was here and what had happened then the vampire sensed his apprehension and chuckled darkly in his mind oh and do you fear me dragosani for all your bluff and bluster what a brave young blood like you and old thibor ferenczy just a poor undead thing in the ground bah shame on you my son dragosani had scraped most of the surface soil and debris to one side and was now five or six inches deep he had reached the harder more solidly frozen earth of the grave itself but as he drove his fingers yet again into that strangely fertile soil so they contacted something hard something that clinked dully he worked harder then and the first links he uncovered were of solid silver and massive the links were at least two inches long and forged of silver rods at least half an inch thick howhow much of this stuff is there he gasped enough to keep me down dragosani came the answer until now the vampires words simple and spontaneous as they were nevertheless contained a menacing something which set the short hairs at the back of dragosanis neck standing erect in a moment thibors mental voice had bubbled like boiling glue filled with all the evil of the pit itself dragosani was a necromancer he knew himself for a monster but next to the old devil in the ground he felt innocent as a babe he caught hold of a great rope of silver links stood up used a strength which astonished even him to rip up the chains from the earth they came up cracking open the ground erupting in scabs of clotted soil and crusts of dusty smoking leafmould even shaking the roots of the trees which had grown up through all the long years to cover this place and keep it secret and dragging the treasure in three trips to the outer rim of the circle of roots and shattered flags and torn earth dragosani calculated that there must be at least five or six hundred pounds of the stuff in the western world he would be a rich man but in moscowto even try to profit from it would be worth ten years in the siberian salt mines at least no such thing as treasure trove in the ussr only theft on the other hand what good was treasure to him no good at all except as a means to an end he couldnt enjoy the fruits of his labours like other men but one day soon he would be able to enjoy when other men all other men crawled to his feet and world leaders came to do obeisance in the courts of the great wallachian hyperstate these were thoughts dragosani kept hidden as he hauled the last of the chains aside and stood panting staring in darkness at the scarred riven earth of this secret place and he gave a wry snort of selfderision as he remembered a time when it would have been hard to see anything at all in this dark place even with his cats eyes but now why it was like daylight yet another proof that a vampire lived in him battening on his body as it would one day attempt to batten on his mind and as for thibors promise to abort the thing dragosani knew that wasnt worth a handful of tombdirt well if he must live with the leech so be it but he would be master and not the beast within somehow somewhere he would find a way and these thoughts too he kept to himself at last he was done and the silver chains lay in a great circle all about the tornup area there he told the thing in the ground all finished nothing to keep you down now thibor ferenczy youve done well dragosani im well pleased but now i must feed and then i must rest it is no easy thing to return from the grave so now your offering if you please which i trust youll leave me in peace to enjoy i shall require the same again tomorrow night before i can stand with you under the stars then and only then will you too be free dragosani kicked the ewe which at once started to life he trapped the shivering animal between his legs as it lurched to its feet yanked back its head the glittering blade he wielded passed through the front part of its neck effortlessly coming away clean before the first spurt of blood gushed out on to the dark unhallowed ground then he picked the shuddering animal up as a man might pick up a cat by scruff of neck and rump and spun with it tossing it centrally into the circle it thudded down and again came to its feet and only then seemed to realise that it was hurt and that this was the end awash in blood the beast fell on its side kicking spastically in its own reek as the rest of its life pumped out of it dragosani stepped back then and farther yet and in his mind he heard the vampires great deep sigh of pleasure of monstrous craving ahhhh not greatly to my taste dragosani but satisfying beyond a doubt i owe you thanks my son but they can wait until tomorrow now begone for im tired and hungry and loneliness is a drug whose addiction ive not yet broken dragosani needed no second bidding he backed away from the broken tomb from the twitching huddled shape at the centre of the circle but even as he went his eyes were on the alert for some sign of the vampires new freedom its mobility oh yes for thibor ferenczy was mobile now the necromancer could feel him underfoot could sense him stretching himself could almost hear the creak of leathery muscles and the groan of old bones as they soaked in blood and something of their brittleness went out of them then the ewes carcass sagged slumped lower closer to the bloodsoaked earth it was as if some seismic suction had pulled at the animal as if the earth itself were a mouth that sucked something moved beneath the slaughtered beast but dragosani could make out nothing for certain he backed away backed up against a tree and quickly groped his way around it putting the rough bole between himself and what was happening but still he kept his eyes riveted on the ewes carcass the animal was large and heavy with wool but even as dragosani watched so it seemed its bulk shrank down a little caved in upon itself diminished the necromancer sent out a mental probe towards the thing in the ground but such was the lusting bestiality it was met with that he at once withdrew it and still the ewe continued to shrink shrivel dwindle away and as the ewe was devoured so the cold ground about began to smoke a stinking mist rising and rapidly thickening obscuring the rest of the act it was as if the earth sweated or as if something down there breathed which had not breathed for a long long time that was enough dragosani turned away and quickly joined max batu with a finger to his lips he beckoned the other to follow and quickly they descended the firebreak together and made their way back to the car earlier that same day and some seven hundred miles away harry keogh decided standing at the grave of august ferdinand mobius that it had been a very bad day for the science of numbers a very bad day indeed or more specifically a bad day for topology and not forgetting astronomy the day in question was the date of mobius death of course there had been students here earlier east german mainly but much like students anywhere else in the world longhaired and tattily attired but properly respectful harry had thought and so they should be he too felt respectful even awed that he stood in the presence of such a man in any case not wanting to appear too strange harry had waited until he was alone also he had needed to think how best to approach mobius this was no ordinary figure lying here but a thinker whod helped guide science along many of the right paths finally harry had settled for a direct approach seating himself he let his thoughts reach out and touch those of the dead man a calm came over harry then his eyes took on their strange glassy look for all that it was bitterly cold a fine patina of sweat gleamed on his brow and slowly he grew aware that indeed mobius or what remained of him was here and active formulae tables of figures astronomical distances and noneuclidean riemannian configurations beat against harrys awareness like the pulses of mighty living computers butall of this in one mind a mind which processed all of these thoughts very nearly simultaneously and then it dawned on harry that mobius was working on something flipping through the pages of memory and learning as he sought to tie together the elements of a puzzle too complex for harrys or for any merely living mans comprehension all very well but it might go on for days and harry simply didnt have the time sir excuse me sir my name is harry keogh ive come a long way to see you the phantasmal flow of figures and formulae stopped at once like a computer switched off eh what who harry keogh sir im an englishman there was a slight pause before the other snapped english i dont care if youre an arab ill tell you what you are youre a nuisance now what is this eh whats it all about im quite unused to this sort of thing im a necroscope harry explained as best he could i can talk to the dead dead talk to the dead hmm i considered that yes and long ago came to the conclusion that i was so obviously you can well it comes to us all death i mean indeed it has its advantages privacy for one or so i thought until now a necroscope you say a new science harry had to smile i suppose you could call it that except i seem to be its one practitioner spiritualists arent quite the same thing ill say theyre not fraudulent bunch at best well then how can i help you harry keogh i mean i suppose youve a reason for disturbing me a good reason that is the best in the world said harry the fact is im tracking down a fiend a murderer i know who he is but i dont know how to bring him to justice all i have is a clue as to how i might set about it and thats where you come in tracking down a murderer a talent like yours and you use it to track down murderers boy you should be out talking to euclid aristotle pythagorus no cancel that last youd get nothing from him him and his damned secretive pythagorean brotherhood its a wonder he even passed on his theorem anyway what is this clue of yours harry showed him a mental projection of the mobius strip its this he said its what ties the futures of my quarry and myself together now the other was interested topology in the time dimension that leads to all sorts of interesting questions are you talking about your probable futures or your actual futures have you spoken to gauss hes the one for probability and topology for that matter gauss was a master when i was a mere student albeit a brilliant student actual said harry our actual futures but that is to presuppose that you know something of the future in the first place and is precognition another talent of yours harry not mine no but i do have friends who occasionally catch glimpses of the future just as surely as i twaddle mobius cut him off zollnerists all talk to the dead harry finished it anyway the other was silent for a moment or two then tm probably a foolbut i think i believe you at least i believe you believe and that you have been misled but for the life of me i cant see how my believing in you will help you in your quest neither can i said harry dejectedly exceptwhat about the mobius strip i mean its all i have to go on cant you at least explain it to me after all who would know more about it than you you invented it no they merely stamped my name on it invented it ridiculous i noticed it thats all as for explaining it once there was a time when that would be the very simplest thing now however harry waited what year is this the abrupt change of subject bewildered harry nine teen seventyseven he answered really as long as that well well and so you see for yourself harry that ive been lying here for more than a hundred years but do you think ive been idle not a bit of it numbers my boy the ultimate answer to all the riddles of the universe space and its curvature and qualities and properties properties still largely unimagined i imagine in the world of the living except i dont have to imagine for i know but explain it are you a mathematician harry i know a little astronomy reluctantly harry shook his head what is your understanding of science of science that is your understanding of the physical the material and the conjectural universe again harry shook his head can you understand any ofthis and a stream of symbols and equations and calculi flashed up on the screen of harrys mind each item in its turn more complex than the last some of it he recognised from talks with james gordon hannant some he knew through intuition but most of it was completely alien its allpretty difficult he finally said hmm but on the other handyou do have intuition yes and i believe its strong in you i suppose i could always teach you harry teach me mathematics something you worked on all your life and for a hundred years since that life ended now whos talking twaddle it would take me at least as long as it has taken you incidentally whats a zollnerist j k f zollner was a mathematician and astronomer god help us who outlived me he was also a crank and a spiritualist to him numbers were magickal did i call you a zollnerist unpardonable you must forgive me actually he wasnt far wrong his topology was wrong thats all he tried to impose the unphysical or mental universe on the physical one and that doesnt work spacetime is a constant fixed and immutable as pi that doesnt leave much room for metaphysics said harry certain by now that hed come to the wrong place no room at all mobius agreed telepathy twaddle whats this then what am i doing right now mobius was a little taken aback but then necroscopy or so im given to believe thats picking nits said harry what about clairvoyancy or farsightedness the ability to view events at a great distance through the medium of the mind alone in the physical world impossible you would perpetuate zollners errors but i know these things can be done harry contradicted i know where there are people who do them not all the time never easily or with any great accuracy but occasionally it is a new science and it requires intuition after another pause mobius said again im tempted to believe you what point would there be in your lying to me mans knowledge of all things increases all the time and after all i can do it but then im not of the physical world not any longer harrys head whirled you can do it are you telling me that you can scry out distant events i see them yes said mobius but not through any crystal ball nor are they strictly distant distance is relative i go there i go where the events i wish to watch are scheduled to occur butwhere do you go how how is the difficult bit said mobius where is far easier harry in life i wasnt only a mathematician but also an astronomer after i died naturally i was restricted to maths but astronomy was in me it was part of me it would not let me be and everything comes to those who wait as time passed i began to feel the stars shining down on me through the day as well as the night i became aware of their weight their mass if you like their great distance the distances between them soon i knew far more about them than ever i had known in life and then i determined to go and see them for myself when you came to me i was calculating the magnitude of a nova soon to occur in andromeda and i shall be there to see it happen why not i am unbodied the laws of the physical universe no longer apply but youve just denied the metaphysical harry pro tested and now youre saying you can teleport to the stars teleportation no for nothing physical is moved as i keep telling you harry i am not a physical thing there may well be a socalled metaphysical universe but neither the real nor the unreal may impose itself upon the other or so you believed until you met me said harry his strange eyes opening wider his voice full of a new awe for suddenly a bright star was shining in harrys mind but shining brighter than any nova in the mind of mobius what whats that are you saying harry became relentless that there is no meeting point between the physical and the metaphysical is that your argument exactly and yet i am physical and you are purely mental and we have met he sensed the others gape astonishing it seems ive overlooked the obvious harry pressed his advantage you use the strip dont you to go out amongst the stars the strip i use a variant of it yes but and you called me a zollnerist for a moment mobius was speechless then it seems my argumentsno longer apply you do teleport said harry you teleport pure mind youre a scryer thats your talent sir in a way it always was even in life you couldsee things that others were blind to the strip is a perfect example well scrying in itself would be a marvellous weapon but i want to take it a step farther i want to impose i mean rigidly impose the physical me on the metaphysical universe please harry not so fast mobius protested i need to sir you offered to teach me harry couldnt be restrained well i accept but only teach me whats absolutely necessary let my instinct my intuition do the rest my minds a blackboard and youve got the chalk right there in your hand so go ahead teach me teach me how to ride your mobius strip it was night again and dragosani had climbed back into the cruciform hills across his back he carried a second ewe this one stunned with a large stone the day had been a busy one but its proceeds must surely show a profit max batu had had the chance to display yet again the morbid power of his evil eye this time to one ladislau giresci eventually the old man would be found in his lonely house victim of a heart attack of course but maxs work had not stopped there for only an hour or so ago dragosani had sent the mongolian out upon another crucial mission which meant that the necromancer was now alone or to all intents and purposes alone as he approached the tomb of the vampire and sent his words and thoughts before him to penetrate the cold gloom beneath dark and stirless trees thibor are you sleeping im here as directed the stars are bright and the night chill and the moon is creeping on the hills this is the hour thibor for both of us and after a moment ahhhhdragosaaaniiti sleeping i suppose i was but i have slept a grand sleep dragosani the sleep of the undead and i dreamed a grand dream of conquest and of empire and for once my hard bed was soft as the breasts of a lover and these old old bones were not weighed down but buoyant as the step of a lad when he meets his lass a grand dream aye butalas only a dream for all that dragosani senseddespondency alarmed for his plan he asked is anything wrong on the contrary all goes well my son except i fear it may take a little longer than i thought i took strength from your offering of yestereve indeed i did and i fancy ive even put on a little flesh but still the ground is hard and these old sinews of mine stiff from the salts of the earth and then more eagerly but did you remember dragosani and bring me another small tribute not too small i hope something perhaps to compare with my last repast for answer the necromancer came to a halt on the rim of the circle tossed down from his shoulder to the ground at his feet the inert mass of the ewe in a grunting heap i didnt forget he said but come on old dragon tell me what you mean why will it take longer than you thought dragosanis disappointment was real his plan depended upon raising the vampire up tonight have you no understanding dragosani came thibors answer among the men who followed me when i was a warrior many were so injured in battle that they were carried to their beds some would recover but after months of lying still often they were wasted and full of aches and torments picture me then after five hundred years butwe shall see what we shall see even as we talk i grow more eager to be risen up and so perhaps after a little more refreshment dragosani wryly nodded his understanding drew out a small glinting sickle of honed brightness from its sheath in his pocket and stooped towards the ewe hold said the vampire as you surmise dragosani this may well be the hour for both of us an hour of great moment for both of us for my own part i think we should treat it with the respect it warrants the necromancer frowned cocked his head on one side how do you mean so far my son i think you would agree that i have not stood on ceremony for all that i have had my food hurled at me as if i were some rooting pig i have not complained but i would have you know dragosani that i too have supped at table indeed ive dined in the courts of princes aye and will again with you perhaps seated upon my right hand may i not therefore expect treatment more nearly gracious or must i always remember you as a man who poured my food over me like slops into a pigsty a bit late for niceties isnt it thibor dragosani wondered what the vampire was up to what exactly do you want thibor was quick to note his apprehension what and do you still distrust me well and i suppose you have your reasons survival was mine but come have we not agreed that when im up and about then that ill drive out the seed of my own flesh from your body and in that moment will you not be entirely in my hands it seems a foolish thing dragosani that you would put your faith in me walking abroad but not in my grave surely if i were so inclined id be capable of more harm to you up than down also if it were my plan to harm you who then would be my guide in this new world im about to enter you shall instruct me dragosani and i you you still havent said what you want the vampire sighed dragosani i am forced to admit a small personal flaw i have in the past accused you of a certain vanity yet now i tell you that i too am vain aye and i would celebrate my rebirth in a manner more fitting therefore bring unto me the ewe my son and lay it down before me this one last time let it be by way of a genuine tribute even as a ritual sacrifice to one who is mighty and not merely swill and roughage for the fattening of swine let me eat as from a platter dragosani and not out of a trough old bastard thought dragosani while continuing to keep his thoughts secret so he was to be the vampires serf was he just another poor gypsy dolt to be cuffed about and follow at heel like a whining dog ah but ive news for you my old my too old friend and dragosani hugged his secret thoughts tightly to himself enjoy this thibor ferenczy for its the very last time a man will fetch and carry for the likes of you and out loud he said you want me to bring you the beast as if it were an offering is it too much to ask the necromancer shrugged right now nothing was too much to ask he would be doing a little asking himself shortly he put away his razoredged knife and took up the sheep he carried it to the centre of the circle crouched down and placed it where last nights offering had lain then again he took out his sickle blade until now the glade had been quiet still as the tomb it was but now dragosani sensed a gathering it was as if muscles were suddenly bunched the silent creep of a cats paws as it closes on a mouse the forming of saliva on a chameleons tongue before it strikes quickly thrilling with horror of the unknown even a monster such as dragosani filled with horror he drew back the stunned beasts head and made its throat taut and no need for that my son said thibor ferenczy dragosani would have leapt away for in that selfsame moment he knew but knew too late that the thing in the ground had had its fill of piglets and sheep not one eighth of an inch had he straightened from his crouch before that phallic tentacle burst from the ground beneath him shearing through his clothing like a knife and up into him and how he would have leapt then to be free of it even if the tearing should kill him he would have leapt but he couldnt growing barbs within him the pseudopod stretched itself through all the lower conduits of his body and filled him and drew him down like a fish yanked from water on a hook dragosanis feet flew out from beneath him as he was slammed down against the dark and seething earth and after that there was no longer room even for the thought of flight for that was when the pain the torment the ultimate agony commenced his bowels were melting his entrails were on fire he was seated upright on a fountain of acid and through all the incredible pain thibor ferenczy howled his triumph and taunted dragosani with the truth the real truth the one final question whose answer had eluded the necromancer through all these years why did they hate me my son my own kith and kin as it were why do all vampires hate other vampires why the answer to that is the very simplest thing the blood is the life dragosani oh the blood of swine will suffice if theres nought better to sup and the blood of fowls and sheep better far however the blood of men as youll very soon be obliged to discover for yourself but over and above all other vessels the true nectar of life may only be sipped from the veins of another vampire dragosani burned in a double hell he felt torn apart inside his parasite twin within clove to him in its agony as thibors nightmare appendage fastened upon it and leeched its essence and yet that terrible tentacle did no real harm no damage protoplasmic it moulded itself to organs without crushing them penetrated without puncturing even its barbs caused no injury for they were fashioned to hold without tearing the agony lay in its being there in its contact with raw nerves and muscles and organs in its advance through all the tracts of dragosanis raped physical body it could not hurt more if some insane doctor had dripped an acid solution into an open vein but it would not kill it could kill certainly but not now not this time in his torment dragosani could not know that and through his torment he cried getitdone with damn you damn yourblack heart liar of liars killme thibor do it now put an end to it ii beg you he sat there in the darkness under the trees amidst the shattered flags and the crumbling ruins of the ancient tomb and horror ate at his mind like a rat set loose in his brain and left to eat its way out someone had set a meat mincer in motion inside him and it was reducing his guts to squirming red worms he jerked and threshed fell to one side the agony drove him upright again only to fall the other way and so he twitched and jerked and lolled and screamed and still thibor ferenczy fed strength you gave me dragosani aye strength and bulk in the blood of beasts but the true life is the blood of a fellow creature even the thin immature blood of that child of mine who now gibbers inside you as he grows weak from his loss even as you grow weak from pain but kill him kill you nay nay what and rob myself of a thousand feasts to come we go together into the world dragosani and you in thrall to me until that time when you shall flee by which time youll not need to ask but know why all the wamphyri share a mutual bond of hate the vampire was sated the tentacle slid out of dragosani and down into the earth out of sight its going was if anything even worse than its coming a white hot sword drawn out of him by a careless hand he cried out a shriek that echoed like the cry of a wild thing through the cold cruel cruciform hills and toppled over on his side but hadnt thibor told him that they named the vlad the impaler after him he had and now dragosani could more fully understand just why the necromancer tried to stand and could not his legs were jelly his brain a seething acid soup in its skull bowl he rolled cleared the tainted circle again tried to rise impossible will was not enough he lay still sobbing in the night gathering wits and strength both the vampire had spoken of hate and he had been right it was hate that kept dragosani conscious now hate and only hate his and that of the creature within him both of them had been ravaged finally he propped himself up on his side glared his hate at the black earth which now steamed and smoked as the vapours of hell rose up from it cracks appeared in the subsoil which dragosani had cleared the earth bulged upward began to break open something thrust up from below then that same something sat up and it was something unbelievable dragosanis lips drew back from his teeth in an involuntary snarl of loathing and in terror for this was the thing in the ground this was what he had talked to argued with cursed and profaned time and time again this was thibor ferenczy the undead embodiment of his own batdevildragon banner but worse it was what dragosani had doomed himself one day to become the thick ears of the thing grew close to its head but were pointed and projected slightly higher than the elongated skull giving the appearance of horns its nose was wrinkled and convoluted like that of a great bat and squat to its face its skin was of scale and its eyes were scarlet like a dragons and it wasbig the hands where they now appeared and clawed at the soil at its waist were huge with nails projecting all of an inch beyond the fingers dragosani finally fought back his terror and forced himself to his feet just as the vampire turned its strangely wolfish head to fix him with a monstrous almost startled stare and its eyes opened wide as their scarlet light fell on him where he tottered ii can seeyou said thibor then his risen voice as evil and alien as any of his mental sendings from the tomb but the statement seemed in no way threatening it was more as if the fact of sight and in particular of seeing dragosani in some way brought to the creature a mixed measure of relief and disbelief whichever the necromancer cringed back and down but in that same moment i ho thing from the earth said max batu stepping out from cover thibor ferenczys head shot round on his neck in the direction of the mongols voice seeing batu where he stood his great dogs jaws fell open and he hissed from between teeth like blades of bone which dripped slime and without pause batu took one look at that face then aimed and fired ladislau girescis crossbow the lignum vitae bolt was fiveeighths of an inch thick and steeltipped it sprang from the weapon and plunged at almost pointblank range into and through the vampires heaving chest transfixing him thibor gave a hissing shriek and tried to draw himself back down into the steaming earth but the bolt jammed in the sides of the hole and prevented him tearing his grey flesh he gave a second shriek then a soulwrenching thing to hear and tossed himself to and fro with the bolt still in him cursing and spewing out slime from his chomping grimacing mouth batu loped quickly to dragosanis side supported him handed him a fullsized sickle whose edge gleamed silver from a recent sharpening the necromancer took it shook batu off staggeringly advanced upon the struggling monster trapped halfin halfout of its grave the last time they buried you he gasped they made one big mistake thibor ferenczy and the muscles of is neck and arm bunched as he drew back the sickle they left your fucking head on the monster tugged at the shaft in its chest stared at dragosani with a look beyond his comprehension there was something of fear in it yes but more than this there was that baffled astonishment as if the beast could not take in or understand this sudden reversal wait it croaked as he drew close the cracked bass sound of its voice like so many saplings snapping in an avalanche cant you see its me but dragosani didnt wait he knew who and what the monster was knew also that the only real way he could inherit its knowledge its powers was this way as a necromancer yes and such a wonderful irony in it for thibor himself had given him the gift die you bastard thing he snarled and the sickle became a blur of steel as it sheared the monsters head from its trunk the awful head sprang aloft fell bounced and even rolling it cried fool damned fool before lying still then the scarlet eyes closed the mouth opened one last time and a gob of redtinged filth shot out and a final word the merest whisper fool dragosanis answer was to swing the sickle a second time splitting the head in two parts like some great grey overripe melon inside the skull the brain was a mush with a writhing core in effect two brains one human and shrivelled and the other alien the brain of the vampire without pause without fear knowing for once exactly what he did dragosani stuck his hands deep into the two halves of the skull cavity and let his trembling fingers feel the reeking fluids and pulp all the secrets and the lore of the wamphyri were here here just waiting for him to search them out yes yes even now the brains were rotting falling into the natural decay and corruption of centuriesbut dragosanis necromantic talent was already tracking the undead monsters secrets through the very juices of its crumbling brain grey as stone his eyes standing out obscenely in his head he lifted up the mess to his face but too late before his frantic eyes everything rotted away boiled into smoke trickled in streams of dust through his twitching fingers even the misshapen skull dust in his hands with a cry almost of anguish wildly swinging his arms like a windmill run amok dragosani spun and made a headlong dive for the vampires headless body where it still sat upright in its grave the severed neck was beginning to steam away settling into the scaled chest which itself slumped down into the unseen trunk below and even as the necromancer plunged his hand and arm down into that hole into the rot and the stench so the earth belched up a great mushrooming cloud of poisonous vapour and collapsed in upon the now almost liquid corpse dragosani howled like a banshee and drew out his arm from the quag then crawled away from the shuddering belching hole as the ground quickly settled into quiescence at the edge of the circle he paused head hanging limply shoulders slumped and sobbed his frustration long and rackingly breathless shaken to his roots by all he had seen max batu watched the necromancer a little while longer then slowly came forward he got down on one knee beside dragosani and gripped his shoulder comrade dragosani batus voice was hushed little more than a dry croaking whisper is it over dragosani stopped sobbing he let his head continue to hang down while he considered batus question was it all over it was all over for thibor ferenczy yes but only just beginning for the new vampire the as yet immature creature which even now shared dragosanis body with him they would supply each others needs learn from each other become as one being the question still remained as to whose will would eventually achieve dominance against any ordinary man the vampire must of course be the winner every time but dragosani was not ordinary he had the power in him to accumulate his own lore his own talents and why not perhaps somewhere in his learning in his gathering of secrets and strange new powers he might yet find a way to be rid of the parasite but until then no max batu he said its not over yet not for a while yet then what must i do now the squat little mongol was anxious to be of assistance how can i help what are your needs dragosani continued to stare at the dark earth how could batu help what were the necromancers needs interesting questions pain and frustration died in dragosani there was much to do and time was wasting he had come here to gather new powers to himself in the face of whatever threat was posed by harry keogh and the british ebranch and that was a job he still must do thibors secrets were beyond him now dead and gone forever like the vampire himself but that must not be the end of the matter however weak and battered he felt right now still he knew that he had not been permanently dam aged the pain may well have scarred his mind and soul but those were scars which would heal no he had suffered no real or lasting injury he had merely been depleted depleted yes the thing inside him needed and dragosani knew what it needed he felt batus hand on his shoulder and could almost hear the blood surging in the others veins then dragosani saw the sharp curved surgical tool with which he would have slit the ewes throat it lay there close to his hand silver against the black earth ah well he had intended this eventually it would be so much sooner that was all two things i need from you max dragosani said and looked up max batu gasped aloud and his jaw fell open the necromancers eyes were scarlet as those of the fiend he had just killed the mongol saw them saw something else that glittered silver in the night and sawnothing else ever interval two i have to stop alec kyle told his weird visitor he put down his pencil massaged his cramped wrist the desk was littered with the curled shavings of five pencils all of them whittled away to nothing this was kyles sixth and his arm felt mangled from frantic scribbling a thin sheaf of papers was stacked in front of kyle with pencilled notes and jottings covering each sheet top to bottom and margin to margin when he had started to write all of this down the notes had been fairly detailed within an hour theyd become jottings barely legible scrawl now even kyle himself could scarcely read them and they were reduced to a listing of dates alongside brief headlines now for a moment resting his wrist and mind both kyle glanced at the dates again and shook his head he still believed instinctively knew that all of this was the absolute truth but there was one massively glaring anomaly here an ambiguity he couldnt ignore kyle frowned looked up at the apparition where it floated upright on the other side of the desk blinked his eyes at this shimmering spectre of a man and said theres something i dont quite understand then he laughed and not a little hysterically i mean there are a good many things here which i dont understand but until now ive at least believed them this is harder to believe oh said the apparition kyle nodded todays monday he said sir keenan is to be cremated tomorrow the police have discovered nothing as yet and it seems almost blasphemous to keep his body well lying about in that condition yes the other nodded his agreement well kyle continued the point is i know a lot of what youve told me to be the truth and i suspect that the rest of it is too youve told me things no one else outside myself and sir keenan should ever have known but but but your story kyle suddenly blurted has already outstripped us ive been keeping a record of your timescale and youve just been telling me about the coming wednesday two days from now according to you thibor ferenczy isnt yet dead wont be until wednesday night after a moment the other said i can see how that must appear strange to you yes time is relative alec the same as space indeed the two go hand in hand ill go further than that everything is relative there is a grand scheme to things some of that escaped kyle for the moment he saw only what he wanted to see you can read the future that well his face was a mask of awe and i thought i had a talent but to be able to see the future so clearly is almost unbe and he stopped short and gasped as if things werent incredible enough a new even more incredible thought had crossed his mind perhaps his visitor saw it written in his face at any rate he smiled a smile transparent as smoke from a cigarette a smile that reflected not at all the light from the window but allowed it to pass right through is there something alec he asked wherewhere are you kyle asked i mean where are you the real physical you right now where are you speaking from or rather when are you speaking from time is relative the spectre said again still smiling youre speaking to me from the future arent you kyle breathed it was the only answer it was the only way the spectre could know all of this the only way he could do all of this youll be very useful to me said the other slowly nodding it seems you have a sharp intuitive ability to match your precognition alec kyle or maybe its all part of the same talent but now shall we continue still gaping kyle again took up the pencil i think you better had continue he whispered youd better tell me all of it right to the end chapter fifteen moscow friday evening dragosanis flat on the pushkin road it was growing dark by the time dragosani gratefully let himself into his flat and poured himself a drink the trains had been maddeningly slow on the journey from romania and max batus absence had made the return trip seem that much longer batus absence yes and dragosanis growing feeling of urgency this sensation of being rushed towards some colossal confrontation time was quickly passing and still there remained so much for him to do achingly tired still he couldnt rest some instinct urged him onward warned him against pausing in his set course with a second drink inside him and beginning to feel a little better he telephoned the chateau bronnitsy and checked that borowitz was still in mourning at his dacha at zhukovka then he asked to speak to igor vlady but vlady had already left for home dragosani phoned him there asked if he could come round the other agreed at once vlady lived in his own state flatlet not too far away but dragosani took his car anyway in less than ten minutes he was seated in vladys tiny livingroom toying with a welcoming glass of vodka well comrade vlady finally asked when theyd done with the usual formalities and preliminaries what can i do for you he peered curiously almost speculatively at dragosanis dark glasses and gaunt grey features dragosani nodded as if he silently confirmed something or other and said i can see youve been expecting me yes i thought i might be seeing you vlady carefully answered dragosani decided against beating about the bush if vlady failed to produce the right answers he would simply kill him he probably would anyway eventually very well im here he said now tell me hows it going to be vlady was a small dark man and normally open as a book that was the impression he achieved anyway now he raised an eyebrow put on an expression of mild surprise hows what going to be he asked innocently look lets not fool around said dragosani you probably already know exactly why ive come here thats what youre paid for your ability to see things in advance so ill ask you again how is it going to be vlady drew back scowled with borowitz you mean for starters yes vladys face grew strangely impassive almost cold hell die he said without emotion tomorrow at midday or thereabouts a heart attack except and he paused and frowned except vlady shrugged a heart attack he repeated dragosani nodded sighed relaxed a little yes he said thats how it will be and what about me and you i dont do readings for myself said vlady its tempting of course but far too frustrating to know the future and not be able to change it also its frightening as for youthats a bit odd dragosani didnt like the sound of that he put down his drink and leaned forward whats odd he asked this might be very important to him vlady took up both of their glasses and poured more vodka first lets get something straight you and i he said comrade im not your rival i have no ambitions in respect of ebranch none at all i know borowitz had me in mind for the job along with yourself but im just not interested i think you should know that you mean youll step aside for me tm not stepping aside for anyone the other shook his head i just dont want the job thats all i dont envy any man that job yuri andropov wont rest until hes crushed the lot of us even if it takes the rest of his lifetime frankly i wish to hell i was out of it altogether did you know i was a trained architect dragosani well i am read the future id far prefer to read the plans of great buildings any day why do you tell me this dragosani was curious it has nothing to do with anything yes it has it has something to do with living and i want to live you see dragosani i know that you will have something to do with borowitzs death with his heart attack and if you can tackle him and win which you will then what chance would i have im not brave dragosani and im not stupid ebranch is all yours again dragosani leaned forward his eyes were pricks of red light gleaming through the dark lenses of his spectacles but your job is to tell borowitz this sort of thing igor he rasped especially this sort of thing are you saying you havent told him or does he in fact already know that ill beinvolved vlady shook himself sat up straighter for a moment hed felt almost hypnotised by dragosani the mans gaze was like that of a snake a wolf something not quite human anyway i really dont know why ive told you any of this he finally said i mean for all i know the old warhorse might even have sent you here but wouldnt you know it if he had said dragosani isnt that something your talent would have foreseen i cant see everything vlady snapped dragosani nodded hmm well he didnt send me now tell me truthfully does he know hes going to die tomorrow and if so does he know that ill be involved well im waiting vlady bit his lip shook his head he doesnt know he mumbled why havent you told him two reasons first it wouldnt change anything even if he did know second i hate the old bastard i have a fiancйe and want to be married ive wanted it for ten years but borowitz says no he needs me to keep my wits sharp he doesnt want my talent dulled too much sex might ruin me he says damn the old bastard he rations me with my own fiancйe dragosani sat back and laughed out loud vlady saw the gape of his mouth and the length of his teeth and once more felt that he talked with some strange animal rather than a man oh i can believe that dragosanis laughter finally rumbled into silence yes thats just typical of him well igor he nodded knowingly i think you can now safely go ahead with your wedding arrangements yes just as soon as you like but youll want to keep me in the branch eh vladys tone remained sour of course i will dragosani nodded youre much too valuable to be a simple architect igor vlady and far too talented but the branch that is merely a beginning theres more to life than that after this is over im going on and up and you can come with me vladys response to that was a blank stare suddenly dragosani was sure he was hiding something you were going to tell me what youve read in my future he reminded now that weve dealt with borowitz i think that would be a good idea i think you said there was somethingodd odd yes vlady agreed but of course i could be wrong anyway youll know all about it tomorrow and he gave a nervous twitch at dragosanis startled expression what whats that about tomorrow the necromancer came slowly to his feet uncoiling from his chair have you been wasting my time and confusing me with trivialities when all the time you knew there was something in store for me tomorrow when tomorrow and where tomorrow night at the chateau said vlady some thing big but i dont know what it will be dragosani began to pace the floor searched his own mind for clues kgb is it likely theyll find borowitzs body that fast i doubt it even if they did why should they suspect the branch or me after all it will only have been a heart attack that could happen to anyone or is it someone inside the branch itself maybe you igor having second thoughts about your loyalties will it be sabotage dragosani continued to pace and if so what form of sabotage he angrily shook his head no no i cant see that damn it come on igor you know more than youre saying what is it exactly that youve seen you dont seem to understand vlady shouted man im not superhuman i cant be exact all the time it was true and dragosani knew it vladys voice betrayed his own exasperation he too wished he had an answer sometimes things are very vague like that time when andrei ustinov got his i knew there would be a ruckus that night and warned borowitz about it but i couldnt for the life of me say who or what would be involved its the same this time too therell be big trouble tomorrow and youll be right in the middle of it it will come from outside and it will bebig trouble of that much im certain but thats all not quite all said dragosani ominously i still dont know what you meant by odd why do you avoid the issue will i be in any danger yes said vlady a great deal of danger and not just you but everyone at the chateau damn it man dragosani slammed his fist down on the table you make it sound like well all be dead men vladys face slowly lost some of its dark colour he half turned his face away but dragosani leaned over him clasped his cheeks in the fingers of one great hand drew his averted face and the oshape of his quivering mouth back towards him he looked deep into the others frightened eyes are you quite sure youve told me everything he asked forming his words slowly and very carefully can you not at least try to explain what you meant by your use of the word odd is there a chance perhaps that youve also foreseen my death for tomorrow vlady jerked his face free and pushed back in his chair away from dragosani the white pressure marks of the others fingers faded on his cheeks were replaced by a dark pink flush dragosani was capable of murder beyond a doubt vlady must at least try to satisfy his demands listen he said and ill explain as best i can after thatyou must make what you will of it when i look at a man when i try to see into his future i normally detect a straight blue line extending forward like a line drawn down a sheet of paper from top to bottom call it his line of life if you wish from the length of this line i can work out the length of the mans life from kinks and deviations which occur in it i can determine something of future occurrences and how they will affect him borowitzs line ends tomorrow at the end there is a kink which indicates a physical malfunction his heart attack as to how i know you will be involved it is simply that at the end your lifeline crosses his and goes on alone but for how long dragosani demanded to know what about tomorrow night igor is that where my line ends vlady shivered your line is entirely different he finally answered i hardly know how to read it at all some six months ago borowitz demanded that i prepare weekly readings on you for his eyes only i tried butit was impossible there were so many deviations in your line that i couldnt read it with any degree of accuracy at all kinks and wriggles id never come across before also as the months passed what had started out as one line began to divide to split into two parallel lines the new one wasnt blue but red which was something else i had never seen before as for the old original line it too slowly turned red you are likelike twins dragosani i know no other way to put it and tomorrow yes tomorrow night one of your lines terminates half of me will die thought dragosani but which half out loud he asked the red or the blue the red line terminates said vlady the vampire dead dragosanis spirits soared but he controlled the laughter he felt welling inside what of the other line vlady shook his head patently at a loss for any reasonable explanation finally he said that is the oddest thing of all its something i simply cannot explain the other line loses its red tinge and forms a loop bends back on itself rejoins the other where the division first occurred dragosani sat down again and took up his drink what vlady had given him wasnt satisfactory but it was better than nothing ive been hard on you igor he said and im sorry for that i can see youve tried to do your best for me and i thank you but youve said that this thing tomorrow will be big which tells me that youve probably done readings for the others wholl be at the chateau so now i want to know just how big it will be vlady bit his lip you wont like the answer comrade he warned at last tell me anyway it will be very nearly total a force a power will visit itself upon the chateau bronnitsy and it will bring devastation keogh it could only be harry keogh no other threat existeddragosani stood up grabbed his coat headed for the door i have to go now igor he said but again i thank you i wont forget what youve done for me tonight believe me and if you should see anything new id be obliged if of course said vlady breathing a sigh of relief following him to the door and as dragosani went out into the night comradewhat happened to max batu it was a dangerous question but he must ask it dragosani paused just beyond the threshold glanced back max ah you know about him do you well it was an accident oh said vlady with a nod of course when he was alone again vlady finished off the vodka and then sat deep into the night wrapped in his own thoughts but as a clock tolled midnight somewhere out in the cold city he started up and shivered and finally decided to break his own rule quickly he cast his mind into the future followed his own lifeline to its inevitable end which came in just three days time and with a violent wrenching terminal squiggle automatically then vlady began to pack a few things and prepare to flee and uppermost in his mind was the thought that with borowitz gone dragosani would be the head of ebranch or head of what survived whatever else gregor borowitz was at least he was human but dragosani vlady knew he could never serve under him oh it could well be that dragosani would die tomorrow night but what if he didnt his line was so very confusing so very alien no there was only one course for vlady now he must try at least try to avoid the unavoidable and almost a thousand miles away where a dark watchtower overlooked the wall in east berlin a kalashnikov machinegun waited for igor vlady he didnt know it but even now his and the weapons futures were bending towards each other they would meet at exactly pm in just three days time dragosani drove straight back to his flat from there he phoned the chateau and got hold of the duty officer he passed on harry keoghs name and description for immediate transmission to border crossing points and incoming airports within the ussr along with the information that keogh was a spy for the west who should be arrested on sight or if that should prove difficult shot dead without delay the kgb would get to know about it of course but dragosani didnt mind if they took keogh alive they wouldnt know what to do with him and one way or the other dragosani would get his hands on him and if they killed himthat would be the end of that as for vladys predictions dragosani had some faith in them but it was by no means total vlady insisted that the future could not be changed dragosani thought differently one of them must be right but they must wait until tomorrow night to find out which one in any case the promised trouble at the chateau bronnitsy might well turn out to be nothing to do with harry keogh after all and so until then at least things must continue according to plan after passing on his information to the chateau dragosani had another drink a stiff one which was not his normal habit and at last fell into his bed exhausted he slept right through until midmorning at am he parked his old volga in a copse off the main road half a mile from the closest dacha turned up the collar of his overcoat and walked the rest of the way into zhukovka precinct just before noon he turned off a track inches deep in snow and walked through a strip of woodland lying parallel to the river until he came to borowitzs dacha smiling grimly he went quickly along the paved path to the door and knocked gently on the rustic oak panels while he waited he sniffed at wood smoke where it hung in the bitter cold air the fine hairs inside his nostrils crackled but melting icicles where they hung from borowitzs roof told him that already the temperature was rising soon the snow would melt and dragosanis footprints would disappear there would be nothing to connect him with this place there came slow footsteps from within and the door cracked open pale shaggy and redeyed gregor borowitz peered out blinked in the grey light of day dragosani he frowned darkly but i said i wasnt to be disturbed i comrade general dragosani cut in if it wasnt a matter of the utmost urgency borowitz stepped aside opened the door wider come in come in he grumbled but without his accustomed fire he had been alone here for a week he no longer seemed robust his grief was very real and had left him old and tired all of which suited dragosani very well indeed he entered followed the other down a short corridor and through hanging curtains into the small pinepanelled room where natasha borowitz lay silently in her shroud the woman had been a peasant pleasant enough in life but plain and dowdy in death like a stout badly fashioned candle she lay there the wax of her face wrinkled the wick of her hair coarse and sparse borowitz patted her cold face and bowed his head as he turned away but he could not hide a very real tear glittering in the corner of his eye now he led dragosani through into the more familiar livingcumdining room and offered him a seat close to a window the rest of the dachas windows were shuttered but this ones shutters stood open letting in the light with a silent shake of his head dragosani declined to sit watched borowitz flop heavily down on to a padded couch i prefer to stand the necromancer said this wont take long a flying visit borowitz grunted scarcely interested you might have waited dragosani tomorrow they take my natasha away from me and then i return to moscow and the chateau bronnitsy what is it that brings you here so urgently anyway you told me that your trip to england was successful so it was said dragosani but something has come up since then well comrade general said dragosani gregor i want you to ask no questions just yet but simply tell me something do you remember a conversation we once had you and i about the future of ebranch you said that one day you would decide who would take over from you when youretired also you said the decision would lie between myself and igor vlady borowitz drew his brows together stared at dragosani disbelievingly so thats why youre here he growled a matter of the utmost urgency eh you think im ready to step down do you or maybe you think its time i stepped down now that natashas gone maybe ill think of retiring eh he sat up straighter his eyes flashed something of the fire dragosani was used to seeing in them except that the necromancer no longer stood in awe of this man i said you should ask no questions he reminded a low dark rumble in his voice i am the one who seeks answers gregor now tell me who did you decide would be your replacement indeed have you yet decided and if so have you made a record of your decision borowitz was astonished outraged you dare he scowled his eyes bulging you dare you forget yourself dragosani you forget who am and where you are and apparently you forget or choose to ignore the fact that i am recently bereaved well damn you dragosani but in answer to your questions no i have committed nothing to paper theres nothing to commit for ill be going on as the head of ebranch for a long time yet i assure you moreover even if i had chosen a successor as of this moment you could erase from your mind any thoughts of yourself in that position he stood up shaking with rage now get your damned arse out of here get out before i dragosani took off his dark widerimmed spectacles borowitz looked at dragosanis face and was suddenly staggered by the massive metamorphosis taken place in him why it hardly seemed like dragosani at all standing there but someone else entirely and those eyes those incredible scarlet eyes i am retiring you gregor dragosani rumbled butyou dont go emptyhanded not after so many years of faithful service he crouched down into himself his shoulders and back seeming to bunch up with a grotesque life of their own retiring me borowitz tried to back away from dragosani but the couch was right behind him you retiring me dragosani nodded opened his long jaws and smiled displayed fangs like scythes we have a small retirement gift for you gregor we borowitz croaked me and max batu said dragosani and in the next moment borowitz looked into the face of hell itself then it was as if a mule had kicked him in the chest he flew backward his arms thrown wide crashed into the wall and bounced off small shelves and pictures were brought crashing down borowitz fell halfsprawling on the couch he clutched at his chest fought to take control of his rubber limbs and climb to his feet gulped air to his straining lungs his heart felt crushed and if he didnt know how at least he knew what dragosani had done to him finally he struggled upright dragosani he held out wildly fluttering pudgy hands towards the necromancer drago again dragosani hurled his psychic bolt and again borowitz was swatted like a fly by the first blast knocked over backwards on to the couch he actually managed to sit up to finish the last word he would ever speak before the second blast hit him sani then it was done the exboss of ebranch sat there upright dead as a doornail showing all the signs of a heart attack classic dragosani grunted his approval he glanced about the room the door of a corner cupboard stood open displaying a battered old typewriter on a shelf with papers envelopes and other items of stationery he quickly carried the machine to a table inserted a blank sheet of paper began to type laboriously i feel unwell i think it is my heart natashas death has affected me badly i think i am finished since i have not yet nominated another to carry on my work i do so now the only man who can be trusted to carry on where i leave off is boris dragosani he is completely faithful to the ussr and especially to the aims and welfare of the party leader also if as i fear the end is coming i want my body put in dragosanis care he knows my wishes in this respect dragosani grinned as he rolled the typewritten sheet up a space or two he read over the note took up a pen and scrawled gb as nearly as possible in the style of borowitz at the end of the last line then dusted the keys with his handkerchief where hed touched them and carried the machine to the couch sitting down beside the dead man he took his hands and laid his fingers briefly on the keys and all the time borowitz watching him through sightless popping eyes all done gregor said dragosani as he took the typewriter back to the table tm going now but ill not say goodbye just yet after they find you well be meeting again eh at the chateau bronnitsy and what price your innermost secrets then gregor borowitz it was pm when he let himself out of the silent cabin in the trees and backtracked to his car since it was a saturday there were fewer people about than one would usually find at the chateau bronnitsy but as the guards on the outer wall checked dragosani through so they sent word of his arrival ahead of him at the central cluster of buildings the duty officer was waiting for him wearing the chateaus uniform of grey overalls with a single diagonal yellow stripe across the heart he came breathlessly forward to greet dragosani where he parked his volga in its designated space good news comrade he declared walking with dragosani through the complex and holding a door open for him we have word of this british agent this harry keogh for you dragosani at once grabbed him by the shoulder his grip like a vice the other carefully disengaged himself stared curiously at dragosani is anything wrong comrade not if weve got keogh dragosani growled no nothing at all but youre not the man i spoke to last night no comrade he has gone off duty i read his log thats all and of course i was here this morning when word of keogh came in dragosani looked more closely at the speaker he saw him remotely thin and slopeshouldered a typical nothing to look at and yet puffed up with his own importance not an esper the duty officer was simply senior ground staff a good clerk mainly and efficient but a bit too pompous too smug and selfsatisfied for dragosanis liking come with me he said coldly you can tell me about keogh as we go with the do at his heels dragosani loped easily through the chateaus corridors and began climbing stairs towards borowitzs private office complex finding it hard to keep up the man said slow down a little comrade or ill not have breath to tell you anything dragosani kept going about keogh he snapped over his shoulder where is he who has him are they bringing him here no one has him comrade the other puffed we merely know where he is thats all hes in east germany leipzig he got in through checkpoint charlie in berlin as a tourist and no attempt to hide his identity apparently very strange hes been in leipzig for three or four days now seems to have spent most of his time there in a graveyard obviously hes waiting for a contact oh dragosani came to a brief halt glared at the other sneered at him obvious did you say let me tell you comrade that nothing is obvious about that one now quickly come into my office and ill give you some instructions a moment later and the do followed dragosani into the antechamber of borowitzs suite your office he gaped behind his desk borowitzs secretary a young man with thicklensed spectacles thin eyebrows and a prematurely receding hairline looked up startled dragosani jerked his thumb towards the open door you out wait outside ill call when i want you what bewildered the man stood up comrade dragosani i must protest i dragosani reached across the desk grabbed the man by the left cheek of his face and dragged him bodily across the desk top scattering pens and pencils everywhere amidst a squall of muted pained squawkings he whirled him towards the open door and aimed a kick at his backside as he released him protest to gregor borowitz next time you see him he snapped until then obey my orders or ill have you shot he continued through into borowitzs old office the do trembling as he followed on behind without pause dragosani lowered himself into borowitzs chair behind his desk continued to glare at the do now whos watching keogh completely overawed the do stuttered a little before settling down iiwethe grepo he finally got it out the grenzpolizei the east german border police yes yes i know who the grepo are dragosani scowled then he nodded good theyre very efficient im told right these are my orders on behalf of gregor borowitz keogh is to be taken alive if possible that was what i ordered last night and i hate to repeat myself but they had no holding charge comrade dragosani the do explained he is not listed this keogh and so far he has done nothing wrong the charge ismurder said dragosani he murdered one of our agents a sleeper in england anyway he will be taken if that proves difficult the orders are to shoot him i ordered that too last night the do felt that he personally was being accused he felt he had to make excuses but these are germans comrade he said some of them like to believe that they still govern themselves if you see what i mean no said dragosani i dont use the telephone next door get me the headquarters of the grenzpolizei in berlin ill speak to them the do stood gaping at him now dragosani snapped and as the man scurried out he called after him and send in that dolt from outside when borowitzs secretary entered dragosani said sit and listen until the comrade general returns ill be in charge what do you know about the working of this place almost everything comrade dragosani answered the other still pale and frightened and holding his face the comrade general left many things to me manpower what about it comrade drag cut that out dragosani snapped no more comrade it wastes time simply call me dragosani yes dragosani manpower dragosani said again what do we have here right now here at the chateau right now a skeleton staff of espers and maybe a dozen security men callin system oh yes dragosani good ill want at least enough men to make our numbers up to thirty and ill want them by pm at the very latest i want our best telepaths and forecasters including igor vlady to be among them can that be done can we muster these men by pm the other immediately nodded in more than three hours oh yes dragosani definitely then get on with it when he was alone dragosani settled back in his chair and put his feet up on the desk he thought about what he was doing if the east germans took keogh especially if they killed him that must surely cancel out the possibility of keoghs being part of tonights disturbance mustnt it in any case it was difficult to see how keogh could possibly make it here from leipzig in just a few hours so perhaps dragosani should be concentrating on some other eventuality but what sabotage was the cold esp war finally starting to heat up had his murdering sir keenan gormley lit some sort of slow fuse laid perhaps a long time ago but what could possibly harm the chateau the place was impregnable as a castle fifty keoghs wouldnt even make it over the outer wall angry with himself with the gradual buildup of tension inside him dragosani forced keogh out of his mind no the threat must come from somewhere else he gave a little more thought to the chateaus fortifications dragosani had never fully understood the need to fortify the chateau but now he was glad indeed for its defences of course old borowitz had been a soldier long before he had started ebranch he was an expert strategist and doubtless hed had his reasons for insisting on this degree of security but here right next door to moscow itself what had he feared insurgency trouble from the kgb perhaps or was it just one of the old mans hangups from his political or military feuding days not that this was the only fortified place in the ussr far from it the space centres nuclear and plasma research stations and the chemical and biological warfare labs at berezov were all security hotspots tight as proverbial drums dragosani scowled how he wished he had borowitz here now downstairs in his operating theatre stretched out on a steel table with his guts hanging open and all the secrets of his soul laid bare ah well and that too would come to pass when they finally found the old bastards body comrade dragosani the dos voice calling from next door shattered his thoughts to shards i have grepo hq in berlin for you im putting them through now good he called back and while im speaking to them theres something else you can do i want the chateau searched top to bottom especially the cellars to my knowledge there are rooms down there no one ever went into i want the place turned inside out look for bombs incendiary devices for anything at all that looks suspicious i want as many men on it as possible particularly the espers understood yes comrade of course very well now let me speak to these damned germans it was pm and arctic cold in the city cemetery in leipzig harry keogh his overcoat turned up around his ears and a flask of coffee in his lap sat frozen at the foot of august ferdinand mobius grave and despaired he had sought to apply his espers mind his metaphysical talent to the equally conjectural properties of altered spacetime and fourdimensioned topology and failed intuition told him it was possible that he could in fact take a mobius trip sideways in time but the mechanics of the thing were mountainsized stumbling blocks that he just couldnt climb his instinctive or intuitive grasp of maths and noneuclidean geometry was not enough he felt like a man given the equation e me and then asked to prove it by producing an atomic explosion but with his mind alone how do you go about turning unbodied numbers pure maths into physical facts its not enough to know that there are ten thousand bricks in a house you cant build the house of numbers you need the bricks it was one thing for mobius to send his unbodied mind out beyond the farthest stars but harry keogh was a physical threedimensional man of living flesh and blood and just suppose he succeeded and actually discovered how to teleport himself from a to some hypothetical b without physically covering the space between what then where would he teleport himself to and how would he know when he was there it could prove as dangerous as stepping off a cliff to prove the law of gravity for days now hed occupied his mind with the problem to the exclusion of almost everything else he had taken food and drink and sleep yes attending to all of natures needs but to nothing else and still the problem remained unsolved spacetime refused to warp for him the equations remained dark unfathomed squiggles on the now grubby wellthumbed pages of his mind a wonderful ambition certainly to impose himself physically within a metaphysical frame but how to go about it you need a spur harry said mobius wearily breaking in on his thoughts for what must be the fiftieth time in the last day or so personally i think thats all that remains after all necessity is the mother of invention you know so far you know what you want to do and i for one believe you have the knack the intuitive ability even though you havent found it yet but you havent a good enough reason for doing it thats all you need now the right spur the prod that will make you take the final step harry gave a mental nod of acknowledgement youre probably right he said i know i will do it its just that ihavent tried yet its something like giving up smoking you can but cant you probably will when its too late when youre dying of cancer except i dont want to wait that long i mean i have all the maths all the theory i have all the ego really the intuition but i havent the need not yet or the spur if you like let me tell you what it feels like im sitting in a welllighted room with a window and a door i look out the window and its dark out there it always will be not night but a stronger darkness that will last for ever its the darkness of the spaces between the spaces i know there are other rooms out there somewhere my problem is that i dont have any directions if i go out that door ill be part of the darkness surrounded by it i might not be able to come in again here or anywhere else its not so much that i cant go out but more that i dont want to think about what its like out there actually to know its there is to know i can go out into it i feel that the going will just be an extension of the other things i can do but an untried extension im a chicken in a shell and i wont break out until i have to who are you talking to mr harry keogh asked a voice that wasnt mobius a flat cold voice as curious as it was emotionless what startled harry looked up there were two of them and it was obvious who or what they were even knowing nothing about spying or eastwest politics he would have recognised these two on sight they chilled him more than the thin wind which now began to keen through the empty cemetery blowing dead leaves and scraps of paper along the aisles between the tombs one was very tall the other short but their darkgrey overcoats their hats pulled down at the front and their narrowrimmed spectacles were so uniform in themselves as to make them appear twins certainly twins in their natures in their thoughts and their petty ambitions as plainclothes men policemen probably political they were quite unmistakable what harry said again coming stiffly to his feet was i talking to myself again fm sorry about that i do it all the time its just a habit of mine talking to yourself the tall one repeated him and shook his head no i dont think so his accent was thick his lips thin as his mirthless smile i think you were talking to someone else probably to another spy harry keogh harry backed away from them a pace or two i really dont know what he began where is your radio mr keogh said the short one he came forward kicked at the dirt of the grave where harry had been sitting is it here buried in the soil perhaps day after day sitting here talking to yourself you must think were all fools listen harry croaked still backing away you must have the wrong man spy thats crazy im a tourist thats all oh said the tall one a tourist in the middle of winter a tourist who comes and sits in the same graveyard day after day to talk to himself you can do better than that mr keogh and so can we we have it on good authority that you are a british agent also that youre a murderer so now please you will come with us dont go with them harry it was keenan gormleys voice coming from nowhere unbidden to harrys mind run man run what harry gasped keenan but how oh harry my harry cried his mother please be careful what he said again shaking his head still backing away from the two men the small one produced handcuffs said i must warn you mr keogh against resistance we are counterespionage officials of the grenzpolizei and hit him harry urged graham sergeant lane in harrys innermost ear you have the measure of both these lads you know the way do it to them before they do it to you but watch it theyre armed as the short one took three quick paces forward holding out the handcuffs harry adopted a defensive stance also closing in the tall one yelled whats this you threaten violence you should know harry keogh that our orders are to take you dead or alive the short one made to snap the cuffs on harrys wrists at the last moment harry slapped them aside halfturned lashed out with his heel at the end of a leg stiffened into a bar of solid bone the blow took the short one in the chest snapped ribs drove him backwards into his tall colleague screaming his agony he slipped to the ground you cant win harry gormley insisted not like this hes right said james gordon hannant this is your last chance harry and you have to take it even if you stop these two therell be others this isnt the way you have to use your talent harry your talent is bigger than you suspect i didnt teach you anything about maths i only showed you how to use what was in you but your full potential remains untapped man you have formulae i havent even dreamed of you yourself once said something like that to my son remember harry remembered strange equations suddenly flashed on the screen of his mind doors opened where no doors should be his metaphysical mind reached out and grasped the physical world eager to bend it to his will he could hear the felled plainclothes man screaming his rage and pain could see the taller one reaching into his overcoat and drawing out an ugly shortbarrelled weapon but printed over this picture of the real world the doors in the mobius spacetime dimension were there within reach their dark thresholds seeming to beckon thats it harry cried mobius himself any one of them will do i dont know where they go he yelled out loud good luck harry shouted gormley hannant and lane almost in unison the gun in the tall agents hand spouted fire and lead harry twisted felt a hot breath against his neck as something snatched angrily at the collar of his coat he whirled leaped dropkicked the tall man and felt deep satisfaction as his feet crashed into face and shoulder the man went down his weapon clattering to the hard ground cursing and spitting blood and teeth he scrambled after it grasped it in two hands came up into a stumbling crouch out of the corner of his eye harry spied a door in the mobius strip it was so close that if he reached out his hand he could touch it the tall agent snarled something incomprehensible swung his gun in harrys direction harry knocked it aside grabbed the mans sleeve tugged him off balance and swung him through the open door the german agent wasno longer there from nowhere an awful lingering slowly fading scream came echoing back it was the cry of the damned of a soul lost for ever in ultimate darkness harry listened to that cry and shuddered but only for a moment over and above it as it dwindled he heard shouted instructions the crunch of running feet on gravel men were coming dodging between the tombstones converging on him he knew that if he was going to use the doors it had to be now the injured agent on the ground was holding a gun in hands that trembled like jelly his eyes were impossibly round for he had seensomething he was no longer sure if he dared pull the trigger and shoot at this man harry didnt give him time to think it over kicking his gun away he paused for one last splitsecond and let the screens in his mind display once more their fantastic formulae the running men were closer a bullet whined where it struck sparks from marble printed over mobius headstone a door floated out of nowhere that was appropriate harry thought and he made a headlong dive on the cold earth the crippled east german agent watched him go disappearing into the stone panting men came together in a knot skidding to a halt all held guns extended forward ready they stared about searched with keen cold eyes the crippled agent pointed he lay there with his broken ribs and drained white face and pointed a trembling finger at mobius headstone but for the moment stunned to his roots he said nothing at all the keening wind continued to blow by pm dragosani knew the worst of it harry keogh was alive he had not been taken but had somehow contrived to make his escape what means he had employed in that escape were unknown or at best the accounts were garbled and not to be trusted but one agent was missing believed dead and another seriously injured and now the east germans were making angry noises and demanding to know just who or what they were dealing with well let them demand what they would dragosani only wished he knew what he was dealing with anyway the problem was his now and time was pressing for there could no longer be any doubt but that keogh was coming here and coming tonight how who could say when exactly that too remained impossible to gauge but of one thing dragosani was absolutely certain come he would one man hurling himself against a small army his task was impossible of course but dragosani knew of the existence of many things which ordinary men considered impossible meanwhile the chateaus emergency callin system had worked well dragosani had all the men he had asked for and halfadozen more they manned machinegun posts on the outer walls similar batteries in the outbuildings also the fortified pillboxes built into the buttresses of the chateau itself espers worked down below in the laboratories in surroundings best suited to their various abilities and talents and dragosani had turned borowitzs offices into his tactical hq the chateau had been searched as per his orders top to bottom but as soon as he had learned of keoghs escape he had called a halt to that he had known where the trouble must originate by then the lower vaults of the place had been explored to the full floorboards and centuried flagstones had been ripped up in the older buildings the foundations of the place had been laid bare almost down to the earth itself three dozen men can do a lot of damage in three hours particularly when theyve been told that their lives may well depend upon it but what enraged dragosani most of all was the thought that all of this was on account of just one man harry keogh and that utter chaos had been forecast in his name which meant quite simply that keogh wielded an awesome power of destruction but what was it dragosani knew he was a necroscope so what also he had seen a dead thing rise up from a river and come to his aid but that had been his mother and the location had been scotland thousands of miles away there was no one here to fight keoghs battles for him of course if dragosani was so worried by all of this he could always flee the place but that just wouldnt be in his own interest not only would it smack of utter cowardice it wouldnt fulfill igor vladys prediction his prediction that the vampire in dragosani would die this night and that was one prediction boris dragosani desired fulfilled above all others indeed it was his ambition while his mind was still his own to crave for it as for vlady himself the callin squad had found a note at his place which explained his absence a note intended for his fiancйe vlady would call for her soon the note said from the west dragosani had been delighted to put out the traitors description to all relevant points of egress nor had he given him any quarter he was to be shot on sight in the name of the security of the mighty ussr so much for vlady and yetwould he have fared any better here dragosani wondered about that had he dragosani terrified vlady that much or had it been something else hed fled from something hed seen approaching perhaps out of the very near future chapter sixteen it was as harry had suspected it would be beyond the mobius doors he discovered the primal darkness itself that darkness which existed before the universe began it was not only the absence of light but the absence of everything he might be at the core of a black hole except a black hole has enormous gravity and this place had none in one sense it was a metaphysical plane of existence but in another it was not because nothing existed here it was simply a place but a place in which no god as yet had uttered those wonderful words of evocation let there be light it was nowhere and it was everywhere it was both central and external from here one might go anywhere or go nowhere for ever and it would be for ever for in this timeless environment nothing ever aged or changed except by force of will harry keogh was therefore a foreign body an unwanted mote in the eye of the mobius continuum and it must try to reject him he felt matterless forces working on him even now pushing at him and attempting to dislodge him from the unreal back into the real except he must not let himself be pushed there were doors he could conjure certainly a million million doors leading to all places and all times but he knew that most of these places and times would be totally lethal to him no use like mobius to emerge in some distant galaxy in deep space harry was not merely a creature of mind but also of matter he had no desire to freeze or fry or melt or explode the problem then was this which door harrys dive through mobius tombstone might have carried him a yard or a lightyear he might have been here for a minute or a month when he felt the first tentative tug of a force other than the rejection forces of this hyperspacetime dimension not even a tug as such it was more a gentle pressure that seemed to want to guide him hed known something like it before when hed tracked his mother under the ice and come up in her pool beneath the overhanging bank there seemed nothing of a threat in it anyway harry went with it following it and feeling it intensify homing in on it as a blind man homes in on a friendly voice or a moth on the bright flame of a candle no for his intuition told him that whatever it was there was no harm in it stronger still the force bobbed him along this parallel spacetime stream and like seeing a light at the end of a tunnel so he sensed the way ahead and began to will himself in that direction good said a distant voice in harrys head very good come to me harry keogh come to me it was a female voice but there was little of warmth in it thin it keened like the wind in the leipzig graveyard and like the wind it was old as the ages who are you harry asked a friend came the answer stronger now harry continued to will himself towards the mental voice he willed himselfthat way and there before him a mobius door he reached for it paused how do i know youre a friend how do i know i can trust you i asked that same question once said the voice almost in his ear for i too had no way of knowing but i trusted harry willed the door open and passed through stretched out in his original dive he found himself suspended maybe three inches above the ground and fell then clung to the earth and hugged himself to it the voice in his head chuckled there it said you see a friend dizzy and feeling sick harry gradually withdrew his fingers from loose dry soil he lifted his head a fraction stared all about light and colour struck almost physical blows on his reeling vision light and warmth that was the first impression to really get through to him how warm it was the soil was warm under his prone body the sun unseasonally warm where it shone on his neck and his hands where on gods earth was he was he on earth at all slowly still dizzy he sat up and gradually as he felt gravity working on him so things stopped revolving and he uttered a loud phew of relief harry wasnt much travelled or hed have recognised the terrain at once as being mediterranean the soil was a yellowybrown and streaked with sand the plants were those of scrubland the suns warmth in january told of his proximity to the equator certainly he was thousands of miles closer to it here than hed been in leipzig in the distance a mountain range threw up low peaks closer there were ruins crumbling white walls and mounds of rubble and overhead a pair of jet fighter planes like speeding silver darts against the pure blue of the sky left vapour trails as they hastened towards the horizon their thunder rolled down over him muted by distance harry breathed easier looked again towards the ruins middleeastern probably just some ancient village fallen victim to natures grand reclamation scheme and again he wondered where he was endor said the voice in his head that was its name when it had a name it was my home endor that rang a bell the biblical endor the place where saul went on the night before his death on the slopes of gilboa where he went to seek out a witch that is what they called me aye she chuckled dryly in his mind the witch of endor but that was long and long ago and there have been witches and witches mine was a great talent but now a greater one is come into the world in my long sleep i heard of him this mighty wizard and such were the rumours that they awakened me the dead call him their friend and there are those among the living who fear him greatly aye and i desired to speak with this one who is already a legend among the tomblegions and lo i called and he came to me and his name is harry keogh harry stared at the earth where he sat put down his hands and pressed upon it his hands came away dusty and dry yourehere he said i am one with the dust of the world she answered my dust is here harry nodded two thousand years is a long time why did you help me he asked would you have me damned for ever by all the teeming dead she answered at once why did i help you because they asked it of me all of them your fame precedes you harry save this one they begged me for he is beloved of us again harry nodded my mother he said your mother is but one answered the witch she is your chief advocate certainly but the dead are many she pleaded for you aye and many a thousand with her harry was astonished i dont know thousands he said i know a dozen two dozen at most again her chuckle long dry and mirthless but they know you and how may i ignore my brothers and sisters in the earth you wish to help me yes do you know what i have to do others have informed me aye then give me whatever aid you can if you can frankly and while i dont wish to seem ungrateful i dont see how theres a lot you can do oh but i controlled some of these same powers you control two thousand years ago and are my arts forgotten a king came to me for help harry keogh saul little good it did him said harry but not unkindly he asked me to show him his future she answered defensively and i showed him and can you show me mine your future she was silent for a moment then i have already looked upon your future harry but of that ask me not that bad eh there are deeds to be performed she answered and wrongs to be righted if i were to show you what will be it would not make you strong for the task ahead like saul perhaps you too would faint away upon the earth im going to lose harrys heart sank something of you shall be lost harry shook his head i dont like the sound of that cant you say more i will not say more then perhaps youll help me with the mobius dimension i mean how may i find my way about in it i dont know what id have done if you hadnt guided me out of there but i know nothing of this thing she answered obviously puzzled i called to you and you heard me why not let them also guide you who love you was that possible harry thought it probably was at least thats something he said i can give it a try now how else can you help me for saul the king she answered i called up samuel now there are also some who would speak to you let me be the medium of their messages but its selfevident i can speak to the dead for myself he said but not to these three she answered for you know them not very well let me speak to them harry keogh a new voice now whispered in his head a soft voice that belied the oncecruelty of its master i saw you one time and you saw me my name is max batu harry gasped spat his disgust on to the sand max batu youre no friend of mine he scowled you killed keenan gormley then he thought about who he was speaking to but you dead i dont understand dragosani killed me the other told him he did it to steal my talent with his necromancy he slit my throat and gutted me and left my body to rot now he has the evil eye i make no pretence of being your friend harry keogh but im much less a friend of his i tell you this because it might help you to kill him before he kills you it is my revenge and as max batus voice faded another took its place i was thibor ferenczy it said its timbre sad and soulful i could have lived for ever i was a vampire harry keogh but dragosani destroyed me i was undead now i am merely dead a vampire just such a creature had cropped up in gormleys and kyles wordassociation game kyle had seen a vampire in harrys future but i can hardly condemn dragosani for killing a vampire he said i dont want you to condemn him the voice grew harsh in a moment shedding its sorrow like a wornout snakeskin i want you to kill him i want the lying cheating illegitimate necromantic dog dead dead dead like me and i know he will be dead know you will kill him but only with my help only if youllbargain with me do not harry the witch of endor warned him satan himself is no match for a vampire where lies and deceit are concerned no bargains harry took her point but it is such a small thing i want thibor protested his mental voice growing into a whine how small only promise me that now and then once in a while be it ever so long when you have the time then that youll speak to me for there are none so lonely as i am now harry keogh very well i promise the exvampire sighed his relief good and now i know why the dead love you now know this harry dragosani has a vampire in him the creature is still immature but it grows fast and learns even faster and do you know how to kill a vampire a wooden stake that is only to pin him down but then you must behead him ill remember that harry nodded nervously licking dry lips and remember too your promise said thibor his voice fading into nothing for a moment then it was silent and harry was left to think about the awesome nature of this composite creature hed pitted himself against but then out of the silence he heard the voice of the third and last informer harry keogh growled this final visitation you dont know me but sir keenan gormley may have told you something of me i was gregor borowitz now i am no more dragosani killed me with max batus evil eye i am dead in my prime by treachery so you too seek revenge said harry had he no friends this dragosani not even one yes he had me i had plans for dragosani great plans ah but the bastard had plans of his own and i wasnt part of them he killed me for my knowledge of ebranch so that he can control what i created but it goes farther than that i think he wants everything i mean literally everything under the sun and if he lives he might very well get everything eventually eventually there came a great mental shudder from borowitz you see hes not finished with me yet my body lies in my dacha where he left it but sooner or later it will be delivered into his hands and then hell deal with me as he dealt with max batu i dont want that harry i dont want that scum wading through my guts in search of my secrets something of his horrortransmitted itself to harry but still the necroscope could feel no pity for him i understand your motivation he said but if he hadnt killed you i would have if i could for my mother for keenan gormley for everyone youve hurt or would hurt yes yes of course you would said borowitz without enmity if you could i was a soldier before i was a schemer harry keogh i understand honour even if dragosani doesnt its because of all these things that i want to help you i accept your reasons said harry how can you help me first i can tell you all i know about the chateau bronnitsy its design and layout the people who work there here take it all and he quickly imparted to harry all knowledge of the place and of the espers who worked there and then i can tell you something else something which you with your special talent can use to good advantage ive said i was first a soldier so i was and my knowledge of warfare was second to none i had studied the entire history of warfare from mans beginnings i had traced his wars right across the face of the planet and knew all the old battlefields intimately you ask how i can help you well listen and ill tell you harry listened and slowly his strange eyes opened wider and a grim smile spread itself across his face he had been weary until now burdened but now a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders he did have a chance after all finally borowitz was finished well we were enemies said harry then even though we never met in the flesh but i thank you anyway you know of course that i intend to destroy your organisation as well as dragosani no more than hed destroy it the other growled anyway i have to go now theres someone else i want to find if i can and his voice too faded into silence harry looked at the rugged terrain all around and saw how the sun dipped lower in the sky dust devils raced along a ridge kites wheeled in the sky as the day turned towards evening and for a long while as the shadows lengthened he sat there on the sand and pebbles with his chin in his hands just thinking at last he said they all want to help me because you bring them hope the witch of endor told him for centuries indeed since time itself began the dead have lain still in their graves and that was that but now they stir they seek each other out they talk to each other in a manner you have taught them they have found a champion only ask of them harry keogh and they will obey harry stood up gazed all around felt the chill of evening beginning to creep i see no reason to stay here any longer he said as for you old lady i dont know how to thank you i have all the thanks i want she answered the teeming dead thank me he nodded yes and there are some of them i want to speak tofirst go then she answered the future waits for you as it waits for all men harry said no more but conjured the mobius doors chose one and walked through it he went first to his mother finding his way to her without difficulty then to sergeant graham lane at harden including a quick jump of only fifty yards or so to the grave of james gordon hannant then to a garden of repose in kensington where keenan gormleys ashes had been scattered but where gormley himself remained and finally to gregor borowitzs dacha in zhukovka he spent perhaps ten to fifteen minutes in each location with the exception of the last it was one thing to talk to dead men in their graves but quite another to talk to one who sat there and looked at you with glassy pusdripping eyes in any case by the time harry was through he was satisfied that he knew his business that he could now safely negotiate the intricacies of the mobius continuum and by then there was only one place left to go but first he took down a doublebarrelled shotgun from the wall and filled his pockets with cartridges from a drawer it was just pm east european time when he started to ride the mobius strip from zhukovka to the chateau bronnitsy along the way he became aware that someone rode the strip with him knew he wasnt alone in the mobius continuum whos there he called out with his mind in the ultimate darkness of the journey just another dead man came the answer but in a voice wry and humourless in my life i read the future but i had to die to understand and finally realise the full extent of my talent strangely in your now i am still alive but i shall be dead shortly i dont understand said harry i didnt expect you to understand immediately im here to explain my name is igor vlady i worked for borowitz i made the mistake of reading my own future my own death that will happen two days from your now as a result of boris dragosanis ordering it but after death i will go on to explore my own potential what i did in life i will do even better in death if i wanted to i could see backward to the beginning of time or go forward to its end if time had a beginning and an end but of course it has not it is all a part of the mobius continuum an endlessly twisting loop containing all space and time let me show you and he showed harry the doors into the future and the past and harry stood on their thresholds and viewed time that had been and time still to come except that he could not understand what he saw for beyond the futuretime door all was a chaos of millions of lines of blue light and one of these streamed from his own being out through the door and into the future his future likewise beyond the pasttime door the same blue light pouring out of him and fading into the past his past along with the light of countless millions of others and such was the dazzling blue brilliance of all those lifethreads that he was almost blinded by it but no light shines from you he said to igor vlady why is that because my light has been extinguished now i am like mobius pure mind and where space holds no secrets for him time holds none for me harry thought about it said i want to see my lifethread again and again he stood on the threshold of the door to the future he looked into the bright blue furnace of the future and saw his lifethread shimmering into it like a neon ribbon and he could see it clearly where it curved away into future time but even as he watched so the end of his thread of life came into view and then it seemed to him that the blue lifelight of his body was not flowing out of him but flowing in the thread was being eaten up by him as he approached his own end and now that end was plainly visible speeding towards him like a meteor out of the future quickly in terror of the unknown he stepped back from the door and once more into darkness am i going to die he asked then is that what youre telling me showing me yes said the timetravelling mind of igor vlady and no again harry failed to understand im about to pass through a mobius door to the chateau bronnitsy he said if im going to die there id like to know it the witch of endor told me that i would lose something of myself now ive seen the end of my lifethread he gave a nervous mental shrug it seems im coming to the end of my tether in answer he sensed a nod but if you were to use the futuretime door said vlady you could go on beyond the end of your thread to where it begins again begins again harry was baffled are you saying im to live again theres a second thread which is also you harry it lives even now all it lacks is mind and vlady explained his meaning he read harrys future for him just as he once read boris dragosanis except that where harry had a future dragosani had only a past and now at last harry had all the answers i owe you my thanks he told vlady then you owe me nothing said vlady but you came to me just in time harry insisted little realising the significance of his words time is relative the other shrugged and chuckled what will be has been thanks anyway said harry and passed through the door to the chateau bronnitsy at pm exactly dragosanis telephone came janglingly alive causing him to start outside it was dark now made darker by snow falling heavily from a black sky searchlights in the chateaus outer walls and towers swept the ground between the complex itself and the perimeter wall as they had swept it since the fall of dark but now their beams were reduced to mere swaths of grey light whose poor penetration was of little or no consequence dragosani found it annoying that vision should be so reduced but the chateaus defences had more going for them than human eyesight alone there were sensitive tripwires out there the latest electronic detection devices even a belt of antipersonnel mines in a circle just beyond the outbuilding pillboxes none of which gave dragosani any real sensation of security igor vladys predictions had ignored all such protections in any case the call did not come from the pillboxes or the fortified perimeter the men in their defensive positions were all equipped with hand radios this call was either external or it came from a department within the chateau itself dragosani snatched the handset from its cradle snapped yes what is it felix krakovitch a trembling voice answered im down in my lab comrade dragosani theressomething dragosani knew the man a seer a minor prognosticator his talent wasnt up to vladys standard by a long shot but neither was it to be ignored not on this of all nights something dragosanis nostrils flared the man had put an eerie emphasis on the word make sense krakovitch whats wrong i dont know comrade its just thatsomethings coming something terrible no its here its here now whats here dragosani snarled into the phone where here out there in the snow belov feels it too belov karl belov was a telepath and a good one over short distances borowitz had often used him at foreign embassy parties picking up what he could from the minds of his hosts is belov there with you now put him on belov was asthmatic his voice was always soft and gasping his sentences invariably short right now they were even more so hes right comrade he gasped theres a mind out there a powerful mind keogh it had to be him just one dragosanis oncesensitive lips curled back from a mouthful of white daggers his red eyes seemed to light from within how keogh had come here he couldnt say but if he was alone he was a dead man and to hell with that traitor vladys predictions on the other end of the line belov fought for air struggled to find a means of expression well dragosani hastened him iim not sure said belov i thought there was only one but now yes dragosani almost shouted damn it all am i surrounded by idiots what is it belov whats out there belov panted into the phone at his end gasped hescalling hes some sort of telepath himself and hes calling to you dragosanis brows knitted in baffled frustration his great nostrils sniffed suspiciously anxiously as if to draw the answer from the air itself no not to me hes calling toto others oh god and theyre beginning to answer him who is answering him dragosani barked whats wrong with you belov are there traitors here in the chateau there came a clattering from the other end a low moan and a thudding sound then krakovitch again he has fainted comrade what dragosani couldnt believe his ears belov fainted what the hell lights were beginning to flicker on the callsign panel of the radio dragosani had had moved in here from the dos control cell a number of men with handsets were trying to contact him from their defensive positions next door borowitzs secretary yul galenski sat nervously behind his desk twitching as he listened to dragosanis raging and now the necromancer started bellowing for him galenski are you deaf get in here i need assistance at that moment the do burst in from the landing in the central stairwell he carried weapons stubby kalashnikov machinepistols as galenski started to his feet he said you sit there ill go in without pause for knocking he almost ran into the other room pulled up short gasping as he saw dragosani crouched over the radios panel of blinking lights dragosani had taken his glasses off snarling soundlessly at the radio he seemed more like some hunched halfcrazy beast than a man still staring in astonishment at the necromancers face his awful eyes the do dumped an armful of weapons onto a chair as he did so dragosani said stop gawping he reached out a great hand and grabbed the dos shoulder dragged him effortlessly towards the radio do you know how to operate this damned thing yes dragosani the do gulped finding his voice they are trying to speak to you i can see that fool dragosani snapped well then speak to them find out what they want the do perched himself on the edge of a steel chair in front of the radio he took up the handset flipped switches said this is zero all callsigns acknowledge over the replies came in sharp numerical succession callsign one ok over two ok over three ok over and so on rapidly through fifteen callsigns the voices were tinny and there was some static but over and above that they all seemed a little too shrill all contained a ragged edge of barely controlled panic zero for callsign one send your message over said the do one there are things out in the snow the answer came back at once ones voice crackling with static and mounting excitement theyre closing on my position request permission to open fire over zero for one wait out snapped the do he looked at dragosani the necromancers red eyes were open wide like clots of blood frozen in his inhuman face no he snarled first i want to know what were dealing with tell him to hold his fire and give me a running commentary whitefaced the do nodded passed on dragosanis order was glad that he wasnt stuck out there in a pillbox in the snow but on the other hand could that be any worse than being stuck in here with the madman dragosani zero this is one ones voice crackled out of the radio almost hysterical with excitement now theyre coming in a semicircle out of the snow in a minute theyll hit the mines but they move soso slowly there one of them stepped on a mine it blew him to bits but the others keep coming theyre thin ragged they dont make any noise some of them have swords zero for one you keep calling them things arent they men ones radio procedure went out of the window men his voice was completely hysterical maybe they are men or were once i think im insane this is unbelievable he tried to get a grip on himself zero im alone here and there aremany of them i request permission to open fire i beg you i must protect myself a white foam began to gather at the corners of dragosanis gaping mouth where he stared at a wallchart checking ones location it was an outbuilding pillbox directly below the command tower but fifty yards out from the chateau itself occasionally as the snow swirled he could see its low squat dark outline through the bulletproof bay windows but as yet no sign of the unknown invaders he stared out into the snow again and at that precise moment saw a blaze of orange fire erupt to throw the outbuilding into brief silhouette and this time there came a low crump of an explosion as another mine was tripped the do looked to him for instructions tell him to describe thesethings dragosani snapped before the do could obey another callsign came up unbidden zero this is eleven fuck one these bastards are all over the place if we dont open fire now theyll be crawling all over us you want to know what they are ill tell you theyre dead men that was it it was what dragosani had feared keogh was here definitely and he was calling up the dead but where from tell them to fire at will he coughed the words out in a spray of froth tell them to cut the bastards down whatever they are the do passed on his orders but already from every quarter dull explosions were beginning to pound all around the chateau the harsh clatter of machinegun fire too the defenders had finally used their own initiative had commenced firing almost pointblank on a zombie army that came marching inexorably through the snow gregor borowitz had not lied he had indeed known his history of warfare and especially in his native land in moscow had been sacked by tartars from the crimea there had been arguments about the division of the loot from the city a wouldbe khan had challenged the authority of his superiors he and his splintergroup of three hundred horsemen had then been stripped of loot rank most of their weapons and whipped out of the city disgraced and scavenging where they could they had ridden south it had rained heavily and they had bogged down in a marshy triangle of forest where rivers overflowed their banks there a fivehundredstrong russian force riding to the relief of the beleaguered city had come across them in the mist and rain and cut them down to a man their bodies had gone down in mud and mire never to be seen again until now nor had they needed much persuasion from harry indeed theyd seemed merely to be waiting for him ready at a moments notice to fight their way free of the bitter earth where they had lain for four hundred years bone by bone tatter by leathery tatter they had come up some of them still bearing the rusted arms of yesteryear and at harrys command theyd moved on the chateau bronnitsy harry had stepped out of the mobius continuum inside the perimeter walls the defenders of those walls gazing outward hadnt even seen him or the agonising emergence of his longdead army moreover the machinegun emplacements on the outer walls were pointing the wrong way which all combined with the night and the snow to give him excellent cover but then there had been the tripwires and other intruder detection devices and now there was the minefield and the inner ring of disguised pillboxes for harry none of these obstacles was any great problem they werent even obstacles when at will he could simply step out of this universe and back into it a moment later in any room in the chateau where he chose to reappear but first he wanted to see how his backup force was making out he wanted the chateaus defenders fully engaged in the business of protecting their own lives not the life of boris dragosani at the moment he was down on his belly in a shallow depression huddled behind a headless boneandleather thing which a moment ago had marched ahead of him towards the pillbox outbuilding where callsign one and his machinegunner second in command sat and gibbered through their viewing slits firing long bursts into the wall of death which slowly bore down on them a large percentage of harrys army about half of his three hundred had emerged from the earth in this sector and the mines were quickly taking an unfair toll of them even now the pillbox and its chattering gun were dealing harrys army terrific blows he decided to take out the pillbox broke open gregor borowitzs shotgun and slipped cartridges into the double breach take me with you begged the tartar who shielded him i helped sack a city once and this is but a palace his skull head had been taken off by shrapnel from a landmine but that hadnt seemed to matter much he still held up a massive battered iron and bronze shield its rim dug into the cold earth upright in the snow using his own bones and the shield to give harry as much cover as possible no said harry shaking his head there wont be much room in there and ill need to get in and get it over with but id be obliged for the use of your shield take it said the corpse releasing the heavy plate from fingers of crusted bone i hope it serves you well a mine went off somewhere to the right its flash turning the falling snow orange for a moment and its thunder shaking the earth in the momentary burst of light harry had seen an arc of skeletal figures stumbling ever closer to the dark huddled shape of the pillbox so had the men inside armourpiercing machinegun bullets screamed in the air blowing apart tartar remains and coming dangerously close for all that harrys ancient shield was heavy still it was rotten with rust and decay he knew it wouldnt stop a direct hit go now urged the dead thing where it struggled to its bony feet and lurched forward headlessly kill some of them for me harry narrowed his eyes one last time through flurries of snow and fixed the location of the firespewing outbuilding in his mind then rolled sideways through a mobius door and into the pillbox no time for thinking in there and little or no room for movement what had looked from outside like an old cowshed was in fact a cramped nest of steel plates and concrete blocks slategrey gunmetal and shining ammunitionbelts grey light fought its way in through arcoffire and viewing slits turning the cordite and sweatsmelling interior to a drifting smog in which callsign one and his second in command coughed and spluttered where they worked furiously and feverishly harry emerged in the tight space behind them dropping his shield to the concrete floor as he swung up the loaded shotgun hearing the clatter as the shield fell both russians turned in their steelbacked swivel chairs they saw a whitefaced youth in an overcoat cradling a shotgun his eyes bright points of light above pinched nostrils and the grim tight line of his mouth who gasped one he looked like some strange startled waspish alien in his chateau uniform with his headset for antennae above goggling eyes how said his second in command his fingers automatically completing the task of fitting a new belt to the machinegun then callsign one was scrabbling to snatch a pistol from his holster and his second in command was coming to his feet cursing harry felt no pity for them it was them or him and there were plenty of others just like them to welcome them where they were going he pulled the triggers one for one two for his second in command and blew them screaming into the arms of death the stench of hot blood quickly mingled with acrid cordite and the reek of sweat and fear causing harrys eyes to water he blinked them furiously broke open the shotgun and reloaded found another mobius door the next pillbox was the same and the one after that six of them in all they were all the same harry took them out in less than two minutes in the last one when it was done he found the chaotic mind of one of the fresh dead defenders and calmed him its over for you now he said but the one who brought all this about is still alive youd be home with your family tonight if not for him and so would i now wheres dragosani in borowitzs office in the tower said the other hes turned it into the control room therell be others with him i expect there will said harry staring into the russians shattered smoking unrecognisable face thanks and then there was only one thing left to do but harry fancied hed need a little help to do it he snapped open the clamps that held the machinegun in place on its swivelling base took up the heavy gun and hurled it down to the hard floor then lifted it and threw it down again after being dashed to the concrete three or four times the hard wooden stock splintered lengthwise allowing harry to break off a jagged stake with a flat base and a sharp hardwood point he reached for his cartridges and found only one left gritted his teeth and loaded the single cartridge into his shotgun it would have to be enough then he pulled open the pillbox door and stepped out into the swirling snow in the near distance softened by night and the fastfalling snow the chateau blazed with light its searchlight beams cutting to and fro as they searched for targets most of harrys army what remained of it was already at the walls of the chateau itself however from which the staccato yammering of machineguns now sounded unceasingly the remaining defenders were trying to kill dead men and they were finding it hard harry looked about saw a group of latecomers leaning into the snow as they plodded towards the beleaguered building eerie figures they were gaunt scarecrow men creaking past him in monstrous animation but death held no fears for harry keogh he stopped two of them a pair of mummied cadavers a little less ravaged than the rest and offered one the hardwood stake for dragosani he said the other tartar carried a great curving sword all scabbed with rust harry reckoned hed used it in his day to devastating effect well and now with any justice hed use it again he pointed to the sword nodded said that too is for dragosani for the vampire in him then he opened a mobius door and guiding his two sere companions stepped through it inside the chateau bronnitsy it had been all hell let loose almost from the beginning the place had been built two hundred and thirty years ago on an ancient battlefield the building itself was a mausoleum for a dozen of the fiercest of all the tartar warriors and its protection had kept the peaty ground pliant so that the bodies which had lain there were more truly mummies than fleshless corpses also dragosani had ordered the great stone flags in the cellars lifted and floorboards ripped out in his search for signs of sabotage and so at harry keoghs first call there had been little to deter these reanimated tartars as theyd struggled up from their centuried graves to answer his command and prowl the chateaus corridors laboratories and conservatories and wherever they found espers or defenders they had simply put them down out of hand now all that remained were the fortified machinegun positions in the chateaus own walls which allowed the men within them no egress no means of escape the machinegun posts could only be entered from within the chateau there were no exterior doors no way out the voice of one such callsign trapped in his fortified position told dragosani the entire story in every gory detail where he raged and frothed in his tower control room comrade this is madness madness the voice moaned over dragosanis control radio blocking all other traffic if any remained to be blocked they arezombies dead men and how may we kill dead men they come and my gunner cuts them down and shoots them to pieces and then the pieces come outside a pile of pieces wriggles and kicks and builds itself into a wall against the wall of the chateau trunks legs arms hands even the smaller pieces and the naked bones themselves soon they will pour in through the gun slits and what then dragosani snarled more animal now than ever and shook his fists at the night and the drifting snow beyond the towers windows keogh he raged i know youre there keogh so come if youre coming and lets be done with it theyre inside the chateau too the voice on the radio sobbed were trapped in here my gunner is a madman now he raves even as he works his gun ive jammed the steel door shut but something continues to batter at it trying to get in i know what it is for i saw it it stuck a leathery claw inside before i could slam the door on its wrist now the hand oh god the hand claws at my legs and tries to climb i kick it away but it always returns see see again again and his voice tapered off into static and a crackling peal of laughter simultaneous with the idiot sounds from the radio suddenly yul galenski cried out in terror from his anteroom office the stairs theyre coming up the stairs his voice was shrill as a girls he had no experience of fighting he was a clerk a secretary and in any case who had experience of such as this the do had been standing at the window whitefaced trembling but now he snatched up a machinepistol and rushed through to galenski where he backed away from the outer door to the landing on his way he grabbed blast grenades from dragosanis desk at least he is a man thought dragosani grudgingly then came the dos yelp of horror his cursing the chatter of his machinepistol finally the tearing explosion of grenades where he armed them and dropped them down the stairwell and coming immediately after the thunder of the explosives the last message from the unknown callsign no no mother in heaven my gunner has shot himself and now theyre coming through the gun slits hands without arms heads without bodies i think i shall have to follow my gunner for he is out of all this now but theseremains they crawl among the grenades no stop that there came the distinct chching of a grenade armed more screaming and gibbering and sounds of chaos and finally a massive burst of static following which nothing the radio sat and hissed background static at itself and suddenly the chateau bronnitsy seemed very quiet it was a quiet which couldnt last as the do backed into galenskis office from the landing where smoke and cordite stench curled up acridly from below so harry keogh and his tartar companions emerged from the mobius continuum they were there in the anteroom as if someone had suddenly switched them on the do heard galenskis wail of abject terror and disbelief whirled in a halfcircle and saw what galenski had seen a grim smokegrimed young man flanked by menacing mummythings of black leather and gleaming white bone the sight of them alone right here in this room with him was almost sufficient to freeze him unman him but not quite life was dear lips drawn back in a rictus of desperation and fear the do gurgled something meaningless and swung up his machinepistolonly to be lifted off his feet and thrown back out onto the landing his face turning to raw pulp as harry discharged his last cartridge at pointblank range in another moment harrys companions had turned their attention to galenski where he gibbered and grovelled in a corner behind his desk and harry had stepped through into what was once gregor borowitzs inner sanctum dragosani in the act of hurling the extinct radio from its table turned and saw him his great jaws gaped his surprise pointing an unsteady hand he hissed like a snake his red eyes blazing and for the merest moment the two faced each other there had been dramatic changes in both men but in dragosani the differences could only be likened to a complete metamorphosis harry recognised him yes but in any other situation he could hardly have known him as for harry himself little of his former personality or identity remained he had inherited a great sum of talents and now surely transcended homo sapiens indeed both men were alien beings and in that frozen moment as they stared at each other they knew it then dragosani saw the shotgun in harrys hands but couldnt know it was useless hissing his hatred and expecting at any moment to hear the weapons roar he bounded to borowitzs great oak desk and fumbled for a machinepistol harry reversed the shotgun stepped forward and dealt the necromancer a crashing blow to the head and neck where he scrabbled at the desk dragosani was knocked flying the machinepistol thudding to the carpeted floor he collided with a wall and for a moment stood there spreadeagled then went into a crouch and now he saw that the shotgun in harrys hands was broken where the stock joined the barrels saw harrys eyes frantically searching the room for another weapon saw that he had the advantage and needed no weapon made by men to finish this thing galenskis bubbling screams from the anteroom were suddenly cut off harry backed towards the halfopen door dragosani wasnt about to let him go he leaped forward grabbed him by the shoulder and held him effortlessly with one hand at arms length hypnotised by the sheer horror of the mans face harry found it impossible to look away he panted for air felt himself squeezed dry by the awesome power of this creature aye pant growled dragosani pant like a dog harry keogh and die like a dog and he bayed a laugh like nothing harry had ever heard before still holding his victim now the necromancer crouched down into himself and his jaws opened wide needle teeth dripped slime and something moved in his gaping mouth which wasnt quite a tongue his nose seemed to flatten to his face and grew ridged like the convoluted snout of a bat and one scarlet eye bulged hideously while the other narrowed to a mere slit harry stared directly into hell and couldnt look away and knowing hed won finally dragosani hurled his bolt of mental horror at which precise moment the door behind harry crashed open and threw him from the necromancers grasp the door gave him cover where he fell to the floor while at the same time another stepped creakingly into the room to take the full force of dragosanis blast and seeing what had entered too late dragosani remembered max batus warning how one must never curse the dead for the dead cant die twice the bolt was deflected reflected turned upon dragosani himself in batus story a man had been shrivelled by just such a blast but in dragosanis case it wasnt as bad as that or perhaps it was worse he seemed picked up in some giants fist and hurled across the room bones snapped in his legs where they hit the desk and he was set spinning by his own momentum the wall brought him up short again but this time he crumpled to the floor and clawing himself up into a seated position he screamed continuously in a voice like a giants chalk on slate his broken legs flopped on floor as if they were made of rubber and he flailed his arms spastically blindly in the air before his face blindly yes for that was where his own mindblast had struck home his eyes coming from behind the shielding door harry saw the necromancer sitting there and gasped it was as if dragosanis eyes had exploded from within their centres were craters in his face with threads of crimson gristle hanging down on to his hollow cheeks harry knew it was over then and the shock of it all caught up with him sickened he turned away from dragosani saw his henchmen waiting finish it he told them and they creakingly advanced on the stricken monster dragosani was quite blind now and so too the vampire within him which had seen with his eyes but immature though the creature was still its alien senses were sufficiently developed to recognise the inexorable approach of black permanent oblivion it sensed the stake held in the mummied claw knew that a rusted sword was even now raised high ruined shell that he was dragosani was no use to the vampire now and evil spirit that it was it came out of him as if exorcised he stopped screaming choked clawed at his throat froth and blood flew as his jaws opened impossibly wide and he began to shake his monstrous head frantically to and fro his entire body was going into convulsions beginning to vibrate as the pain within grew greater than that of ruptured eyes and broken bones any other must surely have died there and then but dragosani was no other his neck grew fat and his grey face turned crimson then blue the vampire withdrew itself from his brain uncoiled from his inner organs tore itself loose from nerves and spinal cord it formed barbs used them to drag itself headfirst up the column of his throat and out of him slopping blood and mucus he coughed the thing endlessly on to his chest and there it coiled a great leech its flat head swaying like that of a cobra scarlet with the blood of its host and there the stake pinned it passed through the vampires pulsating body and into dragosani driven home by hands that shed small bones even as they secured the horror in its place and a single stroke from the second tartars whistling sword completed the job striking its flat loathsome head free from its madly whipping body emptied tortured very nearly mindless dragosani lay there his arms flopping and as harry keogh said and now finish him so the necromancers twitching hand found the machinepistol where it had fallen to the carpeted floor somewhere in his burning brain he had recognised keoghs voice and even knowing he was dying still his evil and vengeful nature surfaced one last time yes he was going but he would not go alone the weapon in his crablike hands coughed once stuttered briefly then chattered a continuous stream of mechanical obscenities until its vocabulary and magazine were empty which was perhaps half a second after an ancient tartar sword had split dragosanis monstrous skull open from ear to ear pain searing pain and death for both of them almost cut in half harry found a mobius door and toppled through it but pointless to take his shattered body with him that was finished now mind was all and as he entered the mobius continuum so he reached out and guided dragged the necromancers mind with him now the pain was finished for both of them and dragosanis first thought was where am i where i want you harry told him he found the door to pasttime and opened it from dragosanis mind a thin red light streamed out amidst the blue brilliance it was the trail of his vampireridden past follow that said harry expelling dragosani through the door falling into the past dragosani clung to his pastlife thread and was drawn back back and he couldnt leave that scarlet thread even if he wanted to for it was him harry watched the scarlet thread winding back on itself taking dragosani with it then searched out and found the door to the future somewhere out there his broken lifethread continued began again all he had to do was find it and so he hurled himself into the blue infinity of tomorrow final interval alec kyle glanced at his watch it was pm and he was already fifteen minutes late for his allimportant governmental board but time however relative had flown and kyle felt desiccated the papers in front of him had grown to a thick sheaf his whole body was cramped and the muscles in his right hand wrist and arm felt tied in knots he couldnt write another word ive missed the board he said and hardly recognised his own voice the words came out in a dry croak he tried to laugh and managed a cough also i think im missing a couple of pounds i havent moved from this chair in over seven hours but its been the best days exercise ive had in years my suit feels loose on me and dirty the spectre nodded i know he said and im sorry ive taxed your mind and body both but dont you think it was worth it worth it kyle laughed again and this time made it the soviet ebranch is destroyed will be the other corrected him a week from now and you ask if its been worth it oh yes then his face fell but ive missed the board that was important not really the spectre told him anyway you didnt miss it or rather you did but i didnt kyle frowned shook his head i dont understand time the other began is relative kyle finished it for him in a gasp the spectre smiled theres a door to all times out there on the mobius strip i am here but im also there they might have given you a hard time but not me gormleys work your work and mine goes on youll get all the help you need and no hassle kyle slowly closed his mouth let his brain reel for a moment until it steadied itself he felt weary now worn out i expect youll want to be going now he said but there are still a couple of things id like to ask you i mean i know who you are for you couldnt be anyone else but yes well where are you now i mean your now whats your base where is it are you speaking to me from the mobius continuum or through it harry where are you again the spectres patient smile ask instead who are you he said and answered im still harry keogh harry keogh junior kyles mouth once more fell open it was all there in his notes but it hadnt jelled until now now the pieces fell into place but brenda i mean your wife was due to die her death has been foretold and how can anyone change or avoid the future you yourself have shown how thats impossible harry nodded she will die he said briefly in childbirth shell die but the dead wont accept her the dead wont kyle was lost death is a place beyond the body said harry the dead have their own existence some of them knew it but most didnt now they do it will change nothing in the world of the living but it means a lot to the dead also they understand that life is precious they know because theyve lost it if brenda dies my life too will be in jeopardy thats something they cant allow they owe me you see they wont accept her you mean theyll give her life back to her in a nutshell yes there are brilliant talents there in the netherworld alec a billion of them theres not much they cant do if they really want to as for my own epitaph that was just my mother being overprotective and pessimistic his outline began to shimmer and the light from the windows seemed to glance more readily through him and now i think its time i wait said kyle starting to his feet wait please just one more thing harry raised ghostly eyebrows but i thought id explained it all and even if i havent im sure youll work it out kyle quickly nodded his agreement im sure i will think all except why why did you bother to come back and tell me simple said harry my son will be me but he will have his own personality he will be his own being i dont know how much of the real me will get through to him thats all there might be times when he we need reminding one things certain though hell be a very talented boy and at last kyle understood you want me us the branch to sort of look after him is that it thats it said harry keogh beginning to fade away shimmering now with a strange blue light as though composed of a million fibrethin neons youll look after him until hes ready to start looking after you all of you do you think you can do that kyle stumbled out from behind his desk held out his arms to the shimmering rapidly diminishing spectral thing oh yes yes we can do that thats all i ask said harry and also that you look after his mother the blue shimmer became a haze snapped into a single vertical line or tube of electric blue light shortened to a single point of blinding blue fire at eyelevel and blinked out and kyle knew that keogh had gone to be born well do it harry he shouted hoarsely feeling tears hot on his cheeks and not knowing why he cried well do itharry epilogue dragosani fell into his own past along the vampire lifethread but not very far for all that it was short it was a journey which left him dazed and frightened but at its end he once again found himself clothed in flesh and clothed in more than flesh a body surrounded him yes and also a mind other than his own he was part of someone else and the other was also blind or buried for even now his unknown host struggled to rise up from a shallow grave from the blackness of a night centuries long from the bitter imprisonment of the soil there was no time to consider the implications no time even to declare his presence to the other dragosani felt stifled smothered yet again on the brink of oblivion he had known enough of pain and wanted no more of it he added his own will to that of his host and strove for the surface and above him suddenly the earth cracked open and host and dragosani both sat up scabs of earth fell from them as they turned their head to gaze all about it was night but overhead viewed through the black twining branches of trees stars gleamed bright in a cold sky dragosani could see butdidnt he know this place someone stood there in the darkness staring at him where he sat halfin halfout of the earth dragosanis vision cleared along with that of his host and the shock he felt then was like a sledgehammer blow to his still teetering mind ii can seeyou he rumbled he saw he knew and terror gibbered again in the night of the cruciform hills then there was a second figure in the darkness a squat figure whose voice was soft when he said ho thing from the earth and in another moment the sighing thud of his lignum vitae bolt where it crashed through the host body and was wedged there then dragosani added his voice to that of his awful host in a hissing shriek and tried to draw down again into the earth but there was no escape and he knew there was no escape he couldnt believe it it couldnt end like this wait he croaked with his hosts voice as the first figure staggered closer holding something that gleamed bright in starlight cant you see its me but the other dragosani didnt know couldnt understand wouldnt wait and the sickle he carried became a blur of steel as it struck home with an irresistible force fool damned fool ferenczydragosani howled from a head already flying free and he knew that this was only one of many agonies many deaths in the unending scarlet loop of his mobius existence it had happened before was happening now would happen againand againand again and fool his
