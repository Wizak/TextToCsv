roald dahl the twits hairy faces what a lot of hairyfaced men there are around nowadays when a man grows hair all over his face it is impossible to tell what he really looks like perhaps thats why he does it hed rather you didnt know then theres the problem of washing when the very hairy ones wash their faces it must be as big a job as when you and i wash the hair on our heads so what i want to know is this how often do all these hairyfaced men wash their faces is it only once a week like us on sunday nights and do they shampoo it do they use a hairdryer do they rub hairtonic in to stop their faces from going bald do they go to a barber to have their hairy faces cut and trimmed or do they do it themselves in front of the bathroom mirror with nailscissors i dont know but next time you see a man with a hairy face maybe you will look at him more closely and start wondering about some of these things mr twit mr twit was one of these very hairyfaced men the whole of his face except for his forehead his eyes and his nose was covered with thick hair the stuff even sprouted in revolting tufts out of his nostrils and earholes mr twit felt that this hairiness made him look terrifically wise and grand but in truth he was neither of these things mr twit was a twit he was born a twit and now at the age of sixty he was a bigger twit than ever the hair on mr twits face didnt grow smooth and matted as it does on most hairyfaced men it grew in spikes that stuck out straight like the bristles of a nailbrush and how often did mr twit wash this bristly nailbrushy face of his the answer is never not even on sundays he hadnt washed it for years dirty beards as you know an ordinary unhairy face like yours or mine simply gets a bit smudgy if it is not washed often enough and theres nothing so awful about that but a hairy face is a very different matter things cling to hairs especially food things like gravy go right in among the hairs and stay there you and i can wipe our smooth faces with a flannel and we quickly look more or less all right again but the hairy man cannot do that we can also if we are careful eat our meals without spreading food all over our faces but not so the hairy man watch carefully next time you see a hairy man eating his lunch and you will notice that even if he opens his mouth very wide it is impossible for him to get a spoonful of beefstew or icecream and chocolate sauce into it without leaving some of it on the hairs mr twit didnt even bother to open his mouth wide when he ate as a result there were always hundreds of bits of old breakfasts and lunches and suppers sticking to the hairs around his face they werent big bits mind you because he used to wipe those off with the back of his hand or on his sleeve while he was eating but if you looked closely you would see tiny little specks of driedup scrambled eggs stuck to the hairs and spinach and tomato ketchup and fish fingers and minced chicken livers and all the other disgusting things mr twit liked to eat if you looked closer still if you peered deep into the moustachy bristles sticking out over his upper lip you would probably see much larger objects that had escaped the wipe of his hand things that had been there for months and months like a piece of maggoty green cheese or a mouldy old cornflake or even the slimy tail of a tinned sardine because of all this mr twit never went really hungry by sticking out his tongue and curling it sideways to explore the hairy jungle around his mouth he was always able to find a tasty morsel here and there to nibble on what i am trying to tell you is that mr twit was a foul and smelly old man he was also an extremely horrid old man as you will find out in a moment mrs twit mrs twit was no better than her husband she did not of course have a hairy face it was a pity she didnt because that at any rate would have hidden some of her fearful ugliness take a look at her have you ever seen a woman with an uglier face than that i doubt it but the funny thing is that mrs twit wasnt born ugly shed had quite a nice face when she was young the ugliness had grown upon her year by year as she got older why would that happen ill tell you why if a person has ugly thoughts it begins to show on the face and when that person has ugly thoughts every day every week every year the face gets uglier and uglier until it gets so ugly you can hardly bear to look at it a person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly you can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stickout teeth but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely nothing shone out of mrs twits face in her right hand she carried a walkingstick she used to tell people that this was because she had warts growing on the sole of her left foot and walking was painful but the real reason she carried a stick was so that she could hit things with it things like dogs and cats and small children and then there was the glass eye mrs twit had a glass eye that was always looking the other way the glass eye you can play a lot of tricks with a glass eye because you can take it out and pop it back in again any time you like you can bet your life mrs twit knew all the tricks one morning she took out her glass eye and dropped it into mr twits mug of beer when he wasnt looking mr twit sat there drinking the beer slowly the froth made a white ring on the hairs around his mouth he wiped the white froth on to his sleeve and wiped his sleeve on his trousers youre plotting something mrs twit said keeping her back turned so he wouldnt see that she had taken out her glass eye whenever you go all quiet like that i know very well youre plotting something mrs twit was right mr twit was plotting away like mad he was trying to think up a really nasty trick he could play on his wife that day youd better be careful mrs twit said because when i see you starting to plot i watch you like a wombat oh do shut up you old hag mr twit said he went on drinking his beer and his evil mind kept working away on the latest horrid trick he was going to play on the old woman suddenly as mr twit tipped the last drop of beer down his throat he caught sight of mrs twits awful glass eye staring up at him from the bottom of the mug it made him jump i told you i was watching you cackled mrs twit ive got eyes everywhere so youd better be careful the frog to pay her back for the glass eye in his beer mr twit decided he would put a frog in mrs twits bed he caught a big one down by the pond and carried it back secretly in a box that night when mrs twit was in the bathroom getting ready for bed mr twit slipped the frog between her sheets then he got into his own bed and waited for the fun to begin mrs twit came back and climbed into her bed and put out the light she lay there in the dark scratching her tummy her tummy was itching dirty old hags like her always have itchy tummies then all at once she felt something cold and slimy crawling over her feet she screamed whats the matter with you mr twit said help screamed mrs twit bouncing about theres something in my bed ill bet its that giant skillywiggler i saw on the floor just now mr twit said that what screamed mrs twit i tried to kill it but it got away mr twit said its got teeth like screwdrivers help screamed mrs twit save me its all over my feet itll bite off your toes said mr twit mrs twit fainted mr twit got out of bed and fetched a jug of cold water he poured the water over mrs twits head to revive her the frog crawled up from under the sheets to get near the water it started jumping about on the pillow frogs love water this one was having a good time when mrs twit came to the frog had just jumped on to her face this is not a nice thing to happen to anyone in bed at night she screamed again by golly it is a giant skillywiggler mr twit said itll bite off your nose mrs twit leapt out of bed and flew downstairs and spent the night on the sofa the frog went to sleep on her pillow the wormy spaghetti the next day to pay mr twit back for the frog trick mrs twit sneaked out into the garden and dug up some worms she chose big long ones and put them in a tin and carried the tin back to the house under her apron at one oclock she cooked spaghetti for lunch and she mixed the worms in with the spaghetti but only on her husbands plate the worms didnt show because everything was covered with tomato sauce and sprinkled with cheese hey my spaghettis moving cried mr twit poking around in it with his fork its a new kind mrs twit said taking a mouthful from her own plate which of course had no worms its called squiggly spaghetti its delicious eat it up while its nice and hot mr twit started eating twisting the long tomatocovered strings around his fork and shovelling them into his mouth soon there was tomato sauce all over his hairy chin its not as good as the ordinary kind he said talking with his mouth full its too squishy i find it very tasty mrs twit said she was watching him from the other end of the table it gave her great pleasure to watch him eating worms i find it rather bitter mr twit said its got a distinctly bitter flavour buy the other kind next time mrs twit waited until mr twit had eaten the whole plateful then she said you want to know why your spaghetti was squishy mr twit wiped the tomato sauce from his beard with a corner of the tablecloth why he said and why it had a nasty bitter taste why he said because it was worms cried mrs twit clapping her hands and stamping her feet on the floor and rocking with horrible laughter the funny walkingstick to pay mrs twit back for the worms in his spaghetti mr twit thought up a really clever nasty trick one night when the old woman was asleep he crept out of bed and took her walkingstick downstairs to his workshed there he stuck a tiny round piece of wood on to the bottom of the stick this made the stick longer but the difference was so small the next morning mrs twit didnt notice it the following night mr twit stuck on another tiny bit of wood every night he crept downstairs and added an extra tiny thickness of wood to the end of the walkingstick he did it very neatly so that the extra bits looked like a part of the old stick gradually but oh so gradually mrs twits walkingstick was getting longer and longer now when something is growing very slowly it is almost impossible to notice it happening you yourself for example are actually growing taller every day that goes by but you wouldnt think it would you its happening so slowly you cant even notice it from one week to the next it was the same with mrs twits walkingstick it was all so slow and gradual that she didnt notice how long it was getting even when it was halfway up to her shoulder that sticks too long for you mr twit said to her one day why so it is mrs twit said looking at the stick ive had a feeling there was something wrong but i couldnt for the life of me think what it was theres something wrong all right mr twit said beginning to enjoy himself what can have happened mrs twit said staring at her old walkingstick it must suddenly have grown longer dont be a fool mr twit said how can a walkingstick possibly grow longer its made of dead wood isnt it dead wood cant grow then what on earth has happened cried mrs twit its not the stick its you said mr twit grinning horribly its you thats getting shorter ive been noticing it for some time now thats not true cried mrs twit youre shrinking woman said mr twit its not possible oh yes it jolly well is said mr twit youre shrinking fast youre shrinking dangerously fast why you must have shrunk at least a foot in the last few days never she cried of course you have take a look at your stick you old goat and see how much youve shrunk in comparison youve got the shrinks thats what youve got youve got the dreaded shrinks mrs twit began to feel so trembly she had to sit down mrs twit has the shrinks as soon as mrs twit sat down mr twit pointed at her and shouted there you are youre sitting in your old chair and youve shrunk so much your feet arent even touching the ground mrs twit looked down at her feet and by golly the man was right her feet were not touching the ground mr twit you see had been just as clever with the chair as hed been with the walkingstick every night when he had gone downstairs and stuck a little bit extra on to the stick he had done the same to the four legs of mrs twits chair just look at you sitting there in your same old chair he cried and youve shrunk so much your feet are dangling in the air mrs twit went white with fear youve got the shrinks cried mr twit pointing his finger at her like a pistol youve got them badly youve got the most terrible case of shrinks ive ever seen mrs twit became so frightened she began to dribble but mr twit still remembering the worms in his spaghetti didnt feel sorry for her at all i suppose you know what happens to you when you get the shrinks he said what gasped mrs twit what happens your head shrinks into your neck and your neck shrinks into your body and your body shrinks into your legs and your legs shrink into your feet and in the end theres nothing left except a pair of shoes and a bundle of old clothes i cant bear it cried mrs twit its a terrible disease said mr twit the worst in the world how long have i got cried mrs twit how long before i finish up as a bundle of old clothes and a pair of shoes mr twit put on a very solemn face at the rate youre going he said shaking his head sadly id say not more than ten or eleven days but isnt there anything we can do cried mrs twit theres only one cure for the shrinks said mr twit tell me she cried oh tell me quickly well have to hurry said mr twit im ready ill hurry ill do anything you say cried mrs twit you wont last long if you dont said mr twit giving her another grizzly grin what is it i must do cried mrs twit clutching her cheeks youve got to be stretched said mr twit mrs twit gets a stretching mr twit led mrs twit outdoors where he had everything ready for the great stretching he had one hundred balloons and lots of string he had a gas cylinder for filling the balloons he had fixed an iron ring into the ground stand here he said pointing to the iron ring he then tied mrs twits ankles to the iron ring when that was done he began filling the balloons with gas each balloon was on a long string and when it was filled with gas it pulled on its string trying to go up and up mr twit tied the ends of the strings to the top half of mrs twits body some he tied round her neck some under her arms some to her wrists and some even to her hair soon there were fifty coloured balloons floating in the air above mrs twits head can you feel them stretching you asked mr twit i can i can cried mrs twit theyre stretching me like mad he put on another ten balloons the upward pull became very strong mrs twit was quite helpless now with her feet tied to the ground and her arms pulled upwards by the balloons she was unable to move she was a prisoner and mr twit had intended to go away and leave her like that for a couple of days and nights to teach her a lesson in fact he was just about to leave when mrs twit opened her big mouth and said something silly are you sure my feet are tied properly to the ground she gasped if those strings around my ankles break itll be goodbye for me and thats what gave mr twit his second nasty idea mrs twit goes ballooning up theres enough pull here to take me to the moon mrs twit cried out to take you to the moon exclaimed mr twit what a ghastly thought we wouldnt want anything like that to happen oh dear me no we most certainly wouldnt cried mrs twit put some more string around my ankles quickly i want to feel absolutely safe very well my angel said mr twit and with a ghoulish grin on his lips he knelt down at her feet he took a knife from his pocket and with one quick slash he cut through the strings holding mrs twits ankles to the iron ring she went up like a rocket help she screamed save me but there was no saving her now in a few seconds she was high up in the blue sky and climbing fast mr twit stood below looking up what a pretty sight he said to himself how lovely all those balloons look in the sky and what a marvellous bit of luck for me at last the old hag is lost and gone for ever mrs twit comes ballooning down mrs twit may have been ugly and she may have been beastly but she was not stupid high up there in the sky she had a bright idea if i can get rid of some of these balloons she said to herself i will stop going up and start to come down she began biting through the strings that held the balloons to her wrists and arms and neck and hair each time she bit through a string and let the balloon float away the upward pull got less and her rate of climb slowed down when she had bitten through twenty strings she stopped going up altogether she stayed still in the air she bit through one more string very very slowly she began to float downwards it was a calm day there was no wind at all and because of this mrs twit had gone absolutely straight up she now began to come absolutely straight down as she floated gently down mrs twits petticoat billowed out like a parachute showing her long knickers it was a grand sight on a glorious day and thousands of birds came flying in from miles around to stare at this extraordinary old woman in the sky mr twit gets a horrid shock mr twit who thought he had seen his ugly wife for the last time was sitting in the garden celebrating with a mug of beer silently mrs twit came floating down when she was about the height of the house above mr twit she suddenly called out at the top of her voice here i come you grizzly old grunion you rotten old turnip you filthy old frumpet mr twit jumped as though hed been stung by a giant wasp he dropped his beer he looked up he gaped he gasped he gurgled a few choking sounds came out of his mouth ughhhhhhhh he said arghhhhhhhh ouchhhhhhhh ill get you for this shouted mrs twit she was floating down right on top of him she was purple with rage and slashing the air with her long walkingstick which she had somehow managed to hang on to all the time ill swish you to a swazzle she shouted ill swash you to a swizzle ill gnash you to a gnozzle ill gnosh you to a gnazzle and before mr twit had time to run away this bundle of balloons and petticoats and fiery fury landed right on top of him lashing out with the stick and cracking him all over his body the house the tree and the monkey cage but thats enough of that we cant go on for ever watching these two disgusting people doing disgusting things to each other we must get ahead with the story here is a picture of mr and mrs twits house and garden some house it looks like a prison and not a window anywhere who wants windows mr twit had said when they were building it who wants every tom dick and harry peeping in to see what youre doing it didnt occur to mr twit that windows were meant mainly for looking out of not for looking into and what do you think of that ghastly garden mrs twit was the gardener she was very good at growing thistles and stingingnettles i always grow plenty of spiky thistles and plenty of stingingnettles she used to say they keep out nasty nosey little children near the house you can see mr twits workshed to one side there is the big dead tree it never has any leaves on it because its dead and not far from the tree you can see the monkey cage there are four monkeys in it they belong to mr twit you will hear about them later hugtight sticky glue once a week on wednesdays the twits had bird pie for supper mr twit caught the birds and mrs twit cooked them mr twit was good at catching birds on the day before bird pie day he would put the ladder up against the big dead tree and climb into the branches with a bucket of glue and a paintbrush the glue he used was something called hugtight and it was stickier than any other glue in the world he would paint it along the tops of all the branches and then go away as the sun went down birds would fly in from all around to roost for the night in the big dead tree they didnt know poor things that the branches were all smeared with horrible hugtight the moment they landed on a branch their feet stuck and that was that the next morning which was bird pie day mr twit would climb up the ladder again and grab all the wretched birds that were stuck to the tree it didnt matter what kind they were song thrushes blackbirds sparrows crows little jenny wrens robins anything they all went into the pot for wednesdays bird pie supper four sticky little boys on one tuesday evening after mr twit had been up the ladder and smeared the tree with hugtight four little boys crept into the garden to look at the monkeys they didnt care about the thistles and stingingnettles not when there were monkeys to look at after a while they got tired of looking at the monkeys so they explored further into the garden and found the ladder leaning against the big dead tree they decided to climb up it just for fun theres nothing wrong with that the next morning when mr twit went out to collect the birds he found four miserable little boys sitting in the tree stuck as tight as could be by the seats of their pants to the branches there were no birds because the presence of the boys had scared them away mr twit was furious as there are no birds for my pie tonight he shouted then itll have to be boys instead he started to climb the ladder boy pie might be better than bird pie he went on grinning horribly more meat and not so many tiny little bones the boys were terrified hes going to boil us cried one of them hell stew us alive wailed the second one hell cook us with carrots cried the third but the fourth little boy who had more sense than the others whispered listen ive just had an idea we are only stuck by the seats of our pants so quick unbutton your pants and slip out of them and fall to the ground mr twit had reached the top of the ladder and was just about to make a grab for the nearest boy when they all suddenly tumbled out of the tree and ran for home with their naked bottoms winking at the sun the great upside down monkey circus now for the monkeys the four monkeys in the cage in the garden were all one family they were mugglewump and his wife and their two small children but what on earth were mr and mrs twit doing with monkeys in their garden well in the old days they had both worked in a circus as monkey trainers they used to teach monkeys to do tricks and to dress up in human clothes and to smoke pipes and all the rest of that nonsense today although they were retired mr twit still wanted to train monkeys it was his dream that one day he would own the first great upside down monkey circus in the world that meant that the monkeys had to do everything upside down they had to dance upside down they had to play football upside down they had to balance one on top of the other upside down with mugglewump at the bottom and the smallest baby monkey at the very top they even had to eat and drink upside down and that is not an easy thing to do because the food and water has to go up your throat instead of down it in fact it is almost impossible but the monkeys simply had to do it otherwise they got nothing all this sounds pretty silly to you and me it sounded pretty silly to the monkeys too they absolutely hated having to do this upside down nonsense day after day it made them giddy standing on their heads for hours on end sometimes the two small monkey children would faint with so much blood going to their heads but mr twit didnt care about that he kept them practising for six hours every day and if they didnt do as they were told mrs twit would soon come running with her beastly stick the rolypoly bird to the rescue mugglewump and his family longed to escape from the cage in mr twits garden and go back to the african jungle where they came from they hated mr and mrs twit for making their lives so miserable they also hated them for what they did to the birds every tuesday and wednesday fly away birds they used to shout jumping about in the cage and waving their arms dont sit on that big dead tree its just been smeared all over with sticky glue go and sit somewhere else but these were english birds and they couldnt understand the weird african language the monkeys spoke so they took no notice and went on using the big dead tree and getting caught for mrs twits bird pie then one day a truly magnificent bird flew down out of the sky and landed on the monkey cage good heavens cried all the monkeys together its the rolypoly bird what on earth are you doing over here in england rolypoly bird like the monkeys the rolypoly bird came from africa and he spoke the same language as they did ive come for a holiday said the rolypoly bird i like to travel he fluffed his marvellous coloured feathers and looked down rather grandly at the monkeys for most people he went on flying away on holiday is very expensive but i can fly anywhere in the world for nothing do you know how to talk to these english birds mugglewump asked him of course i do said the rolypoly bird its no good going to a country and not knowing the language then we must hurry said mugglewump today is tuesday and over there you can already see the revolting mr twit up the ladder painting sticky glue on all the branches of the big dead tree this evening when the birds come in to roost you must warn them not to perch on that tree or they will be made into bird pie that evening the rolypoly bird flew round and round the big dead tree singing out theres sticky stick stuff all over the tree if you land in the branches youll never get free so fly away fly away stay up high or youll finish up tomorrow in a hot bird pie no bird pie for mr twit the next morning when mr twit came out with his huge basket to snatch all the birds from the big dead tree there wasnt a single one on it they were all sitting on top of the monkey cage the rolypoly bird was there as well and mugglewump and his family were inside the cage and the whole lot of them were laughing at mr twit still no bird pie for mr twit mr twit wasnt going to wait another week for his bird pie supper he loved bird pie it was his favourite meal so that very same day he went after the birds again this time he smeared all the top bars of the monkey cage with sticky glue as well as the branches of the big dead tree now ill get you he said whichever one you sit on the monkeys crouched inside the cage watching all this and later on when the rolypoly bird came swooping in for an evening chat they shouted out dont land on our cage rolypoly bird its covered in sticky glue so is the tree and that evening as the sun went down and all the birds came in again to roost the rolypoly bird flew round and round the monkey cage and the big dead tree singing out his warning theres sticky stuff now on the cage and the tree if you land on either youll never get free so fly away fly away stay up high or youll finish up tomorrow in a hot bird pie mr and mrs twit go off to buy guns the next morning when mr twit came out with his huge basket not a single bird was sitting on either the monkey cage or the big dead tree they were all perched happily on the roof of mr twits house the rolypoly bird was up there as well and the monkeys were in the cage and the whole lot of them were hooting with laughter at mr twit ill wipe that silly laugh off your beaks mr twit screamed at the birds ill get you next time you filthy feathery frumps ill wring your necks the whole lot of you and have you bubbling in the pot for bird pie before this day is out how are you going to do that asked mrs twit who had come outside to see what all the noise was about i wont have you smearing sticky glue all over the roof of our house mr twit got very excited ive got a great idea he cried he didnt bother to keep his voice down because he didnt think the monkeys could understand well both go into town right away and well buy a gun each he shouted hows that brilliant cried mrs twit grinning and showing her long yellow teeth well buy those big shotguns that spray out fifty bullets or more with each bang exactly said mr twit lock up the house while i go and make sure the monkeys are safely shut away mr twit went over to the monkey cage attention he barked in his fearsome monkeytrainers voice upside down all of you and jump to it one on top of the other quick get on with it or youll feel mrs twits stick across your backsides obediently the poor monkeys stood on their hands and clambered one on top of the other with mugglewump at the bottom and the smallest child at the very top now stay there till we come back mr twit ordered dont you dare to move and dont overbalance when we return in two or three hours time i shall expect to find you all in exactly the same position as you are now you understand with that mr twit marched away mrs twit went with him and the monkeys were left alone with the birds mugglewump has an idea as soon as mr and mrs twit had disappeared down the road the monkeys all flipped back on to their feet the right way up quick get the key mugglewump called out to the rolypoly bird who was still sitting on the roof of the house what key shouted the rolypoly bird the key to the door of our cage cried mugglewump its hanging on a nail in the workshed thats where he always puts it the rolypoly bird flew down and came back with the key in his beak mugglewump reached a hand through the bars of the cage and took the key he put it in the lock and turned it the door opened all four monkeys leapt out together we are free cried the two little ones where shall we go dad where shall we hide dont get excited said mugglewump calm down everybody before we escape from this beastly place we have one very important thing to do what they asked him were going to turn those terrible twits upside down were going to what they cried you must be joking dad im not joking mugglewump said were going to turn both mr and mrs twit upside down with their legs in the air dont be ridiculous the rolypoly bird said how can we possibly turn those two maggoty old monsters upside down we can we can cried mugglewump we are going to make them stand on their heads for hours and hours perhaps for ever let them see what it feels like for a change how said the rolypoly bird just tell me how mugglewump laid his head on one side and a tiny twinkling little smile touched the corners of his mouth now and again he said but not very often i have a brilliant idea this is one of them follow me my friends follow me he scampered off towards the house and the three other monkeys and the rolypoly bird went after him buckets and paintbrushes cried mugglewump thats what we want next there are plenty in the workshed hurry up everyone get a bucket and a paintbrush inside mr twits workshed there was an enormous barrel of hugtight sticky glue the stuff he used for catching birds fill your buckets mugglewump ordered we are now going into the big house mrs twit had hidden the key to the front door under the mat and mugglewump had seen her doing it so it was easy for them to get in in they went all four monkeys with their buckets of sticky glue then came the rolypoly bird flying in after them with a bucket in his beak and a brush in his claw the great glue painting begins this is the livingroom announced mugglewump the grand and glorious livingroom where those two fearful frumptious freaks eat bird pie every week for supper please dont mention bird pie again said the rolypoly bird it gives me the shudders we mustnt waste time cried mugglewump hurry up hurry up now the first thing is this i want everyone to paint sticky glue all over the ceiling cover it all smear it in every corner over the ceiling they cried why the ceiling never mind why shouted mugglewump just do as youre told and dont argue but how do we get up there they asked we cant reach monkeys can reach anywhere shouted mugglewump he was in a frenzy of excitement now waving his paintbrush and his bucket and leaping about all over the room come on come on jump on the table stand on the chairs hop on each others shoulders rolypoly can do it flying dont stand there gaping we have to hurry dont you understand that those terrible twits will be back any moment and this time theyll have guns get on with it for heavens sake get on with it and so the great gluepainting of the ceiling began all the other birds who had been sitting on the roof flew in to help carrying paintbrushes in their claws and beaks there were buzzards magpies rooks ravens and many more everyone was splashing away like mad and with so many helpers the job was soon finished the carpet goes on the ceiling what now they all said looking at mugglewump ahha cried mugglewump now for the fun now for the greatest upside down trick of all time are you ready were ready said the monkeys were ready said the birds pull out the carpet shouted mugglewump pull this huge carpet out from under the furniture and stick it on to the ceiling on to the ceiling cried one of the small monkeys but thats impossible dad ill stick you on to the ceiling if you dont shut up snapped mugglewump hes dotty they cried hes balmy hes batty hes nutty hes screwy hes wacky cried the rolypoly bird poor old muggles has gone off his wump at last oh do stop shouting such rubbish and give me a hand said mugglewump catching hold of one corner of the carpet pull you nitwits pull the carpet was enormous it covered the entire floor from wall to wall it had a red and gold pattern on it it is not easy to pull an enormous carpet off the floor when the room is full of tables and chairs pull yelled mugglewump pull pull pull he was like a demon hopping round the room and telling everyone what to do but you couldnt blame him after months and months of standing on his head with his family he couldnt wait for the time when the terrible twits would be doing the same thing at least thats what he hoped with the monkeys and the birds all pulling and puffing the carpet was dragged off the floor and finally hoisted up on to the ceiling and there it stuck all at once the whole ceiling of the livingroom was carpeted in red and gold the furniture goes up now the table the big table shouted mugglewump turn the table upside down and put a dollop of sticky glue on to the bottom of each leg then we shall stick that on to the ceiling as well hoisting the huge table upside down on to the ceiling was not an easy job but they managed it in the end will it stay there they cried is the glue strong enough to hold it up its the strongest glue in the world mugglewump replied its the special birdcatching birdkilling glue for smearing on trees please said the rolypoly bird i have asked you before not to mention that subject how would you like it if it was monkey pie they made every wednesday and all your friends had been boiled up and i went on talking about it i do beg your pardon said mugglewump im so excited i hardly know what im saying now the chairs do the same with the chairs all the chairs must be stuck upside down to the ceiling and in their right places oh do hurry up everybody any moment now those two filthy freaks are going to come rushing in with their guns the monkeys with the birds helping them put glue on the bottom of each chair leg and hoisted them up to the ceiling now the smaller tables shouted mugglewump and the big sofa and the sideboard and the lamps and all the tiny little things the ashtrays the ornaments and that beastly plastic gnome on the sideboard everything absolutely everything must be stuck to the ceiling it was terribly hard work it was especially difficult to stick everything on to the ceiling in exactly its right place but they got it done in the end what now asked the rolypoly bird he was out of breath and so tired he could hardly flap his wings now the pictures cried mugglewump turn all the pictures upside down and will one of you birds please fly out on to the road and watch to see when those frumptious freaks are coming back ill go said the rolypoly bird ill sit on the telephone wires and keep guard itll give me a rest the ravens swoop over they had only just finished the job when the rolypoly bird came swooping in screaming theyre coming back theyre coming back quickly the birds flew back on to the roof of the house the monkeys rushed into their cage and stood upside down one on top of the other a moment later mr and mrs twit came marching into the garden each carrying a fearsomelooking gun im glad to see those monkeys are still upside down said mr twit theyre too stupid to do anything else said mrs twit hey look at all those cheeky birds still up there on the roof lets go inside and load our lovely new guns and then itll be bang bang bang and bird pie for supper just as mr and mrs twit were about to enter the house two black ravens swooped low over their heads each bird carried a paintbrush in its claw and each paintbrush was smeared with sticky glue as the ravens whizzed over they brushed a streak of sticky glue on to the tops of mr and mrs twits heads they did it with the lightest touch but even so the twits both felt it what was that cried mrs twit some beastly bird has dropped his dirty droppings on my head on mine too shouted mr twit i felt it i felt it dont touch it cried mrs twit youll get it all over your hands come inside and well wash it off at the sink the filthy dirty brutes yelled mr twit ill bet they did it on purpose just wait till ive loaded up my gun mrs twit got the key from under the doormat and into the house they went the twits are turned upside down whats this gasped mr twit as they entered the livingroom whats happened screamed mrs twit they stood in the middle of the room looking up all the furniture the big table the chairs the sofa the lamps the little side tables the cabinet with bottles of beer in it the ornaments the electric fire the carpet everything was stuck upside down to the ceiling the pictures were upside down on the walls and the floor they were standing on was absolutely bare whats more it had been painted white to look like the ceiling look screamed mrs twit thats the floor the floors up

quickly i shall die i know i will ive got it cried mr twit i know what well do well stand on our heads then anyway well be the right way up so they stood on their heads and of course the moment the tops of their heads touched the floor the sticky glue that the ravens had brushed on a few moments before did its job they were stuck they were pinned down cemented glued fixed to the floorboards through a crack in the door the monkeys watched theyd jumped right out of their cage the moment the twits had gone inside and the rolypoly bird watched and all the other birds flew in and out to catch a glimpse of this extraordinary sight the monkeys escape that evening mugglewump and his family went up to the big wood on top of the hill and in the tallest tree of all they built a marvellous treehouse all the birds especially the big ones the crows and rooks and magpies made their nests around the treehouse so that nobody could see it from the ground you cant stay up here for ever you know the rolypoly bird said why not asked mugglewump its a lovely place just you wait till the winter comes the rolypoly bird said monkeys dont like cold weather do they they most certainly dont cried mugglewump are the winters so very cold over here its all snow and ice said the rolypoly bird sometimes its so cold a bird will wake up in the morning with his feet frozen to the bough that hes been roosting on then what shall we do cried mugglewump my family will all be deepfreezed no they wont said the rolypoly bird because when the first leaves start falling from the trees in the autumn you can all fly home to africa with me dont be ridiculous mugglewump said monkeys cant fly you can sit on my back said the rolypoly bird i shall take you one at a time you will travel by the rolypoly super jet and it wont cost you a penny the twits get the shrinks and down here in the horrid house mr and mrs twit are still stuck upside down to the floor of the livingroom its all your fault yelled mr twit thrashing his legs in the air youre the one you ugly old cow who went hopping around shouting were upside down were upside down and youre the one who said to stand on our heads so wed be the right way up you whiskery old warthog screamed mrs twit now well never get free were stuck here for ever you may be stuck here for ever said mr twit but not me im going to get away mr twit wriggled and squirmed and he squiggled and wormed and he twisted and turned and he choggled and churned but the sticky glue held him to the floor just as tightly as it had once held the poor birds in the big dead tree he was still as upside down as ever standing on his head but heads are not made to be stood upon if you stand on your head for a very long time a horrid thing happens and this was where mr twit got his biggest shock of all with so much weight on it from up above his head began to get squashed into his body quite soon it had disappeared completely sunk out of sight in the fatty folds of his flabby neck im shrinking burbled mr twit so am i cried mrs twit help me save me call a doctor yelled mr twit im getting the dreaded shrinks and so he was mrs twit was getting the dreaded shrinks too and this time it wasnt a fake it was the real thing their heads shrank into their necks then their necks began shrinking into their bodies and their bodies began shrinking into their legs and their legs began shrinking into their feet and one week later on a nice sunny afternoon a man called fred came round to read the gas meter when nobody answered the door fred peeped into the house and there he saw on the floor of the livingroom two bundles of old clothes two pairs of shoes and a walkingstick there was nothing more left in this world of mr and mrs twit and everyone including fred shouted hooray
