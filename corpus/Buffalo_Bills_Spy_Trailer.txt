the outlaws confession xl tearing off the mask buffalo bills spy trailer chapter i the hermit of the grand caсon a horseman drew rein one morning upon the brink of the grand caсon of the colorado a mighty abyss too vast for the eye to take in its grand immensity a mighty mountain rent asunder and forming a chasm which is a valley of grandeur and beauty through which flows the colorado grande ranges of mountains tower to cloudland on all sides with cliffs of scarlet blue violet yes all hues of the rainbow crystal streams flowing merrily along verdant meadows vales and hills with massive forests everywhere such was the sight that met the admiring gaze of the horseman as he sat there in his saddle his horse looking down into the caсon it was a spot avoided by indians as the abidingplace of evil spirits a scene shunned by white men a mighty retreat where a fugitive it would seem would be forever safe no matter what the crime that had driven him to seek a refuge there adown from where the horseman had halted was the bare trace of a trail winding around the edge of an overhanging rock by a shelf that was not a yard in width and which only a man could tread whose head was cool and heart fearless wrapt in admiration of the scene the mistclouds floating lazily upward from the caсon the silver ribbon far away that revealed the winding river and the songs of birds coming from a hundred leafy retreats on the hillsides the horseman gave a deep sigh as though memories most sad were awakened in his breast by the scene and then dismounting began to unwrap a lariat from his saddlehorn he was dressed as a miner wore a slouchhat was of commanding presence and his darkly bronzed face heavily bearded was full of determination intelligence and expression two led horses carrying heavy packs were behind the animal he rode and attaching the lariats to their bits he took one end and led the way down the most perilous and picturesque trail along the shelf running around the jutting point of rocks when he drew near the narrowest point he took off the saddle and packs and one at a time led the horses downward and around the hazardous rocks a false step a movement of fright in one of the animals would send him downward to the depths more than a mile below but the trembling animals seemed to have perfect confidence in their master and after a long while he got them by the point of greatest peril going back and forward he carried the packs and saddles and replacing them upon the animals began once more the descent of the only trail leading down into the grand caсon from that side the way was rugged most dangerous in places and several times his horses barely escaped a fall over the precipice the coolness and strong arm of the man alone saving them from death and his stores from destruction it was nearly sunset when he at last reached the bottom of the stupendous rift and only the tops of the cliffs were tinged with the golden light the valley being in densest shadow going on along the caсon at a brisk pace as though anxious to reach some campingplace before nightfall after a ride of several miles he came in sight of a wooded caсon entering the one he was then in and with heights towering toward heaven so far that all below seemed as black as night but a stream wound out of the caсon to mingle its clear waters with the grand colorado river a mile away and massive trees grew near at hand sheltering a cabin that stood upon the sloping hill at the base of a cliff that arose thousands of feet above it when within a few hundred yards of the lone cabin suddenly there was a crashing grinding sound a terrific roar a rumbling and the earth seemed shaken violently as the whole face of the mighty cliff came crushing down into the valley sending up showers of splintered rocks and clouds of dust that were blinding and appalling back from the scene of danger fled the frightened horses the rider showing no desire to check their flight until a spot of safety was reached then half a mile from the fallen cliff he paused his face white his whole form quivering while his horses stood trembling with terror my god the cliff has fallen upon my home and my unfortunate comrade lies buried beneath a mountain of rocks we mined too far beneath the cliff thus causing a cavein a few minutes more and i would also have shared poor langleys fate but a strange destiny it is that protects me from death a strange one indeed he is gone and i alone am now the hermit of the grand caсon a croesus in wealth of gold yet a fugitive from my fellow men what a fate is mine and how will it all end i wonder thus musing the hermitminer sat upon his own horse listening to the echoes rumbling through the grand caсon growing fainter and fainter like a retreating army fighting off its pursuing foes an hour passed before the unnerved man felt able to seek a camp for the night so great had been the shock of the falling cliff and the fate he had felt had overtaken his comrade at last he rode on up the caсon once more determined to seek a spot he knew well where he could camp a couple of miles above his destroyed home he passed the pile of rocks heaped far up the cliff from which they had fallen looking upon them as the sepulcher of his companion poor lucas langley he too had his sorrows and his secrets which drove him like me to seek a retreat far from mankind and become a hunted man alas what has the future in store for me with a sigh he rode on up the valley his way now guided by the moonlight alone and at last turned into another caсon for the grand caсon has hundreds of others branching off from it some of them penetrating for miles back into the mountains he had gone up this caсon for a few hundred yards and was just about to halt and go into camp upon the banks of a small stream when his eyes caught sight of a light ahead ah what does that mean he ejaculated in surprise hardly had he spoken when from up the caсon came the deep voice of a dog barking his scent telling him of a human presence near ah savage is not dead then and after all lucas langley may have escaped the horseman rode quickly on toward the light the barking of the dog continued but it was not a note of warning but of welcome and as the horseman drew rein by a campfire a huge brute sprang up and greeted him with every manifestation of delight while a man came forward from the shadows of the trees and cried thank heaven you are back again pard seldon for i had begun to fear for your safety and i was sure that i would never meet you again in life lucas for i believed you at the bottom of that mountain of rocks that fell from the cliff and crushed out our little home and the hands of the two men met in a warm grasp it would have been so but for a warning i had when working in the mine i saw that the cliff was splitting and settling and running out i discovered that it must fall and before very long i at once got the two mules out of the caсon above packed all our traps upon them and hastened away to a spot of safety then i returned and got all else i could find gathered up our gold and came here and made our camp tonight the cliff fell but not expecting you to arrive by night i was to be on the watch for you in the morning but thank heaven you are safe and home again and i am happy to find you safe lucas i was within an eighth of a mile of the cliff when it fell and i shall never forget the sight the sound the appalling dread for a few moments as i fled to a spot of safety my horses bearing me along like the wind in their mad terror it was appalling and i have not dared leave my camp since far as i am from it for it resounded through the caсons like a mighty battle with heavy guns but come comrade and we will have supper and talk over all that has happened the horses were staked out up the caсon where grass and water were plentiful and then the two men sat down to supper though neither seemed to have much of an appetite after what had occurred but savage the huge viciouslooking dog felt no bad results from his fright of a few hours before and ate heartily when their pipes were lighted the man who had lately arrived said well lucas i brought back provisions and other things to last us a year and i care not to go again from this caсon until i carry a fortune in gold with me yes here we are safe and i feel that something has happened to cause you to say what you do pard and i will tell you what it is impressively returned the one who had spoken of himself as the hermit of the grand caсon yes he added slowly i will tell you a secret comrade chapter ii the miners secret pard after what has happened the falling of the cliff and our narrow escape from death i feel little like sleep tired as i am so as i said i will tell you a secret continued andrew seldon speaking in a way that showed his thoughts were roaming in the past you will have a good listener pard was the answer yes i feel that i will and you having told me that you were a fugitive from the law that your life had its curse upon it i will tell you of mine at least enough of it to prove to you that i also dare not show my face among my fellow men you know me as andrew seldon and i have with me proof that i could show to convince one that such is my name but in reality andrew seldon is dead and i am simply playing his part in life for i am not unlike him in appearance and as i said i have the proofs that enable me to impersonate him my real name is wallace weston whom circumstances beyond my control made a murderer and fugitive and here i am i entered the army as a private cavalry soldier and worked my way up to sergeant with the hope of getting a commission some day but one day another regiment came to the frontier post where i was stationed and a member of it was the man to whom i owed all my sorrow and misfortune in life well the recognition was mutual a quarrel followed and he his name was manton mayhew fell by my hand and he too was a sergeant i said nothing in my defense for i would not reopen the story of the past for curious eyes to gaze upon and accepted my fate my sentence being to be shot to death on one occasion in an indian fight i had saved the life of the scout buffalo bill ah yes i know of him said the listener earnestly he in return rode through the indian country to the quarters of the district commander to try and get a reprieve hoping to glean new evidence to clear me he was refused and returned just as i was led down on the banks of the river for execution i heard the result and determined in a second to escape or be killed in the attempt buffalo bills horse stood near and with a bound i was upon his back rushed him into the stream swam across and escaped i was fired upon by the scout under an order to do so but his bullets were not aimed to kill me night was near at hand and pursuit was begun but i had a good start reached the desert and entered it the next day for the scouts horse was worn down my pursuers would have overtaken me had i not suddenly come upon a stray horse in a clump of timber an oasis in the desert i mounted him and pushed straight on into the desert and the next day came upon a solitary rock by which lay the dead body of a man upon which the coyotes had just begun to feed he had starved to death in the desert and the horse i had found was his at once an idea seized me to let my pursuer believe that i was that dead man so i dressed him in my uniform killed the horse near him left the scouts saddle and bridle there and started off on foot over the desert attired as the man whom i had found there with him i had found letters papers and a map and diary and these gave me his name and more for i found that the map would lead me to a goldmine the one in this caсon in which we have worked so well to our great profit i wandered back off the desert and you know the rest how i came to the camp where you lay wounded and threatened with death by your comrade blackheart bill who knew that you had a mine which he was determined to have in blackheart bill i recognized a brother of sergeant manton mayhew another man whom i sought revenge upon hugh mayhew had also wronged me as his brothers had for there were three of them strange to say triplets manton hugh and richard mayhew and to them i owed it that i became a fugitive from home you remember my duel with hugh mayhew and that he fell by my hand well there is one more yet and some day we may meet and then it must be his life or mine taking the name of andrew seldon and leaving all to believe that i wallace weston died in the desert i came here with you as my companion we are growing rich and though the cliff mine has fallen in there are others that will pan out even better but pard when i went to the post this time for provisions i came upon buffalo bill escorting a deserter to fort faraway and a band of desperadoes from the mines of last chance had ambushed him to rescue the prisoner i went to the rescue of the scout saved him and his prisoner and went on my way to the post but yet i halfbelieve in spite of believing me dead and my changed appearance with my long hair and beard that buffalo bill halfrecognized me i must take no more chances so shall remain close in this caсon until ready to leave it and go far away with my fortune to enjoy it elsewhere again pard i had written to the home of andrew seldon whom i am now impersonating and i find that he too was a fugitive from the law and that there is no reason for me to share this fortune with any one there as i had intended to do so now let us be lost to the world hermits here in this weird land of mystery the grand caсon where no one dares come until we are ready to seek new associations and homes elsewhere and enjoy our riches pard i thank you for your confidence your secret i felt that you had been a sufferer in the past while i am sure you were not the one to do the first wrong in all things i will be guided by you said lucas langley warmly and it being late the two men retired to their blankets to sleep chapter iii the grave at the deserted camp two men had met in the remote wilds of the grand caсon country as the district bordering upon the colorado river was called having appointed a mysterious deserted camp as a rendezvous one of these men needs no description from my pen hardly more than a passing pen introduction to say that he bore the name of buffalo bill he had come alone from fort faraway to the deserted camp over a hundred miles from the nearest habitation to meet a newfound friend one known in last chance claim as doctor dick and a man of mystery the latter was in person almost as striking in appearance as was handsome dashing bill cody for he was tall sinewy in build graceful and dressed in a way to attract attention with his cavalryboots gold spurs corduroy pants velvet jacket silk shirt and broad black sombrero encircled by a chain of gold links doctor dick was not afraid either to make a lavish display of jewels his weapons were goldmounted as was also his saddle and bridle and from the fact that he was an ardent and successful gambler and was supposed to be very rich he was called in last chance the gold king doctor dick had made his dйbut into last chance miningcamp by bringing in the coach one day with the dead body of the driver on the box by his side and two murdered passengers on the inside he had run off singlehanded the roadagents who had held up the coach and therefore became a hero at once adding to his fame very quickly by showing that he could shoot to kill when attacked signifying his intention of practising medicine and surgery in last chance and gambling in his leisure moments doctor dick had established himself in a pleasant cabin near the hotel to at once become popular and began to make money when buffalo bill went to last chance on a special secretservice mission to investigate the holding up of the coach and had recognized there a deserter whom he had orders to take dead or alive doctor dick had helped him out of what appeared to be a very ugly scrape and thus the two men had become friends becoming confidential doctor dick had told the scout a few chapters of his life and he alone doubted that his foe from boyhood sergeant wallace weston who had been reported as dying in the desert while seeking to escape was dead and the two the scout and the gamblerdoctor had arranged to meet at the deserted camp and discover if the real truth could not be ascertained so it was at the deserted camp they had met and doctor dick had stood with uncovered head before a quaking aspentree at the foot of which was a grave upon the tree had been cut a name and date and this told that there lay the form of hugh mayhew killed in a duel by one whom he had wronged it further told that hugh mayhew was known in the mines as a desperado whose cruel deeds had gained for him the sobriquet of blackheart bill convinced that the body in the grave was that of hugh mayhew after he had unearthed the remains and recognized in that decaying form his once brother one of the triplets doctor dick had seemed deeply moved when he told that he was the last of the trio and lived to avenge them that he was sure wallace weston their old foe was their slayer for he knew from the scout that he had killed his brother manton at the fort and hence he would not be convinced that the grave in the desert of arizona held the body of weston until he had certain proof of it that man who came to your rescue who called himself the hermit of the grand caсon who sought to shun you after his service to you is either wallace weston or knows something of him and it is his trail we must pick up on his return to his retreat and follow to the end before i am satisfied doctor dick had said to buffalo bill and so it was that the two had met at the deserted camp to pick up the trail of the hermit and follow it to the end bring what it might to doctor dick the trail was taken up and followed to the brink of the grandest view in all natures marvels the grand caсon of the colorado to a less experienced scout than buffalo bill there would have appeared to be no trail down into the depths of that mighty chasm and it would have been thought that the one whom they trailed had retraced his steps from there but the scout was not one to be thrown off the trail by any obstacle that perseverance pluck and hard work could overcome and so he set about finding a way down into the caсon though there was no trace of a traveled path left on the solid rocks upon which he stood doctor dicks determined assertion that he did not believe his old enemy wallace weston to be dead really impressed the scout in spite of the fact that he had guided lieutenant tompkins and his troopers in the pursuit of the fugitive soldier had found the body torn by wolves dressed in uniform and with his own saddle and bridle taken when he had dashed away upon his horse lying by his side still in the face of all these seeming proofs the fugitive sergeant might yet be alive and he would do all he could to solve the mystery as to whether he was or not the scout had been anxious to go alone with the gamblerdoctor in the search for he did have the hope that if really found wallace weston might be reconciled with doctor dick while if taken by troopers he would be returned to the fort and executed as he was under deathsentence buffalo bill never forgot a service rendered him and he did not wish to see the sergeant put to death when he was already believed to be dead and the secret might be kept after a long search buffalo bill found the perilous path down which the one he followed had gone with his packhorses he revealed the fact to doctor dick and the two after a long consultation decided to take the risk and make the descent into the grand valley for men with less nerve than these two possessed it would have been impossible and as it was there were times when the winding trail and dangers put their pluck to the test at last the valley was reached and greatly relieved the two went into camp before prosecuting their search further the hermit had admitted to buffalo bill that he had a comrade dwelling with him in his retreat wherever the retreat was would it be that they held a secret there they did not wish known and so would resist the intrusion of others it might be and that a deathstruggle would follow the discovery of their retreat still buffalo bill was not one to dread whatever might turn up and he had seen doctor dick tried and proven true as steel and brave as a lion and so the search continued the scout unerringly clinging to the trail until just as the two felt that the retreat of those mysterious dwellers in the grand caсon was almost before them they came upon a sight that caused them to draw rein and sit upon their horses appalled at the scene presented to their view what they saw was the fallen cliff and there just peering out from among the piles of rocks was the shattered end of a stout cabin they had found the secret retreat but they stood there feeling that those who had dwelt in that ruined cabin were beyond all human eye buried beneath a monument of rocks an army could not remove in weeks and this is the end said buffalo bill the first to speak breaking a silence that was appalling yes his end for he undoubtedly lies buried there beneath that mass of rocks if it is my foe wallace weston who has met such a fate so let it be the two did not tarry long in the caсon for a dread of the weird spot seemed to have come over them both doctor dick roamed about picking up bits of rock and examining it closely while he muttered it was a goldmine that held them here but that falling cliff has hidden the secret forever and buffalo bill went about searching for trails yet made no comment whether he found any or not to indicate that the lone dwellers in the caсon had not both perished in their cabin and lay buried beneath the hills of rock that had fallen from the heights above the valley but as the two men rode away up the dangerous mountaintrail there were eyes peering upon them they little dreamed of and wallace weston muttered they believe me dead now so let it be chapter iv a vow of vengeance the night after leaving the grand caсon buffalo bill and doctor dick camped again at the rendezvous of the deserted camp which was marked by the grave of blackheart bill the two friends talked until a late hour into the night though they intended making an early start in the morning for their respective homes the scout going to the fort the doctor to last chance well cody you were satisfied before that sergeant wallace weston was dead that he died in the desert but you yielded to my belief that he lived and was none other than the hermit of the grand caсon who came to your rescue some time ago but now you are assured that the hermitminer being buried beneath the walls of his cabin there is no doubt left that if he really was wallace weston he is surely not among the living yes doctor i can hardly bring myself to believe that westons body was not the one we buried in the desert yet i grant that it was just possible that it might not have been his so you give up the search wholly yes i return to my duties at fort faraway and i to my doctoring and gambling at last chance but i thank you for coming with me on this trip as my mind is made up the doctor said no more then but wrapped his blankets about him and lay down to rest the next morning when the two were about to part buffalo bill said i wish you would keep your eye upon the suspicious characters in the mines for i fear with the temptations in their way to get hold of treasure in the coaches there may be more mischief done i will keep a bright lookout cody and at once send a courier to report at the fort any lawless deeds that may be done for i know that your support will be prompt then the two parted buffalo bill taking the trail for fort faraway and doctor dick going on to last chance miningcamp but hardly had the scout disappeared from sight when the doctor halted looked back and then slowly returned to the camp dismounting by the grave he stood gazing at the inscription cut into the tree for some minutes and then turned his eyes upon the mound at his feet wicked yes hated and feared yet my brother and i loved him and my other brother manton with a love that was greater than womans love and i revere their memory now whatever they were whatever the crimes that led to their losing their lives i must avenge them and i will for wallace westons hand it was that did the deed yes he killed manton and i am just as sure that he killed hugh who lies here at my feet buffalo bill believes wallace weston dead but i do not no i can never believe that he could die except by my hand and some day we two will meet face to face and then he will die and i will be avenged for mantons and hughs deaths so here i vow to take the life of wallace weston and thus avenge my brothers he raised his right hand as he spoke pressed his left over his heart and so registered his vow of revenge then mounting his horse he rode away upon the trail he had before followed he seemed in no hurry rode slowly made long noonday camps and camped early at night so that it was the afternoon of the third day before he came in view of the scattered settlement of last chance claim situated in a mountain caсon which widened into a large valley after some miles with towering cliffs rugged passes and wild picturesque scenery upon all sides last chance claim or miningcamp was scattered along for miles the village portion where the hotel stores and gamblingsaloons were being at the upper end as he came out of a mountain pass into the valley proper doctor dick beheld crowds of miners hastening toward the hotel and all were carrying their rifles and had an excited air well pards what has happened he asked as he put spurs to his horse and overtook a party of miners on the way to the hotel the response he received caused him to spur forward and dash rapidly on to the head of the valley chapter v masked and merciless dave dockery had taken the place of driver on the last chance trail after bud benton had been killed on the box by unknown parties dave dockery was as shrewd as he was brave and bore many scars of wounds received in the discharge of his duty his nerve and endurance it was said saving his life where other men would surely have been killed the coach out from last chance had gone on its dangerous run with a very large sum in golddust but dave had gotten safely through with it and was congratulated by all who knew the chances he had taken of losing treasure and life he had heard with regret after reaching his eastern destination that he was to be put to an equal strain going back for a large sum of money in bankbills was to be sent back to last chance in payment for several mines purchased there by outsiders dave was told that the box contained at least thirty thousand dollars and so he hid it away as best he could in the coach he also was carrying out as freight a dozen rifles of the last and most improved repeating pattern and double as many revolvers intended for the vigilantes of last chance and who were personally unknown to any of the miners though it was suspected that either landlord larry the hotelkeeper judge storekeeper and proprietor of the largest gamblingsaloon in the place or doctor dick the gambler gold king was the secret leader whoever the vigilante captain and his men might be it was certain that they had a good influence over the most lawless spirits in the mines the fact of their being unknown greatly aiding their good effect dave dockery had hoped that he would have a stageload of passengers upon the run to last chance for he liked to have a crowd along and then he felt that they were a safeguard as well as in numbers there is strength but when the startingtime came only two passengers appeared one of them a miner going out to last chance to hunt for a fortune and the other a young man who told dave dockery that he was only traveling from a love of adventure and enjoyed the wild life he thus far had met with he gave dave a bunch of good cigars showed him a silver flask of fine brandy and was promptly invited to ride upon the box with him an invitation that was as promptly accepted out of the little settlement rolled the coach followed by a cheer from the crowd gathered to see it depart for the going and coming of the coaches in border places are events of great moment to the dwellers there the young man in search of adventure was upon the box with dave and the miner passenger was inside where it was safer for him to ride as he was in a hopeless state of intoxication the horses dashed away in fine style enthused by the cheer of the crowd and dave looked happy and proud while his companion on the box appeared to enjoy the scene immensely the young stranger was well dressed for he had donned what was suitable for frontier roughing it and wore in his belt a single revolver as a means of defense rather than for show or bravado he had a fine face fearless and frank and looked like a man of refinement and education dave dockery was a good reader of human nature and took to his passenger at once being really greatly pleased with his companionship threefourths of the trail had been gone over without adventure the three stops at the relaystations for changes of horses and meals for passengers having been made on time and last chance was only a dozen miles away when as they neared a drearylooking spot in a gorge dave said there is where poor bud benton passed in his chips pard and i tell you i dont like the spot a bit hardly had he uttered the words when a sharp report rang out and dave dockery fell back upon the coach and lay motionless while out of the shadows spurred a horseman dressed in black and wearing a red mask with his revolver leveled at the stranger he said sharply your turn next sir for i am out for blood and gold riding on the box with dave dockery the young stranger had heard much of the wild ways of the border and had been told that it would be madness to resist a holdup of a coach unless the chances were well on the side of those attacked when therefore the sharp report of a revolver had been followed by the toppling over of poor dave and a masked horseman rode out of the shadows of the cliff his revolver covering him the young man did not just know what to do he had with him a few hundred in money his watch chain and a few articles of value with some papers of importance that the masked horseman was alone he could not believe and yet he had against all traditions of the border begun by firing upon dave dockery and not ordering him to halt first that he had fired to kill the bulletwound in the breast and the motionless form of the driver as he lay back upon the top of the coach were in evidence now he stood the chance himself of life and death and he awaited the ordeal with white but calm face the horses had stopped in their tracks and though no other persons were visible the stranger looked for others to appear the thought flashed across him that he must lose all he had with him but his life he could not believe was in danger yet why the masked roadagent had killed dockery without mercy he could not understand do you mean to take my life man that depends whether it is worth more to kill you than to let you live was the businesslike reply but hardly had he spoken when from out of the coach window came a flash and report the miner within awakening to a sense of his danger had taken a hand in the affair the bullet barely missed the head of the masked horseman who at once returned the fire aiming first however at the young man on the box with a groan the latter fell heavily to the ground his revolver halfdrawn from its holster and the murderer leaping from his saddle took refuge among the horses while he called out i have killed your two comrades and you share the same fate unless you surrender i cry quits pard came in frightened tones from the coach and the man was evidently now sobered and greatly alarmed then come out the miner quickly threw open the stage door put his foot upon the step and then peered cautiously toward his foe instantly there came a shot and without a moan he pitched forward head foremost and fell in a heap between the wheels any more called out the roadagent sternly no answer came and revolvers in hand he stepped to one side and opened fire at the coach he fired with both hands and did not cease until he had emptied his weapons and riddled the coach then he unslung his rifle from his saddlehorn and cautiously approached ready to fire at the first sign of danger to himself but he had done his work well and he had nothing to fear so advancing to the coach found that it was empty quickly he set about searching the vehicle for all of value that it might carry he found a roll of bills belonging to the miner and a few things of value in his valise the young man panned out for him nearly a thousand in money and some jewelry and dave dockery was pretty well supplied with funds but the masked marauder searched rapidly on and evidently looked for a richer haul yet the box was found with the money in it and a bullet fired from his revolver shattered the lock ah here is a haul worth all risks to get he muttered and the contents of the chest were put in a sack and tied upon his saddle his work thus far had taken but a few minutes and apparently satisfied with what booty he had secured he shot one of the wheelhorses to prevent the team going on with the coach and mounting the splendid animal he rode and which was covered head and all with a black calico covering he dashed away down the pass at a gallop chapter vi the dumb messenger hardly had the masked roadagent ridden away when a deep groan came from the lips of dave dockery his eyes opened and after a supreme effort which cost him the greatest agony as moans would force themselves through his shut teeth he was able to slip down from the box to the ground he knelt by the side of the man who had been his companion a few minutes before full of life and vigor and found him motionless then he crept on hands and knees to the side of the miner dead came from between his clenched teeth after several efforts he arose by aid of a wheel to his feet and taking a piece of paper and pencil from his pocket wrote a few lines upon it with the greatest difficulty making his way supported by the coach step by step to the wheelhorse that stood chained to his dead comrade he unhitched him from the pole fastened the slip of paper to the bridle and gave him a blow go old horse for i cannot ride you i am too weak to hold myself on your back go for help to last chance and maybe if you hurry you may save my life the horse seemed to understand what was said to him and started off at a swift trot down the trail he was just disappearing from sight when dockery unable to longer stand up tottered and fell by the side of the trail writhing in his agony and while he lay thus the faithful horse increased his speed to a gallop and went along thus for miles his tracechains rattling an accompaniment to his hooffalls as he followed the trail to last chance halting at a stream here and there for a drink of cool water and at a grassy bank for a few mouthfuls of food the horse held on his way and a couple of hours after his departure from the coach galloped into the miningcamp those who saw him with the harness on felt sure that some harm had befallen the coach and they hastened after the animal who avoiding capture dashed up to the hotel door and halted lawrence larrimore nicknamed landlord larry had seen him coming and grasped his bridlerein as he halted he had caught sight of the white slip of paper tied upon the bridle and quickly securing it read what was written thereon in the weak and wavering hand of the wounded driver but which was recognized as the writing of dave dockery it was as follows for landlord larry read it aloud as the miners quickly gathered about him coach held up at bud bentons grave and i fatally wounded one passenger on box killed miner in coach also coach robbed of large sum roadagent was alone wore black domino and red mask horse also masked but feel sure i know him i have just strength to write this and beg quick aid sending it by one of my wheelers come quickly if you hope to find me alive dave a roar went up from the crowd of miners at the reading of this note from dave dockery who even then might be dying and landlord larry cried spread the alarm and let us go quickly to the spot and try and save poor dave yes and capture that masked roadagent for he has got money in plenty oh if doctor dick was only here to look after poor dave he might save him let me see the coach was due at bud bentons grave about two oclock and it is now after three come men mount and follow me dave dockery was liked by all and landlord larry was a very popular man so quickly the miners obeyed the call to follow the one to the rescue of the other just as the party of mounted men were about to ride away from the hotel under the leadership of landlord larry a shout was heard down the valley and then came the cry from a score of men there comes doctor dick with an exclamation of pleasure landlord larry put spurs to his horse and dashed forward to meet the doctor who warmly grasped his hand as the two met and called out what is it landlord larry read this paper from dave dockery who even now may be dead we are going to his aid and i will go with you but your horse is worn out doc and you look tired after your long trail dont mind me for i will mount a fresh horse and follow and doctor dick rode rapidly toward his own cabin the eyes of the miners followed the doctor as though all depended upon him they had come to almost revere this handsome stern mysterious man who had come to dwell among them yet seemed so well fitted to adorn a far different life his life was as a sealed book to them yet his skill as physician and surgeon was great his generosity unbounded and his nerve and daring far above those whom he had been forced to meet in deadly encounter he had made his home in a snugly built cabin under the shelter of a cliff within easy walk of the hotel where he took his meals he had fitted his frontier home with an extravagance and comfort that was surprising and had in a cabin near several as fine horses as could be found among the miningcamps with a chinese servant to look after them and his wants the doctor hastily dismounted called to the chinaman to throw his saddle upon another horse and look after the packanimal entered the cabin for a few moments and before landlord larry and his party were a couple of miles away was in rapid pursuit he did not spare his horse and overtaking the crowd of half a hundred minerhorsemen he was greeted with a cheer which he acknowledged by gracefully raising his sombrero riding to the front of the column he took his place by the side of landlord larry and set a faster pace than that at which they had been going you say that dave dockery was able to write a note landlord yes i handed it to you today i thrust it into my pocket unread and doctor dick now glanced over the note as he rode along i fear he is too far gone larry for if he had been able he would have come into the camp i will ride still faster for every moment counts with a badly wounded man and you see i am mounted on my racer push on do doc and ill follow with the men as fast as i can cried the landlord with a word to racer the horse was off like an arrow and fairly flew up and down hill along the rugged trail to reach the scene of the tragedy and lend aid to the wounded driver at last the coach came in sight and the coming miners were yet all of two miles behind the four coachhorses still attached to the pole stood where they had been left by their driver while the wheelhorse shot by the roadagent lay where he had fallen near the coach to one side and not twenty paces from where bud benton had been killed lay the form of dave dockery throwing himself from his saddle doctor dick bent over him and said quickly he still lives dave dave speak to me the eyes slowly opened and there was a convulsive movement of the form a struggle which becoming violent caused the doctor to grasp him firmly and thus hold him the dying man seemed in an agony of despair at being unable to speak and after a slight resistance ceased his efforts and sank back exhausted here dave take this for it will revive you and doctor dick poured some medicine between the white lips as he did so a groan from another quarter startled him and glancing in the direction from whence it came he saw the form of the young passenger who had been riding on the box quiver slightly in an instant he sprang to the side of the other sufferer and bent over him placing his hand upon his pulse the bullet struck him in the forehead glancing along the skull and coming out i see at the back of the head it remains to see whether the bone is fractured ah here they come and up dashed landlord larry and those who had kept up with him how goes it doctor asked larry dave is beyond hope i fear while this gentleman is alive though i do not know yet how seriously wounded that man in rough clothes there is dead as you can see at a glance but come we will get the wounded men into the stage at once and i will drive on to the camps and the roadagents by all means send a party to hunt them down was the stern rejoinder chapter vii death and madness all knew that doctor dick was a skilful driver and that he would take the coach into last chance sooner than any one else could so they hastened to get the team ready the harness on the horse which had been the dumb messenger to make known the tragedy had been brought back and two of the miners horses were quickly put in as wheelers while the wounded driver and passenger were tenderly lifted into the coach in got a couple of miners to support them in their arms while the body of the man killed by the roadagents was put upon the top of the coach landlord larry had himself led the party in search of the trail of the roadagents while mounting the box and leaving his horse to follow on behind doctor dick sent the team along at a slapping pace for last chance claim as they went along they met other miners coming out to the scene but these were turned back as there was no need of their going and landlord larry had with him all that was needed it was just nightfall when the coach rolled by the door of the hotel while to the surprise of all doctor dick did not draw rein there instead he went on to his own cabin and came to a halt while he said to the miners who accompanied him if the lives of these two men are to be saved it will only be by skill and devoted nursing and i want them near me bring over two cots from the hotel and we will soon make them as comfortable as possible the two cots were soon brought the wounded men tenderly lifted out and the coach driven to the stables by a miner while doctor dick set to work to see just what he could do for his patients all knew that driver dave dockery was a great favorite of the gamblerdoctor and the remark was made hell save dave if it can be done and hes the man to do it left alone with his patients save his chinese assistant doctor dick threw off his coat and set to work in earnest to see what he could do for them and how seriously they were wounded he first went to dave dockery the driver lay as quiet as though asleep placing his hand upon his heart and then his ear close to his breast doctor dick said calmly it is the sleep of death with only a moment of thought he straightened out the limbs closed the eyes folded the once strong bronzed hands over the broad breast and throwing a blanket over the form said to his chinese servant speaking in the chinese tongue and speaking it well loo foo my friend is dead the chinaman replied in his idea of english allee lightee dockee him wellee happy now allee samee melican man angel loo foo had been converted it was said when he carried on the business of washeewashee in a miningcamp for as he had expressed it more lovee melican man joss gettee more washee going from the body of dave dockery doctor dick bent over the form of the wounded stranger he found him lying in a state of coma breathing heavily and apparently very badly wounded examining the wound doctor dick saw that the bullet had glanced on the forehead run along under the scalp to the back of the skull and there cut its way out dressing the wound carefully and using restoratives the doctor soon had the satisfaction of discovering that his patient was rallying and within an hours time his eyes opened and he looked about him in a bewildered way passing his hand slowly over his face he seemed trying to get his scattered thoughts for he muttered something to himself and then suddenly burst into a violent fit of laughter great god he will live but as a madman cried doctor dick moved by the sight of the strong mans brain having been crazed by the wound he had received having made him as comfortable as possible he left loo foo on watch and went over to the saloon to report the result and found it more crowded than usual many had assembled there who did not generally frequent the place preferring the quiet of their own cabins in the evening after a hard days work these were attracted by the happenings of the day and the tragedy was being discussed in all its details with the possibilities of the recovery of the driver and the young passenger and the capture of the bold outlaws the fact that dave dockery had hinted in his note to landlord larry that he could possibly tell who the masked roadagent was was a cause of considerable excitement to all for it would doubtless fall on one in last chance to be the accused a hush fell upon the crowd as doctor dick entered and the few who were gambling for there were only a few that night left their cards on the table to hear what would be said pards said the doctor in his courtly way i am just from my cabin where i have left one of the wounded men dead the other a madman a breathless silence followed these words and then a voice broke it with doc who is the dead man dave dockery a low murmur of regret and sorrow passed over the crowd and the doctor added he died soon after reaching the cabin and tother doc the bullet struck him in the head slightly fracturing the bone i fear indenting it and causing a loss of reason which i fear may never return to him poor fellow better be dead like poor dave said one and this view was the thought of all pards prepare for daves funeral tomorrow and out of respect for him let us close the saloon tonight for i know landlord larry would wish it so a general murmur of assent followed and the doctor continued i wish two men as couriers at once one to carry a note to landlord larry for he can go to the scene of the holdup and start on the trail from there as soon as it is light enough to see ill go doc said a cheery voice and a young man came forward thank you wall go with me to my cabin and ill give you the note now i wish a man to go as courier to fort faraway and remember it is a dangerous and long ride i haint afeered of the danger or the ride doc so im yer man said a burly fellow coming forward and his words were greeted with a cheer doctor dick glanced at him and then said very calmly thank you brassy but i do not care to accept your services and just why in the first place i desire to send a letter to buffalo bill and you have expressed openly your hatred for him and to some day even up on him for not allowing you to have your way in certain matters i doesnt allow my hates to interfere with duty i do not care to accept your services brassy now i asks a reason why i have given you one i wants another is this a demand it be you shall have it then dont beat round the bush but have the narve to come out with it like a man all looked at brassy with amazement he had been drinking and was reckless the doctor smiled but answered complacently i always answer a demand brassy so will tell you frankly that i would not trust you with any message whatever the words fell pat from the lips of the doctor and there was no misunderstanding them and brassy did not for with a yell he shouted yer shall eat them insultin words doctor dick and quick as action could be he had drawn his revolver and fired the crowd had fallen back from about each man at brassys cry and yet one man caught the bullet intended for the doctor in his shoulder it was not a second after the shot of brassys before the doctors weapon rang out he had not expected brassy to open fire so quickly so was not prepared for defense but he was just so little behind him in time that before the man could pull trigger a second time he fired and his bullet went straight where aimed between the eyes of the one he intended to kill when he dropped his hand upon his revolver brassys pistol fired a second shot as he fell but it was from the death clutch upon the trigger and the bullet went over the heads of the crowd while instantly was heard the doctors quiet tones come men who volunteers as courier to faraway a young man stepped promptly forward and answered i was a soldier at faraway sir and know the trail i will go you are the very man harding come with wall to my cabin good night gentlemen and remember i pay the expenses of brassys funeral so do not be mean in his burial outfit with this doctor dick raised his sombrero and left the saloon his admirers being still more impressed with his nerve and bearing after what had occurred the body of brassy was removed to his cabin by those who were his friends and all agreed that he had brought his sudden fate upon himself as the first reason given of his hatred to buffalo bill was excuse enough for refusing him as a courier the saloon was closed and the other gambling and drinkingplaces followed the example set and also closed their doors for the night so that quiet soon rested in the miningcamp of last chance in the meanwhile doctor dick accompanied by wall and harding had gone to his quarters where loo foo was found making a cup of tea alone with the dead and wounded and seemingly unmindful of the fact entering the cabin the doctor drew the blanket back from the form of dave dockery and revealed to the two couriers the honest brave face of the driver poor dave he is on his last trail now he said softly and seating himself at his table he hastily wrote two letters one read dear larry dave died soon after reaching my cabin if you do not find trace of the outlaws by sunset it would be well to return sooner if you can get no clue whatever i send harding to fort faraway with a note to buffalo bill as i promised to do if there was another holdup on the overland trail i had to kill brassy tonight but ball will explain the circumstances get back to poor daves funeral at sunset tomorrow if possible i closed saloon tonight out of respect to dave the young passenger will be a madman if he recovers yours doctor dick the note to buffalo bill told of the holdup on the stagetrail the death of one passenger wounding of another and killing of dave dockery and closed with landlord larry is on the trail of the outlaws and all will be done to hunt them down that it is possible to do i will drive the coach back on the run and until another driver can be found if you cannot come now state what you think best to be done and it will be attended to yours doctor dick the couriers left as soon as the letters were finished and having seen them depart doctor dick went over to the hotel to get his supper which loo foo had ordered for him after which he returned looked at his patient gave him a dose of medicine and throwing himself upon his bed was soon fast asleep wholly oblivious it seemed of the dead man and the sufferer within a few feet of him chapter viii a strange burial the courier on the trail of landlord larry found him and his halfhundred miners trailing the mountains and valleys over in search of some trace of the coming of the roadagents to the scene of the tragedy and their going therefrom but the search of the evening before and up to the arrival of wall at noon when they had gone into camp had been wholly in vain not a hooftrack could be found of the roadagents horses nor a place where they had lain in wait until the stage came along landlord larry was not one to waste energy upon impossibilities and after reading doctor dicks letter he decided to return with his men to last chance they set out soon after the midday rest and arrived in last chance just as all was in readiness for the burial of dave dockery and brassy for a double funeral was to be had the landlord dismissed his men and went at once to the quarters of doctor dick who greeted him warmly and asked any success not a bit too bad we could not find the photograph of a trail and to search longer was a waste of time so as the men wished to go to daves funeral i just came in it was about all you could do under the circumstances larry i see that they have got the corpse you furnished rigged out for burial too brassy yes why not for he has a number of friends dont fear no trouble do yer no i think not for brassy prescribed for himself and i administered the medicine served him right for playing with edged tools i will not say that poor fellow for life was dear to him but he should have been more careful we will go together to the burial by all means and ill give my friends a hint to be ready if brassys pards go to showing an ugly mood while you will go prepared doc i always am was the laconic response now hows yer sick man he will recover bodily but never mentally i fear im sorry and landlord larry went to prepare for the burial in half an hour all was ready to start and doctor dick and landlord larry were given the places of honor at the procession or rather just following what was called the band and which consisted of a dozen men who sang the leader alone playing on a cornet following the doctor and landlord larry came the eight men bearing the body of dave dockery on a litter on their shoulders the body was encased in a board coffin and behind followed eight men carrying the body of brassy following were the miners marching eight abreast and in solid column nearly a thousand men being in line and among them were led the horses which dave dockery was wont to drive his belt of arms hat and whip being carried on top of his coffin up the caсon to the cemetery beneath the cliffs filed the column at funeral pace keeping time to the splendid voices that changed from air to air as they marched along and which echoed and reechoed among the hills the buryingground was reached the bodies placed by the side of the graves dug for them and landlord larry consigned them to their last restingplace by repeating the words of the burial service over them no partiality being shown but when the coffin with the weapons hat and whip of dave dockery was lowered into the grave hundreds of bold brawny men stepped forward and threw in upon it benches of wild flowers they had gathered and when filled up the little mound was covered from view by these sweet offerings of manly regard for the dead driver while in strange contrast was the barren grave of brassy for his immediate friends had not thought of gathering flowers there being no sentiment in his death doctor dick looked calmly on and perhaps it was his stern fearless mien that stayed the trouble that several of brassys pards seemed to have decided upon there in the sacred restingplace of the dead perhaps the belief that they would be quickly sent to join their comrade for they created no disturbance only with a significant glance at the goldking gambler turned and walked away with the bearing of men who would bide their time to avenge chapter ix the courier the man who had volunteered to take the long and dangerous ride to fort faraway to carry a letter to buffalo bill had ridden along steadily after leaving last chance until a couple of hours before day then he halted staked his horse out and wrapping himself in his blanket went to sleep for several hours he slept serenely then awaking he cooked his breakfast and was soon again in the saddle he seemed to understand frontier craft perfectly and to appreciate just what his horse could stand so did not press him too hard camping at nightfall he was again on the trail at daybreak and held steadily on during the day another nightcamp and he rode into fort faraway the next morning before the hour of noon he was directed at once to the quarters of buffalo bill and though having been a soldier there he recognized many old friends he saw that dressed as he then was and with his beard grown the recognition was not mutual but the moment he entered the presence of buffalo bill he was recognized and warmly greeted for the scout had always liked the young soldier who had been given his discharge on account of a severe wound received in an indian fight which it was thought would render him lame for life well harding i am glad to see you and you deserve credit for the plucky ride you have made how is the old wound getting on now all right bill for i am not at all lame i am glad to say and you are getting rich i suppose well no but i have laid up some money in mining only i cannot stand upon my wounded leg long at a time and so i am going to ask you to take me on as a scout under your command if you can do so harding you are just the man i want and you are in that very place where i need you so you can return to your mine and pretend to work as before for there is where i wish you to serve me since i received this letter from doctor dick thank you pard cody for your kindness and will be glad to do as you wish but may i ask a favor certainly it is that no one knows that i am in your service not even landlord larry or doctor dick for i can work better i am sure it might be a good idea to have it so and it shall be as you wish for you can do better work as a spy and i have full confidence in you harding but we will talk over just what it is best to do when i have reported to major randall the holding up of the coach and killing of dave dockery and the others buffalo bill then left the courier and went to headquarters where he held a long conversation with the commandant of the post returning to his own quarters he said to harding who was awaiting him well pard the major has heard the whole story and he has left it to me to go in my own way about running down these roadagents for though only one was seen there were evidently more at the holdup i do not doubt that for one man would be a bold one to alone make an open attempt to hold up a coach with dave dockery on the box and knowing that he had passengers with him well harding you are to return to last chance and give letters i will write to landlord larry and i wish you to go to work in my service and secret service it must be for what you do must be underhand no one knowing that you are doing else than carrying on your mining as before i will give you a paper which will protect you for major randall will endorse it officially and you can use it in case of trouble or necessity not otherwise i thank you friend bill and ill be discreet i promise you but now there is another thing i wish to tell you and to ask what you think of it well what is it harding do you believe that sergeant wallace weston is dead was the query in a low earnest tone buffalo bill started at the unexpected question asked him and gazing intently at harding asked why do you ask such a question harding i will tell you when you answer my question mr cody whether i believe sergeant wallace weston dead yes sir i do you have good reason for believing it then i have please tell me what it is as you have some motive above curiosity in asking i will do so harding and buffalo bill told the whole story of sergeant westons escape from execution and the finding of a body in his uniform upon the desert and burying it but he added i confess harding after a talk with doctor dick upon the subject i was led to doubt to a certain degree the death of the sergeant and even followed a trail which i supposed was his with what result sir that we found the trail led to a mine which had caved in and crushed the cabin home of those who dwelt there when was this sir only a short time ago do you mind giving me the date buffalo bill took a notebook from his pocket and gave the exact date now harding you have some knowledge upon this subject a secret to tell yes sir out with it you will keep it in confidence between us two certainly you know that the sergeant was my friend that he had saved my life twice in battle and i loved him as i did a brother i remember no man knew him better than i did in the fort for we were boon comrades for over a year and i knew his features perfectly as well as other marks of identification yes the sergeant had one mark that he was sensitive about and kept hidden from all though i saw it several times what was it he had a peculiar way of dressing his hair with a curl hanging over his forehead i remember it beneath that curl sir was a birthmark ah it was a red cross an inch in length and perfect in shape indeed yes and i saw that same mark on a mans forehead a few days before the date you say that sergeant weston if it was he was buried in the cavedin mine ah and where did you see it i had gone to wingate by coach sir to collect some money due me from several soldiers there and in the sutlers store i saw a man whose face i was sure i had seen before he wore his hair and beard long and seemed to stoop badly or was roundshouldered but the form otherwise was the same so were the eyes and shape of the head and he had a round gold filling the size of a pins head in one of the front teeth reading a letter that seemed to impress him he took off his hat and pushed his hair back and i saw the red cross on his forehead i went up to see him as though to attract his attention but he looked at me as though he had never seen me before yet his face flushed and paled as he looked now mr cody that man was sergeant weston and ill swear to it but i would not tell any other man than you for if he escaped death no one is more glad of it than i unless unless what harding unless a poor man and a hunted one he turned roadagent and was the man who held up the coach killing dave dockery no harding i can hardly believe that of him and then too the coach was just held up and this man with his pard perished in the cavein of their mine you are sure i cannot see reason to doubt it but now that you tell me what you do the man who saved me from the gang of headlight joe and then went on his way recalled a face i could not place and now i am sure that it was sergeant weston but he too had round shoulders while the sergeant did not have and yet he was then on his way to wingate and it was upon his return that i followed his trail well sir if it was in my power to capture sergeant weston never would i lay hand upon him and i believe you feel the same way unless it was your orders to do so still somehow the thought came to me that a fugitive and friendless he might have turned outlaw i do not think so and i am sure now that if it was weston who came to my aid and whom you saw he perished in the mine but now let us go over what i wish you to do and my plan to run down these roadagents who i am sure are from last chance claim and nowhere else said buffalo bill chapter x doctor dicks drive a pall seemed to have fallen over last chance in the death of dave dockery and its life began to flag in gloom seeing this and fearing that the holdup of the coach might injure the mines landlord larry decided to get up a scheme to attract outsiders to the mines and so the rumor went out of a large find of gold in one of the caсons near the town a couple of miners only were put there to work it and the claim was known as the doctor dick mine as the gold king at once bought from the landlord a halfinterest in it this news stirred the miners to increased exertions in their own mines and also caused prospectors to go out on the search for new finds the wounded passenger continued to steadily improve bodily under the skill and kind care of doctor dick but his mind was a wreck and no one believed that he would ever regain his reason doctor dick hinted at an operation some day that might relieve the pressure upon the brain yet spoke of it also as an experiment and a dangerous one only to be tried as a last resort the man was as docile as a child gave no trouble and simply sat about whittling sticks into the shape of a revolver at last the week passed by when the stage was to start again upon its run eastward a number of miners had volunteered as an escort but doctor dick said he would drive on the run out and come back as a passenger and he did not expect trouble so would not accept an armed escort the night before the stage was to start harding the courier to fort faraway returned he brought with him a letter from buffalo bill to doctor dick and another for landlord larry stating that the troops at the fort were pressed just then with extra duty as the indians were in an angry mood and for them to do what they could for the protection of the coaches until major randall could investigate and patrol the trail harding had little to say of his visit to the fort more than to hint that the soldiers were too much occupied just then with their own affairs to care much for the killing of a stagedriver and couple of passengers as no government funds had been taken by the outlaws the miners would have to look to their own protection for a while at least the courier also stated that there were stories at the fort of secret finds of gold in and about last chance and he would give up his intention expressed some time before of selling out his mining interests and instead stick to hard work in the hope of striking it rich in the end the next morning the coach was to start and as it was to go out at an early hour many of the miners decided to remain up all night gambling in order to see it leave for it would be the sabbath day when they could rest doctor dick had been too busy of late with his patient and other matters to devote much time to gambling and so he also decided to make a night of it at the gamblingtables when the dawn came many regretted that he had done so for never had he played more recklessly and never before had he been such a large winner for luck seemed to go his way from the start play what game he might he was a winner and going from table to table he broke the combination as one of the miners expressed it the dawn was at hand when he went to his cabin for a bath and in half an hour he came back to the hotel for breakfast looking little like a man who had passed the night over a gamblingtable he was dressed in his best was well armed and coming out from a hearty breakfast lighted a cigar and mounted to the stagebox at a single bound an act that gained for him a cheer upon his agility all ready landlord larry he called out as he gathered up the reins and the answer was no passengers mails aboard go doctor dick gathered up the reins in a way that showed him a master of the art of driving he looked very dashing and handsome as he sat on the box his long hair falling upon his shoulders and his face showing no dread of what he might have to encounter upon his run with a wave of the hand at the word go he gave his whiplash a quick whirl and made the crack resound like a pistolshot the six horses bounded forward and a wild yell of admiration of the volunteer drivers pluck went up from the crowd as the coach rolled down the valley the miners came out from their cabins and gave him a cheer and it was a constant yell along the line until he had left the last camp behind him the six fine horses had been sent along at a rapid pace until the camps were left behind the doctor showing his great skill as a driver in dashing over places and around corners where others had found it safer to go slow but when the last cabin disappeared the team was brought down to a jog for the way was long before them the scene of the last tragedy was passed at a walk the doctor glancing calmly at the spot where dave dockery had lost his life along with his passengers the first relay was made and the stocktender there who had heard the news of the holdup from landlord larrys men when searching for the roadagents expressed pleasure at seeing the coach come in safe and with doctor dick upon the box anything suspicious about pard asked the doctor no sir haint seen a man around since poor dave went by on the last run which was his last run on earth yes poor fellow he is gone you doesnt mean ter say that yer is going ter drive ther run doc only on this trip pard for i have other work to do but there was no one at last chance to take the coach out so i volunteered and you has the nerve ter run through while yer handles ther ribbons as though yer was born on a stagebox but yerll find drivers scarce at tother end doctor dick or im greatly mistook i hope not and the fresh team being ready the doctor pushed on once more the second relaystation was reached at noon and here doctor dick had his dinner he had come over the worst part of the road as far as danger from attack was concerned but had fifty miles yet before him where a halt was always made for the night as there was a caсon there to go through which could only be driven in daylight and the relay of horses taken in the morning had to pull on into the station at the end of the ran for the driver on the last chance end of the line but the doctor reached what was known as caсonend station soon after dark and after supper turned in in one of the cots in the cabin provided for passengers and was soon fast asleep he was up at an early hour had breakfast lighted his cigar and with a spanking fine team took the perilous run through the caсon at a trot driving the twenty miles that ended his run in a little over three hours the stage rolling in at a brisk pace to the station at w was greeted with cheers for the news had come from fort faraway the day before of dave dockerys death the killing of one passenger wounding of another and the robbery of the coach the brave man who had dared drive through was greeted with cheers but he had hardly dismounted from the box when he was informed that he would have to drive back as there was no driver there who would take the risk at any price other drivers had been sent for men who were afraid of nothing but no one had yet been found who would drive the run to last chance which had been set down in the frontier vocabulary as the suredeath trail chapter xi running the gantlet doctor dick agreed to drive the coach back on condition that the driver who came to take charge should come on to last chance on horseback and be ready to come back with it he had shown that he did not fear the drive but his business and professional duties demanded that he should be at last chance and there he must remain he was secretly told by the agent that there was a valuable mail to go through in registered letters and asked if he dared risk carrying them by all means sir for i am driving to do my full duty was the answer so the mail was made up and at the last moment two passengers applied for seats they were strangers in w but said they were going to last chance to work in the mines and they were accordingly given seats upon the box as they preferred to ride outside then the coach started on its return to last chance with doctor dick still holding the reins having driven over the run once and knowing what his relay teams could do he started out to make the regular time on the run but there was alarm felt at last chance when half an hour had passed over scheduletime and the coach did not put in an appearance and nothing was seen of it on the three miles of trail visible down the valley when an hour had passed the anxiety became great for all conjectured that doctor dick had met the fate of bud benton and dave dockery some said that the delay was because the doctor was new on the road and this appeared to be a reasonable explanation but landlord larry grew more and more anxious and at last decided to go out with a party on a search for the delayed coach but just as the men were told to get their horses a shout arose down the valley that the coach was approaching and soon after a cloud of dust was visible drifting along the stagetrail a shout arose for it showed that at least some one was there whatever had happened to drive the coach in then those who had said the delay was caused by the doctor being new to the trail began to crow but only for a while as landlord larry who was gazing through a fieldglass at the approaching stage called out there are only four horses two are missing for some reason it was now all conjecture as to the cause of delay again landlord larry had something to say and it was to the effect that the coach was not dashing along with its accustomed speed in coming in at the end of the trail that doctor dick was on the box and alone while he seemed to drive in a very careful manner very different from his going away on his drive out nearer and nearer came the coach up the valley every eye upon it and all wondering guessing and asserting their views of what had happened the doctor is there that is certain said one two horses have been killed another remarked he may have lost them in the bad roads was an answer perhaps they were shot down by roadagents he has no passengers see how he drives he comes on as slow as a snail see he is driving with one hand what does that mean his left hand is hanging by his side he has surely been wounded and so the comments ran around as all stood watching the coming coach which half an hour after coming in sight rolled up to the hotel came to a halt and was greeted with a wild chorus of cheers from the assembled miners the crowd that gazed at doctor dick saw that his handsome face was very pale his eyes had a haggard look and his teeth were firmly set they knew that he had passed through some dread ordeal and a silence fell upon all awaiting for him to speak they saw that his left arm was carried in a sling his handkerchief knotted around his neck and that a red stain was upon his sleeve furthermore they saw that the two wheelhorses were missing the center pair having been put back in their place upon opening the stage door to see if there were any passengers landlord larry started back as the dead form of a man pitched out on his head the door being open it was seen that a second form was in the coach all in a heap in one corner there were red stains upon the steps and upon the leather cushions and everything indicated that the stage had run a deathgantlet but excepting for his pale stern face the doctor was as serene as a may morn though his voice showed weakness when he spoke ill ask your aid landlord for i am weakened from loss of blood bind my arm up to stop the flow and ill see how serious the wound is he said no more but was at once aided from the box and over to his cabin landlord larry leaving his clerk to look after the mails and the dead passengers arriving at the cabin doctor dick had his coatsleeve slit open and the bandage he had tied about his arm removed his silk shirtsleeve was also cut and then the wound was revealed in the fleshy part of the arm taking a probe from his case doctor dick after swallowing a glass of brandy coolly probed the wound found the ball and aided by loo foo the chinee under his direction soon extracted the bullet then the wound was skilfully dressed the arm rested in a sling and doctor dick lolling back in his easy chair asked with the greatest coolness well landlord larry how goes all at last chance the landlord was amazed at the calmness of the man and said quickly oh last chance is o k but it is your run that we are dying to hear about doc well it was a close call for me larry i admit for i found foes where i expected friends you were held up yes where at what you have very appropriately named the dead line larry the place where bud and dave were killed yes it was the masked roadagents not this time ah who then i did not form their acquaintance by name but perhaps a search of the bodies may reveal you killed them two where are the bodies i brought them along in the coach i thought they were passengers who had been killed they were how do you mean they left w booked as passengers but reached last chance as deadhead roadagents now i begin to understand it was your two passengers who attacked you just so it is a wonder that they did not kill you they would easily have done so had i not suspected them but i grew suspicious and without appearing to do so watched their every look and move when we drew near the dead line they said they would lie down on top of the coach and rest so they spread their blankets and did so i thought this strange as just before i had told them we were approaching the scene of the holdups but i kept my eye upon them and as we neared the cliff the sun shone brightly down and i distinctly saw the shadows of the two men as they arose and drew their revolvers i drew mine as quick as a flash turned and caught this shot in the arm while a second bullet whizzed by my head chapter xii a mans nerve the doctor paused in his story as though recalling the thrilling scene which had so nearly cost him his life and a sad look came into his eyes as though he felt that his mission seemed ever to kill so lost was he in thought that landlord larry had to recall him to his story by saying it was a very close call for you doc a close call indeed and but for the shadows on the cliff revealing the hostility of my two passengers my death would have followed but my discovery of their intention and quickness in facing them disconcerted them both destroying their aim close as they were to me they did not fire again oh yes several shots two of which killed my wheelers but i got in my work by firing two shots also killing them yes for you will find my bulletbrands in their foreheads the horses had started forward at the shots and as the wheelers fell the coach gave a lurch which sent the two men from the top to the ground just as i fired on them i quieted my team and first bound my arm up as tightly as i could to stop the flow of blood and then dismounting picked up the two dead men threw them into the coach and drove on of course my wounded arm gave me more and more trouble and i could drive only very slowly with one hand and hence my delay in arrival but i got in without being robbed which i am very glad of for there is a large registered mail on this run now i will have loo foo fetch me some supper and retire for i am about played out and you can search the two men and let me know the result in the morning but one minute how is my patient bodily all right but his mind as you said would be the case is gone poor fellow good night larry and hurry loo foo over with my supper please landlord larry bade doctor dick good night and departed more than ever impressed with the idea that the gold king gambler was a very remarkable man going to his hotel landlord larry found nearly every denizen of last chance awaiting him and a suppressed excitement was apparent in all the two bodies had been taken into the hotel office to await the coming of the landlord and there they lay covered with a blanket the moment landlord larry was seen coming from the cabin of doctor dick cries arose of speech speech tell the news landlord and so on larry mounted to the piazza of the hotel and in a few words told the story of doctor dicks running the gantlet and the nerve he had shown in the ordeal he had passed through oh hes got ther narve of old nick as we all knows cried a miner and this intended compliment was acquiesced in by one and all having learned the news the miners adjourned to the saloons and the toasts for the next few hours were to doctor dick a man o narve from wayback until a late hour the miners drank and gambled and then toward dawn quiet reigned in the camps broken only now and then by a yell from some man who was too full of liquor to go to sleep the next morning greatly to the delight of all doctor dick appeared at breakfast and received an ovation loo foo had dressed his wounded arm and though sore it was all right doctor dick said yet he was pale from loss of blood after breakfast he mounted his horse and took the rounds to see his patients and everywhere he was greeted with a welcome that could not but flatter him but the two weeks before date for the return of the coach for the runs were semimonthly passed away and no driver appeared from w to take the stage out it began to look very much as though doctor dick would have to again take the reins the search of the dead bodies of the two roadagents had revealed nothing as to their identity for excepting their weapons a little money some odds and ends in their pockets they had nothing of value about them and they were buried at the expense of doctor dick who would have it so as he very laconically remarked as i killed them i should pay their expenses when they are unable to do so at last the day for the starting of the coach came round and doctor dick as no one else volunteered expressed his willingness to take the reins though he remarked this will be the last run i shall make so you must get a man here landlord larry to go if i do not bring one back with me from w and once more doctor dick rolled away with a cheer from his admirers chapter xiii a volunteer doctor dick had an uneventful run to w and arrived without accident or delay on time at the end of his journey he was well received but the stageagent told him that not a volunteer had put in an appearance for the place of driver double the price had been offered but there were no takers and the agent added you must find some daredevil at last chance who is willing to risk his life upon the box while rest assured doctor dick i have reported your noble service for the company in its need and it will be appreciated i do not care for pay or thanks only i wish to be relieved of a duty i do not like especially as it interferes with my own work was the answer just before the time came for the starting of the coach a horseman rode up and dismounted at the stage office he was an oddlooking individual tall but with a hump on his back awkward in gait and dressed in buckskin leggings and huntingshirt his hair was long very long bushy and would have been white but for its soiled appearance and he had it cropped or banged in front like an indian or fashionable young miss to keep it out of his eyes his face was cleanshaven but the hue of leather and he wore a pair of ironrimmed spectacles his slouchhat was worn in reality for the rim fell down upon his shoulders save in front where the flap was turned up and fastened with an armybutton he was armed with a pair of old but serviceable revolvers an uglylooking bowieknife with a deerhorn handle and a combined rifle and shotgun doublebarreled his horse was as queer as his master in appearance being a large rawboned animal with patches of hair upon him a long tangled mane and tail and he was unshod though his hoofs looked as tough as iron the saddle was also a back number and the stakerope served for a bridle as well a lariat hung at the saddlehorn also a hatchet and in a large rubber blanket was rolled his bedding while a bag contained a coffeepot fryingpan tin cup plate and some provisions he looked the crowd over as he drew rein and asked quietly whos boss o this layout i am and the stageagent stepped forward i hears thet yer wants a man ter drive yer old hearse on ther trail ter last chance and back i do im yer huckleberry you yas me are you a driver ef i wasnt id not be sich a durned fool as ter trust myself on a twostory hearse pard who sent you here nobody for i haint one ter be sent where did you come from ther upcountry whar i has been trappin huntin prospectin and killin a injin or two see and now you wish to turn stagedriver if it pays what they told me at fort faraway i does the pay is good but have you no references yas where are they here the old man put his hands upon his revolvers and drew them with a lightninglike motion that surprised the lookerson they are pretty good references on a pinch and you may have cause to use them if you drive this trail i has used them before and i guess i kin do it agin was the quiet response when could you begin now what is your name old huckleberry but the boys calls me old huck for short but durn ther name call me what yer wants ter and ill be thar well pard huckleberry i rather like your style and have a mind to give you a trial ef yer kin do better dont do it but if yer cant count on me for as i said afore im yer huckleberry and ready for the game doctor dick had been closely looking at the old volunteer and said something in a whisper to the stageagent who at once said ill take you and the time for starting is almost up im ready only take care of my horse at my expense and the volunteer dismounted ready for work when old huckleberry mounted the stagebox doctor dick yielded to him the reins which he seized in a somewhat awkward manner yet with the air of one who knew just what to do took the whip gave it a resounding crack and started off at a brisk pace there were four passengers inside all miners going to last chance lured there by the rumor of richer mines having been found for the stories were circulating more and more that there were rich finds being discovered there every day that man knows how to handle the reins as well as the best of them old though he may be and a trifle awkward said the stageagent as he saw the volunteer driver sending his team along at a slapping pace in spite of the fact that the trail was none of the best along there the coach soon disappeared from the sight of those at w made the night halt on time and as soon as he had had his supper the new driver wrapped himself in his blankets and threw himself down outdoors declining the invitation of the stocktender to sleep in the cabin he was on his box on time the next morning and with doctor dick by his side went off on his run he was a man disposed to silence for he did not speak often unless doctor dick addressed him but he would ask now and then about the trails and showed some interest in the gamblerkings stories of the different roadagents attacks upon the way to last chance he greeted the stocktenders at the relaystations pleasantly said he hoped to be with them for some time and kept the team at the pace set for scheduletime passing the scenes of the several tragedies he drew rein for a few minutes and attentively regarded the surroundings but drove on again without a word of comment doctor dick had become more and more interested in the strange driver had told him all he could about the trail the time to make going and coming and was anxious to have him make no mistakes he said he tried to draw him out time and again but in vain all he could learn from him was that he had lived for many years upon the frontier and preferred to do so for reasons best known to himself he said he was trapper indianfighter hunter and prospector that was all and he tried to do his duty in every work he undertook more he would not say of himself and the doctor gave up trying to pump him when the coach came in sight of last chance old huckleberry showed no satisfaction at having made the run in safety or excitement at driving in for the first time he quickened the pace of his team handled his reins with a skill that won the admiration as he had all along of doctor dick and at last came to a halt before the hotel with a whoop and the words here we be boss doctor dick introduced old huckleberry from the box as soon as the cheer that greeted their arrival had died away pards i is glad ter know yer and i greets yer and with this old huckleberry dismounted from the box and asked at once for the feedroom he ate his supper with a relish smoked his pipe and declining a bed in the hotel saying it would smother him to sleep in between walls took an ax and hatchet with a few nails and going up on the hillside where there was a thicket soon built for himself a wickiup that would keep him sheltered even in a storm he carried his few traps there and then stuck up a notice which read old huckleberrys claim having completed his quarters he strolled about among the saloons and gamblingdens watched the playing but neither drank nor gambled and at last tiring of looking on went to his roost and turned in for the night an object of curiosity to all yet also of admiration for a man who would volunteer to drive the coach over that trail was one to command respect in last chance chapter xiv the way it was done the new driver drove the run to w for several round trips and not once was he held up he made the regular time drove without any accident whatever attended to his business associated with no one or that is to be on intimate terms with any one not even doctor dick and still slept in his little shelter on the hill he had fitted this up more comfortably and said that he felt perfectly at home there while on his return from w he had led his horse back behind the coach wishing to have him at last chance where his stay was always two weeks for there was only a days stop at the other end of the run he was wont to go on long hunts mounted upon rawbones as he called his horse and he kept landlord larry well supplied with game one day as old huckleberry was returning to last chance and neared the dead line the scene of the other holdup he suddenly threw his rifle to his shoulder and sent a shower of buckshot into a thicket ahead a riflebullet from the other barrel was sent to the other side and the whip was brought down upon his team in a way that put them into a run seeing them well started he threw the reins over the brake and with a revolver in each hand opened a fusillade on both sides of the trail while he called out to his passengers blaze away into the bushes durn yer for thar is game thar ter kill all this had not taken over half a dozen seconds and that there was game in the thickets and dangerous game at that was proven by hearing several loud cries of pain and stern orders given while men were seen hunting shelter from the unexpected fusillade opened upon them there were eight passengers in the coach and urged by the old driver several of them obeyed and opened fire from the windows the result was that where roadagents had been lying in wait for the coach and were just about to show themselves and command a halt they were taken completely by surprise and forced to seek shelter from the leaden messengers flying about them the rapid fire caused the roadagents to believe that there was a coach full of soldiers that a trap was prepared for them and ere they could rally and their leader could convince them that it was not so the coach had gone by the dead line and was going along the pass at the full speed of its horses the reins now in the hands of old huck once more the passengers all saw the panicstricken roadagents half a dozen in number and encouraged by the boldness of old huck kept up a hot fire which they felt confident had not been thrown away when pursuit was no longer feared old huck drew his team down to a trot and leaning over called out we done em up thet time pards the passengers cheered the old driver and when he drew rein at the hotel in last chance they quickly made known his act of heroism for throwing the reins upon the backs of his horses he had gotten down from the box reported the safe arrival of the coach to landlord larry and gone in to his supper when the story was told of how bravely he had run the gantlet landlord larry went in to have a talk with him but found that he had finished his supper and gone it was a cold evening and there was snow flying so looking over to the hill where the little shanty of old huck was located landlord larry saw a bright fire burning and at once went there there sat old huck enjoying his pipe and warming his feet before the fire in the clay chimney he had built he had a canvas covering the doorway to keep out the cold and snow and seemed as contented as could be in his lone quarters well old man you seem happy he said why not you brought in a valuable freight tonight in money and registered letters i know it do you know how much ther agent at w told me he thought about forty thousand and so i made a rush ter git through and did it grandly thats what im paid fer i have heard the story of your running the gantlet and surprising the roadagents old huck laughed and replied waal i calkilate as how they was astonished you see i seen the tracks on the trail foottracks and fresh ones goin on toward the dead line and so i kinder felt sartin o a holdup when i come to ther pass i seen ther top o a small tree wavin and knowed somebody were up in it looking over tother trees so i jist up with old dropem and i let drive with a handful o bullets i had dropped into ther shotbarrel and i put a piece o lead on tother side o trail dropped ther ribbons and set my two puppies ter barking as soon as i hed laid ther silk onter ther team and got em inter a run i tell yer landlord it were prime fun and no mistake and as ther insiders helped with ther guns you bet we waltzed through them scared roadagents in a way that crippled em and we come in on time thats all thar is of ther story boss and old huckleberry puffed away at his pipe again in the most unconcerned manner possible hardly had old huckleberry finished his simple story of his brave act when a voice at the door said ho old gentleman i have just heard at the hotel of your splendid work this afternoon and have come to congratulate you come in pard doc and camp on that blanket thar before ther fire i is glad to see yer but i dont need no congratulations for i haint done nothing more than i oughter well old man you saved the lives of your passengers and a rich freight i learn and i know as well as any one how to appreciate what you did for i have driven the trail you remember i know it and done it well i also praised old huck doc but he does not care to be thanked but what is to be done about this attempted attack on the coach said landlord larry ill go out so as ter git thar at daybreak and see if thar can be any trail found it is spittin now but not much and i guess we can find if we done any harm in our fire and maybe track the varmints said old huck and ill go with you said landlord larry count me another the doctor added then it was decided to take a dozen men along and the doctor and the landlord bade the old driver good night and departed when he at once turned in after throwing a large log upon his fire to burn until morning that is a strange old character larry said doctor dick as the two walked back to the hotel he is indeed doc i do not understand him for he is a mystery to me and to me but do you think i should send another courier to buffalo bill making known this intended attack no write as you did before to him and hell get it by way of w ill do so but did you learn anything in particular about this attack nothing more than that fully half a dozen roadagents were seen and but for the bold and prompt act of old huck there would have been death and robbery beyond all doubt he is a very daring man to do what he did he is indeed and it will surely mark him for death with the roadagents beyond all doubt but we must make a start early enough to bring us to the scene by daybreak so good night the two separated to meet again when old huck came up ready mounted to take the trail the party who were to go were soon in the saddle and they started off at a canter there was just a trace of snow upon the ground and they were glad to see that there was no more a brisk gallop brought them to the dead line at dawn and the search was at once begun hardly any snow had fallen there and in the piсons there was none so that in several places the ground was stained red showing that the fire from the coach had not been useless if not fatal then old huck showed his skill as a trailer for he at once went to work in a way that revealed the fact that he was an old hand at the business he went from bloodstain to bloodstain in silence examined the position of the thicket took in the whole situation and the direction of the stage when the firing had been going on and at last started off up the caсon following a trail that was so faint that a number of the party said that there was no trail at all but he climbed up the steep side of the caсon end followed by the others and there on the top were found several red spots in different places three maybe dead maybe only wounded he said shortly those three stains tell you that old man asked doctor dick yas they took off their dead or wounded as ther case might be and halted ter rest after climbin up here and right here is whar they laid the dead or wounded down while they was restin well which way now huck for your solution seems the right one said doctor dick thats hard ter tell for a horse wouldnt leave no track here was the reply chapter xv a mysterious disappearance that even old huckleberry had lost his grip on the trail after reaching the top of the ridge was soon evident for search as he might he could find no trace of a track in the hard rocky soil about them well scatter pards and try ter find another place whar they has rested ther loads for they wont carry heavy weights far up this slope without restin he said so the party separated and half an hour later a halloo from old huck brought them together again there was another place where the roadagents had halted for there were the three telltale spots of blood lying close together again they separated on a search but after hours spent in vain they were forced to give it up old huck remarking thar is snow higher up so its no use now back to last chance the party reluctantly retraced their way after they had eaten their noonday meal and all hope of finding a clue to the retreat of the roadagents was given up save by old huckleberry who each day went off on a hunt though many were sure that it was a trail not game that he was hunting when at last the day came for him to start off on his run he mounted his box without the slightest apparent reluctance nodded goodby and drove off on his perilous journey there was much anxiety felt at last chance for his return and a number talked of riding out to the dead line and meeting him but this was not done as a suggestion was made that the old man might not take it kindly but look upon it as an interference a belief that he was not able to take care of himself when however the time for his arrival came and no stage appeared men looked anxiously at each other and wondered if the old man was another victim to the roadagents hunt for gold when an hour passed and there was no stage in sight doctor dick said that he would mount his horse and go to see what was the matter he was not allowed to go alone for a score of mounted men at once followed him and the ride was a rapid one to the dead line for the coach was not met on the way arriving at the dead line the coach loomed in sight it was still and dashing up the horses were found hitched to trees but not a soul was visible the box was empty and not a soul was found within where was old huck that question could not be answered and a search was at once begun upon the stagebox blood was found that looked very bad for old huck some one had hitched those horses to the trees surely but who the coach had evidently been searched for the cushions were thrown out and the boot open and yet strange to say the mailbag had escaped the eyes of the searchers being found by landlord larry where old huck always hid it in one of the cushions arranged for the purpose by the old man who had been killed or what the coach had been robbed of was not revealed the party camped all night upon the scene and a thorough search was made the next morning again for the missing driver miles back on the trail had the miners ridden and more every rock and thicket by the way was thoroughly searched yet all in vain at last the party were reluctantly compelled to give up further search for old huck be he dead or alive for not the slightest clue could be found and there was no trace of any trail whatever doctor dick mounted the box and drove the coach back to last chance and the miners had knocked off work and were assembled to hear bad news which the delay caused them to look for landlord larry and doctor dick at once held a consultation upon their return and it was decided to send harding again to fort faraway as a courier with a message to buffalo bill but when called upon to go to the surprise of both harding refused you went before pard harding so why refuse this time when you know it is our duty to report as agreed to buffalo bill the attacks of the roadagents upon the coaches that he may place the matter before the commandant said doctor dick who was anxious to have the mysterious disappearance of old huckleberry known i went before doctor dick but i do not care to go again was hardings firm rejoinder do you fear to go asked landlord larry with a smile if you think that i am influenced by fear i will prove to the contrary was the quiet rejoinder by going no how then have you a driver to take the coach out to w on its next run landlord no unless doctor dick will kindly do so i cannot was the quick response of the doctor then i will said the young miner you yes landlord do you know how to drive i have driven sixinhand often when i drove wagons and ambulances in the army and on one occasion drove the general with fourinhand over four hundred miles of the worst country i ever saw i guess you will do then and it is far easier to get a courier to go to the fort than it is a driver for the coach yes as if i go under pard larry i will be number five five asked the doctor meditatively yes bud benton was one dave dockery two doctor dick number three and old huckleberry number four so i will come in as five you are right and you are in earnest harding asked the landlord certainly you know all that you risk thoroughly then i retract my words in asking you if you feared to go to the fort as courier for your volunteering as driver proves that you fear nothing all right pard larry let it go at that well harding consider yourself engaged for the berth of driver and be ready to take the coach out on its next run you will find me on hand and let me tell you that i am authorized to pay three times the regular wages it will be acceptable if you live to get it was the suggestive response of landlord larry this having been settled upon greatly to larrys relief he further talked with doctor dick and it was decided that as old huck had only disappeared and the coach had not been robbed of the mails they would send no report of the affair to buffalo bill but wait and see how harding came out with his drive the news soon spread about that hal harding had volunteered to drive the coach through to w and he at once became a hero in the camps for those bold fellows always loved heroism in a man above all other qualities he was however regarded as a dead man beforehand for that he would be killed seemed a foregone conclusion and many felt pity for the fate that they felt assured would befall the handsome young miner but harding seemed not to dread the drive in the least but went on about his duties in his usual cheery way sticking to the work in his mine he had found that it panned out richer than he had anticipated and he already had partnership offers and a good price if he would sell he had kept his eyes open too in his secretservice work for buffalo bill and had noted down certain discoveries he had made of a suspicious nature and also had the names of a few whom he considered worth while watching at last the day came for the coach to start out and as nothing had been heard of old huck hal harding reported at the hotel ready to mount the box and drive through as he passed through the crowd he could not but hear several remarks that were made one being he is number five and he is doomed also chapter xvi taking chances there was not a shadow of dread at the fate that might be his upon the face of hal harding as he mounted to the stagebox and gathered up the reins the mails were aboard and he knew that he had a valuable freight hidden away as best it could be of golddust being risked by miners who were sending it eastward what gold was to be sent out was always kept a secret known only to the senders to landlord larry and the driver and though it was taking chances to let it go the senders were risking it as gamblers chance money in large sums upon the turn of a card then too there was a very strange feature in the holding up of the coaches and that was the fact that they had never been halted on the outward run no matter how much gold they carried out but always when bringing back to last chance the exchange in banknotes the roadagents knew that they could carry large sums in money where they could not be bothered with gold in bulk was the reason that landlord larry assigned for the attacks being made only on the westward runs of the coaches not a passenger was to go and harding sang out in a cheerful tone all ready go cried larry and the vehicle rolled away in a manner that showed that the young miner was a good driver as he had asserted that he was the crowd cheered wildly the voices echoing down the caсon as he drove along and now and then he would raise his hat to those who greeted him from their cabins and mines as he went along out of the valley he turned swinging at a brisk trot along through caсons over hills up mountains by the way of narrow passes and down again to the valleys he reached the relaystation nearest last chance and made known to the stocktender the fate of old huck you goes next pard for it wont be long afore doctor dick will come along and tell me that poor hal harding has gone under said the sympathetic stocktender think so sure of it why doctor dick waal ef you gets kilt no other man in or out o last chance will have ther grit to drive ther old deathtrap for thet hearse you is sittin on is no more it is an unlucky old vehicle i admit pard but ill be going and harding drove on once more he had not seen a soul at the dead line all was as quiet at that dread spot as the forms of those who had lost their lives there only the stockmen at the station greeted him on the way and at night he came to the haltingcabin a little ahead of time he had the same story to tell at each one of the relaystations about the fate of old huck and an ominous shake of the head from those who listened convinced him that they expected him to be the next victim the next morning he rolled into w a few minutes ahead of time and the stageagent seemed surprised to see a new man upon the box he heard what harding had to say of old huck listened to his report of his uneventful run and received from him the waybill of what he carried you have done well mr harding and i hope we will hear no more of these attacks so that you may escape for if they make a victim of you i do not know who we can look to unless it be that fearless fellow doctor dick and his practise mining interests and gambling occupy him so thoroughly that he will not drive again sir i am sure not unless no other can be found for he is just the man to step in then in open defiance of danger yes he is just what you say of him sir now how is that poor passenger who was crazed by a shot from the roadagents aimlessly wandering about last chance sir harmless and to be pitied well i have received letters asking about him and had to make a report of the circumstances it will be upon your return trip that you will have to be watchful i will be sir never fear was the cheery response the news of the mysterious disappearance of the old driver soon spread about w and people gathered about the stageoffice to have a look at the brave fellow who had in the face of the past experience brought the coach through the agent had told harding that if the mails had gone through nothing had been taken for no freight had been sent and no passengers were along on that trip as they had found nothing to take the roadagents had doubtless visited their vengeance upon old huck especially to repay him for having run the gantlet on a former occasion there were passengers booked for last chance by stage but when it became known that old huck had been killed as all supposed he must have been they concluded they were in no great hurry to reach the miningcamps and could wait a while longer so harding discovered that he would have to return with an empty coach as far as passengers were concerned he showed no disappointment however at having to return alone and was told by the agent that he was to carry back considerable money and a valuable mail all right sir ill do my best to go through in safety he said and he grasped the outstretched hand of the agent who said i feel as though i was shaking hands with a man about to die now i dont feel that way in the least was the laughing response and harding sprang up to the box seized the reins cracked his whip when he got the word and was off the crowd gathered there cheered him of course but a generally sad expression rested upon every face as they looked upon the brave young miner who had taken his life in his hand to drive what was now called the deathtrap having halted for the night at the way cabin harding pushed on the next morning with the first glimmer of dawn and reached the third relay at noon there was then one more relay and the run into last chance which in good weather could readily be made before sunset he passed the last relay and the stocktender said as he was about to start goodby pard and do you know i kinder feels as if yer was a dead man already dont you believe it for i am worth a dozen dead men old man was the laughing response and harding drove on with the dead line rising in his mind before him he drove more rapidly than was the scheduletime and when he came into the pass with the dead line just ahead he had half an hour to spare the horses pricked up their ears as though they knew the doomed place well and the leaders gave a snort as they beheld a form ahead it was a man leaning against the cross erected in memory of bud benton that harding also saw the form was certain for his eyes were riveted upon the spot as he drew nearer the man moved away from the cross and advanced down into the trail still harding made no move to halt to rush by or appeared to take notice of him the man placed himself by the side of the trail and stood as still as a statue after making a slight sign as it appeared the answer of harding to this sign was to shake his head on rolled the coach and when it neared the silent form without any command to do so harding drew hard upon the reins pressed his foot heavily upon the brake and brought the coach to a standstill the horses which had before drawn it through the deadly dangers it had passed at that spot showing a restless dread and expectancy of the cracking of revolvers but there was no weapon drawn either by the man on the side of the trail or by harding and neither seemed to dread the other the reason for this was that the one who had awaited the coming of the coach at the dead line was none other than old huckleberry chapter xvii a secret kept just fifteen minutes before the time of arrival set for the coach by schedule hal harding drove up to the hotel at last chance from his entering the valley and passing the first mine he had been followed by cheer after cheer until when he reached landlord larrys tavern there were many there to swell the chorus of welcome larry greeted him most warmly and when he saw what a valuable freight he had brought through with him he told him that he was deserving of the highest praise harding received the honors heaped upon him in a modest manner and when asked by landlord larry if he had seen any roadagents answered not one all quiet along the trail then as quiet as the grave i suppose you were anxious upon reaching the dead line i think the horses were more nervous than i was for they at least showed it you told the agent at w about old hucks fate of course sir i told him of his mysterious disappearance do you know i halfway hoped you would hear something of old huck at w no i heard nothing of him there and none of the stocktenders had seen him they did not speak to me of having done so well he is gone that is certain but you have begun well harding and i hope may keep it up thank you landlord larry i hope that i will for i have an abiding faith in the belief that i will live to be an old man i hope so sincerely said the doctor who had been an attentive listener to the conversation between the young miner and larry they say at w doctor dick that if i go under you will be the only man who will dare drive the coach through and i will not do it unless we are doomed to be cut off from all communication and i see that last chance will be ruined from fear of traveling the trail to it said doctor dick decidedly how is your patient doctor which one for i have a number of patients just now the young man whose wound at the hands of the roadagents turned his brain i see him daily and he is about the same like a child mentally they asked about him at w for the agent had received several letters regarding him ah said doctor dick with interest what was their tenor that he had come out west upon a special mission and with considerable money and since leaving w where he had written of his arrival not a word had been heard from him i am glad that he has friends then for he will be cared for in his misfortune yes doctor dick and the agent hinted that some one was coming out to look him up i rejoice at this for he needs care the doctor rejoined and he added i have been convinced that he was no ordinary individual and had been well reared but what a blow it will be to his friends to find him as he is poor fellow after some further conversation harding went to his cabin for the night but he was not long in discovering that he was regarded as a hero by all he had not made the slightest reference to having met old huckleberry at the dead line and as he thought over the fact that he had done so and the secret that was known to him alone he muttered to himself if they only knew what a sensation it would be for last chance yes and for w as well not to speak of the masked roadagent chief and his men who thus far have been playing a winning game but luck sometimes turns and i guess it is nearing the turningpoint now and will come our way harding reported for duty promptly when the time came around for him to take the coach again on its perilous run we have got considerable golddust aboard pard and a big outgoing mail so i hope you will go through all right said landlord larry while doctor dick who just then came up said yes harding i have several valuable letters in the mail with drafts for large sums which i sincerely hope will not miscarry ill do the best i can doctor dick was the answer and harding went out and mounted the box he could not but feel gratified at the size of the crowd that had gathered to see him depart and he raised his sombrero politely in response to the cheers he had gone through in safety once but could he do it a second time that was the thought in the brain of every man there assembled at last the word was given and away went the coach cheered all the way down the valley until it was out of sight as before the young driver lost no time on the trail but upon reaching the dead line instead of seeming to dread the spot and wishing to drive rapidly by he dismounted from the box and going to the cross felt about among the wild flowers growing about it until he picked up a slip of paper while he hastily read what he found written thereon taking from his pocket a similar slip on which there was writing he thrust it out of sight in the spot he had taken the other from then he returned to the coach and drove on once more as though he felt no fear of his surroundings he reached the nightcabin on time and surprised the stocktender there by telling him that he intended to drive on to w that night you dont mean it i certainly do why yerll kill yer team smash ther old box and crush yerself to atoms i believe i can drive the road at night was the firm response its ther wust piece of road on ther whole overland trail it is a bad one but i will depend upon my team mainly and risk it why do you do it i have an idea that it will be safer how so well if there were roadagents on the trail to hold me up tomorrow ill miss them that is all right you are pard but i dont believe they is as dangerous as traveling this trail tonight ill let you know what i think upon my return was hardings answer and he drove on once more night had come on and he well knew the dangers before him from a mistake in driving he had been over the road perhaps half a dozen times always riding upon the box but upon his last run as driver he had most carefully noted every foot of the way the night was dark but he knew that he had the instinct of his team to depend upon and this was more than half the battle he was determined to push through and save his load of gold and if he did make a successful run over that part of the trail by night he would do what no other driver had done and on this account his pride was at stake so he started boldly yet cautiously upon his way and when the sun was just rising in w the stageagent there was awakened by wheels dashing up to his door and heard the call the coach from last chance has arrived he was up in a hurry and congratulating the young driver upon his night drive while he said do you know i feared you would be held up today for a party of desperadoes lately left w and i felt most anxious about you yes they are on the trail waiting for me now not knowing that i slipped by in the night ill get together a band of brave fellows and go back after them and an hour after harding was mounted upon a fine horse and leading a dozen men back upon the trail he had safely driven over in the night chapter xviii a mysterious sound the stageagent at w was right in declaring that the coach might be held up on the rough trail that was always driven by daylight for the party he feared were some wild fellows who had ridden into the settlement two days before and stated that they were on their way to the mines they were well mounted and armed had several packhorses with them and though not having the excuse of drinking to make them dreaded had carried on in a way that caused all peaceably disposed persons to dread them who they were no one knew and when they left the place honest men breathed more freely and congratulated each other that no tragedy had occurred as a reminder of their visit they had gone out upon the trail to last chance late in the afternoon and the agent felt sure that they would camp early and meet the coach the next morning and the result he greatly feared after a look at the party in question so he was rejoiced to find that harding had taken the great risk of driving through by night the crowd that he dreaded were five in number and they were young men bronzedfaced brawny and with an air of recklessness stamped upon them that they were a dangerous lot their appearance indicated and few men would care to face them where no help was at hand they had halted some dozen miles from w and gone into camp on a brook a few hundred yards from the trail the stage would follow that they knew their way well their movements were proof of for they rode at once to the campingplace staked out their horses spread their blankets and gathered wood to cook their supper with the spot chosen was one where they could command a view of the trail for a mile in both directions yet remain in concealment themselves they had supper then gambled a while by the light of the fire and afterward turned in setting no watch it was about midnight when one of the party awoke halfarose and listened he heard a rumbling sound that seemed to surprise him i say pards he called out a man awoke and asked drowsily what is it sully i hear wheels nonsense but i do its the roar of the stream i dont think so i does others were awakened and listened and they distinctly heard a low rumbling sound but after some minutes the sound died away and the one who had first discovered it asked do you think it could have been the coach no indeed why not no man living would dare drive a coach over this trail at night it sounded to me like wheels there it is again all listened attentively and then one said it is the wind in the pines the wind was rising and this solution of mysterious sound seemed to settle the matter so all laid down in their blankets once more the man who had discovered the sound was the one to arise first in the morning and the day was just dawning when he left his blankets gazed about him and then walked over to where the stagetrail ran several hundred yards from their camp and along through a bit of meadowland he had hardly reached the trail when he gave a loud halloo which brought his comrades from their blankets in an instant and his call set them coming toward him at a run look there pards he cried and as each man reached his side he stood gazing down at the trail the stage has gone by said one with an oath as his eyes fell upon the tracks of the six horses and the wheelmarks lately made then one man was bold enough to dare the drive at night sure and the chief will be furious with us what is to be done now the coach is safe in w now for if that fellow drove safely over the back trail he had no trouble beyond here then we had better get a move on us sure for that agent suspects us and therell be a gang on our heels mighty quick and hastening back to camp the party mounted and rode rapidly on toward the mountains chapter xix a fair passenger harding had ridden rapidly upon the trail back toward the night relay for he felt sure that the agent was right in his conjecture that the party of wild fellows who had left w had intended to hold him up on the trail the next day when he came along in fact the slip of paper he had picked up at the dead line had been a warning to that effect and hence he had dared take the drive at night hoping thus to elude his foes and had been successful when he reached the trail where the party had turned off to camp they soon came upon their haltingplace and as the ashes of their fire was cold it proved that they had departed before having breakfast there something frightened them off said harding but i wonder they did not hear my wheels camping as they did this near to the stagetrail they kept no watch doubtless but will you follow them yes to the relaystation at least arriving there for their trail had been lost in the rocky soil harding found that the men had not passed so they turned back for w arriving there by nightfall the coaches that came in from the south and east the next morning brought valuable mail for last chance and to the surprise of all a lady passenger she was young and veiled but enough was seen of her face to reveal its beauty she was dressed in perfect keeping for one on a long journey and carried only a small trunk with her she told the stationagent that her name was celeste seldon and that she had come west for a double purpose searching for her father and one other whom she was most anxious to find the last she had heard of her father was in a letter dated from w and a secret communication also mailed from w was the last tidings received from the second person she sought i wrote you mr agent she said in her sweet way asking about a young man bernard brandon by name who had come west upon a special mission you replied that he had been to w and gone on from here to last chance a miningcamp and though i have written there no response came so i decided to come myself and investigate have you heard anything more of mr brandon the agent looked troubled and seeing it she said quickly you have heard of him so i beg you to tell me all i regret to say miss that he was wounded on his way to last chance shot by roadagents but here is harding the driver of the last chance coach and he can tell you all harding did not appear to like having to give pain to the young girl but he frankly told her of the wound of the young man who could be no other than bernard brandon and the pitiful result i will go to him when do you start sir this afternoon miss but the trail is a very dangerous one and i had better bring him back with me no i will go with you and i will speak for the boxseat if it is not engaged oh no no seats are engaged for all dread the trail between here and last chance i do not so i ride with you sir on the boxseat was the determined reply of the young girl she paid her fare and when the coach started after having dinner at the agents mounted to the box with hardings aid and took her seat by the young driver while the crowd yelled lustily as they drove off to face the dangers of the trail harding drove off with the air of one who felt his full responsibility in having the care of a young and beautiful girl who dared risk the dangerous road he had to travel he found that his fair companion as soon as she left the settlement was very beautiful for she removed her veil when only having to be gazed upon by one person and that one a very handsome young miner it did not take her very long to discover that her companion though driving an overland coach was above the average she had thus far met with among the western wilds for he was polite wellinformed and his courage was proven by what he was then doing for miss seldon had been told by the agent just what trouble they had had on the line the night relay was reached and as there had been no expectation of ever accommodating young ladies no provision had been made for them so harding and the stocktender yielded the cabin to the fair passenger while they occupied a shanty nearby the stocktender exerted himself to make her comfortable and to provide the best supper and breakfast his larder would allow what a surprise they will get in last chance when they see her pard why them miners will make a goddess of her whatever that may be said the stocktender yes if we only get through pard for do you know i am more anxious now than when i am alone why is that well i have my reasons but let me tell you that i mean fight on this run if we are held up and the eyes of the young driver flashed fire the next morning the coach started upon its way half an hour earlier than usual and harding pushed his horses along at a far faster pace than they were accustomed to for some reason he seemed anxious to get by the dead line far ahead of time and to push on into last chance with all speed that was possible he found his fair charge most entertaining and she asked him all about life in the wild west and he was surprised to discover how much she knew of the frontier and its characters she spoke of army officers known to her well by name mentioned buffalo bill as a hero well known in the east and seemed anxious to glean all the information she could of the strange country into which she had ventured at last she touched upon the cause of her coming and her face saddened as she said it grieves me deeply to learn of the sad result of mr brandons wound though i cannot but feel as you say that he is bodily strong that something can be done to restore his mind he came here on a mission for me to find my father who i will confess to you was driven west by pretended friends and false misrepresentations that kept him here as though he had been the veriest criminal hiding from justice but it is not so and i long to find my father and restore him to his home and those who love him have you ever heard of him here his name was andrew seldon no miss seldon i never have heard the name that i now recall where was he when last you heard of him seven letters came into my possession long after they were written for i have not seen my father for seven long years and i was a little girl then and the last of those letters was mailed at w in it he stated that he had been in the mining country had been most successful and would come home within a year or two but this letter did not come to my hands directly and it was answered by others his enemies and mine and so i upon learning the truth and of a cruel plot against him and myself got mr brandon to come and look him up that he might know all as a dread came upon receiving the agents letter that harm had befallen mr brandon i decided to come at once to the west myself for i was reared on a plantation am a good rider have been inured to hardships and can handle firearms when there is need for them so i was fitted for just such a trip as i am now taking but here i am making a confidant of you mr harding when i should be keeping my own counsel oh no i am glad to know more of you and it may be in my power to aid you for i will gladly do all i can i feel that and we will be friends but why do you look so anxious do i yes you do well to be candid i am anxious for your sake not mine for i halfdread trouble on this run and we are nearing the scene of several tragedies which the miners call the dead line will you not ride in the coach now no i take all chances with you and remain where i am was the plucky reply of celeste seldon chapter xx masked foes the brave response of celeste seldon pleased the young miner though he did not wish her to remain upon the box he knew the merciless nature of the roadagents and that if they fired without challenging him she stood in as much danger as he did of being killed or wounded so he said i would much rather that you should go inside the coach especially until we pass the dead line no i remain here you are determined i am then i can say no more and i hope recognizing that i have a lady with me they will not fire upon me you seem to confidently expect an attack i am sorry to say that i do may i ask your reasons well i happen to know that one who was secretly on watch here on my last run is not here today having been called away i also know that five horsemen whom i have reason to believe to be roadagents left w ahead of me for the purpose of robbing the coach have you much of value with you i have considerable money in banknotes for miners at last chance is it too bulky for me to hide i think not miss then let me try it a halt was made and the money taken from its hidingplace then the girl asked do you know the amount that is here yes miss it is stated here and he handed out a paper i will take the paper and the money for i can hide it and with this she put it in a silk bag that she carried and fastened it securely beneath the skirt of her dress feeling relieved on this point harding drove on and soon after came in sight of the dead line he had just come up level with the cross that marked the spot of former tragedies and was talking to his team which showed much nervousness at passing a scene which they realized as one to dread when loud rang a voice hold hard harding or you are a dead man not a soul was visible among the rocks or in the trees and harding had it flash through his mind to make a dash when quickly the hand of the young girl was laid upon his arm and she said firmly obey i must do so was the low reply for the young man realized that it would bring a volley upon them to attempt to dash through so his foot went hard down upon the brake as he pulled his horses up and the stage came to a halt make your lines fast around the brake and hands up now came the order from the unseen foe you must obey said celeste seldon as the driver hesitated with a muttered imprecation harding obeyed and then out from the thicket came a horseman his horse was enveloped in a black blanket and the rider wore a black robe like a domino shielding his form completely his face was covered by a red closefitting mask while a cowl covered his head the devil on horseback muttered harding as he beheld the man and right there he made up his mind that if he was the sole one who held up the coach he would watch his chance if he could get celeste seldon away from his side and try a duel with him for mastery but this hope died away when as though suspecting the intention of harding the horseman called out come men and let us get to work silently there came out of the thicket half a dozen men on foot but all enveloped in black robes wearing red masks and with their feet clad in moccasins while a quick glance at the hoofs of the horse ridden by the chief showed that he had muffles on to prevent making a track the girl calmly surveyed the scene the halfdozen men appearing at the call of their chief seemed to be well trained for two of them went to the heads of the horses two more to either door of the coach and the others awaited orders the horseman rode close up to the side of the coach his hand upon his revolver harding i see that you meditate resistance if opportunity offers but let me warn you that you are a dead man the instant you make any attempt to escape or fire upon us i would kill you now without the slightest hesitation only i fear it would break up the line and travel to last chance and that i do not wish dismount from that box and remember my revolver covers you harding obeyed in sullen silence now what freight have you on i have the mails and this lady passenger but low as you are you will not rob her i hope there was money sent through by you to last chance you pretend to know this but i have no money for last chance i know better there is the coach search it but let me tell you if you touch the united states mails you will have every soldier stationed at w and at faraway on your track i believe you are right about that and i do not care to fight the government by robbing the mails but the money i want i have not got any i told you i do not believe you then find it i will a thorough search of the coach was made and then the driver was searched but without any money being found i know that the sum of thirty thousand dollars was to be sent by you to the miners in last chance you know this yes how never mind but i know it well you see that your spy misinformed you as the money cannot be found it is a dead loss to me and i hold you responsible all right i am but as i said if i kill you no man will be found to take your place oh yes doctor dick will d doctor dick i beg pardon miss but he refers to one whom i hate and some day will be avenged upon well if you kill me you will have the chance for he will drive with even that hope to get even with him i will not kill you yet i must have that money or a hostage take me then no i could not realize the amount on you then do without not i when there is a hostage at hand who this lady coward you would not dare wont i then see for that lady becomes my prisoner until i receive that money what money the thirty thousand you beat me out of today how can you get it by taking me with you asked celeste seldon quietly why very easily miss how so may i ask harding will go on to last chance and report that i have you as my prisoner to hold until the miners pay me the sum of well ill add interest so call it thirtyfive thousand dollars the miners have nothing to do with me sir they do not even know me that does not matter for they are a gallant lot of men rough though they may look and many of them be so when it is known what i have done they will chip in generously and the money will be raised very quickly how will you get it asked harding i will meet you on any day we may agree upon at this spot with this lady and you will come alone as i will and the exchange of the hostage for the money will be made if you come with others or attempt treachery i swear to you i will kill the girl before your eyes so if you wish to have that done play traitor while if you act squarely with me all will be well what do you say i say as it cannot be otherwise i will be your hostage until the money is paid you said celeste seldon firmly chapter xxi the sacrifice the plucky stand taken by celeste seldon won the admiration of harding at once he did not understand why she had been so prompt in her reply so willing to at once yield herself as a hostage until a ransom was received for her release but she did offer and he at once decided what he should do see here cutthroat he said i have something to say to you well out with it but be more choice in your epithets bestowed on me if you wish to keep in good health what dont like the name eh well i called you by a name that denotes your calling what have you to say just this that if you will allow this young lady to ride on to last chance on one of my stagehorses for he will carry her safely there i will remain your hostage until landlord larry sends the money out to you which you demand as a hostage you are of no value but the lady is well again what is it if i pay you the amount you said was to be sent by me will you let the lady go when will you pay it now do so and i will let the lady go free no no sir you have not the money cried celeste to harding yes miss i can make it good for i have a little more saved up than he demands and i can start over again to lay up a fortune you see for i am young yet i will not consent to that except that i return you the money my kind friend for i am well able to do so i will recompense you by paying you back my ransom we will not quarrel on that score miss so give him the money said harding celeste turned and raising her skirt took the bag of money from its hidingplace this she handed to harding who threw it at the masked outlaws feet with the remark your spy informed you correctly there is the money just thirtytwo thousand dollars thank you said the outlaw quietly counting the money before he spoke again yes it is all here now miss had harding ransomed you it was your intention to have repaid him you said by all means for i have no claim upon that brave gentleman you are able to pay back so large a ransom are you had i not been able to pay it back i would not have made the offer to do so you have not got the money with you oh no i am no traveling bank nor am i a fool well said but as you are able to pay a ransom for yourself i shall hold you a prisoner until you pay me the money i demand an oath burst involuntarily from the lips of harding at this treachery on the part of the roadagent while the young girl turned pale with momentary dread but she said firmly after receiving the money you demanded and which i feel it my duty to pay back as it is really my ransom will you be so vile so lost to all manhood as to enforce your words against me what more can you expect of one who has no character who is already damned body and soul oh no i have no conscience so do not appeal to me for all i wish in the world is gold and that i will have no matter who the victim or what the means i have to take to get it you are indeed lost to every human feeling so i said and you are my prisoner until this man harding brings me well say thirty thousand dollars ransom money for your safe delivery to him once more now miss i will take your baggage along for you may need it and you will go with me where would you take me to my retreat and you will be treated with respect but money i must have as for you harding go on to last chance and raise the money for this ladys ransom give it to doctor dick and let him come with you in your coach on your next run out halt just here and he will be met by one of my men with this lady if others come her life shall be the forfeit when my messenger receives the money this lady shall be given into the charge of doctor dick do you understand i do and you will understand that all of last chance every man capable of carrying a gun will be upon your trail before night just let any one pursue me and instead of finding me you will discover the dead body of this young girl in the trail awaiting you remember i am not to be followed or intimidated do you understand now harding made no reply for he was too much overcome to speak but the small leather trunk belonging to celeste seldon having been taken from the coach along with a sidesaddle and bridle she had brought with her the driver clasped her hand in farewell harding was unable himself to speak for his emotion at being unable to protect the girl celeste seldon said to the outlaw i would like to have a word with this gentleman before me yes said the masked chief very well i have no secret to make known to him so you may hear then turning to harding she continued you have been most kind to me sir and i appreciate it you have done all in your power for me no one could do more but let me say to you if you can raise the sum demanded by this this robber do so and every dollar shall be refunded to you within a few days after my return east the men wont ask it miss but i shall pay it now to the reason in part of my coming here yes miss try to find out for me among the miners if a man by the name of andrew seldon is known to any of them and if so where he is i will try also to do all in your power for that poor young man bernard brandon who you told me had been crazed by a bulletwound doubtless given by this very murderer yes i shot him and killed dave dockery the driver and a miner at the same time was the remark of the masked roadagent delivered with the utmost effrontery you seem proud of your red work sir yes killing is a trade with me just now celeste seldon turned from him with disgust and horror and addressing harding continued ask the one you spoke of as doctor dick to do all in his power for that poor sufferer and he shall be well rewarded for it when i am released i will go to last chance as it was my intention and do all i can to find my father and minister to the sufferings of poor mr brandon now i thank you once more and bid you goodby harding clasped her hand dared not to trust himself to speak but there were volumes in the look of intense hatred he cast upon the masked face of the roadagent chief then he mounted to the stagebox gathered up his lines and drove away in a silence that was most expressive harding glanced back as he came to the end of the caсon but saw that the roadagents and their fair prisoner had already disappeared then the lash descended upon the backs of the startled horses and the team was sent along at a pace that was dangerous indeed but harding could only find vent for his pentup feelings by rapid and reckless driving and never before had the distance between the dead line and last chance been covered in the time in which he made it notwithstanding his delay at the dead line he went thundering up the valley half an hour ahead of time and when he drew rein before the hotel his horses were reeking with foam and panting like hardrun hounds while his face was white his eyes ablaze with anger and indignation and his teeth set firmly great god harding what has happened cried landlord larry in alarm throwing the mail at the feet of the surprised landlord harding leaped to the ground and said hoarsely come i wish to speak to you he led the way into the office and then told the whole story we will mount a hundred men and go in pursuit at once cried larry what do you forget his threat what threat to kill the girl he will not do it he will no he dare not you do not know him i do well what is to be done just what he demands what pay him by all means and save the girl you are right but have all ready then the moment that she is safe to throw five hundred mounted men on a hunt for him have the entire country about dead line surrounded and then hunt him and his men to death savagely said harding yes it must be done but now to tell the men what has happened and landlord larry went out followed by harding to find a large crowd of miners gathered about the hotel chapter xxii the ransom landlord larry was considerably nonplused by what had been told him by harding and he hardly knew how to break the news to the miners hundreds had assembled for the mad race of hardings team up the valley had told them that something had gone wrong so they had hurried in twos and by halfdozens to the hotel to hear what had happened they were more eager to learn it all when it was told how harding had made no report but had led landlord larry into the office and been closeted there with him an hour the panting horses had been led away to the stable the mail had been opened by landlord larrys clerk and many had gotten letters but the interest in letters was lost in the desire to learn what had happened on hardings run in when the two men were seen coming out of the hotel a wild yell greeted them landlord larry stepped out upon the piazza and at once a silence fell upon the crowd while every eye was turned upon the white face of harding men i have bad news for you said landlord larry the coach has been held up again and thirtytwo thousand dollars in money given to driver harding to bring to last chance was taken there are some forty of you who feel this loss having sent your gold out to be exchanged for this money but that is not the worst of it the mails were not disturbed as the roadagent said that he wished no trouble with the government nor is this all for harding had a passenger with him on this run a young girl where is she came in a chorus of voices i will tell you there were seven roadagents all masked and their chief mounted they held the coach up at the dead line and they covered harding with their rifles and demanded the money which in some way they knew he had the young lady had hidden it for him but as she was to be held for ransom she gave it up and learning that she was rich the roadagent chief then demanded ransom from her and speaking slowly and distinctly landlord larry went on to tell the whole story of the coach and taking of celeste seldon captive the crowd was as silent as death except for the suppressed breathing of the men and the bronzed faces of the miners paled and flushed by turns when at last it was told how a ransom of thirty thousand dollars was demanded before a word had been said that it would be paid back a yell arose well raise it good that is just what i knew you would do pards and i will head the list with five hundred said landlord larry put me down for five hundred called out harding and the two offers were cheered while a stern voice called out behind the landlord put me down for a thousand larry for i have heard all that you have told the men it was doctor dick who seeing the crowd in front of the hotel had come to the piazza by passing into the house through the rear door another cheer greeted the sum named by doctor dick and there arose cries on all sides as men pressed forward ill give a thousand landlord name me for fifty put me on the list for a hundred twentyfive for me and so on were the sums named by the noblehearted and generous fellows even those who had lost their money by the roadagents subscribing until doctor dick called out for he had been keeping account hold on all the amount is already named now men form in line and give your names as you pass along and the money those who have it it was late when the ransom list was made up and the men had not heeded the suppergong until after they had paid their subscriptions then landlord larry packed the money away and the crowd dispersed to their various occupations and pleasures for the night which may be set down as consisting principally of drinking and gambling the question regarding the unfortunate girl who had fallen into the hands of the masked and merciless outlaws being settled the driver said to landlord larry and doctor dick who had returned to the office in the hotel now i wish to see about the poor fellow whom that young girl was coming out to see and also to learn about her father who was her father asked landlord larry her name is celeste seldon and she wished me to ascertain if her father had ever been heard of in the mines his name was andrew seldon andrew seldon quickly said doctor dick yes i know of such a man or rather knew of him for he is dead now was the response of the gambler a cloud passed over the face of harding and he remarked sadly that poor girl seems doomed to have sorrow dog her steps but you knew her father doctor yes i knew him long years ago and i happen to know of his having been out here working for a fortune in the mines i believe you are sure that it is the one she seeks the names are the same the andrew seldon i knew was from tennessee so was her father and he must be the man you refer to but where did he die ill tell you what i have not made known to others buffalo bill and i struck a trail to see what the end would bring to us and the night before we came to the end those we sought were buried by the cavingin of a mine which they were working under a cliff one of those men was andrew seldon and he had a companion with him and they were killed yes buried under the cliff that fell upon their cabin destroying all you must tell the story to the young girl for i cannot doctor i will do so though i hate to give a woman pain now doctor i wish to ask about the one she seeks here in last chance who is he harding the poor fellow you so devotedly cared for but whose reason was destroyed by the wound he received from the roadagents ah yes poor fellow his mind is irrevocably wrecked where is he landlord larry can tell you better than i for he seems to avoid my cabin since i gave him up as a patient he wanders about among the camps at will but that reminds me that i have not seen him today the landlord said is he the one the girl is coming to see asked doctor dick yes and his name is bernard brandon he came out here on a special mission for her i suppose to find her father and not hearing from him she feared that he had gotten into trouble so came west herself in search of him well her coming may bring back his reason though i doubt it will you not question him doctor telling him about her and see if you cannot get him to talk rationally certainly harding but where is he landlord larry asked his clerk about the man but he had not seen him all day and the miners being questioned not one recalled having seen him since the day before in some dread that harm had befallen him harding then went out in search of the poor fellow he went from miner to miner and camp to camp in his vain search for not anywhere could he find any one who had seen the missing man for over twentyfour hours becoming really alarmed when he realized the shock it would be to celeste seldon whose hazardous and costly trip to the west would be utterly useless harding went back to the hotel to consult doctor dick and landlord larry about giving a general alarm then alarms were only given in times of direct need for the miners were sworn to obey the call and come from every camp and mine within the circuit of habitation about last chance the alarm was given by sending a mounted bugler to every prominent point in the valley where he was to sound the rally three times a halfdozen positions thus visited would send the buglenotes into every camp of the valley and it was the duty of all miners to at once strike for the place of assembly at the hotel and give the warning to all others whom they saw landlord larry hearing the story of hardings fruitless search for the stranger at once decided to order the alarm sounded without consulting doctor dick who was not at his cabin so the bugler was called in and mounting a speedy horse he placed the bugle to his lips and loud clear and ringing resounded the rally then he dashed from point to point at the full speed of his horse and within half an hour from half a dozen prominent positions the buglecall assembling the miners had rung out and men were hastening to obey the summons within an hour every man in last chance had reported at the assemblingpoint all eager to know the cause of the alarm again landlord larry was the speaker and he began by asking if the unfortunate stranger whose wound had crazed him was in the crowd every eye was at once on the search for the man but soon the reports came that bernard brandon was not in the crowd then landlord larry made known that the mysterious disappearance at the time of miss seldons capture by the roadagents was a coincidence so strange that it needed explanation miss seldon was coming to last chance to find that very young man who had in turn come there in search of her father and now when she was a captive to the roadagents to be given up only upon the payment of a large ransom the stranger had most mysteriously disappeared the name of the young ladys father was andrew seldon and if any miner present could tell aught regarding him or had known such a man the landlord wished him to come and tell him all that he could about him but it was the duty and but justice for one and all of them to set out on the search for the young stranger who had disappeared from their midst and he wished to know if they would not take a day off and do so for it might be that he had been injured and was then lying suffering and deserving their sympathy and aid somewhere among the mountains a perfect yell in answer to the request of landlord larry told him that bernard brandon would be found if he was in or near last chance and so it was agreed that all would start at dawn the following morning many mounted many on foot and report the result if good or bad at the hotel at night so the miners meeting broke up and with the first gray in the east the following morning fourfifths of last chance were off searching for the missing man as they wore themselves out or completed the search over the circuit assigned them the men came in and reported at the hotel each had the same story to tell that the search had been a fruitless one many of the mounted men did not come in until after dark but theirs was the same story that no trace of the missing stranger could be found at last every man who had been on the search had returned and not the slightest trace of the missing brandon had been discovered by a single one who had gone out to look for him no one remembered to have seen him very lately and so his fate was unsolved and the miners put it down as unknown with the belief that he had either been kidnaped by roadagents or had fallen into some stream or from a cliff and thus met his death the belief of landlord larry and harding was that bernard brandon had been captured for some reason by roadagents and this convinced them that there were spies of the outlaws then dwelling in their midst but what the motive for kidnaping the man was they could only conjecture believing it to be ransom that they thought the miners would pay and if they did not that celeste seldon would this belief of spies in their midst caused a very unpleasant and uneasy feeling among all for hardly any man knew whether he could trust his own comrade or not doctor dick came in late from his search and rounds to visit his patients and listened in silence to the report that bernard brandon could not be found he however would not believe that roadagents had kidnaped the crazed man but said that he might have sprung from the cliff and taken his own life have fallen over a precipice or been devoured by the fierce mountainwolves that hung in packs about the camps chapter xxiii the outlaws captive it was with a sinking heart that celeste seldon saw harding drive away upon the stage leaving her in the power of the roadagents but she was a brave girl and determined to show the outlaws that she did not fear them no matter how great her dread of them was in reality the saddle and bridle she had brought with her were carried along for a couple of miles and placed upon a led horse one of half a score hidden there and the masked chief started to aid her to mount but she said with a sneer i need no assistance from you with this she placed her hands upon the horn and leaped lightly into the saddle her leather trunk was then strapped securely upon a packsaddle and the chief said now miss seldon that you and my men are mounted we will start she turned her horse on the trail behind him and the other outlaws followed all riding in indian file and with several packhorses bringing up the rear after a ride of a dozen miles a halt was made for a rest the chief said and then celeste seldon observed that the hoofs of every horse were muffled to prevent their leaving a trail having been left something over a couple of miles from the scene of the holding up of the stage it would be next to impossible for the best of trailers to discover which way the roadagents had come to the spot and left it for the chiefs muffledhoofed horse would leave no track to where the other animals were tired out and anxious celeste seldon after eating sparingly of the food given her by the chief sat down with her back to a tree and closing her eyes dropped into a deep sleep when she was awakened to continue the journey she found that she had slept an hour we are ready to go miss said the man who had appeared to be the chiefs lieutenant and whom he had called wolf whether because it was his real name or on account of his nature celeste did not know i am ready she said simply refreshed by her short nap shall i aid you to mount miss no i can mount without your aid but where is your chief he has gone on ahead miss to prepare for your coming leaving me to escort you i am content for one is as bad as the other was the reply and leaping into her saddle again she fell in behind the man wolf and the march was again begun night came on but the outlaws rode on for an hour or more when they halted at a small spring in a thicket celeste was made more comfortable in a shelter of boughs hastily cut and thrown up and when supper was ready she ate heartily of antelopesteak crackers and coffee she was rather glad to have got rid of the masked chief of whom she stood in the greatest awe and wolf never spoke to her unless she addressed some remark to him when she lay down upon the blanketbed spread upon fine straw which he had made for her she sank at once to sleep she had no thought of escape for what could she do there alone in that wild trackless land she would bide her time and await the result be it what it might she was awakened early in the morning and the march was at once begun again a halt being made a couple of hours later for breakfast while it was being prepared she was allowed to wander at will wolf calling her only when it was ready and thus showing that they had not the slightest idea that she would do so foolish a thing as to escape from them to perish in the wilderness or meet death by being attacked by wild beasts when the start was again made wolf said when we halt for our noon camp miss i will have to blindfold you and bind your hands ah you consider me very dangerous then she said with a smile you doubtless are dangerous miss in more ways than one but it is to prevent your seeing where we take you that you are to be blindfolded do you think i could guide a party after you you have the nerve to do it miss but why bind my hands to prevent your removing the bandage from your eyes miss i will pledge you my word that i will not do so i believe you would keep your word miss but the chief is a man who is merciless and his orders were to blindfold and bind you and if i disobey he would shoot me down as though i were in reality a wolf perhaps not much loss but i will submit said celeste with a sigh for she had enjoyed the scenery and her freedom as well this far and now must be both blindfolded and bound chapter xxiv the two fugitives it will be remembered that when buffalo bill and doctor dick rode away from the cavedin mine and crushed cabin of the two goldhunters in the grand caсon there were human eyes following their movements that they little dreamed were upon them gazing at them from a hidingplace half a mile away were two men whose faces showed much anxiety as they saw the scout and the gold king moving about their quarters when they had believed themselves hidden from all search by friend or foe those two were andrew seldon and lucas langley their escape had been miraculous from being buried in the mine beneath the cliff and they had established for themselves new quarters up the grand caсon a few miles away from their former home this new campingplace was more secluded than the former one and approached by a narrow ridge that no one would believe a horse could pass along for in places it was only eighteen inches wide but andrew seldon had gone first along it on foot and found beyond up in the depths of a large caсon opening into the mightier one a perfect garden spot and scene of beauty a crystal stream trickled down a lofty precipice and flowed through the caсon and in its bed glittered grains of gold innumerable back under the shadows of the towering cliffs there were found veins of precious metal giving promise of rich mines there were trees growing luxuriously in this natures park velvety grass covering acres of meadowland wild fruits that were delicious and everything to make this home a most charming one they first made the effort to get their horses across the narrow ridge upon either side of which was an abyss a quarter of a mile in depth seamed with ravines and looking like the craters of defunct volcanoes the first horse tried andrew seldons own ridinganimal followed his master without hesitation along the dizzy awful pathway turning seldon led him back again and then the other animals followed slowly and though nervously yet without accident they were repaid for their fright when turned loose upon the acres of luxuriant grass in the valley a fence of poles made a barrier across the narrow entrance of the valley and so the horses were allowed to roam at will a stout cabin was next built and the two men having made themselves comfortable for the winter were ready to begin their search for gold feeling safe once more in their retreat for who would believe that they had crossed that narrow ridge to find a hidingplace beyond and here these two men so strangely met with mysterious lives and both in hiding from the world settled down to win a fortune from the generous earth to earn riches that would make them comfortable in their latter years far from the scenes that had known them in other days and to which they dared not return each day they worked several hours in their goldhunting and then one of them would take his gun and go in search of game while the other would do the chores about their cabin it was upon one of these hunting expeditions one day that andrew seldon found himself belated from having pursued his game much farther than he had thought it was some miles back to camp and the sun had long since ceased to send its rays down into the depths of the mighty chasm of the grand caсon he started back with his game swung up on his back and the shadows rapidly deepening about him as he neared his old destroyed home he stopped suddenly for across the caсon a light flashed before his gaze it is a firelight as sure as i live he muttered what does it what can it mean he stood like one dazed by the sight for some time and then slowly fell from his lips the words it can mean but one thing that some one has come into the caсon after a moment more of silent thought he said almost cheerily ah it is lucas but again his voice changed as he added no he dreads the spot where he was so nearly buried alive and will not go there whoever it is he is a stranger i must know for if they have come here to remain if they are our foes we will be forewarned and hence forearmed i will at once solve the mystery for i had hoped never to behold a human face here other than lucas langleys and my own and the goldhunter walked away in the direction of the firelight which had so startled him he went cautiously for he knew well the danger if he was discovered and the builders of the campfire proved to be foes he knew the locality well and that he could approach within a hundred yards of the fire and discover just what there was to be seen arriving within an eighth of a mile of the spot he halted laid aside his game and rifle and then moved forward from rock to rock tree to tree armed only with his revolvers he now saw that there were three fires two near together and one a couple of hundred feet apart and off to itself the scene of the camp was a small caсon near his old home and on the trail leading to it there was gold in the caсon for he had discovered it there and taken some away while he had marked it as his claim it having been already staked as one of the finds and claims of the real andrew seldon in truth there were a dozen such claims in the grand caсon found by andrew seldon all of them paying finds having reached a point within a hundred yards of the campfires seldon leaned over a rock and began to survey the scene the three fires were burning brightly and beyond the light fell upon a number of horses corralled in the caсon where there was grass and water there were brush shelters near three in number and about the fires in front of them were gathered a number of men counting them andrew seldon found that there were eight in sight there appeared to be no guard kept and the camp was certainly not a very new one apparently having been made there several weeks before emboldened by his discovery the goldhunter crept nearer and nearer and then could see that the men were all masked this struck him as being a very remarkable circumstance indeed since they were clad like miners some of them wearing beards that came below their masks all were armed thoroughly they were eating their supper as andrew seldon looked at them gaining a point of observation still nearer the goldhunter obtained a view of the campfire apart from the others a comfortable little cabin was just behind the fire and a rustic bench had been made near it a blanket hung over the door of the tiny cabin and about the fire was the evidence of a supper recently eaten for a cup tin plate and knives with the remains of a meal were upon a rock that served as a table upon the rustic seat sat one whose presence there was a great surprise to andrew seldon by heaven it is a woman he almost cried aloud in his amazement then he determined to get a still nearer view and after surveying the position he decided that he could do so by passing around to the edge of the cliff and creeping along it to a point not sixty feet away as he after very cautious work reached the point he sought some forty feet from the one at the campfire gazing upon her he muttered to himself it is a young and beautiful girl and why is she here with those strange men who is she and what is this mystery i must solve it he noted that the single fire was just around a bend of the caсon and that the men were camped below her this looks as though she was a prisoner but how did they find this spot and how dare they venture down that dangerous trail well andrew seldon the real did it i did it lucas langley also and buffalo bill and the comrade with him were two more to make the venture so why not these men but why are they masked and what does it mean that they have that young girl in their midst beyond doubt she is a captive and yet i dare not communicate with her it would betray my presence and i would lose all perhaps my life they do not know of my presence here in the grand caсon and they will hardly find our camp at least as long as they find gold where they are well i will return to my home and tell langley of my strange discovery after so musing and gazing the while at the girl andrew seldon was about to leave his position when he saw a horseman ride into the lower camp the horse seemed to have been hard ridden for he came in with lowered head and that the newcomer was in authority there was shown by the men rising as he approached the fire while one of them took care of his horse i will see what this arrival means muttered andrew seldon and he kept his position among the rocks chapter xxv the outlaw lover the man who had ridden into camp gave some order which andrew seldon could not hear and one of those about the campfire at once set about preparing supper for him there was upon his face a red mask much as the others wore but he was dressed in somewhat better style than they wearing cavalryboots instead of heavy ones such as his men had on while his body dress was a velvet jacket his hat was a slouch encircled by a silver cord representing a snake as the goldhunter discovered when he afterward got a closer view of him he talked to his men for a few minutes but what he said the goldhunter was unable to hear then he walked away in the direction of the other fire now i can know what this means muttered andrew seldon eagerly the young girl had certainly seen the man arrive in camp but she had shown no interest apparently in his coming and now as he approached she calmly remained seated her eyes however following his movements as he drew near he politely raised his sombrero and said i hope i find miss seldon well seldon she bears the name i now am masquerading under muttered the goldhunter in intense surprise miss seldon is as well as could be expected under the existing circumstances of being the captive of a band of cutthroats was the cutting reply and the listening man who heard all opened wide his eyes you are harsh in your terms miss seldon are you not roadagents robbers and murderers and are you not holding me here for ransom after having robbed me of a large sum in my keeping yes such is the case then why wince under the name of cutthroat but you have been away for some days i have you have seen your chief i have and what message does he send you are to go with me at dawn to the rendezvous on the overland trail where you are to be given over to the one sent by the miners of last chance to pay your ransom i am glad of this but will your chief keep faith or will he play the traitor for a third time and escape giving me up through some trick no for if he did he would surely be run down as he knows by the miners even if your life was the forfeit i hope it may prove true that i am to be ransomed and i will be ready to go with you but where is your chief he is in his other camp then he has two yes am i to be blindfolded and bound again when you are taking me from here such are his orders miss seldon he fears that i a young girl may lead a force upon his secret retreat that is just what he fears miss seldon i only wish i was able to do so miss seldon may i speak a word to you suddenly said the masked outlaw drawing nearer i believe there is no more to say for i will be ready at the hour you desire to start there is more to say and say it i will i wish to tell you that i have been a very wicked man that i went to the bad when hardly out of my teens broke my mothers heart by my evil life and ruined my father financially driving him to suicide in his despair i came west and tried to redeem the past by becoming an honest miner but luck went against me and i at last turned once more to evil and found a band of outlaws money came to me in plenty and at last i drifted into the band that our chief commands and as you know i am his lieutenant he found this mine and sent us here to work it and have our retreat here also much gold is coming to us through our work and also by our holding up the coaches on the last chance trail for he posts us where to be on hand for an attack as we have what we call the postoffice halfway between our camp and his when he made you a prisoner i felt for you and as i was the one to hold you captive and bring you here i grew more and more fond of you until now i must i will tell you that i love you with my whole heart and soul celeste seldon the young girl had not moved during the time that the outlaw lieutenant was speaking but now when he proclaimed his love for her she arose drew herself up and said haughtily and i celeste seldon abhor such love as you an outlaw would feel for me and command you not again to speak one word to me while i am in the hateful atmosphere of your presence as your prisoner chapter xxvi the secret out celeste seldon it was her name his daughters name and yet the letter said that she was dead is this a coincidence or is she alive and is this young girl the child of andrew seldon the real so mused andrew seldon the impersonator as he crouched among the rocks his eyes riveted upon the girl not fifty feet from him and who so boldly faced the outlaw officer who had dared breathe to her a word of love the outlaw stood abashed at the manner in which his avowal of love had been received there was no anger in his look and he seemed hurt rather than offended after celeste seldons indignant response to him he halfturned away as though to retire in silence but then reconsidered his determination and said in a low tone full of feeling pardon me for i did wrong to think for a moment that an angel would look kindly upon a devil i love you and i could not but tell you of it for you had decided me as to my own course you had made me see my evil life as it is in all its enormity and decide to make another struggle to go back to honor and truth this at least you deserve credit for and i trust you may carry out your resolve for in that you shall have my full sympathy thank you miss seldon but i have something more to say to you well sir you are to be given up by the chief on the payment of your ransom yes i wish i could prevent this robbery but i cannot as it is simply beyond my power to do so i do not ask it of you granted but your being returned will not end it all how do you mean you came here for an avowed purpose as i understand it i did mr wolf that purpose was to find one who had come west on a special mission granted again his mission was to find your father andrew seldon the listener crouching among the rocks started at this and set his teeth hard while he awaited the reply of the young girl yes he came to find my father andrew seldon who i had reason to believe was in the miningcountry about here you have not heard of the young man who came at your bidding let me say that he came of his own accord knowing that a great wrong had been done my father by one whom he believed his dearest friend he came to find him and tell him all the sad truth but why am i telling you this because you know that i am interested that i can aid you can you was the eager reply i can do so and and what i will reward you generously i seek no reward ask for none would not accept any pay at your hands other than to earn your good opinion and gratitude well sir said celeste seldon coolly have you found your father no i regret to say i have not but i was interrupted in my search by being captured by your robber chief do you know what became of the young man who came west in search of him i had a letter mailed at w from him stating that he had heard of people at last chance who might tell him of my father and that he was going there and would at once communicate with me i had no other letter and my communications remained unanswered even my telegrams wired to santa fй and mailed there brought no response then i decided to come out here myself and i acted promptly and you have not found the one you seek i have discovered that the coach in which he left w was held up by your band that he was wounded and that though he was placed under the care of one known as doctor dick a surgeon though his life was saved his reason was gone and now he is wandering about the mines of last chance a harmless lunatic he was until lately what do you mean i mean that he was kidnaped several days ago kidnaped yes miss seldon for what purpose ransom by whom my chief ah but what ransom can he get from him i believe you told the chief that you were rich and this poor fellow is your messenger i think i understand yes you will be returned and then negotiations will be entered into for your messengers ransom ah i am to be still further robbed said celeste with a sneer yes and that is not the end came the significant reply there was something in the response of the outlaw officer that impressed the young girl most strangely what more could there be in store for her than she had already passed through which caused him to say that the end was not yet the listener among the rocks kept his eyes riveted upon the two his ears turned to catch every word they uttered he now knew that the letter he had received telling him as andrew seldon that celeste the daughter was dead was false and a fraud perpetrated for some reason upon the absent miner you say that the ransom of bernard brandon will not be the end asked celeste after a moment of meditation it will not what else can there be a great deal what do you mean there will be a third demand how upon you for what gold by whom the chief what will the demand be for ill tell you the truth as i happen to know it or rather suspect it from what i do know have seen and heard i hope that you will act squarely with me mr wolf upon my life i will and though i cannot help you now must even appear to be your foe in the end i will help you and prove to be your friend i hope so you ask what this third demand will be yes will you ransom bernard brandon where is he a fugitive where he will be in this camp tomorrow ah then i will see him no he will not arrive until after your departure i will await his coming that cannot be for i have orders to start with you to be ransomed and you are not supposed to know that he has been captured but you have told me so it was a confidential communication and if you betray me i can render you no further service for my usefulness will be gone in fact i would be put to death i will not betray you thank you but let me say that brandon will be brought here for two men now have him in charge and are on the trail here yes you will be ransomed and then go to last chance there you will learn of brandons mysterious disappearance and a ransom will soon after be demanded for him yes you will pay it of course i will then comes the third trial what is it you will be captured ah it is true by whom the masked chief of the cloven hoofs of the grand caсon of the colorado he will still hunt me down he will being forewarned is being forearmed not in this case why so he works in a most mysterious way and do all you may you will be captured by him and another ransom demanded yes and so he will continue to rob me of my gold in this case the ransom will not be of gold i do not understand the ransom demanded will be your hand in marriage celeste uttered a cry of alarm and started back with a look of horror upon her beautiful face chapter xxvii the departure the reply of the outlaw officer telling what the third demand to be made upon celeste seldon would be caused her face to pale and her lips quiver while her eyes burned brightly with indignation she stood for a moment in silence and then asked do you mean that he will make this demand upon me i mean that the demand will be made upon you by one who will enforce it who that i cannot tell you more i cannot say to you yet i will relieve your anxiety by saying that i will protect you cost whose life it may you yes if you are again captured though if i can prevent it i will but if i am it will end there for then i will prove my reformation i will protect you and that poor fellow for whom you will have to pay ransom when i do i believe i will be able to return your gold paid in ransom to you again but whether i do or not you will go your way free and brandon also and i will prove that you have reformed me that my loving you has made me a different man now i cannot will not say more but remember that through all i will secretly be your friend though openly appearing as your guard and enemy i thank you and i will trust you and stepping forward celeste seldon held forth her hand the man put forth his own as though to grasp it then hesitated and said no i will prove my reformation my friendship before i touch you with my crimestained hand i will call you at an early hour and turning abruptly the outlaw lover of celeste seldon walked away resuming her seat the young girl became lost in thought while andrew seldon as we shall still call him after gazing at her for a few moments in silence turned away from his hidingplace and crept cautiously back to where he had left his game and rifle he knew that his comrade would be most anxious about him yet he determined to remain there for the night and see the departure in the morning he would then know just how many outlaws went with celeste seldon as a guard and how many remained so he made himself as comfortable as possible and sank to sleep to awake an hour before dawn and see the campfires burning brightly creeping to the safest point of observation from which he could retreat unseen after daylight should any of the outlaws remain in their camp he waited for developments he had not long to wait before he saw a party approaching on horseback there was one in the lead and as he came within a few yards of where he lay andrew seldon recognized the outlaw officer wolf he held a lariat in his hand that was attached to the bit of the horse following and upon which was mounted celeste seldon in the dim gray of early dawn seldon saw that the eyes of celeste were blindfolded and her hands rested in her lap as though bound behind her came in single file five outlaws and like their leader they were masked bringing up the rear were a couple of packhorses well laden the party passed on and then andrew seldon turned his attention to the outlaw camp in which several of the men had been left having discovered this seldon then crept cautiously back picked up his rifle and game and started off at a doublequick for his own camp anxious to relieve his pards anxiety regarding him and to tell him all that he had discovered a man of great endurance he made a rapid run to his home and did not feel it in the least he found lucas langley just starting off on a search for him and the welcome he received was a sincere one how glad i am to see you pard seldon surely you were not lost he said no indeed but have you any breakfast for i am as ravenous as a wolf as i went without dinner and supper yesterday and did not delay to cook anything this morning you shall have something in a few minutes so wash up and ill get it for you and then we must have a talk said seldon as he went down toward the little stream for a refreshing plungebath he has had an adventure of some kind i am sure muttered lucas langley as he threw a fine steak upon the coals and put some fresh coffee in the pot andrew seldons bath greatly refreshed him and he ate his breakfast quietly after which he said well not go goldhunting today pard for i have something to tell you i feel that you have seen some one in the grand caсon you are right i have are they here to stay yes they think so who are they they are masked men outlaws belonging i feel sure to the roadagent band i heard of when at w they go masked in camp they do how many there are i think nearly a dozen of them tell me of them and where they are they are camped in the bluecliff caсon near our old home and are working the mine we marked as number two on our map they are here for gold then yes golddiggers in their idle moments and at other times roadagents making their retreat here where they deem themselves safe they did not see you no indeed but i got within fifty feet of one of their campfires and where they had a captive ah a prisoner yes did you know him it was a young girl the devils that is what they are indeed but let me tell you just what i discovered overheard and saw then andrew seldon told the story and in lucas langley he found a most ready listener oh that we could rescue that girl said langley when he had heard all to make the attempt would be but to meet with signal failure now lucas i fear so still i will see that they are not left long to carry on their work of deviltry i am with you heart and soul i know that well pard but they will return the girl for the ransom demanded and then they will get the amount they claim for the young man they spoke of yes this will take some days and in that time i shall act you yes they will lay their plans to kidnap the girl from last chance to carry out this scheme of the chief to have his third demand come in and right there i shall thwart them but how can you i will start tonight for fort faraway will you go there yes you told me that there were reasons why you would not go anywhere among those who might recognize you it is different now and necessity demands that i take the risk i have changed greatly for my long hair and beard my glasses and other changes completely disguise me from what i was and so i will go to fort faraway for what purpose i wish to see buffalo bill and place these facts before him for we can tell him where to find the outlaws secret retreat and i believe that the girl and the young man can be saved and every member of the robber band captured it would be a grand thing for you to do yes it is just what i wish to do to render some valuable service to the government when shall we start i will start tonight but you pard must remain here in possession of our mines as you wish pard but will you be gone long not a day longer than is necessary pard well success go with you was lucas langleys response and the two men began to make preparations for the start of the one with information of where the retreat of the outlaw band could be found andrew seldon did not care to take a packhorse for he wished to make all the time possible and when the sun went down he was ready for the trail and with lucas langley accompanying him he started down the caсon to steal by the robbers camp chapter xxviii the lone trail well supplied with food and ammunition having plenty of blankets along for the nights were cold and mounted upon the best one of their horses andrew seldon felt ready to cope with whatever he might have to encounter in the way of hardships and dangers mufflers had been prepared for the hoofs of his horse that he might leave no trail and make no sound in passing the robber camp while a muzzle was carried for the nose of the animal to prevent his neighing and thus betraying his presence to foes after crossing the narrow ridge the mufflers and muzzle were tied on and the two men stole along leading the horse until they came in sight of the campfires only two were burning now and about them only a few men were visible the two men slipped by unseen with their horse some eighth of a mile distant from the camp and having seen his pard to safety lucas langley bade him farewell with many good wishes for his success and started upon his return mounting then andrew seldon set off on his lonely and perilous mission he ascended the hazardous trail stripped his horse of his trappings upon reaching the deadly cliff which he had to pass around and got safely by with the animal then he brought his saddle and trappings around led the horse to the top of the caсon rim and mounting set off for fort faraway taking the trail that must lead him by the deserted camp where he had killed blackheart bill in a duel and where the desperado rested in his grave after his tumultuous life of evil by rapid riding he reached the deserted camp soon after midnight and dismounting prepared to go into camp there was the best of water and grass there and to be merciful to his horse andrew seldon did not allow his own feelings to cause him to camp elsewhere when the animal would be the sufferer having watered his horse and staked him out to feed he sat down upon a log near the wickiup and ate his cold supper quietly then he lighted his pipe and began to smoke with a strange calmness of mien when it is remembered that there within a few yards of him at the base of the quaking aspen whose white trunk looked ghostly in the moonlight was the grave of the man he had killed the man who had been his boyhood friend and afterward his bitterest foe laying aside his pipe he spread his blankets in the wickiup and then walked quietly toward the quaking aspen there was the mound that marked the last restingplace of hugh mayhew whose deeds of wickedness had won for him the name of blackheart bill what thoughts crowded upon him as he stood there gazing upon the little mound of earth knowing that only a few feet below the surface the dead face of his onetime friend was upturned toward him who can tell for some time he stood there his arms folded upon his broad breast and his head bowed at last a sigh found its way between his set teeth and he turned away reaching the wickiup he paused and mused aloud well i am making a bold venture to dare go to the fort from which i fled on the day appointed for my execution fled to live on here in the wilderness believed to be dead yet living my own name cast aside and living under that of one i never knew in life how strange this life is its bitterness sorrows realities and romance and how strange indeed has been my career well what will the end be i wonder i am taking my life in my hands to venture to the fort but i must save that poor girl run down those outlaws and i can only do it through buffalo bill now to turn in for i must get some rest and will even in this weird spot chapter xxix to welcome the fair guest the miners of last chance were too much excited over the expected ransom of celeste seldon and the thought of soon having a young and beautiful girl in the miningcamps to devote themselves to steady work after the situation was known to them then too they were greatly disturbed at the mysterious disappearance of bernard brandon the young man whose mind had been destroyed by his wound and which they could not comprehend for not the slightest trace had been found of him with all their searching the fact that they had been robbed and also celeste seldon was another disturbing element and so it was that little work was done in the mines during the time following hardings arrival and the day set for doctor dick to go out with the ransom money for the young girl whom they all so longed to welcome in their frontier home landlord larry had set the example of having things spruced up for her coming and the miners had quickly followed his example having put their cabins in better condition a cabin which the landlord was having built for his own especial use apart from the hotel was hastened to completion and then the very best the hotel could supply was put in it as furniture and to make it attractive to the fair visitor who was to be regarded as the guest of last chance at last the eventful day arrived for the ransom to be paid and the miners had all taken a peep into the quarters of celeste seldon to see how attractive it was doctor dick had furnished a number of things and the miners who had any pretty robes or souvenirs did likewise until it would have been a callous heart indeed that would not be touched by their devotion to one whom they had never seen the question of an attempt to capture the roadagents had been fully discussed but dismissed upon the advice of landlord larry doctor dick and harding who represented the danger that the girl would be in at the hands of the merciless masked chief that doctor dick was the right man to send out with the ransom all felt assured for if there was any trickery on the part of the roadagents he was the one to meet it doctor dick had even offered to go out upon horseback alone but it was thought best that the coach should be sent for the visitor and harding should drive he having met her the miners however arranged to meet her with a delegation at the entrance to the valley and escort her to the hotel every man was to be dressed in his best and in honor of the occasion the saloons were to be all closed when at last the day arrived harding mounted his box and gathered up his reins doctor dick following to a seat by his side a moment after the bag containing the gold to be paid in ransom was placed between their feet landlord larry gave the word to go and the coach rolled away at a rapid pace followed by the wildest cheering the doctor was fixed up in his most magnificent attire his jewels shone with more than accustomed luster and there was an expression upon his face that boded no good for the roadagents if they meant treachery in their dealings harding was also rigged out in his finest and wore a pleased look at the prospect of meeting celeste again upon whom he considered that he held a special claim and yet underlying all was an anxiety that some hitch might occur in gaining her release that would destroy all prospect of seeing her the coach had been cleaned up to look its best and a united states flag floated from a staff fastened upon the rear the harnesses had been burnished up and red white and blue streamers had been attached to the bridles so that the whole outfit presented a very gorgeous appearance and one intended to impress the beholder with the grandeur of the occasion and so it was that doctor dick went out with the ransom for celeste seldon with harding proud at holding the reins over the picked team that would take her back to last chance well doctor dick what do you think of our chances asked harding when the coach had turned out of the valley and was fairly started upon the trail to the meeting with the masked roadagent chief how do you mean our chances harding to get the young lady you were the one to make the terms true and i fear treachery what chance is there for it we have the money yes we are but two very true they have the captive yes and they can bring many against us also very true harding now if the chief means treachery and has his men there he can hold us up get the ransom money still keep possession of the girl and there it is he might do so but i hardly believe we need submit to even half a dozen outlaws where so much is at stake im with you doc in whatever you say do i know that pard harding but there is another way to look at this affair how is that if those roadagents were treacherous as you seem to fear it would end in their utter annihilation how so doc why the miners would send the alarm to w and to fort faraway and we would have that splendid fellow buffalo bill leading a column of soldiers on the hunt for them from one point another force would push out from w and a couple of hundred miners from last chance and every outlaw in this part of the country would be caught and hanged i believe you are right doc i had not thought of the result of treachery on their part for they would get the worst of it no i guess all will go well i think so and hope so sincerely answered doctor dick and the coach rolled on in silence for some time when harding asked what do you think of brandons disappearance doctor i hardly know what to think unless he has fallen from some precipice and killed himself i guess that is it but now let me give you a warning doc of what that young girl what have i to fear pard if you dont fall in love with her you are a different man from what i take you to be you have been caught i see yes im gone clean gone but i guess that is all the good it will do me for i suppose her lover is that poor fellow brandon you only think her lovely just because she is the only woman you have seen on the frontier she is doubtless as ugly as an old maid just wait and see her and then say which of us is wrong said harding with a confident smile as the coach turned around a cliff neither doctor dick nor harding saw that there was a man standing among the piсons watching them he had from his position been able to see the coach a mile away as it wound along the valley and he had watched it as it approached with seemingly the deepest interest he stood erect like a soldier on duty one hand resting upon a repeating rifle the other grasping a fieldglass which he had occasionally raised to his eyes and viewed the coming stage he stood like a sentinel and had been there for an hour or more before the coach rolled into view a glance was sufficient to show that the silent sentinel on the cliff was none other than buffalo bill the chief of scouts he was dressed as was his wont and back from the cliff a couple of hundred yards grazing upon the ridge was his horse but strangest of all the scoutsentinel did not hail the coach did not make his presence known but allowed it to roll by himself unseen as though he wished to keep the fact of his being there a secret even from doctor dick and harding his ally and spy chapter xxx at the rendezvous as the coach drew near the rendezvous appointed by the masked roadagent chief at the dead line harding breathed hard with suppressed emotion he had really fallen in love with the beautiful girl whom he felt he was in a manner the protector of and he was most anxious as to the result aside from his regard for celeste seldon her unprotected condition would have won his deepest sympathy under any circumstances doctor dick on the other hand was calm and silent he had the money demanded and he had come to do his duty but was prepared to face all emergencies that might arise at last the scene of the tragedies came in view the cross erected at the dead line was just before them and then harding grasped the reins expecting a summons to halt no one was visible in the pass but that was no sign that there was no one there as harding and doctor dick well knew just as the leaders reached the cross a voice called out halt hard went the foot of the driver upon the brake and his hands pulled the team to a sudden stop doctor dick instinctively dropped his hand upon his revolver but removed it instantly and calmly awaited the issue the coach having halted the same voice called out is there any one inside the coach no one answered harding if you lie to me harding your life will be the forfeit all right so be it sir but doctor dick and i are all that came who is following you no one did none of the miners come out from last chance not one you are sure i am if we are attacked both you and doctor dick shall die and if the force is large enough to press me hard i shall kill the girl you need have no fear of an attack but i only wish we dared make the attempt for i would like to see every one of you hanged a laugh greeted this remark of the driver and once again the unseen roadagent called out did you bring the gold did you bring the young lady answer my question harding you answer mine i will reply when i have had an answer if you brought the young lady as you pledged yourself to do you can get the ransom money but if you did not you will have to fight to get it that is our trade but the young lady is here then get her out of your vile company as quickly as possible where is the money before harding could reply doctor dick said sternly a truce to this nonsensical parleying i have the money and will pay it over when the young lady is given into my charge but not before where is she the roadagent seemed impressed by the stern words of doctor dick and responded i will go and fetch her while you turn your coach around this harding at once did and coming to a halt again doctor dick got down from the box and the bag of gold was handed to him by harding there was a wait of a few minutes and then out from among the pines in the pass came a man followed by celeste seldon a few feet behind him as she approached the spot she waved her hand to harding and said pleasantly we meet again my good friend and mighty glad am i that we do miss permit me to introduce to you the boss man of last chance doctor dick and he is here with the money to pay your ransom doctor dick doffed his sombrero bowed low and then stepped forward as celeste held out her hand to him and said in his courtly way i am happy in meeting miss seldon and receiving her in the name of the miners of last chance the outlaw who accompanied celeste was masked completely and his form enveloped in a black robe that effectually concealed it he stepped toward doctor dick and said you sir have the ransom money for the return of this young lady i have gold amounting to the sum demanded see here doc i dont see why we should be robbed by one man so let us run him in now we have the young lady and we will not have to pay the gold and harding suddenly covered the outlaw with his revolver no no cried celeste that will never do no harding we must keep faith with him even if he be a murderer and a thief put up your gun said doctor dick the masked outlaw had not moved at the action of harding but now said you wisely decide doctor dick for i am no fool to be caught in a trap and i trust no man so came prepared to meet treachery if it was intended and this young lady will tell you that my men are within easy range and you harding in covering me with your revolver took big chances i didnt believe you would come alone and we were fools to do so for we could have fought it out right here grumbled the driver greatly disappointed at his not carrying out his suddenly determined upon plot the roadagent then took the bag opened it ran over the gold like one who knew its value and then said yes there is the amount here no more no less ask miss seldon if she has not been treated with marked respect i can but answer yes for i have been but am i not to have my trunk and sidesaddle oh yes certainly and the roadagent gave a signal which was promptly answered by two men appearing in the edge of the pines they wore long black robes and red masks also and their appearance was proof that their leader had not come alone bring the baggage belonging to this lady and her sidesaddle and bridle also called out the leader the men disappeared and doctor dick asked do you expect to keep up your lawless acts much longer without meeting the fate you deserve sir outlaw yes for the money i get is worth taking big chances for doctor dick and gambler that you are you never do a better days work than what sum this gold calls for it is a long lane that has no turn and the turn will come for you some day said harding a light laugh beneath the mask was the answer and celeste seldons face wore a clouded expression harding was not slow to observe then i am free to go sir and celeste turned to the outlaw you are miss seldon was the answer she turned to the coach and doctor dick aided her into it just as the two outlaws came up with the small leather trunk she had brought with her and her saddle and bridle taking the back seat celeste leaned up in one corner as though fatigued and her baggage having been put on top dick and harding mounted to the box the outlaws attentively regarding them through the eyeholes in their masks remember pards i still drive this trail said the driver with an air of defiance as he gathered up the reins i wont forget harding but i advise you to keep in mind the story of the pitcher that went once too often to the well for right here some day you may meet your fate if i do you will not find me flinch from it was the plucky response and the driver called to his horses and the team moved on looking back at the bend the driver and doctor dick saw that the outlaws had already disappeared while celeste seldon gazing back also noted the same fact and murmured to herself what yet is before me i wonder chapter xxxi doctor dick tells the news when the coach had got well away from the dead line harding gave a deep sigh of relief for the first time feeling that celeste was safe and would not be retaken by the outlaws well doc shes safe now and we didnt lose our scalps he said it is a cause of congratulation all round harding now doctor dick you have got to tell the young lady about the poor crazy fellow did you not tell her that his wound had crazed him yes but that is not the worst of it ah yes you mean that he has been captured i cannot say that doc but he has mysteriously disappeared well you wish me to break the news to her i do for i cant tell her what i know will hurt her and it wont do for her to hear it from the men when she arrives in last chance i guess you are right pard so draw up and ill take a seat inside the coach and tell her the news be very gentle doc for i have an idea she loves that young man ill break it to her as gently as i can was the response and as harding drew rein a moment after doctor dick sprang down from the box and said may i ride with you miss seldon certainly sir if you desire i have something to talk to you about said doctor dick as he entered the coach and took the front seat i shall be glad to hear what you have to say sir and i desire now to thank you for your very great kindness toward me while you risked your life in coming out here to serve me do not speak of it miss seldon for the miners all chipped in and made up a purse for your ransom while they are now anxiously awaiting your coming to give you a right royal welcome for you will be the first lady who ever came to our camp indeed this will be an honor but do you mean that there are none of my sex there not one only rough men but with noble hearts many of them so that you will be made to feel at once at home how odd it will be yet i have no hesitancy in going there i assure you and celeste gazed into the face of the man before her with both interest and admiration he is strangely handsome a manly fellow brave intelligent yet a dangerous foe and i wonder what has brought such a man as he to this faraway land ran her thoughts miss seldon what i most wished to say to you i fear will deeply pain you said doctor dick after a pause let me hear it sir for i am becoming accustomed to being pained of late and celeste was perfectly calm i was told by harding the driver that you were on your way to last chance to look up a friend who had come here on a mission for you and who you had feared was in trouble yes and my fears were realized when i learned that the coach in which he was a passenger had been held up i believe that is what you call it by roadagents and mr brandon was so severely wounded in the head that his brain was turned yes but that is not all miss seldon ah what else is there to tell he was under my care for a long while and i did all that i could to restore his reason except to perform an operation for his relief which i feared to risk so mr harding told me when his bodily health was restored he left my cabin and roamed about the camps up to a week ago when he most mysteriously disappeared we had all the miners out upon a search for him did all in our power to find him but in vain and what his fate has been is only conjecture and what is that conjecture doctor dick for i believe you are so called yes i am known to all solely as doctor dick but let me answer your question by replying that we believe the poor fellow has lost his life by falling over a cliff such is not the case sir was the reply that startled the doctor mr brandon is now a captive of the roadagents doctor dick gazed at celeste seldon in amazement do you know this miss seldon or is it only conjecture on your part he asked when he had recovered from his surprise he had come prepared to console but instead had found the young girl cool and with apparently knowledge which he did not possess regarding the man whom harding had said he believed was her lover i know it doctor dick may i ask how i have just been a captive of the outlaws myself and in coming here from their secret retreat we met two of the roadagents with a prisoner the leader had some talk with them but though i at once recognized mr brandon i was not allowed to speak with him did you request it naturally but were refused yes was any reason given simply that i would not be allowed to and if i did mr brandon would not know me as he was crazy while they did not care to have me do so where was this miss seldon a short distance after we left their retreat could you lead the way to their retreat no for i was blindfolded and bound miles before reaching there the outlaw chief did this he was not along but it was done by his orders did you not speak to him of it i have not seen him since why was not that the chief who gave you over to me today no sir i certainly thought so it was his lieutenant who took me to the retreat and back under his orders and where is the chief at his other hidingplace his men said you were well treated i hope miss seldon with perfect respect and consideration sir i am happy to say the only indignity being that i was blindfolded and had my hands bound in approaching and leaving the outlaw retreat but i suppose that was necessary for the safety of the band you certainly take it most coolly why do otherwise sir do you know the motive of the roadagents in making that poor crazy fellow a prisoner money how do you mean they doubtless captured his baggage and discovered by it papers that went to show that a big ransom would be paid for his release ah they will demand a ransom for him then assuredly the miners will hardly pay it if it is a large sum i do not ask them to do so you do not no who will pay it then i will you certainly pardon me but you are a young girl and a rich one nevertheless doctor dick i sent mr brandon to the west on this mission and he has met with misfortune i will pay the ransom demanded take him east and place him in the care of the most eminent surgeons that they may aid him if it is possible you as a skilled surgeon for such i have heard you were might tell me what you deem the chances are for his recovery miss seldon the blow of that bullet caused an indenture of the skull which might be operated upon and successfully raised so as to restore his reason the chances are ninetynine to a hundred against success and only the most skilful surgeon and nervy one could accomplish it if done thank you the one chance in favor shall be taken for without reason one might as well be dead yes far better and you will stand all this expense certainly for it is my intention to pay back to the miners every dollar they subscribed for my ransom for as i said i have the means to do it and far more you are a plucky woman miss seldon but see we are approaching the valley now and you must prepare for a welcome and doctor dick called to harding to come to a halt chapter xxxii the miners welcome harding drew up promptly at the call of doctor dick he had heard the voices of the two within the stage yet not what was said and he was anxious to know how celeste took the news of the disappearance of the man whom she had come to the wild western frontier to see do you mean that i shall mount to the box sir asked celeste in answer to what the doctor had said after the coach halted i do miss seldon for the men will wish to see you and within ten minutes more we will be in the valley of course i cannot refuse sir and celeste sprang out of the coach and mounted to the box taking her seat by the side of harding while doctor dick settled himself upon her trunk upon the top of the coach now miss well make em hum said harding and he cracked his whip in a way that sent the team along at a splendid pace as they neared the turn into the valley harding took a bugle in lieu of a stagehorn and played in a skilful manner the ringing notes of annie laurie intending the sentiment to apply to celeste doctor dick from his perch the while taking the reins the notes of the bugle ringing out the touching air brought tears to the eyes of celeste seldon who however was startled a moment after as the stage came in sight of a hundred horsemen drawn up in two lines one on either side of the trail they were a wild recklesslooking lot of rough riders but the cheer they gave when they saw celeste on the box came from their hearts their hats were doffed and as the yells burst from their lips they closed in behind the coach four abreast and came dashing along as an escort celeste waved her handkerchief vigorously her beautiful face flushed to crimson and her lips quivering her eyes swimming with the emotion that almost overwhelmed her three cheers for the lady of last chance came in the deep voice of doctor dick from the top of the coach and they were given with savage earnestness along dashed the coach harding lashing his horses into a run and driving with marvelous skill while behind them thundered the hundred horsemen yelling like demons in their glad welcome to the first lady to visit their wild camp celeste saw the cabins along the caсon valley perched here and there upon the hills and at last discovered the group of buildings that marked the settlement the miners were pleased to call the city of last chance gathered there was a vast crowd of men and when the stage came in sight and three persons were seen on top with the mounted escort hastening after the yells of welcome began the roar floated down the valley and reached the ears of celeste seldon and she muttered in a low tone how kind they all are this is indeed a welcome to be proud of and never can i forget it they mean it miss said harding and he felt just pride in his frontier home at the reception and the manner in which celeste received it greatly pleased him on flew the horses and up the hill they dashed to at last come to a halt before the hotel the din was now terrific for the voices of the horsemen joined in with the miners about the hotel who with one accord drew their revolvers and began to empty them in the air as there were hundreds of miners and all were armed with a couple each of revolvers the rattling of the fusillade may be imagined celeste bowed right and left waving her handkerchief until landlord larry aided her to dismount and led her into the hotel and the welcome was at an end chapter xxxiii the council celeste seldon was not one to put on airs she had been well reared was refined lovable by nature plucky enough for a man for she had the heart and will to do and dare anything where duty called and yet she was as simple as a child by nature she was deeply touched by the reception she had received and in glancing about when she saw only a wildlooking set of men rude log cabins and an air of the far frontier pervading all she knew that it was just what she must expect to see and she at once adapted herself to circumstances she was escorted by landlord larry to her cabin harding himself bringing her trunk and another miner her saddle and bridle the appearance of the cabin revealed to her at a glance how much had been done to make her comfortable and she praised the neat quarters and expressed the greatest satisfaction in her surroundings when she went over to the hotel to dinner the whole crowd of miners there rose at her entrance and every hat was doffed and placed beneath the bench on which the man sat for hatracks were not one of the luxuries of the last chance hotel and a miner would as soon have thought of parting with his pistols as his headcovering at his own table where sat besides himself doctor dick and harding landlord larry placed celeste seldon and she was given the best the house afforded and expressed herself as being treated far more kindly than she had had the slightest anticipation of the meal concluded celeste said that she would like to consult with the three she regarded as her immediate protectors the landlord doctor dick and harding so the three met her in the landlords private office and celeste at once said i wish first to thank all of my kind friends here through you gentlemen for the very generous manner in which you have received and treated me here i know that the ransom money demanded for my release was quickly raised by the people here you three being particularly generous but i desire to say that i have the money to pay you back and will do so no no under no circumstances miss seldon said doctor dick eagerly and the others chimed in with him but celeste was firm in her determination and said i have no claim upon you and besides i am very well off so i shall insist and landlord larry i will give you a draft for the amount upon an eastern bank and for more as there will be another demand upon me in the amount to ransom the one who came here for me mr bernard brandon but will you pay his ransom miss seldon why not landlord larry i think said doctor dick that as you came to visit last chance we the dwellers here should be responsible and pay these ransoms so say i put in harding quickly and i agree with you added the landlord under no circumstances will i hear to it for i will pay all my own and the ransom of mr brandon so please send the draft through for the money landlord larry and while here i will take steps to find out all i can regarding my father who was last heard of in this part of the country miss seldon i can tell you what you must know sooner or later about your father who let me say was also my friend said doctor dick it seemed hard that in the joy of her release from captivity in the hands of the outlaws celeste seldon should feel the blow of knowing that the unfortunate bernard brandon had been captured and she would have to pay a ransom for him while she also had to suffer still further in learning what was her fathers fate as told her by doctor dick it had been a long time since she had seen her father the last time when she was a little girl and she remembered that he had left home under a cloud and she had never expected to see him again with her mother dead and her father a fugitive wanderer she had been sent by her guardian left so by the wishes of her parents to a northern school and there had had no one upon whom to lean at the words and tone of doctor dick she nerved herself to bear the worst and asked calmly what have you to tell me doctor dick of your father you knew him yes for though my senior in years we were devoted friends have you seen him since coming west i have not but let me tell you that when on a scout with buffalo bill the latter was rescued by a person who was alone and on his way to w the scout had with him a prisoner a deserter from the army and a murderer who had been taken here in last chance and he was taking him a prisoner to fort faraway when he was attacked by a desperado by the name of headlight joe and his gang with his horse shot and falling upon him buffalo bill would have been killed and his prisoner rescued but for the coming of the horseman referred to and who put the outlaws to flight he gave the name of andrew seldon said nothing as to why he was in that part of the country or where he lived and went on his way when i came up with buffalo bill and heard his story of his rescue and the name of his rescuer it at once recalled my oldtime friend and with the scout as my companion we later sought to find him we trailed him to his home where he had dwelt with one other comrade and where was that sir in the grand caсon of the colorado miss seldon and you found him eagerly asked celeste while the landlord and harding gazed at her with deepest sympathy at what they felt she must hear we found his house or rather the wreck of it for mining under a cliff a thousand feet in height it had caved in upon them burying them beneath a mountain of red sandstone celeste shuddered and covered her face with her hands but very quickly regained her composure and said are you sure that my father was in the mine when it caved in i am very sure miss seldon that both he and his comrade were we the scout and myself were camped in the caсon and heard the cavein and it felt like a mighty earthquake and was at night we made a thorough search the next day but could not find any trace of a human being and their horses shared the same fate with a dog also which we heard barking that same night yes there is no doubt of your fathers fate i thank you doctor dick for your telling me all but i must see buffalo bill the famous scout and ask him to guide me to the fatal spot the scene of my fathers lone life in these wilds and of his death said celeste in a low tone that revealed how deeply she felt her fathers fate chapter xxxiv a metamorphosis when harding met with old huckleberry the stagedriver who had so mysteriously disappeared and whose fate was a mystery to the miners of last chance that old worthy saw the coach drive on its way while he regarded its departure with the complacency of one not afraid to be left alone and fully capable of taking care of himself he stood for some time in silent meditation after the coach had disappeared and then shouldering his rifle struck off over the mountains with an evident purpose in view a walk of some ten miles brought him to a secluded nook in the mountains a perfect basin a dozen acres in size heavily wooded with plenty of grass and water a narrow pass not twenty feet in width was the only entrance to the basin and this was securely fastened up with long poles over this old huckleberry clambered and as he walked into the basin a couple of horses feeding there greeted him with a welcoming neigh in the farther end among the pines was a brush cabin and in it were blankets and a campingoutfit with saddle packsaddle and bridles old huckleberry proceeded to build a fire and cook dinner after which he caught one of his horses saddled him and strapped on some blankets and a bag of provisions leading the horse out of the basin he replaced the barrier securely so that the other animal could not get out and mounting started off for the fort as he rode alone he muttered to himself i can do nothing alone i feel certain and by this time the one man whose aid i can best depend upon is at the fort and he will gladly return with me pressing on at a steady gait he did not halt until some time after nightfall and then built no fire but ate a cold supper staked his horse out rolled up in his blankets and was soon fast asleep he rose early and the coming of day found him several miles on his way from his night camp about eight oclock he halted built a fire broiled the steak of an antelope he had killed some crackers and bacon his horse faring well on the grass nearby a rest of an hour and a half and he was again in the saddle keeping up the same steady gait until noon when another halt was made for a couple of hours on through the afternoon he urged his horse once more halting only after nightfall two hours before daybreak he was in the saddle and now his horse was pushed more rapidly forward as though a long rest lay not very far ahead it was two hours before noon when the wornout horse pricked up his ears as he saw a flag fluttering in the skies a mile ahead in through the stockade gate of fort faraway rode old huckleberry and he asked to be at once taken to the quarters of the commanding officer major randall surveyed the old fellow keenly and said pleasantly well old man what can i do for you ill tell yer pard soon as i sees ef thet gent in sojer clothes aint goin ter speak ter a old friend and old huck looked over to an officer who was talking to major randall when he entered the man wore a fatigue uniform and his shoulderstraps bore the rank of a captain with the insignia of a surgeon of cavalry he was tall erect had broad shoulders and was of powerful build while strange to say for an officer he wore his black hair long and falling in heavy masses down his back his face was full of decision courage and intelligence and handsome as well and in his dark piercing eyes there was a strange mixture of gentleness and a fiery nature combined in a voice strangely musical for a mans he said as he arose my dear old pard am i so remiss as to forget the face of a friend for though i see that it is familiar i cannot just place you now pard doc i thinks that aint jist squar ter fergit a old friend said old huckleberry while major randall said he certainly knows you well major powell and i knows major randall well too but as you dont seem ter git onter jist who i is gents ill tell yer by taking off my wig and specs see the wig or shock rather of long gray hair was removed the spectacles taken off and the face of buffalo bill was revealed to the astonished gaze of major randall and surgeon powell who both uttered an exclamation of amazement and then burst out into hearty laughter at the metamorphosis of old huckleberry into the noted chief of scouts well cody what does this masquerading mean cried major randall after he and surgeon powell had shaken hands with the scout it is a part of a plot major for i have been driving stage answered the scout driving stage yes sir i took the semimonthly coach running from w to last chance after the roadagents had killed benton and dockery and no one cared to drive the run unless it was doctor dick the goldgambler of last chance did he take the coach through cody oh yes sir he is not a man to scare and he drove several runs but then his professional duties as gambler and doctor kept him busy and i rigged up as old huckleberry and drove the runs to see what i could find out and what did you find out i believe i discovered sufficient sir to stretch several ropes with human weights that means you are on the right trail to bag those roadagents yes sir they appear to be well handled they are sir for their chief is a man of remarkable pluck cunning and skill and he handles them in a masterly manner who is he i do not believe his own men could tell you sir for he goes masked and robed in black even covering up his horse from ears to tail that is strange it is the safest plan sir and who is driving now harding sir the exsoldier and whom i may confidentially say major i have taken into my service not as a scout but as a spy at last chance a fine fellow but i fear he will be killed as driver on that trail i hope not sir and he has escaped splendidly through great dangers thus far well what will be your plans now i have been hanging on the trail sir since my mysterious disappearance as old huckleberry and have been hovering about the death line taking notes and seeing what i could discover i have a camp in a basin in the mountain range and there i left my packhorse and outfit while i came here you have something to report to me then no sir not particularly though i came for a purpose and that purpose cody i was aware sir that surgeon frank powell was coming to the fort to relieve doctor dey and that his duties as surgeon would not begin for some weeks yet as we have been on so many scoutingexpeditions together and doctor powell is a regiment in himself i wanted him to go back with me and unearth these roadagents following their trail to the very end you could have no one better what do you say powell how could i refuse major after bills most flattering remarks about what i can do and which prove he has irish blood in his veins ah i knew that you would go frank responded cody of course i will and am ready when you say the word only i must ask major randall for a leave should we not accomplish our purpose before i am ordered for duty here that will be all right powell when will you start cody for doctor powell will have to first relieve doctor dey as that would be the best plan and then go leaving his assistant surgeon in charge it is for you to decide major very well say in just ten days from now all right sir but after a couple of days rest i had better return to my basin camp and be on the watch and i can tell surgeon powell just where i will meet him upon a certain date you know best cody but do not venture much until powell joins you for well i know what a team you two make together i feel certain sir that together we can run down these masked marauders was the confident reply of buffalo bill and when he went to his quarters soon after surgeon powell accompanied him for the two were the closest of friends chapter xxxv the drivers letter after several days stay at the fort buffalo bill started upon his return to his secret camp near last chance trail he took with him another packhorse well laden with bedding and supplies for the weather was growing steadily colder and winter would soon be upon the land he knew that little snow generally fell as far down as the last chance trail but it would be well to be prepared for any emergency and as the coaches ran through the winter the roadagents would by no means take a rest riding leisurely on the back trail not caring to push his horses too hard buffalo bill reached his basin camp in the mountains on the third day and the animal he left there pranced like a colt at seeing him come back his first work was to make his quarters more secure and comfortable and this took him a day and the following having strengthened the barrier in the pass to prevent his horses from breaking out he started off on foot for the w and last chance stagetrail he would not ride as he did not wish his trail to be seen by any prowling roadagents and on foot he could accomplish more and be concealed far better than if he had gone mounted before parting with surgeon frank powell at the fort buffalo bill had drawn a map of the country marking the trail the surgeonscout was to follow and also just where he was to meet him the place of rendezvous being the deserted camp where was the grave of blackheart bill when buffalo bill approached the trail at the scene of the dead line tragedies he went most cautiously but no one was there and going up to the little cross the scout bent over and thrust his hand into the spot where as old huckleberry he had his postoffice with harding he took out a slip of paper and read it with clouded brow it was as follows i slip away at night from last chance to leave this here for you it was unfortunate that you should have had to go to the fort when you did as on my run back i was held up here by the agents i had taken your advice and pressed through the other end at night thus escaping men lying in wait for me on my return i had a young lady passenger a miss celeste seldon coming out here to find her father a miner and a young man whom she had sent in search of him it was the young man i told you of who had been wounded and had never regained his reason i had a large sum of money which was taken and miss seldon was carried off as a captive to be held for ransom the miners have subscribed the ransom money and she is to be released i will let you know particulars more fully as soon as i get the opportunity endeavoring to have a letter here for you when i come to make the exchange paying the ransom and receiving the lady from the outlaws doctor dick will come with me but the outlaws threaten to kill miss seldon if others come or if any one else leaves last chance to pursue them and that chief will keep his word harding then there followed a postscript which read the young messenger bernard brandon has most mysteriously disappeared and no search can find him h buffalo bill read this letter over twice and said in a musing way those outlaws are becoming bold indeed when they deliberately rob a young girl and make her their prisoner the man brandon was her messenger sent in search of her father and his mysterious disappearance to me means that he has been captured by the roadagents now i dare not halt the coach on the way to receive the girl if the roadagents give her up but i will be on the watch see it go by and be as near this spot when the ransom is paid as i dare be for from here i may be able to track those devils to their lair so saying the scout set out upon his return for his basin camp chapter xxxvi the scout on the watch when buffalo bill returned from the dead line to his secret camp it was to prepare himself for several days absence from it for his intention was to hang about the last chance trail discovering all that it was in his power to do he found a retreat upon a cliff where there was a thicket of pines giving him a view in both directions of the trail for a mile or more he saw from there the coach coming to the rendezvous with the ransom money for celeste seldons release and upon the box beside the driver was doctor dick yet the scout did not know who might be inside the stage so dared not make any sign of his presence on went the coach and buffalo bill at once started down from the cliff and followed in its trail at an indian trot which kept him well up with it yet just out of sight as he approached the dead line he went more cautiously and reaching the entrance to the pass made a flank movement and climbed to the top of the ridge it was after continued search that he at last found a point of observation and he risked his life by reaching a spot where he would be dashed to death hundreds of feet below should his foot slip or nerve fail him from this spot where he clung to a tree he turned his fieldglass down the pass and could see the coach standing at the dead line a quarter of a mile away he saw that the coach had been turned to the rightabout the team being headed back for last chance and doctor dick was standing near it harding being still on the box and grasping the reins watching with every nerve strung the scout saw the masked roadagent appear and later the fair captive then followed two other roadagents bearing the baggage of celeste seldon and soon after the coach started upon its return buffalo bill could not have reached a point to head it off had he tried and he felt that he must still be cautious but he was determined to reach the dead line and take up the trail from there for certainly the roadagents had not allowed celeste seldon to walk to the scene of the exchange after half an hour he gained a point just over the dead line and from there saw that all was quiet the outlaws had left beyond all doubt it was an hour before the scout could make his way around to the dead line and there he felt in the little postoffice for a letter from harding but none was there he dared not attempt it he muttered then taking a leaf from his notebook he wrote i am again on the trail i saw the lady returned to you i will take the outlaws trail from here and hope to track them to their lair in a few days now i will have the surgeonscout with me in my work so the end is not far away keep me posted as before as i will you yours b b this was placed in the receptacle near the cross and shouldering his rifle buffalo bill set out to look for trails it took him a long while to satisfy himself that he was on the right track but at last he struck off at a lively step along a trail which only a man of his frontier skill could have discovered after a walk of a mile he suddenly came upon a spot where there were the tracks of a horse visible these he followed a mile farther and the scout saw that the ground was trampled down but not by hoofs the track he had followed thus far had been that of one hoof only showing that the other three had been muffled but one had lost its covering the trampled grass and ground revealed that the horses had been left there and all had had their hoofs muffled in some way but the keen eyes of the scout picked up the trail and he followed it quite rapidly until he came to a small stream there were eight horses along as their tracks show here but how many men i do not know when they have gone some miles farther they will remove the muffles from their horses hoofs and then the trail will be easy to follow and it now looks to me as though i will be able to track them to their retreat and that means the end but night is coming on now and this is just the place for me to branch off and go to my own camp following the trail tomorrow on horseback buffalo bill quickly decided what course he would pursue he would walk to his camp get some provisions and an increased outfit return there for the balance of the night and go into camp so as to make an early start in the morning directly on the trail so he set out at a rapid walk and within three hours time had reached his basin camp he quickly set to work to look up some provisions and get ready for his trail and in an hour was ready to start mounted upon his best horse it was after midnight when he reached his campingplace but he was soon asleep wrapped snugly in his blankets while his horse was resting and feeding with the breaking of dawn he was up and ready to start and a few miles away discovered the spot where the outlaws had removed the muffles from the hoofs of their horses from there on he felt no further anxiety about the trail so cooked his breakfast ate it leisurely and again started on his way he understood now thoroughly why the outlaws had left no trails going to and coming from the dead line and other points upon the overland trail the muffled hoofs of the horses explained this and they stuck to their determination to leave no tracks until they got far away from the scene of their evil deeds buffalo bill did not believe that he would have to go very far from the dead line before he found their retreat and was expecting to find out where they were in hiding within half a days ride from his startingpoint but noon came and still the trail led him on he had plenty of time so did not hurry he could do nothing alone other than to discover the retreat and then he would make for his rendezvous with the surgeonscout and together they would plan their future movements but night came on and found him still on the trail he was compelled to go into camp for he could not follow it by night and he soon made himself comfortable again he started after daybreak and a ride of several hours caused him to say this trail is surely leading direct to the grand caсon of the colorado can they have sought that weird land for a retreat yet why not for no safer one could be found within an hour more he felt that the country had a familiar look and he was not long in discovering upon riding a few miles farther that he had ridden right along there with doctor dick when on the trail of andrew seldon suddenly he came upon the grand vista of the caсon and at once drew rein there before him was the mighty view that had so impressed him on his former visit and he knew that the outlaws must have found a retreat in the depths of the grand caсon not daring to go farther on horseback he rode off the trail to find a hidingplace for his horse and after a search discovered a little glen where he felt that he would be safe unless his trail was discovered and he was tracked there there was a pool of water in one end and grass about it so he staked his horse out feeling that he could at least subsist comfortably there for a couple of days should he be kept away that long hiding his saddle and bridle he set out on foot with a couple of blankets strapped on his back his bag of provisions rifle lasso and belt of arms he went back to the trail and again took it up where he had left it to hide his horse every step forward now was one of caution for the country was open in places and he did not know what moment he might come upon a party of outlaws and have to fight for his life but he reached the rim of the caсon by dark and a short search revealed to him that the trail down into the depths of the tremendous chasm had been discovered also by the roadagents and their tracks led down into it the night passed with a cold supper and breakfast and then he set off on foot down the dizzy pathway leading to the bottom of the caсon for now he felt sure that he would discover the lair of the outlaws and that done and his own presence unknown to them he could arrange for an attack upon them at his leisure chapter xxxvii the miners mission the goldhunter andrew seldon rode on his way from his retreat in the caсon determined to risk his life by returning to fort faraway and reporting the presence in the grand caсon of the masked outlaw band if recognized as sergeant wallace weston under sentence of death he would be at once arrested and his execution would follow but he knew that wallace weston was believed to be dead reported as dying of starvation in the desert at the time of his escape as sergeant weston he had been an erect man of martial bearing with a face smoothly shaven and hair cut short as andrew seldon he wore his hair long and his beard fell halfway down to his belt while he further had a pair of spectacles to disguise his eyes with and had manufactured a hump in the shoulders of his coat that gave him a changed form like one who stoops badly but come what may i shall risk it he said firmly as he went on his way after his night in the deserted camp where was the grave of blackheart bill he struck out for fort faraway suddenly he drew his horse to a halt as he saw a dustcloud far ahead it was approaching him and it was made by horses crossing a sandy part of the country out of the dust suddenly emerged a horseman and behind him followed a packanimal hidden in a clump of timber andrew seldon saw that it was a white man and that the trail he was following would bring him near his position i believe that it is buffalo bill he muttered as he saw that the horseman was clad in buckskin and wore his hair long but as he came nearer he said eagerly it is the surgeonscout doctor frank powell the coming horseman eyed the timber carefully as he approached something had evidently made him suspicious of danger there and turning to the left he was about to flank it when andrew seldon rode into view and waved his hat then he rode forward once more but cautiously for the chances were that the man he saw might be a foe he well knew but andrew seldon raised his hands above his head in token of peace and surgeon powell rode straight toward him i dare not let him know who i am though i would trust him heaven knows he knows me as well as any man and ill see how i stand the test of his piercing eyes muttered the goldhunter and as the surgeonscout drew nearer he called out are you buffalo bill sir no i am surgeon frank powell of the army i see now sir that you are not buffalo bill for i met him once when he was in a tight place with roadagents are you from fort faraway sir i am i was on my way there to see buffalo bill when i saw you coming sir and i am on my way to seek buffalo bill for i have an appointment to meet him not many miles from here at a deserted camp where there is a grave i know it well sir for i made the grave and i stopped there last night you made what grave the grave of blackheart bill the desperado who is buried there you killed him you mean i did sir for he had wronged me greatly who are you may i ask my name is andrew seldon sir and i am a miner it seems to me that buffalo bill has spoken to me of you in fact i am sure of it now for you it was who saved him from headlight joe and his outlaws yes sir but cody believes you to be dead how so sir he wished to find you so tracked you into the grand caсon to find your house buried beneath a fallen cliff and he thought you were beneath it all no sir i escaped but as you are going to seek buffalo bill may i join you you may join me mr seldon and i shall be glad to have your company said surgeon powell as he rode along by the side of the goldhunter i will be your guide to the deserted camp sir but do you expect to find mr cody there i hope so but should he not be i shall await him i am glad to hear you say that sir for i am most anxious to see him and i will tell you why if you care to i know your secret surgeon powell and am delighted to feel that i will have your aid as well as buffalo bills in what i wish to do and what do you wish to do mr seldon i will have to ask you to keep my secret sir i will do so well surgeon powell i am a miner and i strolled into the grand caсon of the colorado in my prospecting tours and there discovered several rich gold claims on my way there it was that i came upon a camp and in it i found an unfortunate fellow who was wounded yet bound securely he had gone out in search of gold with a desperado by the name of blackheart bill and finding gold the other sought to rob him of it so shot him failing to find it he was anxious to have his victim recover and show him where it was intending then to kill him it was while blackheart bill was away from his camp that i came to it and i heard his victims story upon the return of the man i recognized him as an old foe of mine one to whom with others i owed a wicked life i forced him to fight me a duel and he fell i buried him and cut his name on the quaking aspen near his grave and then nursing the wounded man to life we went to his gold find it did not pan out very rich so i went to one i knew of down in the grand caсon while i was away at w to get provisions my partner heard the cliff cracking and so moved away up the caсon to another mine we had he was just in time to save his life for the cliff fell and buffalo bill was in the valley that night with a comrade and heard the terrific roar of the falling cliff they believed that my comrade and myself were buried beneath the mountain of rock but we were gazing at them the while and watched them ride away some time after i found that others had come into the caсon and i discovered that it was a camp of outlaws while more still i saw that they had a female captive i crept near enough at night to hear and see all and i saw a young and beautiful girl and the outlaw lieutenant held her a captive for his chief until a large ransom was paid for her by the miners of last chance i at once decided to act and having seen them start with her to give her up for ransom i came on my way to find buffalo bill and guide him to the retreat of the outlaws that young girl sir gave the name of celeste seldon she is my daughter now surgeon powell you have my story and my comrade is in my camp awaiting my return frank powell was greatly impressed with the story of the goldhunter to which he had listened with the deepest attention after he had heard all he said my dear pard you have made a very valuable discovery indeed and buffalo bill will be only too glad to have you guide him to the outlaw camp for that is his mission and mine here i sincerely hope that your daughter will be given up in safety to the miners and that her ransom will be recovered she will be given up in safety sir i am certain for i have perfect confidence in the outlaw lieutenant who told his story to celeste and i only ask that he may not share the fate of the other outlaws and the goldhunter made known what had occurred between wolf and celeste and doctor powell replied i agree with you and if he acts squarely toward miss seldon i will urge that he be allowed to go free when his comrades are to hang chapter xxxviii a leaf from the past when the surgeonscout was guided to the deserted camp by andrew seldon he at once saw that buffalo bill had not reached there but there he was to wait for him and so the horses were staked out and the two made themselves at home there doctor powell went to have a look at the grave of blackheart bill and the inscription upon the white bark of the aspentree and said as he read the name hugh mayhew was his name yes sir there was a sergeant manton mayhew killed at fort faraway by sergeant wallace weston who was sentenced to be shot for the deed but escaped the very moment of his execution was he never captured sir poor fellow he went to an even worse fate than being shot for he wandered into the desert and died of starvation there i knew that he was guilty of killing manton mayhew but i am sure he had some grave reason for so doing but which he would never make known he was a splendid soldier brave and true and he would have been commissioned had not that sad affair occurred did he give no reason for his act sir none he simply accepted his fate though it was said to clear himself he would have had to compromise others and this he would not do poor fellow yes i often think of his sad fate an antelope was killed that afternoon and after enjoying a good supper the surgeon and the goldhunter lighted their pipes and sat down for a talk both anxiously awaiting the coming of buffalo bill after sitting in silence for some minutes the goldhunter said surgeon powell you were speaking of wallace weston today yes you may have noted that the name of mayhew is upon yonder aspentree and referred to the fact i put it there yes then i knew who blackheart bill was that is so i had not thought of that he was the brother of manton mayhew the sergeant indeed yes sir you knew sergeant mayhew then intimately for we were boys together ah tell me of him we lived near each other sir and manton mayhew was my rival at school and also for the love of a pretty girl whom i idolized he did all in his power to ruin me and when i obtained a position in a bank where he also was a clerk he did wreck my life for i was accused of robbery and worse still of murdering the watchman who caught me in the act i would surely have been hanged but for the girl i spoke of who forced me to fly for my life aiding me to escape i fled to prove my innocence and became a wanderer then i received a letter from the woman i loved telling me that she had discovered that i really was a thief and a murderer and that she abhorred where she had loved me and more when in my despair i wrote to one who had been my friend to hear from home i was told that manton mayhew had been the means of ruining my father financially and the blow had driven him to suicide while my poor mother heartbroken had died soon after my flight nor was this all for hugh mayhew the brother of manton had married the girl i had loved several years after other news came to me from my old home and to the effect that manton mayhew had gone to the bad and in a drunken brawl had wounded a companion fatally as he had believed and he had fled no one knew where his brother hugh had wrecked his fathers bank and in a drunken frenzy had shot his wife one night and he too had become a fugitive well to end the story quickly for i hate to dwell upon it manton mayhew had joined the army and a good soldier had become a sergeant ordered to fort faraway he had met there sergeant weston whom he recognized and fearing to be exposed in his crimes he had at once attacked him telling him he would kill him and say that it was on account of his insubordination but wallace weston was armed having just been given a revolver by an officer to take to his quarters and he killed mayhew as he was about to drive a knife to his heart rather than bring out the old story and perhaps be carried back east to be tried for the murder of the bank watchman of which he was innocent sergeant wallace weston submitted in silence to his trial and accepted his fate feeling that his life was one of despair and do you know all this to be as you have stated asked surgeon powell when the goldhunter had finished his story i do sir knowing it you did not come to the rescue of poor weston i did not sir may i ask why and frank powell spoke sternly i will tell you the reason surgeon powell if you will pledge me your word to receive it in sacred confidence i will so pledge myself mr seldon because sir i am wallace weston frank powell was always a calm cool man but now he sprang to his feet dropping his pipe and cried do you speak the truth i do sir upon honor yes now i recognize the look that has so haunted me since i met you this morning upon my soul weston i am glad to see that you are not dead that you can clear up the story of mayhews killing and announce yourself once more a guiltless man but i cannot sir for you forget that i am accused of murdering the watchman and robbing the bank is there no way in which you can disprove that only by the confession of the guilty ones who were they the mayhews and one other they were guilty yes sir and who was the other man a clerk in the bank and devoted friend of the mayhews where is he i do not know sir and they are dead manton and hugh mayhew are dead by my hand but where proof of their crime can be found i cannot tell and so i am forced to hide under an assumed name yes doctor powell the name of a dead man andrew seldon the one whose body was found by the rock in the desert and buried for mine you have had a remarkable escape weston seldon now sir for that is the name i have taken and let me now tell you how that poor man the real andrew seldon was plotted against i shall be glad to hear all that you are willing to tell me seldon well sir it was while escaping from the pursuing soldiers that i came upon a stray horse he led me back to where his dead master lay upon the desert and upon the body i found papers telling who he was that he had left home under a cloud had left a wife and child and riches and come west to hide himself and hunt for gold until he dared return there was a map of gold finds he had discovered and he had struck it rich and was on his way home so i dressed him in my uniform took his traps and went my way and he was buried as wallace weston it was when i was returning to the gold find of andrew seldon that i came upon blackheart bills camp and finding in him hugh mayhew i killed him my intention was to take andrew seldons name dig his gold and to ease my conscience give half to his family i imitated his writing and wrote to his lawyer and best friend and little daughter for his wife was dead as letters told me which he had with him in answer at w i learned that i as andrew seldon dared not return home that my daughter celeste was dead and my fortune gone when celeste seldon was captured from her own lips i learned as she told the outlaw lieutenant that all had been a plot to keep her father away and discovering the plot she had come out here to find him after the messenger had failed to write home to her later than on his arrival in w now you know doctor powell why i was seeking buffalo bill and it is my intention to seek that young girl tell her all and give her onehalf of the fortune in gold i have found through her fathers maps and directions in the grand caсon and then i suppose i shall drift about the world sir unknown leading an aimless life or perhaps return to my golddigging again no weston such must not be your fate for i shall take your case in hand and prove your innocence of robbing that bank and killing the watchman for i believe your story and then with sergeant mayhews character proven you can readily secure pardon for taking his life as you did in selfdefense heaven bless you surgeon powell i only make one request weston yes sir that buffalo bill hears your story as i have for he believes in your innocence most thoroughly and will be most happy to welcome you back to life i will be guided by you sir but some one is coming it is buffalo bill cried frank powell and just then the scout rode into the camp chapter xxxix the outlaws confession when buffalo bill went on his way down into the grand caсon he continued on until he discovered just where the outlaws had made their retreat this done he retraced his way as rapidly as possible and at once went back on the trail to where he had left his horse the sun was just setting as he neared the spot and he approached carefully for he was not sure that some one had not been there and discovered the animal just as he caught sight of his horse he also saw that there was some one there a horseman who had just ridden up to the spot the face of the horseman was masked and this told the story in an instant but buffalo bill had been also discovered and up to the outlaws shoulder went his rifle at the same instant that the weapon of the scout was leveled the two rifles cracked almost as one and the outlaw reeled tried to spur his horse in flight and fell to the ground the scout at once advanced toward him revolver in hand when in faint voice came the words dont fire again your shot is fatal the scout put his revolver in his belt bent over and took the mask from the face of the wounded man his horse following him to the spot the face revealed was not a bad one that of a man of thirty with mustache imperial and hair worn long the scout made him as comfortable as he could for he saw that he had told the truth that the wound he had received was fatal then he sat by the side of the wounded man for a while the light of a full moon falling full in his face and the scout heard him say i am glad that i missed you for i have done evil enough in my time who are you kindly asked the scout my name is alvin wolf and i had just resolved to lead a different life for i am an outlaw one of the masked chiefs band yes i thought as much i changed my life when i met a young girl who was the chiefs captive and i intended to thwart his plans to again capture her for we gave her up for ransom two days ago and acting for him i received the gold he gave me a written order to take the gold to a spot near last chance and turn it over to him which i did last night for he met me there and then he arranged to get a large ransom for a poor crazy fellow the lover of the young girl i believe and so i had decided to act to protect her but you can do so now for i will tell you all and then i can die content yes it is best to die with a free conscience i believe you and more i will tell you of one whom i helped to ruin in life though he is dead now he was a soldier at fort faraway and his name was wallace weston we were boys together though he was older than i and i was led into temptation by others the mayhew brothers and we robbed the bank we were working in were discovered by the watchman and manton mayhew killed him and we had so planned that the robbery would fall upon the assistant cashier wallace weston he fled for we intended to hang him by our testimony and then hugh mayhew forged letters and caused his sweetheart to believe him guilty and she married him mayhew to in the end lose her life at his hands manton mayhew always swore to me that he would kill weston if he ever met him and he said he had heard he was in the army and so i suppose when they met at fort faraway he attempted to do so and was killed himself poor weston did not dare tell of the past so had to suffer but you can make the real truth known to clear his name for i have it all written out as it is in my diary which i have always carried with me and will now give to you i am glad to learn all this but let me ask you about your outlaw band yes how many are in it nine without counting the chief your retreat is in the grand caсon you know this i do yes our retreat is there and your chief the outlaw did not reply and a shudder passed through his frame the scout spoke again and leaning over he heard a few whispered words from the dying lips which a moment after were sealed forever by death chapter xl tearing off the mask when buffalo bill rode into the camp where surgeon powell and the goldhunter sat it was seen that he was leading two horses one carrying a packsaddle the other a heavy load the surgeonscout at once arose and greeted him and said ho bill what game is that a dead outlaw the lieutenant of the band whom i killed but you are not alone frank no it is your old rescuer who was on his way to the fort to see you when he met me he was going to tell you that the outlaws have their retreat in the grand caсon i have been to it but how are you pard seldon and let me say that i have good news for you as your daughter has come west to meet you and is now at last chance thank you mr cody but i am aware of that fact as surgeon powell can tell you but come look me squarely in the face and see if you know who i am buffalo bill gave a fixed look and then cried excitedly by the gods of war you are wallace weston or his ghost i am a very healthy ghost sir but i am wallace weston and i leave it to surgeon powell to tell my story to you the scout seized the goldhunters hand and wrung it hard while he said thank god you are not dead weston for only this night have i heard the truth of your story from the lips of the dying outlaw alvin wolf ha once my friend then my foe for he sided with the mayhews against me he did and i have his diary which tells the whole story but now let me tell mine and then we can compare notes and decide what is best to be done they first had supper after staking out their horses and afterward buried the body of the outlaw alvin wolf then until after midnight they sat talking together the surgeon the scout and the goldhunter about all that had happened after which they retired to their blankets it was just dawn the next morning when wallace weston rode away from the old camp to make all speed to last chance his mission there was to take a letter to driver harding which was as follows trust the bearer with your life pick out eight of the best men in the camp whom you can trust and have them pretend to start for w on business going in your coach see that no one else goes have two leaders that are good saddlehorses and smuggle into the coach seven saddles i will meet you at dead line with horses and prepare to lose your leaders then for four horses can readily pull your empty coach on to w your men must be the best and fully armed the bearer will bring your answer to me yours b b pushing rapidly on wallace weston arrived in last chance that night and at once sought out harding giving him his letter he received his answer after the two had had a talk together and then mounted upon a fresh horse furnished him by the driver he started upon his return having attracted no particular attention it was the next day that the coach rolled out for w and it carried eight miners as passengers arriving at dead line it was met there by buffalo bill surgeon powell and wallace weston and the eight miners joined them and went up to the scouts basin camp then with the two leaders taken from hardings coach they had with wolfs horses and the packanimals enough to mount the party the next morning the start was made for the grand caсon and the descent was made on foot in the darkness of night the horses having been left on the rim the party were led by wallace weston who knew the trail perfectly and at midnight they rushed in upon the outlaw camp giving them a complete surprise revolvers rattled cries of alarm and pain were heard cheers were given and then silence reigned supreme for the battle was won and four outlaws had been made prisoners the rest were killed one miner had been killed and others wounded though slightly and these were cared for by doctor powell in the camp the prisoner bernard brandon was found safe but still unconscious of all about him apparently wallace weston had asked buffalo bill and surgeon powell to go on with him to his camp and there they found lucas langley on guard he having heard the echoes of the firing far down the caсon and supposed that it meant an attack planned by his pard without letting the secret be known that there was gold in the caсon buffalo bill ordered an early start for last chance and it was made by all except lucas langley who remained at his cabin to await westons return upon nearing last chance buffalo bill halted the party to follow on a few hours later while he rode on with surgeon powell and wallace weston the scout was recognized by the miners and warmly greeted and as he dismounted at the hotel and was welcomed by landlord larry and harding who had returned doctor dick came forward and said delighted to see you mr cody again in last chance yes doctor dick i am here to find richard mayhew alias doctor dick and more still the masked chief of the roadagents hold you are covered but doctor dick saw that all was lost saw that the rope would be his end and in spite of the warning of the scout he drew his revolver but ere his finger touched the trigger he fell a dead man at the feet of buffalo bill celeste seldon having come forward just in time to see him fall his length upon the earth to the excited miners buffalo bill turned and made a speech for he had killed their hero the idol of last chance he told them how the mask of the gambler had been torn off by the confession of the outlaw lieutenant alvin wolf and how he had had his suspicions aroused as had also landlord larry and harding by several things that had occurred the whole story was made known and as the rest of the party came in bearing the booty of the outlaws and the prisoners and in doctor dicks cabin was found the very bag of gold that had been given for celeste seldons ransom and the money before taken from the coach there was no doubting his guilt and a howl of rage arose against him and his followers later while buffalo bill surgeon powell wallace weston and landlord larry were at celeste seldons cabin telling her the true story regarding her father the storm broke in fury and harding rushed in to say that the miners had seized the outlaw prisoners and were hanging them an attempted rescue was made by surgeon powell and buffalo bill but in vain that mob would not could not be stayed in its madness and the work of revenge was accomplished the next day as surgeon powell had said that the reason of bernard brandon could be restored by an operation celeste begged him to make the attempt and to the joy of all it was crowned with perfect success with his reason once on its throne and learning all that had taken place bernard brandon told how he had been the young partner of lawyer edgar stone who had kept his friend andrew seldon away from home by false letters had written him that celeste was dead intending in the end to marry her and get the large fortune for himself for the estate had greatly increased in value since the departure of its owner he had at last decided to go to celeste and confess all and learning that he had done so edgar stone had fled to save imprisonment in atonement bernard brandon had come west to find andrew seldon and not hearing from him celeste had followed him bernard brandon hoped that his atonement might win the heart of celeste but instead she dismissed him with liberal payment and placed herself under the guardianship of wallace weston who had taken her fathers name bidding adieu to their pards at last chance after sending harding to the grand caсon to join lucas langley at the mine wallace weston went east with celeste and going to his old home he told the whole story of his life and submitted letters from doctor powell buffalo bill and the diary of the outlaw officer as proof of his innocence so that the charges against him were at once ended by legal process armed with proper papers he presented himself before the president and received his pardon after which with celeste seldon as mrs wallace weston he went to fort faraway and received a welcome from all his old officers and comrades that made his heart glad as the mines in the grand caсon had ceased panning out as expected wallace weston gave up his interest there to lucas langley and harding and returned east with his beautiful wife the end buffalo bills death call is the title of a weirdly thrilling series of

prentiss ingraham about his lifelong friend buffalo bill these two men were inseparable companions and colonel ingraham is therefore well qualified to write stories of the adventures of the oldtime scout and plainsman these stories are destined to be immensely popular because they are drawn true to life they bring the open plains right to the readers front door as it were the fact that these stories are historically correct gives them a very secure place in american literature manifestly no history was ever written that could give space in such detail to the adventures of a single man no
