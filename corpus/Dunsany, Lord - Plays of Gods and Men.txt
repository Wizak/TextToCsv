press new york made in the united states of america the tents of the arabs by lord dunsany dramatis personae the king belnarb cameldrivers aoob the chamberlain zabra a notable eznarza a gypsy of the desert scene outside the gate of the city of thalanna time uncertain act i belnarb by evening we shall be in the desert again aoob yes belnarb then no more city for us for many weeks aoob ah belnarb we shall see the lights come out looking back from the cameltrack that is the last we shall see of it aoob we shall be in the desert then belnarb the old angry desert aoob how cunningly the desert hides his wells you would say he had an enmity with man he does not welcome you as the cities do belnarb he has an enmity i hate the desert aoob i think there is nothing in the world so beautiful as cities belnarb cities are beautiful things aoob i think they are loveliest a little after dawn when night falls off from the houses they draw it away from them slowly and let it fall like a cloak and stand quite naked in their beauty to shine in some broad river and the light comes up and kisses them on the forehead i think they are loveliest then the voices of men and women begin to arise in the streets scarce audible one by one till a slow loud murmur arises and all the voices are one i often think the city speaks to me then she says in that voice of hers aoob aoob who one of these days shall die i am not earthly i have been always i shall not die belnarb i do not think that cities are loveliest at dawn we can see dawn in the desert any day i think they are loveliest just when the sun is set and a dusk steals along the narrower streets a kind of mystery in which we can see cloaked figures and yet not quite discern whose figures they be and just when it would be dark and out in the desert there would be nothing to see but a black horizon and a black sky on top of it just then the swinging lanterns are lighted up and lights come out in windows one by one and all the colours of the raiments change then a woman perhaps will slip from a little door and go away up the street into the night and a man perhaps will steal by with a dagger for some old quarrels sake and skarmi will light up his house to sell brandy all night long and men will sit on benches outside his door playing skabash by the glare of a small green lantern while they light great bubbling pipes and smoke nargroob o it is all very good to watch and i like to think as i smoke and see these things that somewhere far away the desert has put up a huge red cloud like a wing so that all the arabs know that next day the siroc will blow the accursed breath of eblis the father of satan aoob yes it is pleasant to think of the siroc when one is safe in a city but i do not like to think about it now for before the day is out we will be taking pilgrims to mecca and who ever prophesied or knew by wit what the desert had in store going into the desert is like throwing bone after bone to a dog some he will catch and some of them he will drop he may catch our bones or we may go by and come to gleaming mecca oho i would i were a merchant with a little booth in a frequented street to sit all day and barter belnarb aye it is easier to cheat some lord coming to buy silk and ornaments in a city than to cheat death in the desert oh the desert the desert i love the beautiful cities and i hate the desert aoob who is that belnarb what there by the deserts edge where the camels are aoob yes who is it belnarb he is staring across the desert the way that the camels go they say that the king goes down to the edge of the desert and often stares across it he stands there for a long time of an evening looking towards mecca aoob of what use is it to the king to look towards mecca he cannot go to mecca he cannot go into the desert for one day messengers would run after him and cry his name and bring him back to the councilhall or to the chamber of judgments if they could not find him their heads would be struck off and put high up upon some windy roof the judges would point at them and say they see better there belnarb no the king cannot go away into the desert if god were to make me king i would go down to the edge of the desert once and i would shake the sand out of my turban and out of my beard and then i would never look at the desert again greedy and parched old parent of thousands of devils he might cover the wells with sand and blow with his siroc year after year and century after century and never earn one of my curses if god made me king aoob they say you are like the king belnarb yes i am like the king because his father disguised himself as a cameldriver and came through our villages i often say to myself god is just and if i could disguise myself as the king and drive him out to be a cameldriver that would please god for he is just aoob if you did this god would say look at belnarb whom i made to be a cameldriver and who has forgotten this and then he would forget you belnarb belnarb who knows what god would say aoob who knows his ways are wonderful belnarb i would not do this thing aoob i would not do it it is only what i say to myself as i smoke or at night out in the desert i say to myself belnarb is king in thalanna and then i say chamberlain bring skarmi here with his brandy and his lanterns and boards to play skabash and let all the town come and drink before the palace and magnify my name pilgrims belnarb belnarb child of two dogs come and untether your camels come and start for holy mecca belnarb a curse on the desert aoob the camels are rising the caravan starts for mecca farewell beautiful city pilgrims voices off belnarb belnarb belnarb i come children of sin the king enters through the great door crowned he sits upon the step king a crown should not be worn upon the head a sceptre should not be carried in kings hands but a crown should be wrought into a golden chain and a sceptre driven stakewise into the ground so that a king may be chained to it by the ankle then he would know that he might not stray away into the beautiful desert and might never see the palm trees by the wells o thalanna thalanna how i hate this city with its narrow narrow ways and evening after evening drunken men playing skabash in the scandalous gambling house of that old scoundrel skarmi o that i might marry the child of some unkingly house that generation to generation had never known a city and that we might ride from here down the long track through the desert always we two alone till we came to the tents of the arabs and the crown some foolish greedy man should be given it to his sorrow and all this may not be for a king is yet a king chamberlain your majesty king well my lord chamberlain have you more work for me to do chamberlain yes there is much to do king i had hoped for freedom this evening for the faces of the camels are towards mecca and i would see the caravans move off into the desert where i may not go chamberlain there is very much for your majesty to do iktra has revolted king where is iktra chamberlain it is a little country tributary to your majesty beyond zebdarlon up among the hills king almost had it not been for this almost i had asked you to let me go away among the cameldrivers to golden mecca i have done the work of a king now for five years and listened to my councilors and all the while the desert called to me he said come to the tents of my children to the tents of my children and all the while i dwelt among these walls chamberlain if your majesty left the city now king i will not we must raise an army to punish the men of iktra chamberlain your majesty will appoint the commanders by name a tribe of your majestys fighting men must be summoned from agrarva and another from coloono the jungle city as well as one from mirsk this must be done by warrants sealed by your hand your majestys advisers await you in the councilhall king the sun is very low why have the caravans not started yet chamberlain i do not know and then your majesty king look look it is the shadows of the camels moving towards mecca how silently they slip over the ground beautiful shadows soon they are out in the desert flat on the golden sands and then the sun will set and they will be one with night chamberlain if your majesty has time for such things there are the camels themselves king no no i do not wish to watch the camels they can never take me out to the beautiful desert to be free forever from cities here i must stay to do the work of a king only my dreams can go and the shadows of the camels carry them to find peace by the tents of the arabs chamberlain will your majesty now come to the councilhall king yes yes i come voices off ho yo ho yay ho yo ho yay now the whole caravan has started hark to the drivers of the baggagecamels they will run behind them for the first ten miles and tomorrow they will mount them they will be out of sight of thalanna then and the desert will lie all round them with sunlight falling on its golden smiles and a new look will come into their faces i am sure that the desert whispers to them by night saying be at peace my children at peace my children meanwhile the chamberlain has opened the door for the king and is waiting there bowing with his hand resolutely on the opened door chamberlain your majesty will come to the councilhall king yes i will come had it not been for iktra i might have gone away and lived in the golden desert for a year and seen holy mecca chamberlain perhaps your majesty might have gone had it not been for iktra king my curse upon iktra zabra your majesty king oho more work for an unhappy king zabra iktra is pacified king is pacified zabra it happened suddenly the men of iktra met with a few of your majestys fighting men and an arrow chanced to kill the leader of the revolt and therefore the mob fled away although they were many and they have all cried for three hours great is the king king i will even yet see mecca and the dreamedof tents of the arabs i will go down now into the golden sands i chamberlain your majesty king in a few years i will return to you chamberlain your majesty it cannot be we could not govern the people for more than a year they would say the king is dead the king king then i will return in a year in one year only chamberlain it is a long time your majesty king i will return at noon a year from today chamberlain but your majesty a princess is being sent for from tharba king i thought one was coming from karshish chamberlain it has been thought more advisable that your majesty should wed in tharba the passes across the mountains belong to the king of tharba and he has great traffic with sharan and the isles king let it be as you will chamberlain but your majesty the ambassadors start this week the princess will be here in three months time king let her come in a year and a day chamberlain your majesty king farewell i am in haste i go to make ready for the desert the olden golden mother of happy men chamberlain one from whom god had not withheld all wisdom would not have given that message to our crazy young king zabra but it must be known many things might happen if it were not known at once chamberlain i knew it this morning he is off to the desert now zabra that is evil indeed but we can lure him back chamberlain perhaps not for many days zabra the kings favour is like gold chamberlain it is like much gold who are the arabs that the kings favour should be cast among them the walls of their houses are canvas even the common snail has a finer wall to his house zabra o it is most evil alas that i told him this we shall be poor men chamberlain no one will give us gold for many days zabra yet you will govern thalanna while he is away you can increase the taxes of the merchants and the tribute of the men that till the fields chamberlain they will only pay taxes and tribute to the king who gives of his bounty to just and upright men when he is in thalanna but while he is away the surfeit of his wealth will go to unjust men and to men whose beards are unclean and who fear not god zabra we shall indeed be poor chamberlain a little gold perhaps from evildoers for justice or a little money to decide the dispute of some righteous wealthy man but no more till the king returns whom god prosper zabra god increase him will you yet try to detain him chamberlain no when he comes by with his retinue and escort i will walk beside his horse and tell him that a progress through the desert will well impress the arabs with his splendour and turn their hearts towards him and i will speak privily to some captain at the rear of the escort and he shall afterwards speak to the chief commander that he may lose the cameltrack in a few days time and take the king and his followers to wander in the desert and so return by chance to thalanna again and it may yet be well with us we will wait here till they come by zabra will the chief commander do this thing certainly chamberlain yes he will be one thakbar a poor man and a righteous zabra but if he be not thakbar but some greedy man who demands more gold than we would give to thakbar chamberlain why then we must give him even what he demands and god will punish his greed zabra he must come past us here chamberlain yes he must come this way he will summon the cavalry from the saloia samang zabra it will be nearly dark before they can come chamberlain no he is in great haste he will pass before sunset he will make them mount at once zabra i do not see stir at the saloia chamberlain no no i do not see he will make a stir as they look a man comes through the doorway wearing a coarse brown cloak which falls over his head he calls furtively l what man is that he has gone down to the camels zabra he has given a piece of money to one of the cameldrivers chamberlain see he has mounted zabra can it have been the king chamberlain it is only some cameldriver going into the desert how glad his voices sounds zabra the siroc will swallow him chamberlain what if it were the king zabra why if it were the king we should starve for a year curtain act ii the king wrapped in a cameldrivers cloak sits by eznarza a gypsy of the desert king now i have known the desert and dwelt in the tents of the arabs eznarza there is no land like the desert and like the arabs no people king it is all over and done i return to the walls of my fathers eznarza time cannot put it away i go back to the desert that nursed me king did you think in those days on the sands or among the tents in the mornings that my year would ever end and i be brought away by strength of my word to the prisoning of a palace eznarza i knew that time would do it for my people have learned the way of him king is it then time that has mocked our futile prayers is he then greater than god that he has laughed at our praying eznarza we may not say that he is greater than god yet we prayed that our own year might not pass away god could not save it king yes yes we prayed that prayer all men would laugh at it eznarza the prayer was not laughable only he that is lord of the years is obdurate if a man prayed for life to a furious merciless sultan well might the sultans slaves laugh yet it is not laughable to pray for life king yes we are slaves of time tomorrow brings the princess who comes from tharba we must bow our heads eznarza my people say that time lives in the desert he lies there in the sun king no no not in the desert nothing alters there eznarza my people say that the desert is his country he smites not his own country my people say but he overwhelms all other lands of the world king yes the desert is always the same evn the littlest rocks of it eznarza they say that he loves the sphinx and does not harm her they say that he does not dare to harm the sphinx she has borne him many gods whom the infidels worship king their father is more terrible than all the false gods eznarza o that he had but spared our little year king he destroys all things utterly eznarza there is a little child of man that is mightier than he and who saves the world from time king who is this little child that is mightier than time is it love that is mightier eznarza no not love king if he conquers even love then none are mightier eznarza he scares love away with weak white hairs and with wrinkles poor little love poor love time scares him away king what is this child of man that can conquer time and that is braver than love eznarza even memory king yes i will call to him when the wind is from the desert and the locusts are beaten against my obdurate walls i will call to him more when i cannot see the desert and cannot hear the wind of it eznarza he shall bring back our year to us that time cannot destroy time cannot slaughter it if memory says no it is reprieved though banished we shall often see it though a little far off and all its hours and days shall dance to us and go by one by one and come back and dance again king why that is true they shall come back to us i had thought that they that work miracles whether in heaven or earth were unable to do one thing i thought that they could not bring back days again when once they had fallen into the hands of time eznarza it is a trick that memory can do he comes up softly in the town or the desert wherever a few men are like the strange dark conjurors who sing to snakes and he does his trick before them and does it again and again king we will often make him bring the old days back when you are gone to your people and i am miserably wedded to the princess coming from tharba eznarza they will come with sand on their feet from the golden beautiful desert they will come with a longgone sunset each one over his head their lips will laugh with the olden evening voices king it is nearly noon it is nearly noon it is nearly noon eznarza why we part then king o come into the city and be queen there i will send its princess back again to tharba you shall be queen in thalanna eznarza i go now back to my people you will wed the princess from tharba on the morrow you have said it i have said it king o that i had not given my word to return eznarza a kings word is like a kings crown and a kings sceptre and a kings throne it is in fact a foolish thing like a city king i cannot break my word but you can be queen in thalanna eznarza thalanna will not have a gypsy for a queen king i will make thalanna have her for a queen eznarza you cannot make a gypsy live for a year in a city king i knew of a gypsy that lived once in a city eznarza not such a gypsy as i come back to the tents of the arabs king i cannot i gave my word eznarza kings have broken their words king not such a king as i eznarza we have only that little child of man whose name is memory king come he shall brink back to us before we part one of those days that were banished eznarza let it be the first day the day we met by the well when the camels came to ellolith king our year lacked some few days for my year began here the camels were some days out eznarza you were riding a little wide of the caravan upon the side of the sunset your camel was swinging on with easy strides but you were tired king you had come to the well for water at first i could see your eyes then the stars came out and it grew dark and i only saw your shape and there was a little light about your hair i do not know if it was the light of the stars i only knew that it shone eznarza and then you spoke to me about the camels king then i heard your voice you did not say the things you would say now eznarza of course i did not king you did not say things in the same way even eznarza how the hours come dancing back king no no only their shadows we went together then to holy mecca we dwelt alone in tents in the golden desert we heard the wild free day sing sings in his freedom we heard the beautiful nightwind nothing remains of our year but desolate shadows memory whips them and they will not dance we made our farewells where the desert was the city shall not hear them eznarza covers her face the king rises softly and walks up the steps enter l the chamberlain and zabra only noticing each other chamberlain he will come he will come zabra but it is noon now our fatness has left us our enemies mock at us if he do not come god has forgotten us and our friends will pity us chamberlain if he is alive he will come zabra i fear that it is past noon chamberlain then he is dead or robbers have waylaid him chamberlain and zabra put dust on their heads belnarb god is just i am the king the kings hand is on the door when belnarb says this he goes down the steps again and sits beside the gypsy she raises her head from her hands and looks at him finally he partially covers his face arab fashion and watches belnarb and the chamberlain and zabra chamberlain are you indeed the king belnarb i am the king chamberlain your majesty has altered much since a year ago belnarb men alter in the desert and alter much aoob indeed your excellency he is the king when the king went into the desert disguised i fed his camel indeed he is the king zabra he is the king i know the king when i see him chamberlain you have seen the king seldom zabra i have often seen the king belnarb yes we have often met often and often chamberlain if some one could recognize your majesty some one besides this man who came with you then we should all be certain belnarb there is no need of it i am the king the king rises and stretches out his hand palm downwards king in holy mecca in greenroofed mecca of the many gates we knew him for the king belnarb yes that is true i saw this man in mecca chamberlain pardon your majesty the desert had altered you zabra i knew your majesty aoob as well as i do belnarb let this man be rewarded suitably give him some post in the palace chamberlain yes your majesty king i am a cameldriver and we go back to our camels chamberlain as you wish exeunt belnarb aoob chamberlain and zabra through door eznarza you have done wisely wisely and the reward of wisdom is happiness king they have their king now but we will turn again to the tents of the arabs eznarza they are foolish people king they have found a foolish king eznarza it is a foolish man that would choose to dwell among walls king some are born kings but this man has chosen to be one eznarza come let us leave them king we will go back again eznarza come back to the tents of my people king we will dwell a little apart in a dear brown tent of our own eznarza we shall hear the sand again whispering low to the dawnwind king we shall hear the nomads stirring in their camps far off because it is dawn eznarza the jackals will patter past us slipping back to the hills king when at evening the sun is set we shall weep for no day that is gone eznarza i will raise up my head of a nighttime against the sky and the old old unbought stars shall twinkle through my hair and we shall not envy any of the diademmed queens of the world curtain the laughter of the gods a tragedy in three acts by lord dunsany dramatis personae

fathers sword was so terrible that he had to hide it with a cloak tharmia he probably did that because there were no jewels in the scabbard arolind there were emeralds in it that outstared the sea tharmia now i must leave you here and go down among the shops for i have not changed my hair since we came to thek ichtharion have you not brought that from barbulelsharnak tharmia it was not necessary the king would not take his court where they could not obtain necessaries arolind may i go with your sincerity tharmia indeed princely lady i shall be glad of your company arolind i wish to see the other palaces in thek then we can go on beyond the walls to see what princes live in the neighbourhood tharmia it will be delightful ichtharion well we are here in thek ludibras how lucky we are that the king has come to thek i feared he would never come ichtharion it is a most fair city ludibras when he tarried year after year in monstrous barbulelsharnak i feared that i would see the sun rise never more in the windy glorious country i feared we should live always in barbulelsharnak and be buried among houses ichtharion it is mountainous with houses there are no flowers there i wonder how the winds come into it ludibras ah do you know that it is that brought him here at last i gave him orchids from a far country at last he noticed them those are good flowers said he they come from thek i said thek is purple with them it seems purple far out on the sand to the camel men then ichtharion no it was not you brought him he saw a butterfly once in barbulelsharnak there had not been one there for seven years it was lucky for us that it lived i used to see hundreds but they all died but that one when they came to barbulelsharnak the king saw it ludibras it was since then that he noticed my purple orchids ichtharion something changed in his mind when he saw the butterfly he became quite different he would not have noticed a flower but for that ludibras he came to thek in order to see the orchids ichtharion come come we are here nothing else matters ludibras yes we are here how beautiful are the orchids ichtharion what a beautiful thing the air is in the morning i stand up very early and breathe it from my casement not in order to nourish my body you understand but because it is the wild sweet air of thek ludibras yes it is wonderful rising up in the morning it seems all fresh from the fields ichtharion it took us two days to ride out of barelsharnak do you remember how men stared at our camels no one had gone away from the city for years ludibras i think it is not easy to leave a great city it seems to grow thicker around you and you forget the fields ichtharion the jungle is like a sea lying there below us the orchids that blaze on it are like tyrian ships all rich with purple of that wonderful fish they have even dyed their sails with it ludibras they are not like ships because they do not move they are like they are like no tangible thing in all the world they are like faint beautiful songs of an unseen singer they are like temptations to some unknown sin they make me think of the tigers that slip through the gloom below them enter harpagas and attendants with spears and leather belts ichtharion where are you going harpagas we are going hunting ichtharion hunting how beautiful harpagas a little street goes down from the palace door the other end of it touches the very jungle ludibras o heavenly city of thek ichtharion have you ever before gone hunting harpagas no i have dreamed of it in barbulelsharnak i nearly forgot my dream ichtharion man was not made for cities i did not know this once ludibras i will come with you ichtharion i will come with you too we will go down by the little street and there will be the jungle i will fetch a spear as we go ludibras what shall we hunt in the jungle harpagas they say there are kroot and abbax and tigers some say have been heard of we must never go back to barbulelsharnak again

husband brought him here tharmia what arolind nothing what did you say tharmia i said nothing i thought you spoke carolyx it may be better for my husband to persuade him for he was ever opposed to his coming to thek tharmia he could have but little influence with his majesty since the king has come to thek arolind no it will be better for our husbands to arrange it carolyx i myself have some influence with the queen tharmia it is of no use her nerves are all aquiver she weeps if you speak with her if you argue a matter with her she cries aloud and maidens must come and fan her and put scent on her hands arolind she never leaves her chamber and the king would not listen to her tharmia hark they are coming back they are singing a hunting song why they have killed a beast all four of the men are bringing it on two branches arolind what kind of beast is it tharmia i do not know it seems to have barbed horns carolyx we must go and meet them the song is loud and joyous exeunt by the

earth break in pieces beneath i would rather be mad than to fear things like that st sentry hush enter from other side ichtharion ludibras and harpagas each with his wife beside him hand in hand each couple bows before the king still hand in hand then they seat themselves the king nods once to each couple king well your sincerity i trust that you are glad to have come to thek tharmia very glad

majesty king then we can stay here long can we not harpagas there are reasons of state why that were dangerous king reasons of state why should we not stay here harpagas your majesty there is a legend in the world that he who is greatest in the city of barbulelsharnak is the greatest in the world king i had not heard that legend harpagas your majesty little legends do not hive in the sacred ears of kings nevertheless they hum among lesser men from generation to generation king i will not go for a legend to barbulelsharnak harpagas your majesty it is very dangerous king we will discuss things of state which little interest your sincerities tharmia your majesty we are ignorant of these things king we will rest from things of state for awhile shall we not we will be happy shall we not in this ancient beautiful palace ludibras if your majesty commands we must obey king but is not thek most beautiful are not the jungle orchids a wonder and a glory ludibras they have been thought so your majesty they were pretty in barbulelsharnak where they were rare king but when the sun comes over them in the morning when the dew is on them still are they not glorious then indeed they are very glorious ludibras i think they would be glorious if they were blue and there were fewer of them king i do not think so but you ichtharion you think the city beautiful ichtharion yes your majesty king ah i am glad you love it it is to me adorable ichtharion i do not love it your majesty i hate it very much i know it is beautiful because your majesty has said so ludibras this city is dangerously unhealthy your majesty harpagas it is dangerous to be absent from barbulelsharnak ichtharion we implore your majesty to return to the centre of the world king i will not go again to barbulelsharnak exeunt king and attendants ichtharion ludibras and harpagas remain enter arolind and carolyx each goes up to her husband very affectionate arolind and you talked to the king ludibras yes arolind you

alone in the jungle and here i shall be buried ludibras but arolind oh will you not leave me alone is nothing sacred to you not even my grief harpagas what are we to do ludibras all women are alike ichtharion i do not allow my wife to speak to me like that i hope tharmia will not weep it is very distressing to see a woman in tears do not be unhappy do not be at all unhappy but i have been unable to persuade the king to return to barbulelsharnak you will be happy here after a little while tharmia you are the kings adviser ha ha ha you are the grand high vizier of the court ha ha ha you are the warder of the golden wand ha ha ha o go and throw biscuits to the kings dog ichtharion what tharmia throw little ginger biscuits to the kings dog perhaps he will obey you perhaps you will have some influence with the kings dog if you feed him with little biscuits you ichtharion ludibras has her sincerity the princely lady tharmia been speaking with you ichtharion she spoke a few words we must leave thek we must depart from thek ludibras what without the king harpagas no ichtharion no they would say in barbulelsharnak these were once at court and men that we have flogged would spit in our faces ludibras who can command a king harpagas only the gods ludibras the gods there are no gods now we have been civilised over three thousand years the gods that nursed our infancy are dead or gone to nurse younger nations ichtharion i refuse the listen to o the sentries are gone no the gods are no use to us they were driven away by the decadence harpagas we are not in the decadence here barbulelsharnak is in a different age the city of thek is scarcely civilised ichtharion but everybody lives in barbulelsharnak harpagas the gods ludibras the old prophet is coming harpagas he believes as much in the gods as you or i do ludibras yes but we must not speak as though we knew that ichtharion ludibras and harpagas the gods are good voiceofthegods they are benignant ichtharion listen let him prophesy to the king let him bid the king go hence lest they smite the city ludibras can we make him do it ichtharion i think we can make him do it harpagas the king is more highly civilised even than we are he will not care for the gods ichtharion he cannot ignore them the gods crowned his forefather and if there are no gods who made him king ludibras why that is true he must obey a prophecy ichtharion if the king disobeys the gods the people will tear him asunder whether the gods created the people or the people created the gods ludibras if the king discovers this we shall be painfully tortured ichtharion how can the king discover it ludibras he knows that there are no gods ichtharion no man knows that of a certainty ludibras but if there are enter prophet with harpagas ichtharion quickly sends ludibras and harpagas away ichtharion there is a delicate matter concerning the king voiceofthegods then i can help you little for i serve only the gods ichtharion it also concerns the gods voiceofthegods ah then i hearken ichtharion this city is for the king whose body is fragile a very unhealthy city moreover there is no work here that a king can profitably do also it is dangerous for barbulelsharnak to be long without a king lest voiceofthegods does this concern the gods ichtharion in this respect it does concern the gods that if the gods knew this they would warn the king by inspiring you to make a prophecy as they do not know this voiceofthegods the gods know all things ichtharion the gods do not know things that are not true this is not strictly true voiceofthegods it is written and hath been said that the gods cannot lie ichtharion the gods of course cannot lie but a prophet may sometimes utter a prophecy that is a good prophecy and helpful to men thereby pleasing the gods although the prophecy is not a true one voiceofthegods the gods speak through my mouth my breath is my own breath i am human and mortal but my voice is from the gods and the gods cannot lie ichtharion is it wise in an age when the gods have lost their power to anger powerful men for the sake of the gods voiceofthegods it is wise ichtharion we are three men and you are alone with us will the gods save you if we want to put you to death and slip away with your body into the jungle voiceofthegods if you should do this thing the gods have willed it if they have not willed it you cannot ichtharion we do not wish to do it nevertheless you will make this prophecy you will go before the king and you will say that the gods have spoken and that within three days time for the sake of vengeance upon some unknown man who is in this city they will overthrow all thek unless every man is departed voiceofthegods i will not do it for the gods cannot lie ichtharion has it not been the custom since unremembered time for a prophet to have two wives voiceofthegods most certainly it is the law what ichtharion three voiceofthegods do not betray me it was long ago ichtharion you will be allowed to serve the gods no more if men know this the gods will not protect you in this matter for you have offended also against the gods voiceofthegods it is worse that the gods should lie do not betray me ichtharion i go to tell the others what i know voiceofthegods i will make the false prophecy ichtharion ah you have chosen wisely voiceofthegods when the gods punish me who make them lie they will know what punishment to give to you ichtharion the gods will not punish us it is long ago that the gods used to punish men voiceofthegods the gods will punish us act ii king karnos look at them now are they not beautiful they catch the last rays of the lingering sun can you say that the orchids are not beautiful now ichtharion your majesty we were wrong they are most beautiful they tower up from the jungle to take the sun they are like the diadem of some jubilant king king karnos ah now you have come to love the beauty of thek ichtharion yes yes your majesty i see it now i would live in this city always king karnos yes we will live here always there is no city lovelier than thek am i not right ludibras your majesty no city is like it king karnos ah i am always right tharmia how beautiful is thek arolind yes it is like a god whispers there has been a prophecy there has been a prophecy king karnos ah there has been a prophecy bring in the prophet enter mournfully with dejected head and walking very slowly voiceofthegods you have made a prophecy voiceofthegods i have made a prophecy king karnos i would hear that prophecy voiceofthegods your majesty the gods in three days time king karnos stop is it not usual to begin with certain words voiceofthegods it is written and hath been said it is written and hath been said that the gods cannot lie king karnos that is right voiceofthegods that the gods cannot lie king karnos yes yes voiceofthegods in three days time the gods will destroy this city for vengeance upon some man unless all men desert it king karnos the gods will destroy thek voiceofthegods yes king karnos when will this happen voiceofthegods it must be in three days time king karnos how will it happen voiceofthegods why it will happen king karnos how voiceofthegods why there will be a sound as the riving of wood a sound as of thunder coming up from the ground a cleft will run like a mouse across the floor there will be a red light and then no light at all and in the darkness thek shall tumble in exit prophet slowly he begins to weep then casts his cloak over his face he stretches out his arms to grope his way and is led by the hand the king sits thinking tharmia save us your majesty arolind save us ichtharion we must fly your majesty ludibras we must escape swiftly the king sits still in silence he lifts a stick on his right to beat a little silver bell but puts it down again at last he lifts it up and strikes the bell king karnos bring back that prophet the king looks thoughtful the rest have a frightened look reenter prophet when the gods prophesy rain in the season of rain or the death of an old man we believe them but when the gods prophesy something incredible and ridiculous such as happens not nowadays and hath not been heard of since the fall of bleth then our credulity is overtaxed it is possible that a man should lie it is not possible that the gods should destroy a city nowadays voiceofthegods o king have mercy king karnos what would you be sent safe away while your king is destroyed by the gods voiceofthegods no no your majesty i would stay in the city your majesty but if the gods do not destroy the city if the gods have misled me king karnos if the gods have misled you they have chosen your doom why ask for mercy from me voiceofthegods if the gods have misled me and punish me no further i ask mercy from you o king king karnos if the gods have misled you let the gods protect you from my executioner st sentry very witty nd sentry yes yes king karnos if the doom fall not at sunset why then the executioner voiceofthegods your majesty king karnos no more no doubt the gods will destroy the whole city at sunset ichtharion your majesty is it safe to kill a prophet even for any guilt will not the people king karnos not while he is a prophet but if he has prophesied falsely his death is due to the gods the people once even burned a prophet themselves because he had taken three wives ichtharion it is most unfortunate but what can we do ludibras he will not be killed if he betray us instead ichtharion why that is true king karnos why do you whisper tharmia your majesty we fear that the gods will destroy us all and king karnos you do not fear it a plaintive lament off enter the queen her face is pale as paper queen o your majesty your majesty i have heard the lutanist i have heard the lutanist king karnos she means the lute that is heard by those about to die queen i have heard gogowza the lutanist playing his lute and i shall die o i shall die king karnos no no no you have not heard gogowza send for her maidens send for the queens maidens queen i have heard gogowza playing and i shall die king karnos hark why i hear it too that is not gogowza it is only a man with a lute i hear it too queen o the king hears it too the king will die the great king will die my child will be desolate for the king will die mourn people of the jungle mourn citizens of thek and thou

real lute that is no spirit playing queen o but he is old in a few days he will die it is gogowza and the king will die king karnos no no it is only a man look out of the window there it is dark your majesty and i cannot see queen it is the spirit gogowza i can hear the music clearly king karnos he is young queen the young are always in danger they go about among swords he will die too and the great king and i in a few days we will be buried king karnos let us all listen we cannot all die in a few days time tharmia i hear it clearly queen women are blossoms in the hand of death they are often close to death she will die too all i hear it i hear it and i and i and i it is only a man with a lute queen i should like to see him then i should know for certain no it is too dark king karnos we will call the man if you wish it queen yes i shall be easy then and then i shall sleep king instructs attendants to enquire without queen at window still king karnos it is some man down by the river playing his lute i am told that sometimes a man will play all night tharmia thats their amusement here arolind well really its almost all the music we get tharmia it really is arolind o how i cry for the golden hall of song in barbulelsharnak i think it would almost hold the city of thek attendant it is only a common lute your majesty all hear it except one man king karnos all except one did you say ah thank you to queen at window it is only a common lute queen one man did not hear it who was he where is he why didnt he attendant he was riding back again to barbulelsharnak he was just starting he said he did not hear it queen oh send for him here attendant he is gone your majesty queen overtake him quick overtake him tharmia i wish that i were going back to barbulelsharnak arolind o to be again at the centre of the world tharmia were we not talking of the golden hall arolind ah yes how lovely it was how beautiful it was when the king was there and strange musicians came from the heathen lands with huge plumes in their hair and played on instruments that we did not know tharmia the queen was better then the music eased her arolind this lute player is making her quite mad tharmia well well no wonder he has a mournful sound listen arolind do not let us listen it makes me feel cold tharmia he cannot play like nagra or dear trehannion it is because we have heard trehannion that we do not like to listen arolind i do not like to listen because i feel cold tharmia we feel cold because the queen has opened the casement find the man that is playing the lute and give him this and let him cease to play upon his lute ichtharion hark he is playing still king karnos yes we all hear him it is only a man to another or same attendant let him stop playing attendant yes your majesty attendant this is the man that does not hear the lute king karnos ah you are deaf then are you not man no your majesty king karnos you hear me clearly man yes your majesty king karnos listen now you hear the lute man no your majesty king karnos who sent you to barbulelsharnak man the captain of the camelguard sent me your majesty king karnos then go and never return you are deaf and also a fool the queen will not sleep to another the queen will not sleep bring music bring music quickly the queen will not sleep the man bows low and departs he says farewell to a sentry the queen leans from the casement muttering music heard off queen ah that is earthly music but of that other tune i have a fear king karnos we have all heard it comfort yourself calm yourself queen one man does not hear it king karnos but he has gone away we all hear it now queen i wish that i could see him king karnos a man is a small thing and the night very large and full of wonders you may well not see him queen i should like to see him why cannot i see him king karnos i have sent the camelguard to search for him and to stop him playing his lute do not let the queen know about this prophecy she would think i do not know what she would think ichtharion no your majesty king karnos the queen has a very special fear of the gods ichtharion yes your majesty queen you speak of me king karnos o no we speak of the gods queen o do not speak of the gods the gods are very terrible all the dooms that shall ever be come forth from the gods in misty windings of the wandering hills they forge the future even as on an anvil the future frightens me king karnos call the queens maidens send quickly for her maidens do not let the future frighten you queen men laugh at the gods they often laugh at the gods i am more sure that the gods laugh too it is dreadful to think of the laughter of the gods o the lute the lute how clearly i hear the lute but you all hear it do you not you swear that you all hear it king karnos yes yes we all hear the lute it is only a man playing queen i wish i could see him then i should know that he was only a man and not gogowza most terrible of the gods i should be able to sleep then king karnos yes yes here comes the man that i have sent to find him you have found the lute player tell the queen that you have found the lute player attendant the camelguard have searched your majesty and cannot find any man that is playing a lute act iii tharmia we have done too much we have done too much our husbands will be put to death the prophet will betray them and they will be put to death arolind o what shall we do tharmia it would have been better for us to have been clothed with rags than to bring our husbands to death by what we have done arolind we have done much and we have angered a king and who knows we may have angered even the gods tharmia even the gods we are become like helen when my mother was a child she saw here once she says she was the quietest and gentlest of creatures and wished only to be loved and yet because of her there was a war for four or five years at troy and the city was burned which had remarkable towers and some of the gods of the greeks took her side my mother says and some she says were against her and they quarrelled upon olympus where they live and all because of helen arolind o dont dont it frightens me i only want to be prettily dressed and see my husband happy tharmia have you seen the prophet arolind oh yes i have seen him he walks about the palace he is free but cannot escape tharmia what does he look like has he a frightened look arolind he mutters as he walks sometimes he weeps and then he puts his cloak over his face tharmia i fear that he will betray them arolind i do not trust a prophet he is the gobetween of gods and men they are so far apart how can he be true to both tharmia this prophet is false to the gods it is a hateful thing for a prophet to prophesy falsely prophet the gods have spoken a lie the gods have spoken a lie can all their vengeance ever atone for this tharmia he spoke of vengeance arolind o he will betray them queen why do you weep ah you are going to die you heard the deathlute you do well to weep tharmia no your majesty it is the man that has played for the last three days we all heard him queen three days yes it is three days gogowza plays no longer than three days gogowza grows weary then he has given his message and he will go away tharmia we have all heard him your majesty except the deaf young man that went back to barbulelsharnak we hear him now queen yes but nobody has seen him yet my maidens have searched for him but they have not found him tharmia your majesty my husband heard him and ludibras and while they live we know there is nothing to fear if the king grew angry with them because of any idle story that some jealous man might tell some criminal wishing to postpone his punishment if the king were to grow angry with them they would open their veins they would never survive his anger then we should all of us say perhaps it was gogowza that ichtharion or ludibras heard queen the king will never grow angry with ichtharion or ludibras tharmia your majesty would not sleep if the king grew angry with them queen oh no i should not sleep it would be terrible tharmia your majesty would be wakeful all night long and cry queen oh yes i should not sleep i should cry all night arolind she has no influence with the king tharmia no but he hates to hear her cry all night i am sure that the prophet will betray you but we have spoken to the queen we have told her it would be dreadful if the king were to grow angry with you and she things she will cry all night if he is angry ichtharion poor frightened brain how strong are little fancies she should be a beautiful queen but she goes about white and crying in fear of the gods the gods that are no more than shadows in the moonlight mans fear rises weird and large in all this mystery and makes a shadow of himself upon the ground and man jumps and says the gods why they are less than shadows we have seen shadows we have not seen the gods tharmia o do not speak like that there used to be gods they overthrew bleth dreadfully and if they still live on in the dark of the hills why they might hear your words ichtharion why you grow frightened too do not be frightened we will go and speak with the prophet while you follow the queen be much with her and do not let her forget that she will cry if the king should be angry with us arolind i am almost afraid when i am with the queen i do not like to be with her tharmia she could not hurt us she is afraid of all things arolind she makes me have huge fears of prodigious things ludibras the prophet is coming this way ichtharion sit down we must speak with him he will betray us ludibras why should the prophet betray us ichtharion because the guilt of the false prophecy is not his guilt it is ours and the king may spare him if he tells him that again he mutters of vengeance as he walks many have told me ludibras the king will not spare him even if he betrays us it was he that spoke the false prophecy to the king ichtharion the king does not in his heart believe in the gods it is for cheating him that the prophet is to die but if he knows we had planned it ludibras what can we say to the prophet ichtharion why we can say nothing but we can learn what he will do from what he says to us ludibras here he is we must remember everything that he says ichtharion watch his eyes ichtharion and ludibras the gods are good voiceofthegods they are benignant ichtharion i am much to blame i am very much to blame ludibras we trust that the king will relent ichtharion he often relents at sunset he looks out over the orchids in the evening they are very beautiful then and if he is angry his anger passes away just when the cool breeze comes at the set of sun ludibras he is sure to relent at sunset ichtharion do not be angry i am indeed to blame do not be angry voiceofthegods i do not wish the king to relent at sunset ichtharion do not be angry voiceofthegods it hath been said of old that the gods cannot lie it is written and hath been said i have plotted with you and i have made them lie for my voice is the voice of the gods ludibras we hope that the king will pardon you voiceofthegods i wish to die ichtharion no no we will pray the king to pardon you voiceofthegods i wish to die ludibras no no voiceofthegods because of me the holy gods have lied they that have spoken sooth through a thousand prophets because of me they have lied they will be proudly silent for evermore and inspire no prophet again and the nations will wander blindly and fall unwarned to their doom or stray away and be lost in unchronicled time or though they should speak again yet how shall man believe them i have brought a bane upon the generations that have not yet known the world ichtharion no no do not say that voiceofthegods and my name shall be a curse upon the lips of many nations crowding to their doom ichtharion do not be unhappy all men must die but to die unhappy voiceofthegods i have betrayed the gods who spake by me ichtharion do not be unhappy voiceofthegods i say to you that i have betrayed the gods ichtharion listen to me do not be so unhappy there are no gods everybody knows that there are no gods the king knows it voiceofthegods you have heard their prophet lie and believe that the gods are dead ludibras there are indeed no gods it is well known voiceofthegods there are gods and they have a vengeance even for you listen and i will tell you what it shall be aye and for you also listen no no they are silent in the gloom of the hills they have not spoken to me since i lied ichtharion you are right the gods will punish us it is natural that they should not speak just now but they will certainly punish us it is not therefore necessary for any man to avenge himself upon us even though there were any cause voiceofthegods it is not necessary ichtharion indeed it might even further anger the gods if a man should be before them to punish us voiceofthegods they are swift no man outruns them ludibras a man would be rash to attempt to voiceofthegods the sun is falling low i will leave you now for i have ever loved the sun at evening i go to watch it drop through the gilded clouds and make a wonder of familiar things after the sunset night and after an evil deed the vengeance of the gods ludibras he really believes in the gods ichtharion he is as mad as the queen we must humour his madness if we ever see him more i think that all will be well an executioner steals after the prophet he is dressed in crimson satin to the knees he wears a leather belt and carries the axe of his trade ludibras his voice was angry as he went away i fear he may yet betray us ichtharion it is not likely he thinks that the gods will punish us ludibras how long will he think so the queens fancies change thrice an hour ichtharion the executioner keeps very close to him now he comes closer every hour there is not much time for him to change his fancies ludibras he has the will to betray us if that fancy leaves him ichtharion the executioner is very eager for him he invented a new stroke lately but he has not had a man since we came to thek ludibras i do not like an eager executioner the king sees him and it makes him think ichtharion look how low the sun is he has no time to betray us the king is not yet here ludibras he is coming ichtharion but the prophet is not here ludibras no he is not yet come king karnos the queens maidens have persuaded her that there is nothing to fear they are quite excellent they shall dance before me the queen will sleep they are quite excellent ah ichtharion come to me ichtharion ludibras why does the king send for you king karnos you were wrong ichtharion ichtharion your majesty king karnos you were wrong to think that thek is not very lovely ichtharion yes i was wrong and i am much to blame king karnos yes it is very beautiful at evening i will watch them go down over the orchids i will never see barbulelsharnak any more i will sit and watch the sun go down on the orchids till it is gone and all their colours fade ichtharion it is very beautiful now how still it is i have never seen so still a sunset before king karnos it is like a picture done by a dying painter full of a beautiful colour even if all these orchids died tonight yet their beauty is an indestructible memory ludibras the prophet is coming this way ichtharion your majesty the prophet walks about in the palace and the executioner is close behind him if the queen saw him and the executioner would it not trouble her were it not better that he should be killed at once shall i whistle for the executioner king karnos not now i said at sunset ichtharion your majesty it is merciful to kill a man before the set of the sun for it is natural in a man to love the sun but to see it set and to know that it will not come again is even a second death it would be merciful to kill him now king karnos i have said at sunset it were unjust to kill him before his prophecy is proven false ichtharion but your majesty we know that it is false he also knows it king karnos he shall die at sunset ludibras your majesty the prophet will pray for life if he is not killed now it would be pity to grant it king karnos is not a kings word death i have said he shall die at sunset enter prophet the executioner creeps along close behind him voiceofthegods o the gods are about to have lied the gods will have lied i have prophesied falsely and the gods will have lied my death cannot atone for it nor the punishment of others ichtharion he will betray us yet voiceofthegods o why did you let your voice come through my lips o why did you allow your voice to lie for centuries it has been said from city to city the gods cannot lie the nomads have known it out upon the plains the mountaineers have known it near the dawn that is all over now o king let me die at once for i have prophesied falsely and at sunset the gods will lie king karnos it is not sunset yet no doubt you have spoken truly how well the queen looks her maidens are quite excellent ludibras there is something a little dreadful in seeing the queen so calm she is like a windless sunset in the winter before a hurricane comes and the snow swirls up before it over the world ichtharion i do not like calm sunsets they make me think that something is going to happen yes the queen is very quiet she will sleep tonight queen i am not frightened any longer all the wild fancies of my brain have left it i have often troubled you with little fears now they are all at rest and i am afraid no longer king karnos that is good i am very glad you will sleep tonight queen sleep why yes i shall sleep o yes we shall all sleep king karnos your maidens have told you that there is nothing to fear queen nothing to fear no no more little fears to trouble me king karnos they have told you there is nothing at all to fear indeed there is nothing queen no more little fears there is one great fear king karnos a great fear why what is it queen i must not say for you have often soothed me when i was frightened and it were not well for me to trouble you at the last king karnos what is your fear shall i send again for your maidens queen no it is not my fear it is all mens fear if they knew king karnos ah you have seen my man in red i will send him away i will queen no no my fear is not earthly i am not afraid of little things any more king karnos why what is it then queen i do not quite know but you know how i have ever feared the gods the gods are going to do some dreadful thing king karnos believe me the gods do nothing nowadays queen you have indeed been very good to me it seems a little while since the camels came to argunzeerith by the iris marshes the camels with the goldhung palanquin and the bells above their heads high up in the air the silver bridal bells it seems a very little while ago i did not know how swift the end would come king karnos what end to whom is the end coming queen do not be troubled we should not let fate trouble us the world and its daily cares ah they are frightful but fate i smile at fate fate cannot hurt us if we smile at it king karnos what end do you say is coming queen i do not know something that has been shall soon be no more king karnos no no look upon thek it is built of rock and our palace is all of marble time has not scratched it with six centuries six tearing centuries with all their claws we are throned on gold and founded upon marble death will some day find me indeed but i am young sire after sire of mine has died in barbulelsharnak or in thek but has left our dynasty laughing sheer in the face of time from over these ageold walls queen say farewell to me now lest something happen king karnos no no we will not say unhappy things executioner the sun has set king karnos not yet the jungle hides it it is not yet set look at the beautiful light upon the orchids for how long they have flashed their purple on the gleaming walls of thek for how long they will flash there on our immortal palace immortal in marble and immortal in song ah how the colour changes to the executioner the sun is set take him away to the queen it is he whose end you foresaw voiceofthegods the gods have lied king karnos the jungle is sinking it has fallen into the earth the city is falling in the houses are rolling towards us ichtharion they are coming up like a wave and darkness is coming with them loud and prolonged thunder flashes of red light and then total darkness a little light comes back showing recumbent figures shattered pillars and rocks of white marble the prophets back is broken but he raises the forepart of his body for a moment voiceofthegods they have not lied ichtharion o i am killed some one is laughing laughing even in thek why the whole city is shattered what is that dreadful sound voiceofthegods it is the laughter of the gods that cannot lie going back to their hills the queens enemies by lord dunsany dramatis personae the queen ackazarpses her handmaid prince rhadamandaspes prince zophernes the priest of horus the kings of the four countries the twin dukes
