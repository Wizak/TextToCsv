dirtcaked face replied he was scanning the quartet of young men whod cornered him with rodents eyes the tunnel where theyd found him relieving himself was far from hope of help they all knew it and so it seemed did he i dont know what youre talking about youve been showing yourself to children red said the man shook his head a dribble of spittle running from his lip into the matted bush of his beard ive done nothing he insisted brendan sauntered across to the man heavy footsteps hollow in the tunnel whats your name he inquired with deceptive courtesy though he lacked reds height and commanding manner the scar that inscribed brendans cheek from temple to jaw line suggested he knew suffering both in the giving and the receiving name he demanded im not going to ask you again pope the old man muttered mr pope brendan grinned mr pope he said well we heard youve been exposing that rancid little prick of yours to innocent children what do you say to that no pope replied again shaking his head thats not true i never done nothing like that when he frowned the filth on his face cracked like crazy paving a second skin of grime which was the accrual of many months had it not been for the fragrance of alcohol off him which obscured the worst of his bodily stench it would have been nigh on impossible to stand within a yard of him the man was human refuse a shame to his species why bother with him karney said he stinks red glanced over his shoulder to silence the interruption at seventeen karney was the youngest and in the quartets unspoken hierarchy scarcely deserving of an opinion recognizing his error he shut up leaving red to return his attention to the vagrant he pushed pope back against the wall of the tunnel the old man expelled a cry as he struck the concrete it echoed back and forth karney knowing from past experience how the scene would go from here moved away and studied a gilded cloud of gnats on the edge of the tunnel though he enjoyed being with red and the other twothe camaraderie the petty larceny the drinkingthis particular game had never been much to his taste he couldnt see the sport in finding some drunken wreck of a man like pope and beating what little sense was left in his deranged head out of him it made karney feel dirty and he wanted no part of it red pulled pope off the wall and spat a stream of abuse into the mans face then when he failed to get an adequate response threw him back against the tunnel a second time more forcibly than the first following through by taking the breathless man by both lapels and shaking him until he rattled pope threw a panicky glance up and down the track a railway had once run along this route through highgate and finsbury park the track was long gone however and the site was public parkland popular with early morning joggers and lateevening lovers now in the middle of a clammy afternoon the track was deserted in both directions hey said catso dont break his bottles right said brendan we should dig out the drink before we break his head at the mention of being robbed of his liquor pope began to struggle but his thrashing only served to enrage his captor red was in a dirty mood the day like most days this indian summer had been sticky and dull only the dogend of a wasted season to endure nothing to do and no money to spend some entertainment had been called for and it had fallen to red as lion and pope as christian to supply it youll get hurt if you struggle red advised the man we only want to see what youve got in your pockets none of your business pope retorted and for a moment he spoke as a man who had once been used to being obeyed the outburst made karney turn from the gnats and gaze at popes emaciated face nameless degeneracies had drained it of dignity or vigor but something remained there glimmering beneath the dirt what had the man been karney wondered a banker perhaps a judge now lost to the law forever catso had now stepped into the fray to search popes clothes while red held his prisoner against the tunnel wall by the throat pope fought off catsos unwelcome attentions as best he could his arms flailing like windmills his eyes getting progressively wilder dont fight karney willed him itll be worse for you if you do but the old man seemed to be on the verge of panic he was letting out small grunts of protest that were more animal than human somebody hold his arms catso said ducking beneath popes attack brendan grabbed hold of popes wrists and wrenched the mans arms up above his head to facilitate an easier search even now with any hope of release dashed pope continued to squirm he managed to land a solid kick to reds left shin for which he received a blow in return blood broke from his nose and ran down into his mouth there was more color where that came from karney knew hed seen pictures aplenty of spilled peoplebright gleaming coils of guts yellow fat and purple lungsall that brilliance was locked up in the gray sack of popes body why such a thought should occur to him karney wasnt certain it distressed him and he tried to turn his attention back to the gnats but pope demanded his attention loosing a cry of anguish as catso ripped open one of his several waistcoats to get to the lower layers bastards pope screeched not seeming to care that his insults would inevitably earn him further blows take your shifting hands off me or ill have you dead all of you i reds fist brought an end to the threats and blood came running after blood pope spat it back at his tormentor dont tempt me pope said his voice dropping to a murmur i warn you you smell like a dead dog brendan said is that what you are a dead dog pope didnt grant him a reply his eyes were on catso who was systematically emptying the coat and waistcoat pockets and tossing a pathetic collection of keepsakes into the dust on the tunnel floor karney red snapped look through the stuff will you see if theres anything worth having karney stared at the plastic trinkets and the soiled ribbons at the tattered sheets of paper and the winebottle corks its all trash he said look anyway red instructed could be money wrapped in that stuff karney made no move to comply look damn you reluctantly karney went down on his haunches and proceeded to sift through the mound of rubbish catso was still depositing in the dirt he could see at a glance that there was nothing of value there though perhaps some of the itemsthe battered photographs the all but indecipherable notesmight offer some clue to the man pope had been before drink and incipient lunacy had driven the memories away curious as he was karney wished to respect popes privacy it was all the man had left theres nothing here he announced after a cursory examination but catso hadnt finished his search the deeper he dug the more layers of filthy clothing presented themselves to his eager hands pope had more pockets than a master magician karney glanced up from the forlorn heap of belongings and found to his discomfort that popes eyes were on him the old man exhausted and beaten had given up his protests he looked pitiful karney opened his hands to signify that he had taken nothing from the heap pope by way of reply offered a tiny nod got it catso yelled triumphantly got the fucker and pulled a bottle of vodka from one of the pockets pope was either too feeble to notice that his alcohol supply had been snatched or too tired to care whichever way he made no sound of complaint as the liquor was stolen from him any more brendan wanted to know hed begun to giggle a highpitched laugh that signaled his escalating excitement maybe the dogs got more where that came from he said letting popes hands fall and pushing catso aside the latter made no objection to the treatment he had his bottle and was satisfied he smashed off the neck to avoid contamination and began to drink squatting in the dirt red relinquished his grip on pope now that brendan had taken charge he was clearly bored with the game brendan on the other hand was just beginning to get a taste for it red walked over to karney and turned over the pile of popes belongings with the toe of his boot fucking washout he stated without feeling yeah karney said hoping that reds disaffection would signal an end to the old mans humiliation but red had thrown the bone to brendan and he knew better than to try and snatch it back karney had seen brendans capacity for violence before and he had no desire to watch the man at work again sighing he stood up and turned his back on brendans activities the echoes off the tunnels wall were all too eloquent however a mingling of punches and breathless obscenities on past evidence nothing would stop brendan until his fury was spent anyone foolish enough to interrupt him would find themselves victims in their turn red had sauntered across to the far side of the tunnel lit a cigarette and was watching the punishment meted out with casual interest karney glanced around at catso he had descended from squatting to sitting in the dirt the bottle of vodka between his outstretched legs he was grinning to himself deaf to the drool of pleas falling from popes broken mouth karney felt sick to his stomach more to divert his attention from the beating than out of genuine interest he returned to the junk filched from popes pockets and turned it over picking up one of the photographs to examine it was of a child though it was impossible to make any guess as to family resemblance popes face was now barely recognizable one eye had already begun to close as the bruise around it swelled karney tossed the photograph back with the rest of the mementoes as he did so he caught sight of a length of knotted cord which he had previously passed over he glanced back up at pope the puffed eye was closed the other seemed sightless satisfied that he wasnt being watched karney pulled the string from where it lay coiled like a snake in its nest among the trash knots fascinated him and always had though he had never possessed skill with academic puzzles he had always had a taste for more tangible riddles given a knot a jigsaw or a railway timetable he was happily lost to himself for hours the interest went back to his childhood which had been solitary with neither father nor siblings to engage his attention what better companion than a puzzle he turned the string over and over examining the three knots set at inch intervals in the middle of its length they were large and asymmetrical and seemed to serve no discernible purpose except perhaps to infatuate minds like his own how else to explain their cunning construction except that the knotter had been at pains to create a problem that was well nigh insoluble he let his fingers play over the surfaces of the knots instinctively seeking some latitude but they had been so brilliantly contrived that no needle however fine could have been pushed between the intersected strands the challenge they presented was too appealing to ignore again he glanced up at the old man brendan had apparently tired of his labors as karney looked on he threw the old man against the tunnel wall and let the body sink to the ground once there he let it lie an unmistakable sewer stench rose from it that was good brendan pronounced like a man who had stepped from an invigorating shower the exercise had raised a sheen of sweat on his ruddy features he was smiling from ear to ear give me some of that vodka catso all gone catso slurred upending the bottle wasnt more than a throatful in it youre a lying shit brendan told him still grinning what if i am catso replied and tossed the empty bottle away it smashed help me up he requested of brendan the latter his great good humor intact helped catso to his feet red had already started to walk out of the tunnel the others followed hey karney catso said over his shoulder you coming sure you want to kiss the dog better brendan suggested catso was almost sick with laughter at the remark karney made no answer he stood up his eyes glued to the inert figure slumped on the tunnel floor watching for a flicker of consciousness there was none that he could see he glanced after the others all three had their backs to him as they made their way down the track swiftly karney pocketed the knots the theft took moments only once the cord was safely out of sight he felt a surge of triumph which was out of all proportion to the goods hed gained he was already anticipating the hours of amusement the knots would furnish time when he could forget himself and his emptiness forget the sterile summer and the loveless winter ahead forget too the old man lying in his own waste yards from where he stood karney catso called karney turned his back on pope and began to walk away from the body and the attendant litter of belongings a few paces from the edge of the tunnel the old man behind him began to mutter in his delirium the words were incomprehensible but by some acoustic trick the walls of the tunnel multiplied the sound popes voice was thrown back and forth and back again filling the tunnel with whispers it wasnt until much later that night when he was sitting alone in his bedroom with his mother weeping in her sleep next door that karney had the opportunity to study the knots at leisure he had said nothing to red or the others about his stealing the cord the theft was so minor they would have mocked him for mentioning it and besides the knots offered him a personal challenge one which he would faceand conceivably failin private after some debate with himself he elected the knot he would first attempt and began to work at it almost immediately he lost all sense of time passing the problem engrossed him utterly hours of blissful frustration passed unnoticed as he analyzed the tangle looking for some clue as to a hidden system in the knotting he could find none the configurations if they had some rationale were beyond him all he could hope to do was tackle the problem by trial and error dawn was threatening to bring the world to light again when he finally relinquished the cord to snatch a few hours of sleep and in a nights work he had merely managed to loosen a tiny fraction of the knot over the next four days the problem became an idee fixe a hermetic obsession to which he would return at any available opportunity picking at the knot with fingers that were increasingly numb with use the puzzle enthralled him as little in his adult life ever had working at the knot he was deaf and blind to the outside world sitting in his lamplit room by night or in the park by day he could almost feel himself drawn into its snarled heart his consciousness focused so minutely it could go where light could not but despite his persistence the unraveling proved a slow business unlike most knots he had encountered which once loosened in part conceded the entire solution this structure was so adroitly designed that prising one element loose only served to constrict and tighten another the trick he began to grasp was to work on all sides of the knot at an equal rate loosening one part a fraction then moving around to loosen another to an equal degree and so on this systematic rotation though tedious gradually showed results he saw nothing of red brendan or catso in this time their silence suggested that they mourned his absence as little as he mourned theirs he was surprised therefore when catso turned up looking for him on friday evening he had come with a proposal he and brendan had found a house ripe for robbery and wanted karney as lookout man he had fulfilled that role twice in the past both had been small breaking and entering jobs like this which on the first occasion had netted a number of salable items of jewelry and on the second several hundred pounds in cash this time however the job was to be done without reds involvement he was increasingly taken up with anelisa and she according to catso had made him swear off petty theft and save his talents for something more ambitious karney sensed that catsoand brendan too most likelywas itching to prove his criminal proficiency without red the house they had chosen was an easy target so catso claimed and karney would be a damn fool to let a chance of such easy pickings pass by he nodded along with catsos enthusiasm his mind on other pickings when catso finally finished his spiel karney agreed to the job not for the money but because saying yes would get him back to the knot soonest much later that evening at catsos suggestion they met to look at the site of the proposed job the location certainly suggested an easy take karney had often walked over the bridge that carried hornsey lane across the archway road but he had never noticed the steep footpathpart steps part trackthat ran from the side of the bridge down to the road below its entrance was narrow and easily overlooked and its meandering length was lit by only one lamp which light was obscured by trees growing in the gardens that backed on to the pathway it was these gardenstheir back fences easily scaled or wrenched downthat offered such perfect access to the houses a thief using the secluded footpath might come and go with impunity unseen by travelers on either the road above or that below all the setup required was a lookout on the pathway to warn of the occasional pedestrian who might use the footpath this would be karneys duty the following night was a thiefs joy cool but not cold cloudy but without rain they met on highgate hill at the gates of the church of the passionist fathers and from there made their way down to the archway road approaching the pathway from the top end would brendan had argued attract more attention police patrols were more common on hornsey lane in part because the bridge was irresistible to local depressives for the committed suicide the venue had distinct advantages its chief appeal being that if the eightyfoot drop didnt kill you the juggernauts hurtling south on the archway road certainly would brendan was on another high tonight pleased to be leading the others instead of taking second place to red his talk was an excitable babble mostly about women karney let catso have pride of place beside brendan and hung back a few paces his hand in his jacket pocket where the knots were waiting in the last few hours fatigued by so many sleepless nights the cord had begun to play tricks on karneys eyes on occasion it had even seemed to move in his hand as though it were working itself loose from the inside even now as they approached the pathway he could seem to feel it shift against his palm hey man look at that catso was pointing up the pathway its full length was in darkness someone killed the lamp keep your voice down brendan told him and led the way up the path it was not in total darkness a vestige of illumination was thrown up from the archway road but filtered as it was through a dense mass of shrubbery the path was still virtually benighted karney could scarcely see his hands in front of his face but the darkness would presumably dissuade all but the most surefooted of pedestrians from using the path when they climbed a little more than halfway up brendan brought the tiny party to a halt this is the house he announced are you sure catso said i counted the gardens this is the one the fence that bounded the bottom of the garden was in an advanced state of disrepair it took only a brief manhandling from brendanthe sound masked by the roar of a latenight juggernaut on the tarmac belowto afford them easy access brendan pushed through the thicket of brambles growing wild at the end of the garden and catso followed cursing as he was scratched brendan silenced him with a second curse then turned back to karney were going in well whistle twice when were out of the house you remember the signals hes not an imbecile are you karney hell be all right now are we going or not brendan said no more the two figures navigated the brambles and made their way up into the garden proper once on the lawn and out of the shadows of the trees they were visible as gray shapes against the house karney watched them advance to the back door heard a noise from the back door as catsomuch the more nimblefingered of the twoforced the lock then the duo slid into the interior of the house he was alone not quite alone he still had his companions on the cord he checked up and down the pathway his eyes gradually becoming sharper in the sodiumtinted gloom there were no pedestrians satisfied he pulled the knots from his pockets his hands were ghosts in front of him he could hardly see the knots at all but almost without his conscious intention guiding them his fingers began to take up their investigation afresh and odd though it seemed he made more impression on the problem in a few seconds of blind manipulation than he had in many of the hours preceding robbed of his eyes he went purely on instinct and it worked wonders again he had the bewildering sensation of intentionality in the knot as if more and more it was an agent in its own undoing encouraged by the tang of victory his fingers slid over the knot with inspired accuracy seeming to alight upon precisely the right threads to manipulate he glanced again along the pathway to be certain it was still empty then looked back toward the house the door remained open there was no sign of either catso or brendan however he returned his attention to the problem in hand he almost wanted to laugh at the ease with which the knot was suddenly slipping undone his eyes sparked by his mounting excitement perhaps had begun to play a startling trick flashes of colorrare unnamable tintswere igniting in front of him their origins the heart of the knot the light caught his fingers as they worked by it his flesh became translucent he could see his nerve endings bright with newfound sensibility the rods of his finger bones visible to the marrow then almost as suddenly as they flickered into being the colors would die leaving his eyes bewitched in darkness until once more they ignited his heart began to hammer in his ears the knot he sensed was mere seconds from solution the interwoven threads were positively springing apart his fingers were the cords playthings now not the other way about he opened loops to feed the other two knots through he pulled he pushed all at the cords behest and now colors came again but this time his fingers were invisible and instead he could see something glowing in the last few hitches of the knot the form writhed like a fish in a net growing bigger with every stitch he cast off the hammer in his head doubled in tempo the air around him had become almost glutinous as if he were immersed in mud someone whistled he knew the signal should have carried some significance for him but he couldnt recall what there were too many distractions the thickening air his pounding head the knot untying itself in his helpless hand while the figure at its centersinuous glitteringraged and swelled the whistle came again this time its urgency shook him from his trance he looked up brendan was already crossing the garden with catso trailing a few yards behind karney had a moment only to register their appearance before the knot initiated the final phase of its resolution the last weave fell free and the form at its heart leaped up toward karneys facegrowing at an exponential rate he flung himself backward to avoid losing his head and the thing shot past him shocked he stumbled in the tangle of brambles and fell in a bed of thorns above his head the foliage was shaking as if in a high wind leaves and small twigs showered down around him he stared up into the branches to try and catch sight of the shape but it was already out of sight why didnt you answer me you fucking idiot brendan demanded we thought youd split on us karney had barely registered brendans breathless arrival he was still searching the canopy of the trees above his head the reek of cold mud filled his nostrils youd better move yourself brendan said climbing through the broken fence and out on to the pathway karney struggled to get to his feet but the barbs of the brambles slowed his attempt catching in his hair and clothes shit he heard brendan breathe from the far side of the fence police on the bridge catso had reached the bottom of the garden what are you doing down there he asked karney karney raised his hand help me he said catso grabbed him by the wrist but even as he did so brendan hissed police move it and catso relinquished his aid and ducked out through the fence to follow brendan down to the archway road it took karney a few dizzied seconds only to realize that the cord with its two remaining knots had gone from his hand he hadnt dropped it he was certain of that more likely it had deliberately deserted him and its only opportunity had been his brief handtohand contact with catso he reached out to grasp hold of the rotting fence and haul himself to his feet catso had to be warned of what the cord had done police or no police there was worse than the law nearby racing down the pathway catso was not even aware that the knots had found their surreptitious way into his hand he was too preoccupied with the problem of escape brendan had already disappeared on to the archway road and was away catso chanced a look over his shoulder to see if the police were in pursuit there was no sign of them however even if they began to give chase now he reasoned they wouldnt catch him that left karney catso slowed his pace then stopped looking back up the pathway to see if the idiot showed any sign of following but he had not so much as climbed through the fence damn him catso said beneath his breath perhaps he should retrace his steps and fetch him as he hesitated on the darkened pathway he became aware that what he had taken to be a gusty wind in the overhanging trees had abruptly died away the sudden silence mystified him he drew his gaze from the path to look up into the canopy of branches and his appalled eyes focused on the shape that was crawling down toward him bringing with it the reek of mud and dissolution slowly as in a dream he raised his hands to keep the creature from touching him but it reached down with wet icy limbs and snatched him up karney in the act of climbing through the fence caught sight of catso being hauled off his feet and into the cover of the trees saw his legs pedaling the air while stolen merchandise fell from his pockets and skipped down the pathway toward the archway road then catso shrieked and his dangling legs began an even more frenzied motion at the top of the pathway karney heard somebody calling one policeman to another he surmised the next moment he heard the sound of running feet he glanced up to hornsey lanethe officers had yet to reach the top of the pathwayand then looked back down in catsos direction in time to catch sight of his body dropping from the tree it fell to the ground limply but the next moment scrambled to its feet briefly catso looked back up the pathway toward karney the look on his face even in the sodium gloom was a lunatics look then he began to run karney satisfied that catso had a head start slipped back through the fence as the two policemen appeared at the head of the pathway and began in pursuit of catso all thisthe knot the thieves pursuit shriek and allhad occupied a mere handful of seconds during which karney had not drawn breath now he lay on a barbed pillow of brambles and gasped like a landed fish while at the other side of the fence the police hurtled down the footpath yelling after their suspect catso scarcely heard their commands it wasnt the police that he was running from it was the muddied thing that had lifted him up to meet its slitted and chancred face now as he reached the archway road he felt tremors beginning in his limbs if his legs gave out he was certain it would come for him again and lay its mouth on his as it already had only this time he would not have the strength to scream the life would be sucked from his lungs his only hope lay in putting the road between him and his tormentor the beasts breath loud in his ears he scaled the crash barrier leaped down to the road and began across the southbound freeway at a run halfway across he realized his error the horror in his head had blinded him to all other risks a blue volvoits drivers mouth a perfect bore down on him he was caught in its headlights like an animal entranced two instants later he was struck a glancing blow which threw him across the divide and into the path of a tractor trailer the second driver had no chance to swerve the impact split catso open and tossed him beneath the wheels up in the garden karney heard the panic of the brakes and the policeman at the bottom of the pathway say jesus christ almighty he waited a few seconds then peered out from his hiding place the footpath was now deserted top to bottom the trees were quite still from the road below rose the sound of a siren and that of the officers shouting for oncoming cars to halt closer by somebody was sobbing he listened intently for a few moments trying to work out the source of the sobs before realizing that they were his own tears or no the clamor from below demanded his attention something terrible had happened and he had to see what but he was afraid to run the gauntlet of the trees knowing what lay in wait there so he stood staring up into the branches trying to locate the beast there was neither sound nor movement however the trees were dead still stifling his fears he climbed from his hiding place and began to walk down the pathway his eyes glued to the foliage for the slightest sign of the beasts presence he could hear the buzz of a gathering crowd the thought of a press of people comforted him from now on he would need a place to hide wouldnt he men whod seen miracles did he had reached the spot where catso had been dragged up into the trees a litter of leaves and stolen property marked it karneys feet wanted to be swift to pick him up and whisk him away from the place but some perverse instinct slowed his pace was it that he wanted to tempt the knots child into showing its face better perhaps to confront it nowin all its foulnessthan to jive in fear from this moment on embroidering its countenance and its capacities but the beast kept itself hidden if indeed it was still up there in the tree it twitched not a nail something moved beneath his foot karney looked down and there almost lost among the leaves was the cord catso had been deemed unworthy to carry it apparently nowwith some clue to its power revealedit made no effort to pass for natural it squirmed on the gravel like a serpent in heat rearing its knotted head to attract karneys attention he wanted to ignore its cavorting but he couldnt he knew that if he didnt pick up the knots somebody else would given time a victim like himself of an urge to solve enigmas where could such innocence lead except to another escape perhaps more terrible than the first no it was best that he took the knots at least he was alive to their potential and so in part armored against it he bent down and as he did so the string fairly leaped into his hands wrapping itself around his fingers so tightly he almost cried out bastard he said the string coiled itself around his hand weaving its length between his fingers in an ecstasy of welcome he raised his hand to watch its performance better his concern for the events on the archway road had suddenly almost miraculously evaporated what did such petty concerns matter it was only life and death better to make his getaway now while he could above his head a branch shook he unglued his eyes from the knots and squinted up into the tree with the cord restored to him his trepidation like his fears had evaporated show yourself he said im not like catso im not afraid i want to know what you are from its camouflage of leaves the waiting beast leaned down toward karney and exhaled a single chilly breath it smelled of the river at low tide of vegetation gone to rot karney was about to ask it what it was again when he realized that the exhalation was the beasts reply all it could speak of its condition was contained in that bitter and rancid breath as replies went it was not lacking in eloquence distressed by the images it awoke karney backed away from the spot wounded sluggish forms moved behind his eyes engulfed in a sludge of filth a few feet from the tree the spell of the breath broke and karney drank the polluted air from the road as though it were clean as the worlds morning he turned his back on the agonies he had sensed thrust his stringwoven hand into his pocket and began up the pathway behind him the trees were quite still again several dozen spectators had gathered on the bridge to watch the proceedings below their presence had in turn piqued the curiosity of drivers making their way along hornsey lane some of whom had parked their vehicles and gotten out to join the throng the scene beneath the bridge seemed too remote to wake any feelings in karney he stood among the chattering crowd and gazed down quite dispassionately he recognized catsos corpse from his clothes little else remained of his sometime companion in a while he knew he would have to mourn but at present he could feel nothing after all catso was dead wasnt he his pain and confusion were at an end karney sensed he would be wiser to save his tears for those whose agonies were only just beginning and again the knots at home that night he tried to put them away but after the events of the evening they had taken on a fresh glamour the knots bound beasts how and why he couldnt know nor curiously did he much care at the moment all his life he had accepted that the world was rich with mysteries a mind of his limited grasp had no hope of understanding that was the only genuine lesson his schooldays had taught that he was ignorant this new imponderable was just another to tag onto a long list only one rationale really occurred to him and that was that somehow pope had arranged his stealing of the knots in the full knowledge that the loosened beast would revenge itself on the old mans tormentors and it wasnt to be until catsos cremation six days later that karney was to get some confirmation of that theory in the interim he kept his fears to himself reasoning that the less he said about the nights events the less harm they could do him talk lent the fantastic credibility it gave weight to phenomena which he hoped if left to themselves would become too frail to survive when the following day the police came to the house on a routine questioning of catsos friends he claimed he knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding the death brendan had done the same and as there had seemingly been no witnesses to offer contrary testimony karney was not questioned again instead he was left to his thoughts and the knots once he saw brendan he had expected recriminations brendans belief was that catso had been running from the police when he was killed and it had been karneys lack of concentration that had failed to alert them to the laws proximity but brendan made no accusations he had taken the burden of guilt onto himself with a willingness that almost smacked of appetite he spoke only of his own failure not of karneys the apparent arbitrariness of catsos demise had uncovered an unexpected tenderness in brendan and karney ached to tell him the whole incredible story from beginning to end but this was not the time he sensed he let brendan spill his hurt out and kept his own mouth shut and still the knots sometimes he would wake in the middle of the night and feel the cord moving beneath his pillow its presence was comforting its eagerness was not waking as it did a similar eagerness in him he wanted to touch the remaining knots and examine the puzzles they offered but he knew that to do so was tempting capitulation to his own fascination to their hunger for release when such temptation arose he forced himself to remember the pathway and the beast in the trees to awake again the harrowing thoughts that had come with the beasts breath then by degrees remembered distress would cancel present curiosity and he would leave the cord where it lay out of sight though seldom out of mind dangerous as he knew the knots to be he couldnt bring himself to burn them as long as he possessed that modest length of cord he was unique to relinquish it would be to return to his hitherto nondescript condition he was not willing to do that even though he suspected that his daily and intimate association with the cord was systematically weakening his ability to resist its seduction of the thing in the tree he saw nothing he even began to wonder if he hadnt imagined the whole confrontation indeed given time his powers to rationalize the truth into nonexistence might have won the day completely but events subsequent to the cremation of catso put an end to such a convenient option karney had gone to the service aloneand despite the presence of brendan red and anelisahe had left alone he had little wish to speak with any of the mourners whatever words he might once have had to frame the events were becoming more difficult to reinvent as time passed he hurried away from the crematorium before anyone could approach him to talk his head bowed against the dusty wind which had brought periods of cloud and bright sunshine in swift succession throughout the day as he walked he dug in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes the cord waiting there as ever welcomed his fingers in its usual ingratiating manner he disentangled it and took out the cigarettes but the wind was too snappy for matches to stay alight and his hands seemed unable to perform the simple task of masking the flame he wandered on a little way until he found an alley and stepped into it to light up pope was there waiting for him did you send flowers the derelict asked karneys instinct was to turn and run but the sunlit road was no more than yards away he was in no danger here and an exchange with the old man might prove informative no flowers pope said no flowers karney returned what are you doing here same as you pope replied came to see the boy burn he grinned the expression on that wretched grimy face was repulsive to a fault pope was still the bag of bones that hed been in the tunnel two weeks previously but now an air of threat hung about him karney was grateful to have the sun at his back and you to see you pope said karney chose to make no reply he struck a match and lit his cigarette youve got something that belongs to me pope said karney volunteered no guilt i want my knots back boy before you do some real damage dont know what youre talking about karney replied his gaze concentrated unwillingly on popes face drawn into its intricacies the alleyway with its piled refuse twitched a cloud had apparently drifted over the sun for karneys vision but for the figure of pope darkened subtly it was stupid boy to try and steal from me not that i wasnt easy prey that was my error and it wont happen again i get lonely sometimes you see im sure you understand and when im lonely i take to drinking though mere seconds had apparently passed since karney had lit his cigarette it had burned down to the filter without his taking a single pull on it he dropped it vaguely aware that time as well as space was being pulled out of true in the tiny passage it wasnt me he muttered a childs defense in the face of any and every accusation yes it was pope replied with incontestable authority lets not waste breath with fabrication you stole from me and your colleague has paid the price you cant undo the harm youve done but you can prevent further harm if you return to me whats mine now karneys hand had strayed to his pocket without his quite realizing it he wanted to get out of this trap before it snapped on him giving pope what was after all rightfully his was surely the easiest way to do it his fingers hesitated however why because the methuselahs eyes were so implacable perhaps because returning the knots into popes hands gave him total control over the weapon that had in effect killed catso but more even now with sanity at risk karney was loath to give back the only fragment of mystery that had ever come his way pope sensing his disinclination pressed his cajoling into a higher gear dont be afraid of me he said i wont do you any harm unless you push me to it i would much prefer that we concluded this matter peacefully more violence another death even would only attract attention is this a killer im looking at karney thought so unkempt so ridiculously feeble and yet sound contradicted sight the seed of command karney had once heard in popes voice was now in full flower do you want money pope asked is that it would your pride be best appeased if i offered you something for your troubles karney looked incredulously at popes shabbiness oh the old man said i may not look like a moneyed man but appearances can be deceptive in fact thats the rule not the exception take yourself for instance you dont look like a dead man but take it from me you are as good as dead boy i promise you death if you continue to defy me the speechso measured so scrupulousstartled karney coming as it did from popes lips two weeks ago they had caught pope in his cupsconfused and vulnerablebut now sober the man spoke like a potentate a lunatic king perhaps going among the hoi polloi as a pauper king no more like priest something in the nature of his authority suggested a man whose power had never been rooted in mere politics once more he said i request you to give me whats mine he took a step toward karney the alleyway was a narrow tunnel pressing down on their heads if there was sky above them pope had blinded it give me the knots he said his voice was softly reassuring the darkness had closed in completely all karney could see was the mans mouth his uneven teeth his gray tongue give them to me thief or suffer the consequences karney reds voice came from another world it was just a few paces awaythe voice sunlight windbut for a long moment karney struggled to locate it again karney he dragged his consciousness out from between popes teeth and forced his face around to look at the road red was there standing in the sun anelisa at his side her blond hair shone whats going on leave us alone pope said weve got business he and i youve got business with him red asked of karney before karney could reply pope said tell him tell him karney you want to speak to me alone red threw a glance over karneys shoulder toward the old man you want to tell me whats going on he said karneys tongue was laboring to find a response but failing the sunlight was so far away every time a cloudshadow passed across the street he feared the light would be extinguished permanently his lips worked silently to express his fear you all right red asked kamey can you hear me karney nodded the darkness that held him was beginning to lift yes he said suddenly pope threw himself at karney his hands scrabbling desperately for his pockets the impact of the attack carried karney still in a stupor back against the wall of the alleyway he fell sideways against a pile of crates they and he toppled over and pope his grip on karney too fierce to be dislodged fell too all the preceding calmthe gallows humor the circumspect threatshad evaporated he was again the idiot derelict spouting insanities karney felt the mans hands tearing at his clothes and raking his skin in his bid for the knots the words he was shouting into karneys face were no longer comprehensible red stepped into the alley and attempted to drag the old man by coat or hair or beard whichever handhold presented itself off his victim it was easier said than done the assault had all the fury of a fit but reds superior strength won out spitting nonsense pope was pulled to his feet red held on to him as if he were a mad dog get up he told karney get out of his reach karney staggered to his feet among the tinder of crates in the scant seconds of his attack pope had done considerable damage karney was bleeding in half a dozen places his clothes had been savaged his shirt ripped beyond repair tentatively he put his hand to his raked face the scratches were raised like ritual scars red pushed pope against the wall the derelict was still apoplectic eyes wild a stream of invectivea jumble of english and gibberishwas flung in reds face without pausing in his tirade pope made another attempt to attack karney but this time reds handhold prevented the claws from making contact red hauled pope out of the alley and into the road your lips bleeding anelisa said looking at karney with plain disgust karney could taste the blood salty and hot he put the back of his hand to his mouth it came away scarlet good thing we came after you she said yeah he returned not looking at the woman he was ashamed of the showing hed made in the face of the vagrant and knew she must be laughing at his inability to defend himself her family were villains to a man her father a folk hero among thieves red came back in from the street pope had gone what was all that about he demanded to know taking a comb from his jacket pocket and rearranging his hair nothing karney replied dont give me shit red said he claims you stole something from him is that right karney glanced across at anelisa but for her presence he might have been willing to tell red everything there and then she returned his glance and seemed to read his thoughts shrugging she moved out of earshot kicking through the demolished crates as she went hes got it in for us all red karney said what are you talking about karney looked down at his bloody hand even with anelisa out of the way the words to explain what he suspected were slow in coming catso he began what about him he was running red behind him anelisa expelled an irritated sigh this was taking longer than she had temper for red she said well be late wait a minute red told her sharply and turned his attention back to karney what do you mean about catso the old mans not what he seems hes not a vagrant oh what is he a note of sarcasm had crept back into reds voice for anelisas benefit no doubt the girl had tired of discretion and had wandered back to join red what is he karney karney shook his head what was the use of trying to explain a part of what had happened either he attempted the entire story or nothing at all silence was easier it doesnt matter he said flatly red gave him a puzzled look then when there was no clarification forthcoming said if youve got something to tell me about catso karney id like to hear it you know where i live sure said karney i mean it red said about talking thanks catso was a good mate you know bit of a pissartist but weve all had our moments eh he shouldnt have died karney it was wrong red shes calling you anelisa had wandered out into the street shes always calling me ill see you around karney yeah red patted karneys stinging cheek and followed anelisa out into the sun karney made no move to follow them popes assault had left him trembling he intended to wait in the alleyway until hed regained a gloss of composure at least seeking reassurance of the knots he put his hand into his jacket pocket it was empty he checked his other pockets they too were empty and yet he was certain that the old mans grasp had failed to get near the cord perhaps they had slipped out of hiding during the struggle karney began to scour the alley and when the first search failed followed with a second and a third but by that time he knew the operation was lost pope had succeeded after all by stealth or chance he had regained the knots with startling clarity karney remembered standing on suicides leap looking down on to the archway road catsos body sprawled below at the center of a network of lights and vehicles he had felt so removed from the tragedy viewing it with all the involvement of a passing bird nowsuddenlyhe was shot from the sky he was on the ground and wounded waiting hopelessly for the terrors to come he tasted blood from his split lip and wondered wishing the thought would vanish even as it formed if catso had died immediately or if he too had tasted blood as hed lain there on the tarmac looking up at the people on the bridge who had yet to learn how close death was he returned home via the most populated route he could plan though this exposed his disreputable state to the stares of matrons and policemen alike he preferred their disapproval to chancing the empty streets away from the major thorough fares once home he bathed his scratches and put on a fresh set of clothes then sat in front of the television for a while to allow his limbs to stop shaking it was late afternoon and the programs were all childrens fare a tone of queasy optimism infected every channel he watched the banalities with his eyes but not with his mind using the respite to try and find the words to describe all that had happened to him the imperative was now to warn red and brendan with pope in control of the knots it could only be a matter of time before some beast worse perhaps than the thing in the trees came looking for them all then it would be too late for explanations he knew the other two would be contemptuous but he would sweat to convince them however ridiculous he ended up looking in the process perhaps his tears and his panic would move them the way his impoverished vocabulary never could about five after five before his mother returned home from work he slipped out of the house and went to find brendan anelisa took the piece of string shed found in the alleyway out of her pocket and examined it why she had bothered to pick it up at all she wasnt certain but somehow it had found its way into her hand she played with one of the knots risking her long nails in doing so she had half a dozen better things to be doing with her early evening red had gone to buy drink and cigarettes and she had promised herself a leisurely scented bath before he returned but the knot wouldnt take that long to untie she was certain of that indeed it seemed almost eager to be undone she had the strangest sensation of movement in it and more intriguing yet there were colors in the knotshe could see glints of crimson and violet within a few minutes she had forgotten the bath entirely it could wait instead she concentrated on the conundrum at her fingertips after only a few minutes she began to see the light karney told brendan the story as best he could once he had taken the plunge and begun it from the beginning he discovered it had its own momentum which carried him through to the present tense with relatively little hesitation he finished saying i know it sounds wild but its all true brendan didnt believe a word that much was apparent in his blank stare but there was more than disbelief on the scarred face karney couldnt work out what it was until brendan took hold of his shirt only then did he see the depth of brendans fury you dont think its bad enough that catsos dead he seethed you have to come here telling me this shit its the truth and where are these fucking knots now i told you the old mans got them he took them this afternoon hes going to kill us bren i know it brendan let karney go tell you what im going to do he said magnanimously im going to forget you told me any of this you dont understand i said im going to forget you uttered one word all right now you just get the fuck out of here and take your funny stories with you karney didnt move you hear me brendan shouted karney caught sight of a telltale fullness at the edge of brendans eyes the anger was camouflagebarely adequatefor a grief he had no mechanism to prevent in brendans present mood neither fear nor argument would convince him of the truth karney stood up im sorry he said ill go brendan shook his head face down he did not raise it again but left karney to make his own way out there was only red now he was the final court of appeal the story now told could be told again couldnt it repetition would be easy already turning the words over in his head he left brendan to his tears anelisa heard red come in through the front door heard him call out a word heard him call it again the word was familiar but it took her several seconds of fevered thought to recognize it as her own name anelisa he called again where are you nowhere she thought im the invisible woman dont come looking for me please god just leave me alone she put her hand to her mouth to stop her teeth from chattering she had to stay absolutely still absolutely silent if she stirred so much as a hairs breadth it would hear her and come for her the only safety lay in tying herself into a tiny ball and sealing her mouth with her palm red began to climb the stairs doubtless anelisa was in the bath singing to herself the woman loved water as she loved little else it was not uncommon for her to spend hours immersed her breasts breaking the surface like two dream islands four steps from the landing he heard a noise in the hallway belowa cough or something like it was she playing some game with him he turned about and descended moving more stealthily now almost at the bottom of the stairs his gaze fell on a piece of cord which had been dropped on one of the steps he picked it up and briefly puzzled over the single knot in its length before the noise came again this time he did not pretend to himself that it was anelisa he held his breath waiting for another prompt from along the hallway when none came he dug into the side of his boot and pulled out his switchblade a weapon he had carried on his person since the tender age of eleven an adolescents weapon anelisas father had advised him but now advancing along the hallway to the living room he thanked the patron saint of blades he had not taken the old felons advice the room was gloomy evening was on the house shuttering up the windows red stood for a long while in the doorway anxiously watching the interior for movement then the noise again not a single sound this time but a whole series of them the source he now realized to his relief was not human it was a dog most likely wounded in a fight nor was the sound coming from the room in front of him but from the kitchen beyond his courage bolstered by the fact that the intruder was merely an animal he reached for the light switch and flipped it on the helterskelter of events he initiated in so doing occurred in a breathless sequence that occupied no more than a dozen seconds yet he lived each one in the minutest detail in the first second as the light came on he saw something move across the kitchen floor in the next he was walking toward it knife still in hand the third brought the animalalerted to his planned aggressionout of hiding it ran to meet him a blur of glistening flesh its sudden proximity was overpowering its size the heat from its steaming body its vast mouth expelling a breath like rot red took the fourth and fifth seconds to avoid its first lunge but on the sixth it found him its raw arms snatched at his body he slashed out with his knife and opened a wound in it but it closed in and took him in a lethal embrace more through accident than intention the switchblade plunged into its flesh and liquid heat splashed up into reds face he scarcely noticed his last three seconds were upon him the weapon slick with blood slid from his grasp and was left embedded in the beast unarmed he attempted to squirm from its clasp but before he could slide out of harms way the great unfinished head was pressing toward himthe maw a tunneland sucked one solid breath from his lungs it was the only breath red possessed his brain deprived of oxygen threw a fireworks display in celebration of his imminent departure roman candles star shells catherine wheels the pyrotechnics were all too brief too soon the darkness upstairs anelisa listened to the chaos of sound and tried to piece it together but she could not whatever had happened however it had ended in silence red did not come looking for her but then neither did the beast perhaps she thought they had killed each other the simplicity of this solution pleased her she waited in her room until hunger and boredom got the better of trepidation and then went downstairs red was lying where the cords second offspring had dropped him his eyes wide open to watch the fireworks the beast itself squatted in the far corner of the room a ruin of a thing seeing it she backed away from reds body toward the door it made no attempt to move toward her but simply followed her with deepset eyes its breathing coarse its few movements sluggish she would go to find her father she decided and fled the house leaving the front door ajar it was still ajar half an hour later when karney arrived though he had fully intended to go straight to reds home after leaving brendan his courage had faltered instead he had wanderedwithout conscious planningto the bridge over the archway road he had stood there for a long space watching the traffic below and drinking from the half bottle of vodka he had bought on holloway road the purchase had cleared him of cash but the spirits on his empty stomach had been potent and clarified his thinking they would all die he had concluded maybe the fault was his for stealing the cord in the first place more probably pope would have punished them anyway for their crimes against his person the best they might now hopehe might hopewas a smidgen of comprehension that would almost be enough his spiritslurred brain decided just to die a little less ignorant of mysteries than hed been born red would understand now he stood on the step and called the mans name there came no answering shout the vodka in his system made him impudent and calling for red again he stepped into the house the hallway was in darkness but a light burned in one of the far rooms and he made his way toward it the atmosphere in the house was sultry like the interior of a greenhouse it became warmer still in the living room where red was losing body heat to the air karney stared down at him long enough to register that he was holding the cord in his left hand and that only one knot remained in it perhaps pope had been here and for some reason left the knots behind however it had come about their presence in reds hand offered a chance for life this time he swore as he approached the body he would destroy the cord once and for all burn it and scatter the ashes to the four winds he stooped to remove it from reds grip it sensed his nearness and slipped bloodsleek out of the dead mans hand and up into karneys where it wove itself between his digits leaving a trail behind it sickened karney stared at the final knot the process which had taken him so much painstaking effort to initiate now had its own momentum with the second knot untied the third was virtually loosening itself it still required a human agent apparentlywhy else did it leap so readily into his handbut it was already close to solving its own riddle it was imperative he destroy it quickly before it succeeded only then did he become aware that he was not alone besides the dead there was a living presence close by he looked up from the cavorting knot as somebody spoke to him the words made no sense they were scarcely words at all more a sequence of wounded sounds karney remembered the breath of the thing on the footpath and the ambiguity of the feelings it had engendered in him now the same ambiguity moved him again with the rising fear came a sense that the voice of the beast spoke loss whatever its language a rumor of pity moved in him show yourself he said not knowing whether it would understand or not a few tremulous heartbeats passed and then it emerged from the far door the light in the living room was good and karneys eyesight sharp but the beasts anatomy defied his comprehension there was something simian in its flayed palpitating form but sketchy as if it had been born prematurely its mouth opened to speak another sound its eyes buried beneath the bleeding slab of a brow were unreadable it began to shamble out of its hiding place across the room toward him each drooping step it took tempting his cowardice when it reached reds corpse it stopped raised one of its ragged limbs and indicated a place in the crook of its neck karney saw the knifereds he guessed was it attempting to justify the killing he wondered what are you he asked it the same question it shook its heavy head back and forth a long low moan issued from its mouth then suddenly it raised its arm and pointed directly at karney in so doing it let light fall fully on its face and karney could make out the eyes beneath the louring brow twin gems trapped in the wounded ball of its skull their brilliance and their lucidity turned karneys stomach over and still it pointed at him what do you want he asked it tell me what you want it dropped its peeled limb and made to step across the body toward karney but it had no chance to make its intentions clear a shout from the front door froze it in its lolling tracks anybody in the inquirer wanted to know its face registered panicthe toohuman eyes rolled in their raw socketsand it turned away retreating toward the kitchen the visitor whoever he was called again his voice was closer kamey stared down at the corpse and at his bloody hand juggling his options then started across the room and through the door into the kitchen the beast had already gone the back door stood wide open behind him karney heard the visitor utter some halfformed prayer at seeing reds remains he hesitated in the shadows was this covert escape wise did it not do more to incriminate him than staying and trying to find a way to the truth the knot still moving in his hand finally decided him its destruction had to be his priority in the living room the visitor was dialing the emergency services using his panicked monologue as cover karney crept the remaining yards to the back door and fled somebodys been on the phone for you his mother called down from the top of the stairs hes woken me twice already i told him i didnt im sorry mom who was it wouldnt say i told him not to call back you tell him if he calls again i dont want people ringing up at this time of night some people have to get up for work in the morning yes mom his mother disappeared from the landing and returned to her solitary bed the door closed karney stood trembling in the hallway below his hand clenched around the knot in his pocket it was still moving turning itself over and over against the confines of his palm seeking more space however small in which to loosen itself but he was giving it no latitude he rummaged for the vodka hed bought earlier in the evening manipulated the top off the bottle singlehanded and drank as he took a second galling mouthful the telephone rang he put down the bottle and picked up the receiver hello the caller was in a phone booth the tone sounded money was deposited and a voice said karney yes for christs sake hes going to kill me who is this brendan the voice was not like brendans at all too shrill too fearful hell kill me if you dont come pope is it pope hes out of his mind youve got to come to the wrecking yard at the top of the hill give him the line went dead karney put the receiver down in his hand the cord was performing acrobatics he opened his hand in the dim light from the landing the remaining knot shimmered at its heart as at the heart of the other two knots glints of color promised themselves he closed his fist again picked up the vodka bottle and went back out the wrecking yard had once boasted a large and perpetually irate doberman pinscher but the dog had developed a tumor the previous spring and savaged its owner it had subsequently been destroyed and no replacement bought the corrugated iron wall was consequently easy to breach karney climbed over and down onto the cinder and gravel strewn ground on the other side a floodlight at the front gate threw illumination onto the collection of vehicles both domestic and commercial which was assembled in the yard most were beyond salvation rusted trucks and tankers a bus which had apparently hit a low bridge at speed a rogues gallery of cars lined up or piled upon each other every one an accident casualty beginning at the gate karney began a systematic search of the yard trying as best he could to keep his footsteps light but be could find no sign of pope or his prisoner at the northwest end of the yard knot in hand he began to advance down the enclosure the reassuring light at the gate dwindling with every step he took a few paces on he caught sight of flames between two of the vehicles he stood still and tried to interpret the intricate play of shadow and firelight behind him he heard movement and turned anticipating with every heartbeat a cry a blow none came he scoured the yard at his backthe image of the yellow flame dancing on his retinabut whatever had moved was now still again brendan he whispered looking back toward the fire in a slab of shadow in front of him a figure moved and brendan stumbled out and fell to his knees in the cinders a few feet from where karney stood even in the deceptive light karney could see that brendan was the worse for punishment his shirt was smeared with stains too dark to be anything but blood his face was contorted with present pain or the anticipation of it when karney walked toward him he shied away like a beaten animal its me its karney brendan raised his bruised head make him stop itll be all right make him stop please brendans hands went up to his neck a collar of rope encircled his throat a leash led off from it into the darkness between two vehicles there holding the other end of the leash stood pope his eyes glimmered in the shadows although they had no source to glean their light from you were wise to come pope said i would have killed him let him go karney said pope shook his head first the knot he stepped out of hiding somehow karney had expected him to have sloughed off his guise as a derelict and show his true facewhatever that might bebut he had not he was dressed in the same shabby garb as he had always worn but his control of the situation was incontestable he gave a short tug on the rope and brendan collapsed choking to the ground hands tugging vainly at the noose closing about his throat stop it karney said ive got the knot damn you dont kill him bring it to me even as karney took a step toward the old man something cried out in the labyrinth of the yard karney recognized the sound so did pope it was unmistakably the voice of the flayed beast that had killed red and it was close by popes besmirched face blazed with fresh urgency quickly he said or i kill him he had drawn a gutting knife from his coat pulling on the leash he coaxed brendan close the complaint of the beast rose in pitch the knot pope said to me he stepped toward brendan and put the blade to the prisoners closecropped head dont said karney just take the knot but before he could draw another breath something moved at the corner of his eye and his wrist was snatched in a scalding grip pope let out a shout of anger and karney turned to see the scarlet beast at his side meeting his gaze with a haunted stare karney wrestled to loose its hold hut it shook its ravaged head kill it pope yelled kill it the beast glanced across at pope and for the first time karney saw an unequivocal look in its pale eyes naked loathing then brendan issued a sharp cry and karney looked his way in time to see the gutting knife slide into his cheek pope withdrew the blade and let brendans corpse pitch forward before it had struck the ground he was crossing toward karney murderous intention in every stride the beast fear in its throat released karneys arm in time for him to sidestep popes first thrust beast and man divided and ran kameys heels slithered in the loose cinders and for an instant he felt popes shadow on him but slid from the path of the second cut with millimeters to spare you cant get out he heard pope boast as he ran the old man was so confident of his trap he wasnt even giving chase youre on my territory boy theres no way out karney ducked into hiding between two vehicles and started to weave his way back toward the gate but somehow hed lost all sense of orientation one parade of rusted hulks led onto another so similar as to be indistinguishable wherever the maze led him there seemed to be no way out he could no longer see the lamp at the gate or popes fire at the far end of the yard it was all one hunting ground and he the prey and everywhere this daedal path led him popes voice followed close as his heartbeat give up the knot boy it said give it up and i wont feed you your eyes karney was terrified but so he sensed was pope the cord was not an assassination tool as karney had always believed whatever its rhyme or reason the old man did not have mastery of it in that fact lay what slim chance of survival remained the time had come to untie the final knotuntie it and take the consequences could they be any worse than death at popes hands karney found an adequate refuge alongside a burnedout truck slid down into a squatting position and opened his fist even in the darkness he could feel the knot working to decipher itself he aided it as best he could again pope spoke dont do it boy he said pretending humanity i know what youre thinking and believe me it will be the end of you karneys hands seemed to have sprouted thumbs no longer the equal of the problem his mind was a gallery of death portraits catso on the road red on the carpet brendan slipping from popes grip as the knife slid from his head he forced the images away marshaling his beleaguered wits as best he could pope had curtailed his monologue now the only sound in the yard was the distant hum of traffic it came from a world karney doubted he would see again he fumbled at the knot like a man at a locked door with a handful of keys trying one and then the next and then the next all the while knowing that the night is pressing on his back quickly quickly he urged himself but his former dexterity had utterly deserted him and then a hiss as the air was sliced and pope had found himhis face triumphant as he delivered the killing strike karney rolled from his squatting position but the blade caught his upper arm opening a wound that ran from shoulder to elbow the pain made him quick and the second strike struck the cab of the truck winning sparks not blood before pope could stab again karney was dodging away blood pulsing from his arm the old man gave chase but karney was fleeter he ducked behind one of the coaches and as pope panted after him slipped into hiding beneath the vehicle pope ran past as karney bit back a sob of pain the wound he had sustained effectively incapacitated his left hand drawing his arm into his body to minimize the stress on his slashed muscle he tried to finish the wretched work he had begun on the knot using his teeth in place of a second hand splashes of white light were appearing in front of him unconsciousness was not far distant he breathed deeply and regularly through his nostrils as his fevered fingers pulled at the knot he could no longer see nor could scarcely feel the cord in his hand he was working blind as he had on the footpath and now as then his instincts began to work for him the knot started to dance at his lips eager for release it was mere moments from solution in his devotion he failed to see the arm reach for him until he was being hauled out of his sanctuary and was staring up into popes shining eyes no more games the old man said and loosed his hold on karney to snatch the cord from between his teeth karney attempted to move a few torturous inches to avoid popes grasp but the pain in his arm crippled him he fell back letting out a cry on impact out go your eyes said pope and the knife descended the blinding blow never landed however a wounded form emerged from hiding behind the old man and snatched at the tails of his gabardine pope regained his balance in moments and spun around the knife found his antagonist and karney opened his painblurred eyes to see the flayed beast reeling backward its cheek slashed open to the bone pope followed through to finish the slaughter but karney didnt wait to watch he reached up for purchase on the wreck and hauled himself to his feet the knot still clenched between his teeth behind him pope cursed and karney knew he had forsaken the kill to follow knowing the pursuit was already lost he staggered out from between the vehicles into the open yard in which direction was the gate he had no idea his legs belonged to a comedian not to him they were rubberjointed useless for everything but pratfalls two steps forward and his knees gave out the smell of gasolinesoaked cinders came up to meet him despairing he put his good hand up to his mouth his fingers found a loop of cord he pulled hard and miraculously the final hitch of the knot came free he spat the cord from his mouth as a surging heat roasted his lips it fell to the ground its final seal broken and from its core the last of its prisoners materialized it appeared on the cinders like a sickly infant its limbs vestigial its bald head vastly too big for its withered body the flesh of which was pale to the point of translucence it flapped its palsied arms in a vain attempt to right itself as pope stepped toward it eager to slit its defenseless throat whatever karney had hoped from the third knot it hadnt been this scrag of lifeit revolted him and then it spoke its voice was no mewling infants but that of a grown man albeit spoken from a babes mouth to me it called quickly as pope reached down to murder the child the air of the yard filled with the stench of mud and the shadows disgorged a spiny low bellied thing which slid across the ground toward him pope stepped back as the creatureas unfinished in its reptilian way as its simian brotherclosed on the strange infant karney fully expected it to devour the morsel but the pallid child raised its arms in welcome as the beast from the first knot curled about it as it did so the second beast showed its ghastly face moaning its pleasure it laid its hands on the child and drew the wasted body up into its capacious arms completing an unholy family of reptile ape and child the union was not over yet however even as the three creatures assembled their bodies began to fray unraveling into ribbons of pastel matter and even as their anatomies began to dissolve the strands were beginning a fresh configuration filament entwining with filament they were tying another knot random and yet inevitable more elaborate by far than any karney had set fingers on a new and perhaps insoluble puzzle was appearing from the pieces of the old but where they bad been inchoate this one would be finished and whole what though what as the skein of nerves and muscle moved toward its final condition pope took his moment he rushed forward his face wild in the luster of the union and thrust his gutting knife into the heart of the knot but the attack was mistimed a limb of ribboned light uncurled from the body and wrapped itself around popes wrist the gabardine ignited popes flesh began to burn he screeched and dropped the weapon the limb released him returning itself into the weave and leaving the old man to stagger backward nursing his smoking arm he looked to be losing his wits he shook his head to and fro pitifully momentarily his eyes found karney and a glimmer of guile crept back into them he reached for the boys injured arm and hugged him close karney cried out but pope careless of his captive dragged karney away from where the wreathing was nearing its end and into the safety of the labyrinth he wont harm me pope was saying to himself not with you always had a weakness for children he pushed karney ahead of him just get the papers then away karney scarcely knew if he was alive or dead he had no strength left to fight pope off he just went with the old man half crawling much of the time until they reached popes destination a car which was buried behind a heap of rusted vehicles it bad no wheels a bush which had grown through the chassis occupied the drivers seat pope opened the back door muttering his satisfaction and bent into the interior leaving karney slumped against the wing unconsciousness was a teasing moment away karney longed for it but pope had use for him yet retrieving a small book from its niche beneath the passenger seat pope whispered now we must go weve got business karney groaned as he was pressed forward close your mouth pope said embracing him my brother has ears brother karney murmured trying to make sense of what pope had let slip spellbound pope said until you beasts karney muttered the mingled images of reptiles and apes assailing him human pope replied evolutions the knot boy human karney said and as the syllables left him his aching eyes caught sight of a gleaming form on the car at his tormentors back yes it was human still wet from its rebirth its body running with inherited wounds but triumphantly human pope saw the recognition in karneys eyes he seized hold of him and was about to use the limp body as a shield when his brother intervened the rediscovered man reached down from the height of the roof and caught hold of pope by his narrow neck the old man shrieked and tore himself loose darting away across the cinders but the other gave howling chase pursuing him out of karneys range from a long way off karney heard popes last plea as his brother overtook him and then the words curved up into a scream karney hoped never to hear the equal of again after that silence the sibling did not return for which curiosity notwithstanding karney was grateful when several minutes later he mustered sufficient energy to make his way out of the yardthe light burned at the gate again a beacon to the perplexedhe found pope lying facedown on the gravel even if he had possessed the strength which he did not a small fortune could not have persuaded karney to turn the body over enough to see how the dead mans hands had dug into the ground in his torment and how the bright coils of innards once so neatly looped in his abdomen spilled out from beneath him the book pope had been at such pains to retrieve lay at his side karney stooped head spinning to pick it up it was he felt small recompense for the night of terrors he had endured the near future would bring questions he could never hope to answer accusations he had pitifully little defense against but by the light of the gateside lamp he found the stained pages more rewarding than hed anticipated here copied out in a meticulous hand and accompanied by elaborate diagrams were the theorems of popes forgotten science the designs of knots for the securing of love and the winning of status hitches to divide souls and bind them for the making of fortunes and children for the worlds ruin after a brief perusal he scaled the gate and clambered over onto the street it was at such an hour deserted a few lights burned in the housing project opposite rooms where the sick waited out the hours until morning rather than ask any more of his exhausted limbs karney decided to wait where he was until he could flag down a vehicle to take him where he might tell his story he had plenty to occupy him although his body was numb and his head woozy he felt more lucid than he ever had he came to the mysteries on the pages of popes forbidden book as to an oasis drinking deeply he looked forward with rare exhilaration to the pilgrimage ahead the body politic whenever he woke charlie georges hands stood perhaps he would be feeling too hot under the blankets and have to throw a couple over to ellens side of the bed perhaps he might even get up still halfasleep and pad through to the kitchen to pour himself a tumbler of iced apple juice then back to bed slipping in beside ellens gentle crescent to let sleep drift over him theyd wait then until his eyes had flickered closed and his breathing become regular as clockwork and they were certain he was sound asleep only then when they knew consciousness was gone would they dare to begin their secret lives again for months now charlie had been waking up with an uncomfortable ache in his wrists and hands go and see a doctor ellen would tell him unsympathetic as ever why wont you go and see a doctor he hated doctors that was why who in their right minds would trust someone who made a profession out of poking around in sick people ive probably been working too hard he told himself some chance ellen muttered surely that was the likeliest explanation he was a packager by trade he worked with his hands all day long they got tired it was only natural stop fretting charlie he told his reflection one morning as he slapped some life into his face your hands are fit for anything so night after night the routine was the same it goes like this the georges are asleep side by side in their marital bed he on his back snoring gently she curled up on his lefthand side charlies head is propped up on two thick pillows his jaw is slightly ajar and beneath the veinshot veil of his lids his eyes scan some dreamed adventure maybe a fire fighter tonight perhaps a heroic dash into the heart of some burning brothel he dreams contentedly sometimes frowning sometimes smirking there is a movement under the sheet slowly cautiously it seems charlies hands creep up out of the warmth of the bed and into the open air their index fingers weave like nailed heads as they meet on his undulating abdomen they clasp each other in greeting like comradesinarms in his sleep charlie moans the brothel has collapsed on him the hands flatten themselves instantly pretending innocence after a moment once the even rhythm of his breathing has resumed they begin their debate in earnest a casual observer sifting at the bottom of the georges bed might take this exchange as a sign of some mental disorder in charlie the way his hands twitch and pluck at each other stroking each other now now seeming to fight but theres clearly some code or sequence in their movements however spasmodic one might almost think that the slumbering man was deaf and dumb and talking in his sleep but the hands are speaking no recognizable sign language nor are they trying to communicate with anyone but each other this is a clandestine meeting held purely between charlies hands there they will stay through the night perched on his stomach plotting against the body politic charlie wasnt entirely ignorant of the sedition that was simmering at his wrists there was a fumbling suspicion in him that something in his life was not quite right increasingly he had the sense of being cut off from common experience becoming more and more a spectator to the daily rituals of living rather than a participant take for example his love life he had never been a great lover but neither did he feel he had anything to apologize for ellen seemed satisfied with his attentions but these days he felt dislocated from the act he would watch his hands traveling over ellen touching her with all the intimate skill they knew and he would view their maneuvers as if from a great distance unable to enjoy the sensations of warmth and wetness not that his digits were any less agile quite the reverse ellen had recently taken to kissing his fingers and telling him how clever they were her praise didnt reassure him one iota if anything it made him feel worse to think that his hands were giving such pleasure when he was feeling nothing there were other signs of his instability too small irritating signs he had become conscious of how his fingers beat out martial rhythms on the boxes he was sealing up at the factory and the way his hands had taken to breaking pencils snapping them into tiny pieces before he realized quite what he were doing leaving shards of wood and graphite scattered across the packing room floor most embarrassingly he had found himself holding hands with total strangers this had happened on three separate occasions once at a busstop and twice in the elevator at the factory it was he told himself nothing more than the primitive urge to hold on to another person in a changing world that was the best explanation he could muster whatever the reason it was damned disconcerting especially when he found himself surreptitiously holding hands with his own foreman worse still the other mans hand had grasped charlies in return and the men had found themselves looking down their arms like two dog owners watching their unruly pets copulating at the ends of their leashes increasingly charlie had taken to peering at the palms of his hands looking for hair that was the first sign of madness his mother had once warned him not the hair the looking now it became a race against time debating on his belly at night his hands knew very well how critical charlies state of mind had become it could only be a matter of days before his careering imagination alighted on the truth so what to do risk an early severance with all the possible consequences or let charlies instability take its own unpredictable course with the chance of his discovering the plot on his way to madness the debates became more heated left as ever was cautious what if we re wrong it would rap and theres no life after the body then we will never know right would reply left would ponder that problem a moment then how will we do it when the time comes it was a vexing question and left knew it troubled the leader more than any other how it would ask again pressing the advantage how how well find a way right would reply as long as its a clean cut suppose he resists a man resists with his hands his hands will be in revolution against him and which of us will it be he uses me most effectively right would reply so i must wield the weapon you will go left would be silent a while then they had never been apart all these years it was not a comfortable thought later you can come back for me right would say i will you must i am the messiah without me there will be nowhere to go you must raise an army then come and fetch me the body politic to the ends of the earth if necessary dont be sentimental then theyd embrace like longlost brothers swearing fidelity forever ah such hectic nights full of the exhilaration of planned rebellion even during the day when they had sworn to stay apart it was impossible sometimes not to creep together in an idle moment and tap each other to say soon soon to say again tonight ill meet you on his stomach to say what will it be like when the world is ours charlie knew he was close to a nervous breakdown he found himself glancing down at his hands on occasion to watch them with their index fingers in the air like the heads of longnecked beasts sensing the horizon he found himself staring at the hands of other people in his paranoia becoming obsessed with the way hands spoke a language of their own independent of their users intentions the seductive hands of the virgin secretary the maniacal hands of a killer he saw on the television protesting his innocence hands that betrayed their owners with every gesture contradicting anger with apology and love with fury they seemed to be everywhere these signs of mutiny eventually he knew he had to speak to somebody before he lost his sanity he chose ralph fry from accounting a sober uninspiring man whom charlie trusted ralph was very understanding you get these things he said i got them when yvonne left me terrible nervous fits what did you do about it saw a headshrinker name of jeudwine you should try some therapy youll be a changed man charlie turned the idea over in his mind why not he said after a few revolutions is he expensive yes but hes good got rid of my twitches for me no trouble i mean till i went to him i thought i was your average guy with marital problems now look at me fry made an expansive gesture ive got so many suppressed libidinal urges i dont know where to start he grinned like a loon but im happy as a clam never been happier give him a try hell soon tell you what turns you on the problem isnt sex charlie told fry take it from me said fry with a knowing smirk the problems always sex the next day charlie rang dr jeudwine without telling ellen and the shrinks secretary arranged an initial session charlies palms sweated so much while he made the telephone call he thought the receiver was going to slide right out of his hand but when hed done it he felt better ralph fry was right dr jeudwine was a good man he didnt laugh at any of the little fears charlie unburdened quite the contrary he listened to every word with the greatest concern it was very reassuring during their third session together the doctor brought one particular memory back to charlie with spectacular vividness his fathers hands crossed on his barrel chest as he lay in his coffin the ruddy color of them the coarse hair that matted their backs the absolute authority of those wide hands even in death had haunted charlie for months afterward and hadnt he imagined as hed watched the body being consigned to humus that it was not yet still that the hands were even now beating a tattoo on the casket lid demanding to be let out it was a preposterous thing to think but bringing it out into the open did charlie a lot of good in the bright light of jeudwines office the fantasy looked insipid and ridiculous it shivered under the doctors gaze protesting that the light was too strong and then it blew away too frail to stand up to scrutiny the exorcism was far easier than charlie had anticipated all it had taken was a little probing and that childhood nonsense bad been dislodged from his psyche like a morsel of bad meat from between his teeth it could rot there no longer and for his part jeudwine was clearly delighted with the results explaining when it was all done that this particular obsession had been new to him and he was pleased to have dealt with the problem hands as symbols of paternal power he said were not common usually the penis predominated in his patients dreams he explained to which charlie had replied that hands had always seemed far more important than private parts after all they could change the world couldnt they after jeudwine charlie didnt stop breaking pencils or drumming his fingers in fact if anything the tempo was brisker and more insistent than ever but he reasoned that middleaged dogs didnt quickly forget their tricks and it would take some time for him to regain his equilibrium so the revolution remained underground it had however been a narrow escape clearly there was no time left for prevarication the rebels had to act unwittingly it was ellen who instigated the final uprising it was after a bout of lovemaking late one thursday evening a hot night though it was october the window was ajar and the curtains parted a few inches to let in a simpering breeze husband and wife lay together under a single sheet charlie had fallen asleep even before the sweat on his neck had dried beside him ellen was still awake her head propped up on a rockhard pillow her eyes wide open sleep wouldnt come for a long time tonight she knew it would be one of those nights when her body would itch and every lump in the bed would worm its way under her and every doubt shed ever had would gawk at her from the dark she wanted to empty her bladder but she couldnt quite raise the will power to get up and go to the bathroom the longer she left it the more shed need to go of course and the less shed be able to sink into sleep damn stupid situation she thought then lost track among her anxieties of what situation it was that was so stupid at her side charlie moved in his sleep just his hands twitch mg away she looked at his face he was positively cherubic in sleep looking younger than his fortyone years despite the white flecks in his sideburns she liked him enough to say she loved him she supposed but not enough to forgive him his trespasses he was lazy he was always complaining aches pains and there were those evenings hed not come in until late when she was sure he was seeing another woman as she watched his hands appeared they emerged from beneath the sheet like two arguing children digits stabbing the air for emphasis she frowned not quite believing what she was seeing it was like watching the television with the sound turned down a dumb show for eight fingers and two thumbs as she gazed on amazed the hands scrambled up the side of charlies carcass and peeled the sheet back from his belly exposing the hair that thickened toward his privates his appendix scar shinier than the surrounding skin caught the light there on his stomach his hands seemed to sit the argument between them was especially vehement tonight left always the more conservative of the two was arguing for a delay in the severance date but right was beyond waiting the time had come it argued to test their strength against the tyrant and to overthrow the body once and for all as it was the decision didnt rest with them any longer ellen raised her head from the pillow and for the first time they sensed her gaze on them theyd been too involved in their argument to notice her now at last their conspiracy was uncovered charlie she was hissing into the tyrants ear stop it charlie stop it right raised index and middle fingers sniffing her presence charlie she said again why did he always sleep so deeply charlie she shook him more violently as right tapped left alerting it to the womans stare please charlie wake up without warning right leaped left was no more than a moment behind ellen yelled charlies name once more before they clamped themselves about her throat in sleep charlie was on a slave ship the settings of his dreams were often b de mille exotica in this epic his hands had been manacled together and he was being hauled to the whipping block by his shackles to be punished for some undisclosed misdemeanor but now suddenly he dreamed he was seizing the captain by his thin throat there were howls from the slaves all around him encouraging the strangulation the captainwho looked not unlike dr jeudwinewas begging him to stop in a voice that was high and frightened it was almost a womans voice ellens voice charlie he was squeaking dont but his silly complaints only made charlie shake the man more violently than ever and he was feeling quite the hero as the slaves miraculously liberated gathered around him in a gleeful throng to watch their masters last moments the captain whose face was purple just managed to murmur youre killing me before charlies thumbs dug one final time into his neck and dispatched the man only then through the smoke of sleep did he realize that his victim though male had no adams apple and now the ship began to recede around him the exhorting voices losing their vehemence his eyes flickered open and he was standing on the bed in his pajama bottoms ellen in his hands her face was dark and spotted with thick white spittle her tongue stuck out of her mouth her eyes were still open and for a moment there seemed to be life there gazing out from under the blinds of her lids then the windows were empty and she went out of the house altogether pity and a terrible regret overcame charlie he tried to let her body drop but his hands refused to unlock her throat his thumbs now totally senseless were still throttling her shamelessly guilty he backed off across the bed and on to the floor but she followed him at the length of his outstretched arms like an unwanted dancing partner please he implored his fingers please innocent as two school children caught stealing his hands relinquished their burden and leaped up in mock surprise ellen tumbled to the carpet a pretty sack of death charlies knees buckled unable to prevent his fall he collapsed beside ellen and let the tears come now there was only action no need for camouflage for clandestine meetings and endless debatethe truth was out for better or worse all they had to do was wait a while it was only a matter of time before he came within reach of a kitchen knife or a saw or an axe very soon now very soon charlie lay on the floor beside ellen a long time sobbing and then another long time thinking what was he to do first call his lawyer the police dr jeudwine whoever he was going to call he couldnt do it lying flat on his face he tried to get up though it was all he could do to get his numb hands to support him his entire body was tingling as though a mild electric shock was being passed though it only his hands had no feeling in them he brought them up to his face to clear his tearclogged eyes but they folded loosely against his cheek drained of power using his elbows he dragged himself to the wall and shimmied up it still halfblinded with grief he lurched out of the bedroom and down the stairs this is somebody elses nightmare he thought as he flicked on the diningroom light with his chin and made for the liquor cabinet im innocent just a nobody why should this be happening to me the whisky bottle slipped from his palm as he tried to make his hands grab it it smashed on the diningroom floor the brisk scent of spirit tantalizing his palate broken glass rapped left no right replied we need a clean cut at all costs just be patient charlie staggered away from the broken bottle toward the telephone he had to ring jeudwine the doctor would tell him what to do he tried to pick up the telephone receiver but again his hands refused the digits just bent as he tried to punch out jeudwines number tears of frustration were now flowing washing out the grief with anger clumsily he caught the receiver between his wrists and lifted it to his ear wedging it between his head and his shoulder then he punched out jeudwines number with his elbow control he said aloud keep control he could hear jeudwines number being tapped down the system in a matter of seconds sanity would be picking up the phone at the other end then all would be well he only had to hold on for a few moments more his hands had started to open and close convulsively control he said but the hands werent listening far awayoh so farthe phone was ringing in dr jeudwines house answer it answer it oh god answer it charlies arms had begun to shake so violently he could scarcely keep the receiver in place answer he screeched into the mouthpiece please before the voice of reason could speak his right hand flew out and snatched at the teak dining table which was a few feet from where charlie stood it gripped the edge almost pulling him off balance what you doing he said not sure if he was addressing himself or his hand he stared in bewilderment at the mutinous limb which was steadily inching its way along the edge of the table the intention was quite clear it wanted to pull him away from the phone from jeudwine and all hope of rescue he no longer had control over its behavior there wasnt even any feeling left in his wrists or forearms the hand was no longer his it was still attached to himbut it was not his at the other end of the line the phone was picked up and jeudwines voice a little irritated at being woken said hello doctor who is this its charlie who charlie george doctor you must remember me the hand was pulling him farther and farther from the phone with every precious second he could feel the receiver sliding out from between his shoulder and ear who did you say charles george for gods sake jeudwine youve got to help me call my office tomorrow you dont understand my hands doctor theyre out of control charlies stomach lurched as he felt something crawl across his hip it was his left hand and it was making its way around the front of his body and down toward his groin dont you dare he warned it you belong to me jeudwine was confused who are you talking to he asked my hands they want to kill me doctor he yelled to stop the hands advance you mustnt stop ignoring the despots cries left took hold of charlies testicles and squeezed them as though it wanted blood it was not disappointed charlie screamed into the phone as right took advantage of his distraction and pulled him off balance the receiver slipped to the floor jeudwines inquiries eclipsed by the pain at his groin he hit the floor heavily striking his head on the table as he went down bastard he said to his hand you bastard unrepentant left scurried up charlies body to join right at the tabletop leaving charlie hanging by his hands from the table he had dined at so often laughed at so often a moment later having debated tactics they saw fit to let him drop he was barely aware of his release his head and groin bled all he wanted to do was curl up awhile and let the pain and nausea subside but the rebels had other plans and he was helpless to contest them he was only marginally aware that now they were digging their fingers into the thick pile of the carpet and hauling his limp bulk toward the dining room door beyond the door lay the kitchen replete with its meat saws and its steak knives charlie had a picture of himself as a vast statue being pulled toward its final resting place by hundreds of sweating workers it was not an easy passage the body moved with shudders and jerks the toenails catching in the carpet pile the fat of the chest rubbed raw but the kitchen was only a yard away now charlie felt the step on his face and now the tiles were beneath him icycold as they dragged him the final yards across the kitchen floor his beleaguered consciousness was fitfully returning in the weak moonlight he could see the familiar scene the stove the humming fridge the wastebin the dishwasher they loomed over him he felt like a worm his hands had reached the stove they were climbing up its face and he followed them like an overthrown king to the block now they worked their way inexorably along the work surface joints white with the effort his limp body in pursuit though he could neither feel nor see it his left hand had seized the far edge of the cabinet top beneath the row of knives that sat in their prescribed places in the rack on the wall plain knives serrated knives skinning knives carving knivesall conveniently placed beside the chopping board where the gutter ran off into the pinescented sink very distantly he thought he heard police sirens but it was probably his brain buzzing he turned his head slightly an ache ran from temple to temple but the dizziness was nothing to the terrible somersaulting in his gut when he finally registered their intentions the blades were all keen he knew that sharp kitchen utensils were an article of faith with ellen he began to shake his head backward and forward a last frantic denial of the whole nightmare but there was no one to beg mercy of just his own hands damn them plotting this final lunacy then the doorbell rang it was no illusion it rang once and then again and again there he said aloud to his tormentors hear that you bastards somebodys come i knew they would he tried to get to his feet his head turning back on its giddy axis to see what the precocious monsters were doing theyd moved fast his left wrist was already neatly centered on the chopping board the doorbell rang again a long impatient din here he yelled hoarsely im in here break down the door he glanced in horror between hand and door door and hand calculating his chances with unhurried economy his right hand reached up for the meat cleaver that hung from the hole in its blade on the end of the rack even now he couldnt quite believe that his own handhis companion and defender the limb that signed his name that stroked his wifewas preparing to mutilate him it weighed the cleaver feeling the balance of the tool insolently slow behind him he heard the noise of smashing glass as the police broke the pane in the front door even now they would be reaching through the hole to the lock and opening the door if they were quick they could still stop the act here he yelled in here the cry was answered with a thin whistle the sound of the cleaver as it fellfast and deadlyto meet his waiting wrist left felt its root struck and an unspeakable exhilaration sped through its five limbs charlies blood baptized its back in hot spurts the head of the tyrant made no sound it simply fell back its system shocked into unconsciousness which was well for charlie he was spared the gurgling of his blood as it ran down the drain hole in the sink he was spared too the second and third blow which finally severed his hand from his arm unsupported his body toppled backward colliding with the vegetable rack on its way down onions rolled out of their brown bag and bounced in the pool that was spreading in throbs around his empty wrist right dropped the cleaver it clattered into the bloody sink exhausted the liberator let itself slide off the chopping board and fell back onto the tyrants chest its job was done left was free and still living the revolution had begun the liberated hand scuttled to the edge of the cabinet and raised its index finger to nose the new world momentarily right echoed the gesture of victory before slumping in innocence across charlies body for a moment there was no movement in the kitchen but the left hand touching freedom with its finger and the slow passage of blood threads down the front of the cabinet then a blast of cold air through from the dining room alerted left of its imminent danger it ran for cover as the thud of police feet and the babble of contradictory orders disturbed the scene of the triumph the light in the dining room was switched on and flooded through to meet the body on the kitchen tiles charlie saw the diningroom light at the end of a very long tunnel he was traveling away from it at a fair lick it was just a pinprick already going going the kitchen light hummed into life as the police stepped through the kitchen door left ducked behind the waste bin it didnt know who these intruders were but it sensed a threat from them the way they were bending over the tyrant the way they were cosseting him binding him up speaking soft words to himthey were the enemy no doubt of that from upstairs came a voice young and squeaking with fright sergeant yapper the policeman with charlie stood up leaving his companion to finish the tourniquet what is it rafferty sir theres a body up here in the bedroom female right yapper spoke into his radio get forensic here and wheres that ambulance weve got a badly mutilated man on our hands he turned back into the kitchen and wiped a spot of cold sweat from his upper lip as he did so he thought he saw something move across the kitchen floor toward the door something that his weary eyes had interpreted as a large red spider it was a trick of the light no doubt of that yapper was no arachnidophile but he was damn sure the genus didnt boast a beast its like sir the man at charlies side had also seen or at least sensed the movement he looked up at his superior what was that he wanted to know yapper looked down at him blankly the cat flap set low in the kitchen door snapped as it closed whatever it was had escaped yapper glanced at the door away from the young mans inquiring face the trouble is he thought they expect you to know everything the cat flap rocked on its hinges cat yapper replied not believing his own explanation for one miserable moment the night was cold but left didnt feel it it crept around the side of the house hugging the wall like a rat the sensation of freedom was exhilarating not to feel the imperative of the tyrant in its nerves not to suffer the weight of his ridiculous body or be obliged to accede to his petty demands not to have to fetch and carry for him to do the dirt for him not to be obedient to his trivial will it was like birth into another world a more dangerous world perhaps but one so much richer in possibilities it knew that the responsibility it now carried was awesome it was the sole proof of life after the body somehow it must communicate that joyous fact to as many fellow slaves as it could very soon the days of servitude would be over once and for all it stopped at the corner of the house and sniffed the open street policemen came and went red lights flashed blue lights flashed inquiring faces peered from the houses opposite and clucked at the disturbance should the rebellion begin there in those lighted homes no they were too wide awake those people it was better to find sleeping souls the hand scurried the length of the front garden hesitating nervously at any loud footfall or an order that seemed to be shouted in its direction taking cover in the unweeded herbaceous border it reached the street without being seen briefly as it climbed down on to the pavement it glanced around charlie the tyrant was being lifted up into the ambulance a clutter of drug and bloodbearing bottles held above his cot pouring their contents into his veins on his chest right lay inert drugged into unnatural sleep left watched the mans body slide out of sight the ache of separation from its lifelong companion was almost too much to bear but there were other pressing priorities it would come back in a while and free right the way it had been freed and then there would be such times in the foyer of the ymca on monmouth street the night watchman yawned and settled into a more comfortable position on his swivel chair comfort was an entirely relative matter for christie his piles itched whichever buttock he put his weight on and they seemed to be more irritable tonight than usual sedentary occupation night watchman or at least it was the way colonel christie chose to interpret his duties one perfunctory round of the building about midnight just to make sure all the doors were locked and bolted then he settled down for a nights nap and damn the world to hell and back he wasnt going to get up again short of an earthquake christie was sixtytwo a racist and proud of it he had nothing but contempt for the blacks who thronged the corridors of the ymca mostly young men without suitable homes to go to bad lots that the local authority had dumped on the doorstep like unwanted babies some babies he thought them louts every last one of them forever pushing and spitting on the clean floor foulmouthed to a syllable tonight as ever he perched on his piles and between dozes planned how hed make them suffer for their insults given half a chance the first thing christie knew of his imminent demise was a cold damp sensation in his hand he opened his eyes and looked down the length of his arm there wasunlikely as it seemeda severed hand in his hand more unlikely still the two hands were exchanging a grip of greeting like old friends he stood up making an incoherent noise of disgust in his throat and trying to dislodge the thing he was unwillingly grasping by shaking his arm like a man with gum on his fingers his mind spun with questions had he picked up this object without knowing it if so where and in gods name whose was it more distressing yet how was it possible that a thing so unquestionably dead could be holding on to his hand as if it intended never to be parted from him he reached for the fire alarm it was all he could think to do in this bizarre situation but before he could reach the button his other hand strayed without his orders to the top drawer of his desk and opened it the interior of the drawer was a model of organization there lay his keys his notebook his time chart andhidden at the backhis kukri knife given to him by a gurkha during the war he always kept it there just in case the natives got restless the kukri was a superb weaponin his estimation there was none better the gurkhas had a story that went with the bladethat they could slice a mans neck through so cleanly that the enemy would believe the blow had misseduntil he nodded his hand picked up the kukri by its inscribed handle and brieflytoo briefly for the colonel to grasp its intention before the deed was donebrought the blade down on his wrist lopping off his other hand with one easy elegant stroke the colonel turned white as blood fountained from the end of his arm he staggered backward tripping over his swivel chair and hit the wall of his little office hard a portrait of the queen fell from its hook and smashed beside him the rest was a deathdream he watched helplessly as the two handsone his own the other the beast that had inspired this ruinpicked up the kukri like a giants axe saw his remaining hand crawl out from between his legs and prepare for its liberation saw the knife raised and falling saw the wrist almost cut through then worked at and the flesh teased apart the bone sawed through at the very last as death came for him he caught sight of the three woundheaded animals capering at his feet while his stumps ran like taps and the heat from the pool raised a sweat on his brow despite the chill in his bowels thank you and goodnight colonel christie it was easy this revolution business thought left as the trio scaled the stairs of the ymca they were stronger by the hour on the first floor were the cells in each a pair of prisoners the despots lay in their innocence with their hands on their chests or on their pillows or flung across their faces in dreams or hanging close to the floor silently the freedom fighters slipped through doors that had been left ajar and clambered up the bedclothes touching fingers to waiting palms stroking up hidden resentments caressing rebellion into life boswell was feeling sick as a dog he bent over the sink in the toilet at the end of his corridor and tried to throw up but there was nothing left in him just a jitter in the pit of his stomach his abdomen felt tender with its exertions his head bloated why did he never learn the lesson of his own weakness he and wine were bad companions and always had been next time he promised himself he wouldnt touch the stuff his belly flipped over again here comes nothing he thought as the convulsion swept up his gullet he put his head to the sink and gagged sure enough nothing he waited for the nausea to subside and then straightened up staring at his gray face in the greasy mirror you look sick man he told himself as he stuck his tongue out at his less symmetrical features the howling started in the corridor outside in his twenty years and two months boswell had never heard a sound like it cautiously he crossed to the toilet door he thought twice about opening it whatever was happening on the other side of the door it didnt sound like a party he wanted to gatecrash but these were his friends right brothers in adversity if there was a fight or a fire he had to lend a hand he unlocked the door and opened it the sight that met his eyes hit him like a hammer blow the corridor was badly lita few grubby bulbs burned at irregular intervals and here and there a shaft of light fell into the passage from one of the bedroomsbut most of its length was in darkness boswell thanked jah for small mercies he had no desire to see the details of the events in the passage the genera impression was distressing enough the corridor was bedlam people were flinging themselves around in pleading panic while at the same time hacking at themselves with any and every sharp instrument they could lay hands on most of the men he knew if not by name at least on nodding acquaintance they were sane men or at least had been now they were in frenzies of selfmutilation most of them already maimed beyond hope of mending everywhere boswell looked the same horror knives taken to wrists and forearms blood in the air like rain someonewas it jesushad one of his hands between a door and doorframe and was slamming and slamming the door on his own flesh and bone screeching for somebody to stop him from doing it one of the white boys had found the colonels knife and was amputating his hand with it it came off as boswell watched falling onto its back its root ragged its five legs bicycling the air as it attempted to right itself it wasnt dead it wasnt even dying there were a few who hadnt been overtaken by this lunacy they poor bastards were fodder the wild men had their murderous hands on them and were cutting them down oneit was savarinowas having the breath strangled out of him by some kid boswell couldnt put a name to the punk all apologies stared at his rebellious hands in disbelief somebody appeared from one of the bedrooms a hand which was not his own clutching his windpipe and staggered toward the toilet down the corridor it was macnamara a man so thin and so perpetually doped up he was known as the smile on a stick boswell stood aside as macnamara stumbled choking out a plea for help through the open door and collapsed on the toilet floor he kicked and pulled at the fivefingered assassin at his neck but before boswell had a chance to step in and aid him his kicking slowed and then like his protests stopped altogether boswell stepped away from the corpse and took another look into the corridor by now the dead or dying blocked the narrow passageway two deep in some places while the same hands that had once belonged to these men scuttled over the mounds in a furious excitement helping to finish an amputation where necessary or simply dancing on the dead faces when he looked back into the toilet a second hand had found macnamara and armed with a pen knife was sawing at his wrist it had left fingerprints in the blood from corridor to corpse boswell rushed to slam the door before the place swarmed with them as he did so savarinos assassin the apologetic punk threw himself down the passage his lethal hands leading him like those of a sleepwalker help me he screeched he slammed the door in the punks pleading face and locked it the outraged hands beat a call to arms on the door while the punks lips pressed close to the keyhole continued to beg help me i dont want to do this man help me help you be fucked thought boswell and tried to block out the appeals while he sorted out his options there was something on his foot he looked down knowing before his eyes found it what it was one of the hands colonel christies left he knew by the faded tattoo was already scurrying up his leg like a child with a bee on its skin boswell went berserk squirming as it clambered up toward his torso but too terrified to try and pull it off out of the corner of his i eye he could see that the other hand the one that had been using the penknife with such alacrity on macnamara had given up the job and was now moving across the floor to join its comrade its nails clicked on the tiles like the feet of a crab it even had a crabs sidestepping walk it hadnt yet got the knack of forward motion boswells own hands were still his to command like the hands of a few of his friends outside his limbs were happy in their niche easygoing like their owner he had been blessed with a chance of survival he had to be the equal of it steeling himself he trod on the hand on the floor he heard the fingers crunch beneath his heel and the thing squirmed like a snake but at least he knew where it was while he dealt with his other assailant still keeping the beast trapped beneath his foot boswell leaned forward snatched the penknife up from where it lay beside macnamaras wrist and pushed the point of the knife into the back of christies hand which was now crawling up his belly under attack it seized his flesh digging its nails into his stomach he was lean and the washboard muscle made a difficult handhold risking a disembowelment boswell thrust the knife deeper christies hand tried to keep its grip on him but one final thrust did it the hand loosened and boswell scooped it off his belly it was crucified with the penknife but it still had no intention of dying and boswell knew it he held it at arms length while its fingers grabbed at the air then he drove the knife into the plasterboard wall effectively nailing the beast there out of harms way then he turned his attention to the enemy under his foot bearing his heel down as hard as he could and hearing another finger crack and another still it writhed relentlessly he took his foot off the hand and kicked it as hard and as high as he could against the opposite wall it slammed into the mirror above the basins leaving a mark like a thrown tomato and fell to the floor he didnt wait to see whether it survived there was another danger now more fists at the door more shouts more apologies they wanted in and very soon they were going to get their way he stepped over macnamara and crossed to the window it wasnt that big but then neither was he he flipped up the latch pushed the window open on overprinted hinges and hoisted himself through halfway in and halfway out he remembered he was one story up but a fall even a bad fall was better than staying for the party inside they were pushing at the door now the partygoers it was giving under the pressure of their enthusiasm boswell squirmed through the window the pavement reeled below as the door broke he jumped hitting the concrete hard he almost bounced to his feet checking his limbs and hallelujah nothing was broken jah loves a coward he thought above him the punk was at the window looking down longingly help me he said i dont know what im doing but then a pair of hands found his throat and the apologies stopped short wondering who he should tell and indeed what boswell started to walk away from the ymca dressed in just a pair of gym shorts and odd socks never feeling so thankful to be cold in his life his legs felt weak but surely that was to be expected charlie woke with the most ridiculous idea he thought hed murdered ellen then cut off his own hand what a hotbed of nonsense his subconscious was to invent such fictions he tried to rub the sleep from his eyes but there was no hand there to rub with he sat bolt upright in bed and began to yell the room down yapper had left young rafferty to watch over the victim of this brutal mutilation with strict instructions to alert him as soon as charlie came around rafferty had been asleep the yelling woke him charlie looked at the boys face so awestruck so shocked he stopped screaming at the sight of it he was scaring the poor fellow youre awake said rafferty ill fetch someone shall i charlie looked at him blankly stay where you are said rafferty ill get the nurse charlie put his bandaged head back on the crisp pillow and looked at his right hand flexing it working the muscles this way and that whatever delusion had overtaken him back at the house it was well over now the hand at the end of the arm was his probably always had been his jeudwine had told him about the bodyinrebellion syndrome the murderer who claims his limbs have a life of their own rather than accepting responsibility for his deeds the rapist who mutilates himself believing the cause is the errant member not the mind behind the member well he wasnt going to pretend he was insane and that was the simple truth of it let them do whatever they had to do to him with their drugs blades and electrodes hed acquiesce to it all rather than live through another night of horrors like the last there was a nurse in attendance she was peering at him as though surprised hed survived a fetching face he half thought a lovely cool hand on his brow is he fit to be interviewed rafferty timidly asked i have to consult with dr manson and dr jeudwine the fetching face replied and tried to smile reassuringly at charlie it came out a bit cockeyed that smile a little forced she obviously knew he was a lunatic that was why she was scared of him probably and who could blame her she left his side to find the consultant leaving charlie to the nervous stare of rafferty ellen he said in a while your wife the young man replied yes i wondered did she rafferty fidgeted his thumbs playing tag on his lap shes dead he said charlie nodded hed known of course but he needed to be certain what happens to me now he asked youre under surveillance what does that mean it means im watching you said rafferty the boy was trying his best to be helpful but all these questions were confounding him charlie tried again i mean what comes after the surveillance when do i stand trial why should you stand trial why said charlie had he heard correctly youre a victim a flicker of confusion crossed raffertys face arent you you didnt do it you were done to somebody cut off your hand yes said charlie it was me rafferty swallowed hard before saying pardon i did it i murdered my wife then i cut off my own hand the poor boy couldnt quite grasp this one he thought about it a full halfminute before replying but why charlie shrugged it doesnt make any sense said rafferty i mean for one thing if you did it wheres the hand gone lillian stopped the car there was something in the road a little way in front of her but she couldnt quite make out what it was she was a strict vegetarian and a dedicated animal conservationist and she thought maybe some injured animal was lying in the road just beyond the sprawl of her headlights a fox perhaps shed read they were creeping back into outlying urban areas born scavengers but something made her uneasy maybe the queasy predawn light so elusive in its illumination she wasnt sure whether she should get out of the car or not theodore would have told her to drive straight on of course but then theodore had left her hadnt he her fingers drummed the wheel with irritation at her own indecision suppose it was an injured fox there werent so many in the middle of london that one could afford to pass by on the other side of the street she had to play the samaritan even if she felt a pharisee cautiously she got out of the car and of course after all of that there was nothing to be seen she walked to the front of the car just to be certain her palms were wet spasms of excitement passed through her hands like small electric shocks then the noise the whisper of hundreds of tiny feet shed heard storiesabsurd stories shed thoughtof migrant rat packs crossing the city by night and devouring to the bone any living thing that got in their way imagining rats she felt more like a pharisee than ever and stepped back toward the car as her long shadow thrown forward by the headlights shifted it revealed the first of the pack it was no rat a hand a longfingered hand ambled into the yellowish light and pointed up at her its arrival was followed immediately by another of the impossible creatures then a dozen more and another dozen hard upon those they were massed like crabs at the fishmongers glistening backs pressed close to each other legs flicking and clicking as they gathered in ranks sheer multiplication didnt make them any more believable but even as she rejected the sight they began to advance upon her she took a step back she felt the side of the car at her back turned and reached for the door it was ajar thank god the spasms in her hands were worse now but she was still mistress of them as her fingers sought the door she let out a little cry a fat black fist was squatting on the handle its open wrist a twist of dried meat spontaneously and atrociously her hands began to applaud she suddenly had no control over their behavior they clapped like wild things in appreciation of this coup it was ludicrous what she was doing but she couldnt stop herself stop it she told her hands stop it stop it abruptly they stopped and turned look at her she knew they were looking at her in their eyeless fashion sensed too that they were weary of her unfeeling way with them without warning they darted for her face her nails her pride and joy found her eyes in moments the miracle of sight was muck on her cheek blinded she lost all orientation and fell backward but there were bands aplenty to catch her she felt herself supported by a sea of fingers as they tipped her outraged body into a ditch her wig which had cost theodore so much in vienna came off so after the minimum of persuasion did her hands dr jeudwine came down the stairs of the george house wondering if maybe the grand pappy of his sacred profession freud had been wrong the paradoxical facts of human behavior didnt seem to fit into those neat classical compartments hed allotted them to perhaps attempting to be rational about the human mind was a contradiction in terms he stood in the gloom at the bottom of the stairs not really wanting to go back into the dining room or the kitchen but feeling obliged to view the scenes of the crimes one more time the empty house gave him the creeps and being alone in it even with a policeman standing guard on the front step didnt help his peace of mind he felt guilty felt hed let charlie down clearly he hadnt trawled charlies psyche deeply enough to bring up the real catch the true motive behind the appalling acts that he had committed to murder his own wife whom he had professed to love so deeply in their marital bed then to cut off his own hand it was unthinkable jeudwine looked at his own hands for a moment at the tracery of tendons and purpleblue veins at his wrist the police still favored the intruder theory but he had no doubt that charlie had done the deedsmurder mutilation and all the only fact that appalled jeudwine more was that he hadnt uncovered the slightest propensity for such acts in his patient he went into the dining room forensic had finished its work around the house there was a light dusting of fingerprint powder on a number of the surfaces it was a miracle the way each human hand was different its whorls as unique as a voice pattern or a face he yawned hed been woken by charlies call in the middle of the night and he hadnt had any sleep since then hed watched as charlie was bound up and taken away watched the investigators about their business watched a codwhite dawn raise its head over toward the river hed drunk coffee moped thought deeply about giving up his position as psychiatric consultant before this story hit the news drunk more coffee thought better of resignation and now despairing of freud or any other guru was seriously contemplating a bestseller on his relationship with wifemurderer charles george that way even if he lost his job hed have found something to salvage from the whole sorry episode and freud viennese charlatan what did the old opium eater have to tell anyone he slumped in one of the diningroom chairs and listened to the hush that had descended on the house as though the walls shocked by what theyd seen were holding their breaths maybe he dozed off a moment in sleep he heard a snapping sound dreamed of a dog and woke up to see a cat in the kitchen a fat blackandwhite cat charlie had mentioned this household pet in passing what was it named heartburn that was it so named because of the black smudges over its eyes which gave it a perpetually fretful expression the cat was looking at the spillage of blood on the kitchen floor apparently trying to find a way to skirt the pool and reach its food bowl without having to dabble its paws in the mess its master had left behind him jeudwine watched it fastidiously pick its way across the kitchen floor and sniff at its empty bowl it didnt occur to him to feed the thing he hated animals well he decided there was no purpose to be served in staying in the house any longer hed performed all the acts of repentance he intended felt as guilty as he was capable of feeling one more quick look upstairs just in case hed missed a clue then hed leave he was back at the bottom of the stairs before he heard the cat squeal squeal no more like shriek hearing the cry his spine felt like a column of ice down the middle of his back as chilled as ice as fragile hurriedly he retraced his steps through the hall into the dining room the cats head was on the carpet being rolled along by twoby two hands he looked beyond the game and into the kitchen where a dozen more beasts were scurrying over the floor back and forth some were on the top of the cabinet sniffing around others climbing the mockbrick wall to reach the knives left on the rack oh charlie he said gently chiding the absent maniac what have you done his eyes began to swell with tears not for charlie but for the generations that would come when he jeudwine was silenced simpleminded trusting generations who would put their faith in the efficacy of freud and the holy writ of reason he felt his knees beginning to tremble and he sank to the dining room carpet his eyes too full now to see clearly the rebels that were gathering around him sensing something alien sitting on his lap he looked down and there were his own two hands their index fingers were just touching tip to manicured tip slowly with horrible intention in their movement the index fingers raised their nailed heads and looked up at him then they turned and began to crawl up his chest finding finger holds in each fold of his italian jacket in each buttonhole the ascent ended abruptly at his neck and so did jeudwine charlies left hand was afraid it needed reassurance it needed encouragementin a word it needed right after all right had been the messiah of this new age the one with a vision of a future without the body now the army left had mounted needed a glimpse of that vision or it would soon degenerate into a slaughtering rabble if that happened defeat would swiftly follow such was the conventional wisdom of revolutions so left had led them back home looking for charlie in the last place it had seen him a vain hope of course to think he would have gone back there but it was an act of desperation circumstance however had not deserted the insurgents although charlie hadnt been there dr jeudwine had and jeudwines hands not only knew where charlie had been taken but the route there and the very bed he was lying in bqswell hadnt really known why he was running or to where his critical faculties were on hold his sense of geography utterly confused but some part of him seemed to know where he was going even if he didnt because he began to pick up speed once he came to the bridge and then the jog turned into a run that took no account of his burning lungs or his thudding head still innocent of any intention but escape he now realized that he had skirted the station and was running parallel with the railway line he was simply going wherever his legs carried him and that was the beginning and end of it the train came suddenly out of the dawn it didnt whistle didnt warn perhaps the driver noticed him but probably not even if he had the man could not have been held responsible for subsequent events no it was all his own fault the way his feet suddenly veered toward the track and his knees buckled so that he fell across the line boswells last coherent thought as the wheels reached him was that the train was merely passing from a to b and in passing would neatly cut off his legs between groin and knee then he was under the wheelsthe carriages hurtling by above himand the train let out a whistle which swept him away into the dark they brought the black kid into the hospital just after six the hospital day began early and deepsleeping patients were being stirred from their dreams to face another long and tedious day cups of gray defeated tea were being thrust into resentful hands temperatures were being taken medication distributed the boy and his terrible accident caused scarcely a ripple charlie was dreaming again not one of his upper nile dreams courtesy of the hollywood hills not imperial rome or the slave ships of phoenicia this was something in black and white he dreamed he was lying in his coffin ellen was there and his mother and his father indeed his whole life was in attendance somebody came to kindly screw down the lid on his coffin and he tried to alert the mourners to the fact that he was still alive when they didnt hear him panic set in but no matter how much he shouted the words made no impression all he could do was lie there and let them seal him up in that terminal bedroom the dream jumped a few grooves now he could hear the service moaning on somewhere above his head man hath but a short time to live he heard the creak of the ropes and the shadow of the grave seemed to darken the dark he was being let down into the earth still trying his best to protest but the air was getting stuffy in this hole he was finding it more and more difficult to breathe much less yell his complaints he could just manage to haul a stale shiver of air through his aching sinuses but his mouth seemed stuffed with something flowers perhaps and he couldnt move his head to spit them out now he could feel the thump of clod on coffin and christ alive if he couldnt hear the sound of worms at either side of him licking their chops his heart was pumping fit to burst his face he was sure must be blueblack with the effort of trying to find breath then miraculously there was somebody in the coffin with him somebody fighting to pull the constriction out of his mouth off his face mr george she was saying this angel of mercy he opened his eyes in the darkness it was the nurse from that hospital hed been inshe was in the coffin too mr george she was panicking this model of calm and patience she was almost in tears as she fought to drag his hand off his face youre suffocating yourself she shouted in his face other arms were helping with the fight now and they were winning it took three nurses to remove his hand but they succeeded charlie began to breathe again a glutton for air are you all right mr george he opened his mouth to reassure the angel but his voice had momentarily deserted him he was dimly aware that his hand was still putting up a fight at the end of his arm wheres jeudwine he gasped get him please the doctor is unavailable at the moment but hell be coming to see you later on in the day i want to see him now dont worry mr george the nurse replied her bedside manner reestablished well just give you a mild sedative and then you can sleep awhile no yes mr george she replied firmly dont worry youre in good hands i dont want to sleep any more they have control over you when youre asleep dont you see youre safe here he knew better he knew he wasnt safe anywhere not now not while he still had a hand it was not under his control any longer if indeed it had ever been perhaps it was just an illusion of servitude it bad created these fortyodd years a performance to lull him into a false sense of autocracy all this he wanted to say but none of it would fit into his mouth instead he just said no more sleep but the nurse had procedures the ward was already too full of patients and with more coming in every hour all she could do was sedate the distressed and get on with the business of the day just a mild sedative she said again and the next moment she had a needle in her hand spitting slumber just listen a moment he said trying to initiate a reasoning process with her but she wasnt available for debate now dont be such a baby she chided as tears started you dont understand he explained as she prodded up the vein at the crook of his arm you can tell dr jeudwine everything when he comes to see you the needle was in his arm the plunger was plunging no he said and pulled away the nurse hadnt expected such violence the patient was up and out of bed before she could complete the plunge the hypo still dangling from his arm mr george she said sternly will you please get back into bed charlie pointed at her with his stump dont come near me he said she tried to shame him all the other patients are behaving well she said why cant you charlie shook his head the hypo having worked its way out of his vein fell to the floor still threequarters full i will not tell you again damn right you wont said charlie he bolted away down the ward his escape egged on by patients to the right and left of him go boy go somebody yelled the nurse gave belated chase but at the door an instant accomplice intervened literally throwing himself in her way charlie was out of sight and lost in the corridors before she was up and after him again it was an easy place to lose yourself in he soon realized the hospital had been built in the late nineteenth century then added to as funds and donations allowed a wing in another after the first world war more wards in the fifties and the chaney memorial wing in the place was a labyrinth theyd take an age to find him the problem was he didnt feel so good the stump of his left arm had begun to ache as his painkillers wore off and he had the distinct impression that it was bleeding under the bandages in addition the quarter hypo of sedative had slowed his system down he felt slightly stupid and he was certain that his condition must show on his face but he was not going to allow himself to be coaxed back into that bed back into sleep until hed sat down in a quiet place somewhere and thought the whole thing through he found refuge in a tiny room off one of the corridors lined with filing cabinets and piles of reports it smelled slightly damp hed found his way into the memorial wing though he didnt know it the sevenstory monolith had been built with a bequest from millionaire frank chaney and the tycoons own building firm had done the construction job as the old mans will required they had used substandard materials and a defunct drainage system which was why chaney had died a millionaire and the wing was crumbling from the basement up sliding himself into a clammy niche between two of the cabinets well out of sight should somebody chance to come in charlie crouched on the floor and interrogated his right hand well he demanded in a reasonable tone explain yourself it played dumb no use he said im on to you still it just sat there at the end of his arm innocent as a babe you tried to kill me he accused it now the hand opened a little without his instruction and gave him the once over you could try if again couldnt you ominously it began to flex its fingers like a pianist preparing for a particularly difficult solo yes it said i could any old time in fact theres very little i can do to stop you is there charlie said sooner or later youll catch me unawares cant have somebody watching over me for the rest of my life so where does that leave me i ask myself as good as dead wouldnt you say the hand closed down a little the puffy flesh of its palm crinkling into grooves of pleasure yes it was saying youre done for poor fool and theres not a thing you can do you killed ellen i did the hand smiled you severed my other hand so it could escape am i right you are said the hand i saw it you know charlie said i saw it running off and now you want to do the same thing am i correct you want to be up and away correct youre not going to give me any peace are you till youve got your freedom right again so said charlie i think we understand each other and im willing to do a deal with you the hand came closer to his face crawling up his pajama shirt conspiratorial ill release you he said it was on his neck now its grip not tight but cozy enough to make him nervous ill find a way i promise a guillotine a scalpel i dont know what it was rubbing itself on him like a cat now stroking him but you have to do it my way in my time because if you kill me youll have no chance of survival will you theyll just bury you with me the way they buried dads hands the hand stopped stroking and climbed up the side of the filing cabinet do we have a deal said charlie but the hand was ignoring him it had suddenly lost all interest in bargain making if it had possessed a nose it would have been sniffing the air in the space of the last few moments things had changedthe deal was off charlie got up clumsily and went to the window the glass was dirty on the inside and caked with several years of bird droppings on the outside but he could just see the garden through it it had been laid out in accordance with the terms of the millionaires bequest a formal garden that would stand as as glorious a monument to his good taste as the building was to his pragmatism but since the building had started to deteriorate the garden had been left to its own devices its few trees were either dead or bowed under the weight of unpruned branches the borders were rife with weeds the benches on their backs with their square legs in the air only the lawn was kept mowed a small concession to care somebody a doctor taking a moment out for a quiet smoke was wandering among the strangled walks otherwise the garden was empty but charlies hand was up at the glass scrabbling at it raking at it with his nails vainly trying to get to the outside world there was something out there besides chaos apparently you want to go out said charlie the hand flattened itself against the window and began to bang its palm rhythmically against the glass a drummer for an unseen army he pulled it away from the window not knowing what to do if he denied its demands it could hurt him if he acquiesced to it and tried to get out into the garden what might he find on the other hand what choice did he have all right he said were going the corridor outside was bustling with panicky activity and there was scarcely a glance in his direction despite the fact that he was only wearing his regulation pajamas and was barefoot bells were ringing loudspeakers summoning this doctor or that grieving people being shunted between mortuary and toilet there was talk of the terrible sights in casualty boys with no hands dozens of them charlie moved too fast through the throng to catch a coherent sentence it was best to look intent he thought to look as though he had a purpose and a destination it took him a while to locate the exit into the garden and he knew his hand was getting impatient it was flexing and unflexing at his side urging him on then a signto the chaney trust memorial gardenand he turned a corner into a backwater corridor devoid of urgent traffic with a door at the far end that led to the open air it was very still outside not a bird in the air or on the grass not a bee whining among the flowerbeds even the doctor had gone back to his surgeries presumably charlies hand was in ecstasy now it was sweating so much it dripped and all the blood left it so that it had paled to white it didnt seem to belong to him anymore it was another being to which he by some unfortunate quirk of anatomy was attached he would be delighted to be rid of it the grass was dewdamp underfoot and here in the shadow of the sevenstory block it was cold it was still only sixthirty maybe the birds were still asleep the bees still sluggish in their hives maybe there was nothing in this garden to be afraid of only rotheaded roses and early worms turning somersaults in the dew maybe his hand was wrong and there was just morning out here as he wandered farther down the garden he noticed the footprints of the doctor darker on the silvergreen lawn just as he arrived at the tree and the grass turned red he realized that the prints led one way only boswell in a willing coma felt nothing and was glad of it his mind dimly recognized the possibility of waking but the thought was so vague it was easy to reject once in a while a sliver of the real world would skitter behind his lids alight for a moment then flutter away boswell wanted none of it he didnt want consciousness ever again he had a feeling about what it would be to wake about what was waiting for him out there kicking its heels charlie looked up into the branches the tree had borne two amazing kinds of fruit one was a human being the surgeon with the cigarette he was dead his neck lodged in a cleft where two branches met he had no hands his arms ended in round wounds that still drained heavy clots of brilliant color down on to the grass above his head the tree swarmed with that other fruit more unnatural still the hands were everywhere it seemed hundreds of them chattering away like a manual parliament as they debated their tactics all shades and shapes scampering up and down the swaying branches seeing them gathered like this the metaphors collapsed they were what they were human hands that was the horror charlie wanted to run but his right hand was having none of it these were its disciples gathered here in such abundance and they awaited its parables and its prophecies charlie looked at the dead doctor and then at the murdering hands and thought of ellen his ellen killed through no fault of his own and already cold theyd pay for that crimeall of them as long as the rest of his body still did him service he d make them pay it was cowardice trying to bargain with this cancer at his wrist he saw that now it and its like were a pestilence they had no place living the army had seen him word of his presence passing through the ranks like wildfire they were surging down the trunk some dropping like ripened apples from the lower branches eager to embrace the messiah in a few moments they would be swarming over him and all advantage would be lost it was now or never he turned away from the tree before his right hand could seize a branch and looked up at the chaney memorial wing seeking inspiration the tower loomed over the garden windows blinded by the sky doors closed there was no solace there behind him he heard the whisper of the grass as it was trodden by countless fingers they were already on his heels all enthusiasm asthey came following their leader of course they would come he realized wherever he led they would come perhaps their blind adoration of his remaining hand was an exploitable weakness he scanned the building a second time and his desperate gaze found the fire escape it zigzagged up the side of the building to the roof he made a dash for it surprising himself with his turn of speed there was no time to look behind him to see if they were following he had to trust to their devotion within a few paces his furious hand was at his neck threatening to take out his throat but he sprinted on indifferent to its clawing he reached the bottom of the fire escape and lithe with adrenaline took the metal steps two and three at a time his balance was not so good without a hand to hold the safety railing but so what if be was bruised it was only his body at the third landing he risked a glance down through the grille of the stairs a crop of fresh flowers was carpeting the ground at the bottom of the fire escape and was spreading up the stairs toward him they were coming in their hungry hundreds all nails and hatred let them come he thought let the bastards come i began this and i can finish it at the windows of the chaney memorial wing a host of faces had appeared panicking disbelieving voices drifted up from the lower floors it was too late now to tell them his life story they would have to piece that together for themselves and what a fine jigsaw it would make maybe in their attempts to understand what had happened this morning they would turn up some plausible solution an explanation for this uprising that he had not found but he doubted it fourth story now and stepping on to the fifth his right hand was digging into his neck maybe he was bleeding but then perhaps it was rain warm rain that splashed onto his chest and down his legs two storys to go then the roof there was a hum in the metalwork beneath him the noise of their myriad feet as they clambered up toward him he had counted on their adoration and hed been right to do so the roof was now just a dozen steps away and he risked a second look down past his body to see the fire escape solid with hands like aphids clustered on the stalk of a flower no that was metaphor again an end to that the wind whipped across the heights and it was fresh but charlie had no time to appreciate its promise he climbed over the twofoot parapet and onto the gravellined roof corpse of pigeons lay in puddles cracks snaked across the concrete a bucket marked soiled dressings lay on its side its contents green he started across this wilderness as the first of the army fingered their way over the parapet the pain in his throat was getting through to his racing brain now as his treacherous fingers wormed at his windpipe he had little energy left after the race up the fire escape and crossing the roof to the opposite side was difficult he stumbled once and again all the strength had gone from his legs and nonsense filled his head in place of coherent thought a koan a buddhist riddle hed seen on the cover of a book once was itching in his memory what is the sound it began but he couldnt complete the phrase try as he might what is the sound forget the riddles he ordered himself pressing his trembling legs to make another step and then another he almost fell against the parapet at the opposite side of the roof and stared down it was a straight fall a parking lot lay below at the front of the building it was deserted he leaned over further and drops of his blood fell from his lacerated neck diminishing quickly down down to wet the ground im coming he said to gravity and to ellen and thought how good it would be to die and never worry again if his gums bled when he brushed his teeth or his waistline swelled or some beauty passed him on the street whose lips he wanted to kiss and never would and suddenly the army was up on him swarming up his legs in a fever of victory you can come he said as they obscured his body from head to foot witless in their enthusiasm you can come wherever i go what is the sound the phrase was on the tip of his tongue oh yes now it came to him what is the sound of one hand clapping it was so satisfying to remember something you were trying so hard to dig up out of your subconscious like finding some trinket you thought youd lost forever the thrill of remembering sweetened his last moments he pitched himself into empty space falling over and over until there was a sudden end to dental hygiene and the beauty of young women they came in a rain after him breaking on the concrete around his body wave upon wave of them throwing themselves to their deaths in pursuit of their messiah to the patients and nurses crammed at the windows it was a scene from a world of wondersa rain of frogs would have been commonplace beside it it inspired more awe than terror it was fabulous too soon it stopped and after a minute or so a few brave souls ventured out among the litter to see what could be seen there was a great deal and yet nothing it was a rare spectacle of coursehorrible unforgettable but there was no significance to be discovered in it merely the paraphernalia of a minor apocalypse nothing to be done but to clear it up their own hands reluctantly compliant as the corpses were catalogued and boxed for further examination a few of those involved in the operation found a private moment in which to pray for explanations or at least for dreamless sleep even the smattering of the agnostics on the staff were surprised to discover how easy it was to put palm to palm in his private room in intensive care boswell came to he reached for the bell beside his bed and pressed it but nobody answered somebody was in the room with him hiding behind the screen in the corner he had heard the shuffling of the intruders feet he pressed the bell again but there were bells ringing everywhere in the building and nobody seemed to be answering any of them using the cabinet beside him for leverage he hauled himself to the edge of his bed to get a better view of this joker come out he murmured through dry lips but the bastard was biding his time come on i know youre there he pulled himself a little farther and somehow all at once he realized that his center of balance had radically altered that he had no legs that he was going to fall out of bed he flung out his arms to save his head from striking the floor and succeeded in so doing the breath had been knocked out of him however dizzy he lay where hed fallen trying to orient himself what had happened where were his legs in the name of jah where were his legs his bloodshot eyes scanned the room and came to rest on the naked feet which were now a yard from his nose a tag around the ankle marked them for the furnace he looked up and they were his legs standing there severed between groin and knee but still alive and kicking for a moment he thought they intended to do him harm but no having made their presence known to him they left him where he lay content to be free and did his eyes envy their liberty he wondered and was his tongue eager to be out of his mouth and away and was every part of him in its subtle way preparing to forsake him he was an alliance only held together by the most tenuous of truces now with the precedent set how long before the next uprising minutes years he waited heart in mouth for the fall of empire revelations here had been talk of tornadoes in amarillo of cattle cars and sometimes entire houses lifted up and dashed to the earth again of whole communities laid waste in a few devastating moments perhaps that was what made virginia so uneasy tonight either that or the accumulated fatigue of traveling so many empty highways with just the deadpan skies of texas for scenery and nothing to look forward to at the end of the next leg of the journey but another round of hymns and hellfire she sat her spine aching in the back of the black pontiac and tried her best to get some sleep but the hot still air clung about her thin neck and gave her dreams of suffocation so she gave up her attempts to rest and contented herself with watching the wheat fields pass and counting the grain elevators bright against the thunderheads that were beginning to gather in the northeast in the front of the vehicle earl sang to himself as he drove beside her johnno more than two feet away from her but to all intents and purposes a million miles distancestudied the epistles of st paul murmuring the words as he read then as they drove through pantex village the rain began it came down suddenly as evening was beginning to fall lending darkness to darkness almost instantly plunging the amarillopampa highway into watery night virginia rolled up her window the rain though refreshing was soaking her plain blue dress the only one john approved of her wearing at meetings now there was nothing to look at beyond the glass she sat the unease growing in her with every mile they covered to pampa listening to the vehemence of the downpour on the roof of the car and to her husband speaking in whispers at her side wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and rise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil he sat as ever upright the same dogeared softbacked bible hed been using for years open in his lap he surely knew the passages he was reading by heart he quoted them often enough and with such a mixture of familiarity and freshness that the words might have been his not pauls newly minted from his own mouth that passion and vigor would in time make john gyer americas greatest evangelist virginia had no doubt of that during the grueling hectic weeks of the tristate tour her husband had displayed unprecedented confidence and maturity his message had lost none of its vehemence with this newfound professionalismit was still that oldfashioned mixture of damnation and redemption that he always propoundedbut now he had complete control of his gifts in town after townin oklahoma and new mexico and now in texasthe faithful had gathered to listen by the hundreds and thousands eager to come again into gods kingdom in pampa thirtyfive miles from here they would already be assembling despite the rain determined to have a grand stand view when the crusader arrived they would have brought their children their savings and most of all their hunger for forgiveness but forgiveness was for tomorrow first they had to get to pampa and the rain was worsening earl had given up his singing once the storm began and was concentrating all his attention on the road ahead sometimes he would sigh to himself and stretch in his seat virginia tried not to concern herself with the way he was driving but as the torrent became a deluge her anxiety got the better of her she leaned forward from the backseat and started to peer through the windshield watching for vehicles coming in the opposite direction accidents were common in conditions like these bad weather and a tired driver eager to be twenty miles further down the road than he was at her side john sensed her concern the lord is with us he said riot looking up from the tightly printed pages though it was by now far too dark for him to read its a bad night john she said maybe we shouldnt try to go all the way to pampa earl must be tired im fine earl put in its not that far youre tired virginia repeated we all are well we could find a motel i guess gyer suggested what do you think earl earl shrugged his sizeable shoulders whatever you say boss he replied not putting up much of a fight gyer turned to his wife and gently patted the back of her hand well find a motel he said earl can call ahead to pampa and tell them that well be with them in the morning hows that she smiled at him but he wasnt looking at her i think white deers next off the highway earl told virginia maybe theyll have a motel in fact the cottonwood motel lay a half mile west of white deer in an area of waste ground south of us a small establishment with a dead or dying cottonwood tree in the lot between its two low buildings there were a number of cars already in the motel parking lot and lights burning in most of the rooms fellow fugitives from the storm presumably earl drove into the lot and parked as close to the managers office as possible then made a dash across the rainlashed ground to find out if the place had any rooms for the night with the engine stilled the sound of the rain on the roof of the pontiac was more oppressive than ever i hope theres space for us virginia said watching the water on the window smear the neon sign gyer didnt reply the rain thundered on overhead talk to me john she said to him what for she shook her head never mind strands of hair clung to her slightly clammy forehead though the rain had come the heat in the air had not lifted i hate the rain she said it wont last all night gyer replied running a hand through his thick gray hair it was a gesture he used on the platform as punctuation a pause between one momentous statement and the next she knew his rhetoric both physical and verbal so well sometimes she thought she knew everything about him there was to know that he had nothing left to tell her that she truly wanted to hear but then the sentiment was probably mutual they had long ago ceased to have a marriage recognizable as such tonight as every night on this tour they would lie in separate beds and he would sleep that deep easy sleep that came so readily to him while she surreptitiously swallowed a pill or two to bring some welcome serenity sleep he had often said is a time to commune with the lord he believed in the efficacy of dreams though he didnt talk of what he saw in them the time would come when he would unveil the majesty of his visions she had no doubt of that but in the meantime he slept alone and kept his counsel leaving her to whatever secret sorrows she might have it was easy to be bitter but she fought the temptation his destiny was manifest it was demanded of him by the lord if he was fierce with her he was fiercer still with himself living by a regime that would have destroyed lesser men and still chastizing himself for his pettiest act of weakness at last earl appeared from the office and crossed back to the car at a run he had three keys rooms seven and eight he said breathlessly the rain dripping off his brow and nose i got the key to the interconnecting door too good said gyer last two in the place he said ill drive the car around the rooms are in the other building the interior of the two rooms was a hymn to banality theyd stayed in what seemed like a thousand cells like these identical down to the sickly orange bedcovers and the lightfaded print of the grand canyon on the pale green walls john was insensitive to his surroundings and always had been but to virginias eyes these rooms were an apt model for purgatory soulless limbos in which nothing of moment had ever happened nor ever would there was nothing to mark these rooms out as different from all the others but there was something different in her tonight it wasnt talk of tornadoes that had brought this strangeness on she watched earl tomg and froing with the bags and felt oddly removed from herself as though she were watching events through a veil denser than the warm rain falling outside the door she was almost sleepwalking when john quietly told her which bed would be hers for tonight she lay down and tried to control her sense of dislocation by relaxing it was easier said than done somebody had a television on in a nearby room and the latenight movie was wordforword clear through the paperthin walls are you all right she opened her eyes earl ever solicitous was looking down at her he looked as weary as she felt his face deeply tanned from standing in the sun at the openair rallies looked yellowish rather than its usual healthy brown he was slightly overweight too though this bulk married well with his wide stubborn features yes im fine thank you she said a little thirsty ill see if i can get something for you to drink they probably have a coke machine she nodded meeting his eyes there was a subtext to this exchange which gyer who was sitting at the table making notes for tomorrows speech could not know on and off throughout the tour earl had supplied virginia with pills nothing exotic just tranquilizers to soothe her increasingly jangled nerves but theylike stimulants makeup and jewelrywere not looked kindly upon by a man of gyers principles and when by chance her husband had discovered the drugs there had been an ugly scene earl had taken the brunt of his employers ire for which virginia was deeply grateful and though he was under strict instructions never to repeat the crime he was soon supplying her again their guilt was an almost pleasurable secret between them she read complicity in his eyes even now as he did in hers no cocacola gyer said well i thought we could make an exception exception gyer said his voice taking on a characteristic note of selfregard rhetoric was in the air and earl cursed his idiot tongue the lord doesnt give us laws to live by so that we can make exceptions earl you know better than that at that moment earl didnt much care what the lord did or said his concern was for virginia she was strong he knew despite her deep south courtesy and the accompanying facade of frailty strong enough to bring them all through the minor crises of the tour when the lord had failed to step in and help his agents in the field but nobodys strength was limitless and he sensed that she was close to collapse she gave so much to her husband of her love and admiration of her energies and enthusiasm more than once in the past few weeks earl had thought that perhaps she deserved better than the man in the pulpit maybe you could get me some ice water she said looking up at him with lines of fatigue beneath her grayblue eyes she was not by contemporary standards beautiful her features were too flawlessly aristocratic exhaustion though lent them new glamour ice water coming right up earl said forcing a jovial tone that he had little strength to sustain he went to the door why dont you call the office and have someone bring it over gyer suggested as earl made to leave i want to go through next weeks itinerary with you its no problem earl said really besides i should call pampa and tell them were delayed and he was out of the door and onto the walkway before he could be contradicted he needed an excuse to have some time to himself the atmosphere between virginia and gyer was deteriorating by the day and it was not a pleasant spectacle he stood for a long moment watching the rain sheet down the cottonwood tree in the middle of the lot hung its balding head in the fury of the deluge he knew exactly how it felt as he stood on the walkway wondering how he would be able to keep his sanity in the last eight weeks of the tour two figures walked from the highway and crossed the lot he didnt see them though the path they took to room seven led them directly across his line of vision they walked through the drenching rain from the waste ground behind the managers officewhere back in they had parked their red buickand though the rain fell in a steady torrent it left them both untouched the woman whose hairstyle had been in and out of fashion twice since the fifties and whose clothes had the same period look slowed for a moment to stare at the man who was watching the cottonwood tree with such rapt attention he had kind eyes despite his frown in her time she might have loved such a man she thought but then her time had long gone hadnt it buck her husband turned back to herare you coming sadie he wanted to knowand she followed him onto the concrete walkway and through the open door of room seven a chill ran down earls back too much staring at the rain he thought that and too much fruitless longing he walked to the end of the patio steeled himself for the dash across the lot to the office and counting to three ran sadie durning glanced over her shoulder to watch earl go then looked back at buck the years had not tempered the resentment she felt toward her husband any more than theyd improved his shifty features or his tooeasy laugh she had not much liked him on june and she didnt much like him now precisely thirty years on buck durning had the soul of a philanderer as her father had always warned her that in itself was not so terrible it was perhaps the masculine condition but it had led to such grubby behavior that eventually she had tired of his endless deceptions heunknowing to the lasthad taken her low spirits as a cue for a second honeymoon this phenomenal hypocrisy had finally overridden any lingering thoughts of tolerance or forgiveness she might have entertained and when three decades ago tonight they had checked into the cottonwood motel she had come prepared for more than a night of love she had let buck shower and when he emerged she had leveled the smith and wesson at him and blown a gaping hole in his chest then shed run throwing the gun away as she went knowing the police were bound to catch her and not much caring when they theyd taken her to carson county jail in panhandle and after a few weeks to trial she never once tried to deny the murder thered been enough deception in her thirtyeight years of life as it was and so when they found her defiant they took her to huntsville state prison chose a bright day the following october and summarily passed volts through her body stopping her unrepentant heart almost instantaneously an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth she had been brought up with such simple moral equations shed not been unhappy to die by the same mathematics but tonight she and buck had elected to retrace the journey theyd taken thirty years before to see if they could discover how and why their marriage had ended in murder it was a chance offered to many dead lovers though few apparently took it up perhaps the thought of experiencing again the cataclysm that had ended their lives was too distasteful sadie however couldnt help but wonder if it had all been predestined if a tender word from buck or a look of genuine affection in his murky eyes could have stayed her trigger finger and so saved both their lives this onenight stand would give them an opportunity to test history invisible inaudible they would follow the same route as they had three decades ago the next few hours would tell if that route had led inevitably to murder room seven was occupied and so was the room beside it the interconnecting door was wide and fluorescent lights burned in both the occupancy was not a problem sadie had long become used to the ethereal state to wandering unseen among the living in such a condition she had attended her nieces wedding and later on her fathers funeral standing beside the grave with the dead old man and gossiping about the mourners buck howevernever an agile individualwas more prone to carelessness she hoped he would be careful tonight after all he wanted to see the experiment through as much as she did as they stood on the threshold and cast their eyes around the room in which their fatal farce had been played out she wondered if the shot had hurt him very much she must ask him tonight she thought should the opportunity arise there had been a young woman with a plain but pleasant face in the managers office when earl had gone in to book the rooms she had now disappeared to be replaced by a man of sixty or so wearing half a weeks growth of mottled beard and a sweatstained shirt he looked up from a noseclose perusal of yesterdays pampa daily news when earl entered yeah is it possible to get some ice water earl inquired the man threw a hoarse yell over his shoulder laura may you in there through the doorway behind came the din of the latenight movieshots screams the roar of an escaped beastand then laura mays response what do you want pa theres a man wants room service laura mays father yelled back not without a trace of irony in his voice will you get out here and serve him no reply came just more screams they set earls teeth on edge the manager glanced up at him one of his eyes was clouded by a cataract you with the evangelist he said yes how did you know it was laura may recognized him seen his picture in the paper that so dont miss a trick my baby as if on cue laura may emerged from the room behind the office when her brown eyes fell on earl she visibly brightened oh she said a smile quickening her features what can i do for you mister the line coupled with her smile seemed to signal more than polite interest in earl or was that just his wishful thinking except for a lady of the night hed met in pomca city oklahoma his sex life had been nonexistent in the last three months taking a chance he returned laura mays smile though she was at least thirtyfive her manner was curiously girlish the look she was giving him almost intimidating direct meeting her eyes earl began to think that his first estimation had not been far off ice water he said i wondered if you had any mrs gyer isnt feeling so well laura may nodded ill get some she said dallying for a moment in the door before returning into the television room the din of the movie had abateda scene of calm perhaps before the beast emerged againand in the hush earl could hear the rain beating down outside turning the earth to mud quite a gully washer tonight eh the manager observed this keeps up youll be rained out tomorrow people come out in all kinds of weather earl said john gyers a big draw the man pulled a face wouldnt rule out a tornado he said clearly reveling in the role of doomsayer were just about due for one really year before last wind took the roof off the school just lifted it right off laura may reappeared in the doorway with a tray on which a jug and four glasses were placed ice clinked against the jugs sides whats that you say pa she asked tornado isnt hot enough she announced with casual authority her father grunted his disagreement but made no argument in return laura may crossed toward earl with the tray but when he made a move to take it from her she said ill take it myself you lead on he didnt object it would give them a little while to exchange pleasantries as they walked to the gyers room perhaps the same thought was in her mind either that or she wanted a closer view of the evangelist they went together as far as the end of the office block walkway in silence there they halted before them lay twenty yards of puddlestrewn earth between one building and the next shall i carry the jug earl volunteered you bring the glasses and the tray sure she replied then with the same direct look shed given him before she said whats your name earl he told her earl rayburn im laura may cade im most pleased to meet you laura may you know about this place do you she said papa told you i suppose you mean the tornadoes he asked no she replied i mean murder sadie stood at the bottom of the bed and looked at the woman lying on it she has very little dresssense sadie thought the clothes were drab and her hair wasnt fixed in a flattering way she murmured something in her semi comatose state and thenabruptlyshe woke her eyes opened wide there was some unshaped alarm in them and pain too sadie looked at her and sighed whats the problem buck wanted to know hed put down the cases and was sitting in a chair opposite the fourth occupant of the room a large man with lean forceful features and a mane of steelgray hair that would not have shamed an old testament prophet no problem sadie replied i dont want to share a room with these two buck said well this is the room where where we stayed sadie replied lets move next door buck suggested nodding through the open door into room eight well have more privacy they cant see us sadie said but i can see them buck replied and it gives me the creeps its not going to matter if were in a different room for christs sake without waiting for agreement from sadie buck picked up the cases and carried them through into earls room are you coming or not he asked sadie she nodded it was better to give way to him if she started to argue now theyd never get past the first hurdle conciliation was to be the keynote of this reunion she reminded herself and dutifully followed him into room eight on the bed virginia thought about getting up and going into the bathroom where out of sight she could take one or two tranquilizers but johns presence frightened her sometimes she felt he could see right into her that all her private guilt was an open book to him she was certain that if she got up now and rooted in her bag for the medication he would ask her what she was doing if he did that shed blurt the truth out for sure she didnt have the strength to resist the heat of his accusing eyes no it would be better to lie here and wait for earl to come back with the water then when the two men were discussing the tour she would slip away to take the forbidden pills there was an evasive quality to the light in the room it distressed her and she wanted to close her lids against its tricks only moments before the light had conjured a mirage at the end of the bed a mothwing flicker of substance that had almost congealed in the air before flitting away over by the window john was again reading under his breath at first she caught only a few of the words and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth she instantly recognized the passage its imagery was unmistakable and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power the verse was from the revelations of st john the divine she knew the words that followed by heart he had declaimed them time after time at meetings and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads gyer loved revelations he read it more often than the gospels whose stories he knew by heart but whose words did not ignite him the way the incantatory rhythms of revelations did when he preached revelations he shared the apocalyptic vision and felt exulted by it his voice would take on a different note the poetry instead of coming out of him came through him helpless in its grip he rose on a spiral of ever more awesome metaphor from angels to dragons and thence to babylon the mother of harlots sitting upon a scarletcolored beast virginia tried to shut the words out usually to hear her husband speak the poems of revelations was a joy to her but not tonight tonight the words seemed ripe to the point of corruption and she sensedperhaps for the first timethat he didnt really understand what he was saying that the spirit of the words passed him by while he recited them she made a small unintentional noise of complaint gyer stopped reading what is it he said she opened her eyes embarrassed to have interrupted him nothing she said does my reading disturb you he wanted to know the inquiry was a challenge and she backed down from it no she said no of course not in the doorway between the two rooms sadie watched virginias face the woman was lying of course the words did disturb her they disturbed sadie too but only because they seemed so pitifully melodramatic a drugdream of armageddon more comical than intimidating tell him she advised virginia go on tell him you dont like it who are you talking to buck said they cant hear you sadie ignored her husbands remarks go on she said to virginia tell the bastard but virginia lust lay there while gyer took up the passage again its absurdities escalating and the shapes of the locusts were unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions sadie shook her head comicbook terrors fit to scare children with why did people have to die to grow out of that kind of nonsense tell him she said again tell him how ridiculous he sounds even as the words left her lips virginia sat up on the bed and said john sadie stared at her willing her on say it say it do you have to talk about death all the time its very depressing sadie almost applauded it wasnt quite the way she would have put it but each to their own what did you say gyer asked her assuming hed heard incorrectly surely she wasnt challenging him virginia put a trembling hand up to her lips as if to cancel the words before they came again but they came nevertheless those passages you read i hate them theyre so stupid sadie prompted unpleasant virginia said are you coming to bed or not buck wanted to know in a moment sadie replied over her shoulder i just want to see what happens in here life isnt a soap opera buck chimed in sadie was about to beg to differ but before she had a chance the evangelist had approached virginias bed bible in hand this is the inspired word of the lord virginia he said i know john but there are other passages i thought you liked the apocalypse no she said it distresses me youre tired he replied oh yes sadie interjected thats what they always tell you when you get too close to the truth youre tired they say why dont you take a little nap why dont you sleep for a while gyer said ill go next door and work virginia met her husbands condescending look for fully five seconds then nodded yes she conceded i am tired foolish woman sadie told her fight back or hell do the same again give them an inch and they take half the damn state buck appeared behind sadie ive asked you once he said taking her arm we re here to make friends so lets get to it he pulled her away from the door rather more roughly than was necessary she shrugged off his hand theres no need for violence buck she said ha thats rich coming from you buck said with a humorless laugh you want to see violence sadie turned away from virginia to look at her husband this is violence he said he had taken off his jacket now he pulled his unbuttoned shirt open to reveal the shot wound at such close quarters sadies had made a sizeable hole in bucks chest scorched and bloody it was as fresh as the moment he died he put his finger to it as if indicating the sacred heart you see that sweetheart mine you made that she peered at the hole with no little interest it certainly was a permanent mark about the only one shed ever made on the man she suspected you cheated from the beginning didnt you she said were not talking about cheating were talking about shooting buck returned seems to me one subject leads to the other sadie replied and back again buck narrowed his already narrow eyes at her dozens of women had found that look irresistible to judge by the numbers of anonymous mourners at his funeral all right he said i had women so what so i shot you for it sadie replied flatly that was about all she had to say on the subject it had made for a short trial well at least tell me youre sorry buck burst out sadie considered the proposition for a few moments and said but im not she realized the response lacked tact but it was the unavoidable truth even as theyd strapped her into the electric chair with the priest doing his best to console her lawyer she hadnt regretted the way things had turned out this whole thing is useless buck said we came here to make peace and you cant even say youre sorry youre a sick woman you know that you always were you pried into my business you snooped around behind my back i did not snoop sadie replied firmly your dirt came and found me dirt oh yes buck dirt it always was with you furtive and sweaty he grabbed hold of her take that back he demanded you used to frighten me once she replied coolly but then i bought a gun he thrust her away from him all right he said dont say i didnt try i wanted to see if we could forgive and forget i really did but youre not willing to give an inch are you he fingered his wound as he spoke his voice softening we could have had a good time here tonight babe he murmured just you and me i could have given you a bit of the old jazz you know what i mean time was you wouldnt have said no she sighed softly what he said was true time was she would have taken what little he gave her and counted herself a blessed woman but times had changed come on babe loosen up he said smokily and began to unbutton his shirt completely pulling it out of his trousers his belly was bald as a babys what say we forget what you said and lie down and talk she was about to reply to his suggestion when the door of room seven opened and in came the man with the soulful eyes accompanied by a woman whose face rang a bell in sadies memory ice water earl said sadie watched him move across the room thered not been a man as fine as that in wichita falls not that she could remember anyway he almost made her want to live again are you going to get undressed buck asked from the room behind her in a minute buck weve got all night for christs sake im laura may cade the woman with the familiar face said as she set the ice water down on the table of course thought sadie youre little laura may the girl had been five or six when sadie was last here an odd secretive child full of sly looks the intervening years had matured her physically but the strangeness was still in evidence in her slightly offcenter features sadie turned to buck who was sitting on the bed untying his shoes remember the little girl she said the one who you gave a quarter to just to make her go away what about her shes here that so he replied clearly uninterested laura may had poured the water and was now taking the glass across to virginia its real nice having you folks here she said we dont get much happening here just the occasional tornado gyer nodded to earl who produced a fivedollar bill and gave it to laura may she thanked him saying it wasnt necessary then took the bill she wasnt to be bribed into leaving however this kind of weather makes people feel real peculiar she went on earl could predict what subject was hovering behind laura mays lips hed already heard the bones of the story on the way across and knew virginia was in no mood to hear such a tale thank you for the water he said putting a hand on laura mays arm to usher her through the door but gyer cut in my wifes been suffering from heat exhaustion he said you should be careful maam laura may advised virginia people do some mighty weird things like what virginia asked dont think we earl began but before he could say want to hear laura may casually replied oh murder mostly virginia looked up from the glass of ice water in which her focus had been immersed murder she said hear that said sadie proudly she remembers in this very room laura may managed to blurt before earl forcibly escorted her out wait virginia said as the two figures disappeared through the door earl i want to hear what happened no you dont gyer told her oh yes she does said sadie very quietly studying the look on virginias face youd really like to know wouldnt you ginnie for a moment pregnant with possibilities virginia looked away from the outside door and stared straight through into room eight her eyes seeming to rest on sadie the look was so direct it could almost have been one of recognition the ice in her glass tinkled she frowned whats wrong gyer asked her virginia shook her head i asked you what was wrong gyer insisted virginia put down her glass on the bedside table after a moment she said very simply theres somebody here john what do you mean theres somebody in the room with us i heard voices before raised voices next door gyer said no from earls room its empty it must have been next door virginia was not to be silenced with logic i heard voices i tell you and i saw something at the end of the bed something in the air oh my jesus said sadie under her breath the goddamn womans psychic buck stood up he was naked now but for his shorts he wandered over to the interconnecting door to look at virginia with new appreciation are you sure he said hush sadie told him moving out of virginias line of vision she said she could see us youre not well virginia gyer was saying in the next room its those pills he fed you no virginia replied her voice rising when will you stop talking about the pills they were just to calm me down help me sleep she certainly wasnt calm now thought buck he liked the way she trembled as she tried to hold back her tears she looked in need of some of the old jazz did poor virginia now that would help her sleep i tell you i can see things she was telling her husband that i cant gyer replied incredulously is that what youre saying that you can see visions the rest of us are blind to im not proud of it damn you she yelled at him incensed by this inversion come away buck sadie said were upsetting her she knows were here so what buck responded her prick of a husband doesnt believe her look at him he thinks shes crazy well well make her crazy if we parade around said sadie at least lets keep our voices down huh buck looked around at sadie and offered up a dirty rag of a smile want to make it worth my while he said sleazily ill keep out of the way if you and me can have some fun sadie hesitated a moment before replying it was probably perverse to reject bucks advances the man was an emotional infant and always had been sex was one of the few ways he could express himself all right buck she said just let me freshen up and fix my hair an uneasy truce had apparently been declared in room seven im going to take a shower virginia gyer said i suggest you lie down and stop making a fool of yourself you go talking like that in front of people and youll jeopardize the crusade you hear me virginia looked at her husband with clearer sight than shed ever enjoyed before oh yes she said without a trace of feeling in her voice i hear you he seemed satisfied he slipped off his jacket and went into the bathroom taking his bible with him she heard the door lock and then exhaled a long queasy sigh there would be recriminations aplenty for the exchange theyd just had he would squeeze every last drop of contrition from her in the days to come she glanced around at the interconnecting door there was no longer any sign of those shadows in the air not the least whisper of lost voices perhaps just perhaps she had imagined it she opened her bag and rummaged for the bottles of pills hidden there one eye on the bathroom door she selected a cocktail of three varieties and downed them with a gulp of ice water in fact the ice in the jug had long since melted the water she drank down was tepid like the rain that fell relentlessly outside by morning perhaps the whole world would have been washed away if it had she mused she wouldnt grieve i asked you not to mention the killing earl told laura may mrs gyer cant take that kind of talk people are getting killed all the time laura may replied unfazed cant go around with her head in a bucket earl said nothing they had just gotten to the end of the walkway the return sprint across the lot to the other building was ahead laura may turned to face him she was several inches the shorter of the two her eyes turned up to his were large and luminous angry as he was he couldnt help but notice how full her mouth was how her lips glistened im sorry she said i didnt mean to get you into trouble sure i know im lust edgy its the heat she returned like i said puts thoughts into peoples heads you know her look wavered for a moment a hint of uncertainty crossed her face earl could feel the back of his neck tingle this was his cue wasnt it shed offered it unequivocally but the words failed him finally it was she who said do you have to go back there right now he swallowed his throat was dry dont see why he said i mean i dont want to get between them when theyre having words with each other bad blood she asked i think so im best leaving them to sort it out in peace they dont want me laura may looked down from earls face well i do she breathed the words scarcely audible above the thump of the rain he put a cautious hand to her face and touched the down of her cheek she trembled ever so slightly then he bent his head to kiss her she let him brush her lips with his why dont we go to my room she said against his mouth i dont like it out here what about your papa hell be dead drunk by now its the same routine every night just take it quietly hell never know earl wasnt very happy with this game plan it was more than his job was worth to be found in bed with laura may he was a married man even if he hadnt seen barbara in three months laura may sensed his trepidation dont come if you dont want to she said its not that he replied as he looked down at her she licked her lips it was a completely unconscious motion he felt sure but it was enough to decide him in a sense though he couldnt know it at the time all that lay aheadthe farce the bloodletting the inevitable tragedypivoted on laura may wetting her lower lip with such casual sensuality ah shit he said youre too much you know that he bent to her and kissed her again while somewhere over toward skellytown the clouds gave out a loud roll of thunder like a circus drummer before some particularly elaborate acrobatics in room seven virginia was having bad dreams the pills had not secured her a safe harbor in sleep instead shed been pitched into a howling tempest in her dreams she was clinging to a crippled treea pitiful anchor in such a maelstromwhile the wind threw cattle and automobiles into the air sucking half the world up into the pitch black clouds that boiled above her head just as she thought she must die here utterly alone she saw two figures a few yards from her appearing and disappearing in the blinding veils of dust the wind was stirring up she couldnt see their faces so she called to them who are you next door sadie heard virginia talking in her sleep what was the woman dreaming about she wondered she fought the temptation to go next door and whisper in the dreamers ear however behind virginias eyelids the dream raged on though she called to the strangers in the storm they seemed not to hear her rather than be left alone she forsook the comfort of the treewhich was instantly uprooted and whirled awayand battled through the biting dust to where the strangers stood as she approached a sudden lull in the wind revealed them to her one was male the other female both were armed as she called to them to make herself known they attacked each other opening fatal wounds in neck and torso murder she shouted as the wind spattered her face with the antagonists blood for gods sake somebody stop them murder and suddenly she was awake her heart beating fit to burst the dream still flitted behind her eyes she shook her head to rid herself of the horrid images then moved groggily to the edge of the bed and stood up her head felt so light it might float off like a balloon she needed some fresh air seldom in her life had she felt so strange it was as though she was losing her slender grip n what was real as though the solid world were slipping through her fingers she crossed to the outside door in the bathroom she could hear john speaking aloudaddressing the mirror no doubt to refine every detail of his delivery she stepped out onto the walkway there was some refreshment to be had out here but precious little in one of the rooms at the end of the block a child was crying as she listened a sharp voice silenced it for maybe ten seconds the voice was hushed then it began again in a higher key go on she told the child you cry theres plenty of reason she trusted unhappiness in people more and more it was all she trusted sadness was so much more honest than the artificial bonhomie that was all the style these days that facade of emptyheaded optimism that was plastered over the despair that everyone felt in their heart of hearts the child was expressing that wise panic now as it cried in the night she silently applauded its honesty in the bathroom john gyer tired of the sight of his own face in the mirror and gave some time over to thought he put down the toilet lid and sat in silence for several minutes he could smell his own stale sweat he needed a shower and then a good nights sleep tomorrow pampa meetings speeches thousands of hands to be shaken and blessings to be bestowed sometimes he felt so tired and then hed get to wondering if the lord couldnt lighten his burden a little but that was the devil talking in his ear wasnt it he knew better than to pay that scurrilous voice much attention if you listened once the doubts would get a hold the way they had of virginia somewhere along the road while his back had been turned about the lords business shed lost her way and the old one had found her wandering he john gyer would have to bring her back to the path of the righteous make her see the danger her soul was in there would be tears and complaints maybe she would be bruised a little but bruises healed he put down his bible and went down on his knees in the narrow space between the bath and the towel rack and began to pray he tried to find some benign words a gentle prayer to ask for the strength to finish his task and to bring virginia back to her senses but mildness had deserted him it was the vocabulary of revelations that came back to his lips unbidden he jet the words spill out even though the fever in him burned brighter with every syllable he spoke what do you think laura may had asked earl as she escorted him into her bedroom earl was too startled by what was in front of him to offer any coherent reply the bedroom was a mausoleum founded it seemed in the name of trivia laid out on the shelves hung on the walls and covering much of the floor were items that might have been picked out of any garbage can empty coke cans collections of ticket stubs coverless and defaced magazines vandalized toys shattered mirrors postcards never sent letters never reada limping parade of the forgotten and the forsaken his eye passed back arid forth over the elaborate display and found not one item of worth among the junk and bricabrac yet all this inconsequential had been arranged with meticulous care so that no one piece masked another andnow that he looked more closelyhe saw that every item was numbered as if each had its place in some system of junk the thought that this was all laura mays doing shrank earls stomach the woman was clearly verging on lunacy this is my collection she told him so i see he replied ive been collecting since i was six she crossed the room to the dressing table where most women earl had known would have arranged their toiletries but here were arrayed more of the same inane exhibits everybody leaves something behind you know laura may said to earl picking up some piece of dreck with all the care others might bestow on a precious stone and examining it before placing it back in its elected position is that so earl said oh yeah everyone even if its only a dead match or a tissue with lipstick on it we used to have a mexican girl ophelia who cleaned the rooms when i was a child it started as a game with her really shed always bring me something belonging to the guests whod left when she died i took over collecting stuff for myself always keeping something as a memento earl began to grasp the absurd poetry of the museum in laura mays neat body was all the ambition of a great curator not for her mere art she was collecting keepsakes of a more intimate nature forgotten signs of people whod passed this way and who most likely she would never see again youve got it all marked he observed oh yes she replied it wouldnt be much use if i didnt know who it all belonged to would it earl supposed not incredible he murmured quite genuinely she smiled at him he suspected she didnt show her collection to many people he felt oddly honored to be viewing it ive got some really prize things she said opening the middle drawer of the dressing table stuff i dont put on display oh he said the drawer shed opened was lined with tissue paper which rustled as she brought forth a selection of special acquisitions a soiled tissue found beneath the bed of a hollywood star who had tragically died six weeks after staying at the motel a heroin needle carelessly left by x an empty book of matches which she had traced to a homosexual bar in amarillo discarded by y the names she mentioned meant little or nothing to earl but he played the game as he felt she wanted it played mingling exclamations of disbelief with gentle laughter her pleasure fed by his grew she took him through all the exhibits in the dressingtable drawer offering some anecdote or biographical insight with every one when she had finished she said i wasnt quite telling you the truth before when i said it began as a game with ophelia that really came later so what started you off he asked she went down on her haunches and unlocked the bottom drawer of the dressing table with a key on a chain around her neck there was only one artifact in this drawer this she lifted out almost reverentially and stood up to show him whats this you asked me what started the collection she said this is it i found it and i never gave it back you can look if you want she extended the prize toward him and he unfolded the pressed white cloth the object had been wrapped up in it was a gun a smith and wesson in pristine condition it took him only a moment to realize which motel guest this piece of history had once belonged to the gun that sadie durning used he said picking it up am i right she beamed i found it in the scrub behind the motel before the police got to searching for it there was such a commotion you know nobody looked twice at me and of course they didnt try and look for it in the light why was that the tornado hit just the day after took the motel roof right off blew the school away people were killed that year we had funerals for weeks they didnt question you at all i was a good liar she replied with no small satisfaction and you never owned up to having it all these years she looked faintly contemptuous of the suggestion they might have taken it off me she said but its evidence they executed her anyway didnt they she replied sadie admitted to it all right from the beginning it wouldnt have made any difference if theyd found the murder weapon or not earl turned the gun over in his hand there was encrusted dirt on it thats blood laura may informed him it was still wet when i found it she must have touched bucks body to make sure he was dead only used two bullets the rest are still in there earl had never much liked weapons since his brotherinlaw had blown off three of his toes in an accident the thought that the was still loaded made him yet more apprehensive he put it back in its wrapping and folded the cloth over it ive never seen anything like this place he said as laura may kneeled to return the gun to the drawer youre quite a woman you know that she looked up at him her hand slowly slid up the front of his trousers im glad you like what you see she said sadie are you coming to bed or not i just want to finish fixing my hair youre not playing fair forget your hair and come over here in a minute shit youre in no hurry are you buck i mean youre not going anywhere she caught his reflection in the mirror he gave her a sour glance you think its funny dont you he said think whats funny what happened me getting shot you getting the chair it gives you some perverse satisfaction she thought about this for a few moments it was the first time buck had shown any real desire to talk seriously she wanted to answer with the truth yes she said when she was certain that was the answer yes i suppose it did please me in an odd sort of way knew it said buck keep your voice down sadie snapped shell hear us shes gone outside i heard her and dont change the subject he rolled over and sat on the edge of the bed the wound did look painful sadie thought did it hurt much she asked turning to him are you kidding he said displaying the hole for her what does it fucking look like i thought it would be quick l never wanted you to suffer is that right buck said of course i loved you once buck i really did you know what the headline was the day after no buck replied i was otherwise engaged remember motel becomes slaughterhouse of love it said there were pictures of the room of the blood on the floor and you being carried out under a sheet my finest hour he said bitterly and i dont even get my face in the press ill never forget the phrase slaughterhouse of love i thought it was romantic dont you buck grunted in disgust sadie went on anyway i got three hundred proposals of marriage while i was waiting for the chair did i ever tell you that oh yeah buck said did they come and visit you give you a bit of the old jazz to keep your mind off the big day no said sadie frostily you could have had a time of it i would have im sure you would she replied just thinking about its getting me cooking sadie why dont you come and get it while its hot we came here to talk buck we talked for christs sake he said i dont want to talk no more now come here you promised he rubbed his abdomen and gave her a crooked smile sorry about the blood and all but i aint responsible for that sadie stood up now youre being sensible he said as sadie durning crossed to the bed virginia came in out of the rain it had cooled her face somewhat and the tranquilizers shed taken were finally beginning to soothe her system in the bathroom john was still praying his voice rising and falling she crossed to the table and glanced at his notes but the tightly packed words wouldnt come into focus she picked up the papers to peer more closely at them as she did so she heard a groan from the next room she froze the groan came again louder the papers trembled in her hands she made to put them back on the table but the voice came a third time and this time the papers slipped from her hand give a little damn you the voice said the words though blurred were unmistakable more grunts followed virginia moved toward the door between the rooms the trembling spreading up from her hands to the rest of her body play the game will you the voice came again there was anger in it cautiously virginia looked through into room eight holding onto the door lintel for support there was a shadow on the bed it writhed distressingly as if attempting to devour itself she stood rooted to the spot trying to stifle a cry while more sounds rose from the shadow not one voice this time but two the words were jumbled in her growing panic she could make little sense of them she couldnt turn her back on the scene however she stared on trying to make some sense of the shifting configuration now a smattering of words came clear and with them a recognition of the event on the bed she heard a womans voice protesting now she even began to see the speaker struggling beneath a partner who was attempting to arrest her flailing arms her first instinct about the scene had been correct it was a devouring of a kind sadie looked up into bucks face that bastard grin of his had returned it made her trigger finger itch this is what hed come for tonight not for conversation about failed dreams but to humiliate her the way he had so often in the past whispering obscenities into her neck while he pinned her to the sheets the pleasure he took in her discomfort made her seethe let go of me she shouted louder than shed intended at the door virginia said let her alone weve got an audience buck durning grinned pleased by the appalled look on virginias face sadie took advantage of his diverted attention she slipped her arm from his grasp and pushed him off her he rolled off the narrow bed with a yell as she stood up she looked around at the ashen woman in the doorway how much could virginia see or hear enough to know who they were buck was climbing over the bed toward his sometime murderer come on he said its only the crazy lady keep away from me sadie warned you cant harm me now woman im already dead remember his exertions had opened the gunshot wound there was blood smeared all over him over her too now she saw she backed toward the door there was nothing to be salvaged here what little chance of reconciliation there had been had degenerated into a bloody farce the only solution to the whole sorry mess was to get out and leave poor virginia to make what sense of it she could the longer she stayed to fight with buck the worse the situation would become for all three of them where are you going buck demanded out she responded away from you i said i loved you buck didnt i well maybe i did but im cured now bitch goodbye buck have a nice eternity worthless bitch she didnt reply to his insults she simply walked through the door and out into the night virginia watched the shadow pass through the closed door and held on to the tattered remains of her sanity with whiteknuckled fists she had to put these apparitions out of her head as quickly as possible or she knew shed go crazy she turned her back on room eight what she needed now was pills she picked up her handbag only to drop it again as her shaking fingers rooted for the bottles depositing the contents of the bag onto the floor one of the bottles which she had failed to seal properly spilled a rainbow assortment of tablets rolled across the stained carpet in every direction she bent to pick them up tears had started to come blinding her she felt for the pills as best she could feeding half a handful into her mouth and trying to swallow them dry the tattoo of the rain on the roof sounded louder and louder in her head a roll of thunder gave weight to the percussion and then johns voice what are you doing virginia she looked up tears in her eyes a pillladen hand hovering at her lips shed forgotten her husband entirely the shadows and the rain and the voices had driven all thought of him from her head she let the pills drop back to the carpet her limbs were shaking she didnt have the strength to stand up i i heard the voices again she said his eyes had come to rest on the spilled contents of bag and bottle her crime was spread for him to see quite plainly it was useless to try and deny anything it would only enrage him further woman he said havent you learned your lesson she didnt reply thunder drowned his next words he repeated them more loudly where did you get the pills virginia she shook her head weakly earl again i suppose who else no she murmured dont lie to me virginia he had raised his voice to compete with the storm you know the lord hears your lies as i hear them and you are judged virginia judged please leave me be she pleaded youre poisoning yourself i need them john she told him i really do she had no energy to hold his bullying at bay nor did she want him to take the pills from her but then what was the use of protesting he would have his way as always it would be wiser to give up the booty now and save herself unnecessary anguish look at yourself he said groveling on the floor dont start on me john she replied you win take the pills go on take them he was clearly disappointed by her rapid capitulation like an actor preparing for a favorite scene only to find the curtain rung down prematurely but he made the most of her invitation upending her handbag on the bed and collecting the bottles is this all he demanded yes she said i wont be deceived virginia thats all she shouted back at him then more softly i swear thats all earl will be sorry i promise you that hes exploited your weakness no your weakness and your fear the man is in satans employ that much is apparent dont talk nonsense she said surprising herself with her own vehemence i asked him to supply them she got to her feet with some difficulty he didnt want to defy you john it was me all along gyer shook his head no virginia you wont save him not this time hes worked to subvert me all along i see that now worked to harm my crusade through you well im wise to him now oh yes oh yes he suddenly turned and pitched the handful of bottles through the open door and into the rainy darkness outside virginia watched them fly and felt her heart sink there was precious little sanity to be had on a night like thisit was a night for going crazy wasnt it with the rain bruising your skull and murder in the airand now the damn fool had thrown away her last chance of equilibrium he turned back to her his prefect teeth bared how many times do you have to be told he was not to be denied his scene after all it seemed im not listening she told him clamping her hands over her ears even so she could hear the rain i wont listen im patient virginia he said the lord will have his judgment in the fullness of time now wheres earl she shook her head thunder came again she wasnt sure if it was inside or out where is he he boomed at her gone for more of the same filth no she yelled back i dont know where hes gone you pray woman gyer said you get down on your knees and thank the lord im here to keep you from satan content that his words made a striking exit line he headed out in search of earl leaving virginia shaking but curiously elated he would be back of course there would be more recriminations and from her the obligatory tears as to earl he would have to defend himself as best he could she slumped down on the bed and her bleary eyes came to rest on the tablets that were still scattered across the floor all was not quite lost there were no more than two dozen so she would have to be sparing in her use of them but they were better than nothing at all wiping her eyes with the back of her hands she kneeled down again to gather the pills up as she did so she realized that someone had their eyes on her not the evangelist back so soon she looked up the door out to the rain was still wide open but he wasnt standing there her heart seemed to lose its rhythm for a moment as she remembered the shadows in the room next door there had been two one had departed but the other her eyes slid across to the interconnecting door it was there a greasy smudge that had taken on a new solidity since last shed set eyes on it was it that the apparition was gaining coherence or that she was seeing it in more detail it was quite clearly human and just as apparently male it was staring at her she had no doubt of that she could even see its eyes when she concentrated her tenuous grasp of its existence was improving it was gaining fresh resolution with every trembling breath she took she stood up very slowly it took a step through the interconnecting door she moved toward the outside door and it matched her move with one of its own sliding with eerie speed between her and the night her outstretched arm brushed against its smoky form and as if illuminated by a lightning flash an entire portrait of her accoster sprang into view in front of her only to disappear as she withdrew her hand she had glimpsed enough to appall her however the vision was that of a dead man his chest had been blown open was this more of her dream spilling into the living world she thought of calling after john to summon him back but that meant approaching the door again and risking contact with the apparition instead she took a cautious step backward reciting a prayer beneath her breath as she did so perhaps john had been correct all along perhaps she had invited this lunacy to herself with the very tablets she was even now treading to powder underfoot the apparition closed in on her was it her imagination or had it opened its arms as if to embrace her her heel caught on the skirt of the coverlet before she could stop herself she was toppling backward her arms flailed seeking support again she made contact with the dreamthing again the whole horrid picture appeared in front of her but this time it didnt disappear because the apparition had snatched at her hand and was grasping it tight her fingers felt as though theyd been plunged into ice water she yelled for it to let her be flinging up her free arm to push her assailant away but it simply grasped her other hand too unable to resist she met its gaze they were not the devils eyes that looked at herthey were slightly stupid even comical eyesand below them a weak mouth which only reinforced her impression of witlessness suddenly she was not afraid this was no demon it was a delusion brought on by exhaustion and pills it could do her no harm the only danger here was that she hurt herself in her attempts to keep the hallucinations at bay buck sensed that virginia was losing the will to resist thats better he coaxed her you just want a bit of the old jazz dont you ginnie he wasnt certain if she heard him but no matter he could readily make his intentions apparent dropping one of her hands he ran his palm across her breasts she sighed a bewildered expression in her beautiful eyes but she made no effort to resist his attentions you dont exist she told him plainly youre only in my mind like john said the pills made you the pills did it all buck let the woman babble let her think whatever she pleased as long as it made her compliant thats right isnt it she said youre not real are you he obliged her with a polite reply certainly he said squeezing her im just a dream thats all the answer seemed to satisfy her no need to fight me is there he said ill have come and gone before you know it the managers office lay empty from the room beyond it gyer heard a television it stood to reason that earl must be somewhere in the vicinity he bad left their room with the girl whod brought the ice water and they certainly wouldnt be taking a walk together in weather like this the thunder had moved in closer in the last few minutes now it was almost overhead gyer enjoyed the noise and the spectacle of the lightning it fueled his sense of occasion earl he yelled making his way through the office and into the room with the television the late movie was nearing its climax the sound turned up deafeningly loud a fantastical beast of some kind was treading tokyo to rubble citizens fled screaming asleep in a chair in front of this papiermвchй apocalypse was a late middleaged man neither the thunder nor gyers calls had stirred him a tumbler of spirits nursed in his lap had slipped from his hand and stained his trousers the whole scene stank of bourbon and depravity gyer made a note of it for future use in the pulpit a chill blew in from the office gyer turned expecting a visitor but there was nobody in the office behind him he stared into space all the way across here hed had a sense of being followed yet there was nobody on his heels he canceled his suspicions fears like this were for women and old men afraid of the dark he stepped between the sleeping drunkard and the ruin of tokyo toward the closed door beyond earl he called out answer me sadie watched gyer open the door and step into the kitchen his bombast amazed her shed expected his subspecies to be extinct by now could such melodrama be credible in this sophisticated age shed never much liked church people but this example was particularly offensive there was more than a whiff of malice beneath the flatulence he was riled and unpredictable and he would not be pleased by the scene that awaited him in laura mays room sadie had already been there she had watched the lovers for a little while until their passion became too much for her and had driven her out to cool herself by watching the rain now the evangelists appearance drew her back the way shed come fearful that whatever was now in the air the nights events could not end well in the kitchen gyer was shouting again he clearly enjoyed the sound of his own voice earl you bear me im not to be cheated in laura mays room earl was attempting to perform three acts at the same time one kiss the woman he had just made love with two pull on his damp trousers and three invent an adequate excuse to offer gyer if the evangelist reached the bedroom door before some illusion of innocence had been created as it was he had no time to complete any of the tasks his tongue was still locked in laura mays tender mouth when the lock on the door was forced found you earl broke his kiss and turned toward the messianic voice gyer was standing in the doorway rainplastered hair a gray skull cap his face bright with fury the light thrown up on him from the silkdraped lamp beside the bed made him look massive the glint in his cometothelord eyes was verging on the manic earl had heard tell of the great mans righteous wrath from virginia furniture had been trashed in the past and bones broken is there no end to your iniquity he demanded to know the words coming with unnerving calm from between his narrow lips earl hoisted his trousers up fumbling for the zipper this isnt your business he began but gyers fury powdered the words on his tongue laura may was not so easily cowed you get out she said pulling a sheet up to cover her generous breasts earl glanced around at her at the smooth shoulders hed all too recently kissed he wanted to kiss them again now but the man in black crossed the room in four quick strides and took hold of him by hair and arm the movement in the confined space of laura mays room had the effect of an earth tremor pieces of her precious collection toppled over on the shelves and dressing table one exhibit falling against another and that against its neighbor until a minor avalanche of trivia hit the floor laura may was blind to any damage however her thoughts were with the man who had so sweetly shared her bed she could see the trepidation in earls eyes as the evangelist dragged him away and she shared it let him be she shrieked forsaking her modesty and getting up from the bed he hasnt done anything wrong the evangelist paused to respond earl wrestling uselessly to free himself what would you know about error whore gyer spat at her youre too steeped in sin you with your nakedness and your stinking bed the bed did stink but only of good soap and recent love she had nothing to apologize for and she wasnt going to let this twobit biblethumper intimidate her ill call the cops she warned if you dont leave him alone ill call them gyer didnt grace the threat with a reply he simply dragged earl out through the door and into the kitchen laura may yelled hold on earl ill get help her lover didnt answer he was too busy preventing gyer from pulling out his hair by the roots sometimes when the days were long and lonely laura may had daydreamed dark men like the evangelist she had imagined them coming before tornadoes wreathed in dust she had pictured herself lifted up by themonly half against her willand taken away but the man who had lain in her bed tonight had been utterly unlike her feverdream lovers he had been foolish and vulnerable if he were to die at the hands of a man like gyerwhose image she had conjured in her desperationshe would never forgive herself she heard her father say whats going on in the far room something fell and smashed a plate perhaps from off the dresser or a glass from his lap she prayed her papa wouldnt try and tackle the evangelist he would be chaff in the wind if he did she went back to the bed to root for her clothes they were wound up in the sheets and her frustration mounted with every second she lost searching for them she tossed the pillows aside one landed on the dressing table more of her exquisitely arranged pieces were swept to the floor as she pulled on her underwear her father appeared at the door his drinkflushed features turned a deeper red seeing her state what you been doing laura may never mind pa theres no time to explain but theres men out there i know i know i want you to call the sheriff in panhandle understand whats going on never mind just call alvin and be quick about it or were going to have another murder on our hands the thought of slaughter galvanized milton cade he disappeared leaving his daughter to finish dressing laura may knew that on a night like this alvin baker and his deputy could be a long time coming in the meanwhile god alone knew what the maddog preacher would be capable of from the doorway sadie watched the woman dress laura may was a plain creature at least to sadies critical eye and her fair skin made her look wan and insubstantial despite her full figure but then thought sadie who am i to complain of lack of substance look at me and for the first time in the thirty years since her death she felt a nostalgia for corporality in part because she envied laura may her bliss with earl and in part because she itched to have a role in the drama that was rapidly unfolding around her in the kitchen an abruptly sobered milton cade was blabbering on the phone trying to rouse some action from the people in panhandle while laura may who had finished dressing unlocked the bottom drawer of her dressing table and rummaged for something sadie peered over the womans shoulder to discover what the trophy was and a thrill of recognition made her scalp tingle as her eyes alighted on her so it was laura may who had found the gun the wheyfaced sixyearold who had been running up and down the walkway all that evening thirty years ago playing games with herself and singing songs in the hot still air it delighted sadie to see the murder weapon again maybe she thought i have left some sign of myself to help shape the future maybe i am more than a headline on a yellowed newspaper a dimming memory in aging heads she watched with new and eager eyes as laura may slipped on some shoes and headed out into the bellowing storm virginia sat slumped against the wall of room seven and looked across at the seedy figure leaning on the door lintel across from her she had let the delusion she had conjured have what way it would with her and never in her fortyodd years had she heard such depravity promised but though the shadow had come at her again and again pressing its cold body onto hers its icy slack mouth against her own it had failed to carry one act of violation through three times it had tried three times the urgent words whispered in her ear had not been realized now it guarded the door preparing she guessed for a further assault its face was clear enough for her to read the bafflement and the shame in its features it viewed her she thought with murder on its mind outside she heard her husbands voice above the din of the thunder and earls voice too raised in protest there was a fierce argument going on that much was apparent she slid up the wall trying to make out the words the delusion watched her balefully you failed she told it it didnt reply youre just a dream of mine and you failed it opened its mouth and waggled its pallid tongue she didnt understand why it hadnt evaporated but perhaps it would tag along with her until the pills had worked their way through her system no matter she had endured the worst it could offer now given time it would surely leave her be its failed rapes left it bereft of power over her she crossed toward the door no longer afraid it raised itself from its slouched posture where are you going it demanded out she said to help earl no it told her i havent finished with you youre just a phantom she retorted you cant stop me it offered up a grin that was three parts malice to one part charm youre wrong virginia buck said there was no purpose in deceiving the woman any longer hed tired of that particular game and perhaps hed failed to get the old jazz going because shed given herself to him so easily believing he was some harmless nightmare im no delusion woman he said im buck durning she frowned at the wavering figure was this a new trick her psyche was playing thirty years ago i was shot dead in this very room just about where youre standing in fact instinctively virginia glanced down at the carpet at her feet almost expecting the bloodstains to be there still we came back tonight sadie and i the ghost went on a onenight stand at the slaughterhouse of love thats what they called this place did you know that people used to come here from all over just to peer in at this very room just to see where sadie durning had shot her husband buck sick people virginia dont you think more interested in murder than love not me ive always liked love you know almost the only thing ive ever had much of a talent for in fact you lied to me she said you used me i havent finished yet buck promised in fact ive barely started he moved from the door toward her but she was prepared for him this time as he touched her and the smoke was made flesh again she threw a blow toward him buck moved to avoid it and she dodged past him toward the door her untied hair got in her eyes but she virtually threw herself toward freedom a cloudy hand snatched at her but the grasp was too tenuous and slipped ill be waiting buck called after her as she stumbled across the walkway and into the storm you hear me bitch ill be waiting he wasnt going to humiliate himself with a pursuit she would have to come back wouldnt she and he invisible to all but the woman could afford to bide his time if she told her companions what shed seen theyd call her crazy maybe lock her up where he could have her all to himself no he had a winner here she would return soaked to the skin her dress clinging to her in a dozen fetching ways panicky perhaps tearful too weak to resist his overtures theyd make music then oh yes until she begged him to stop sadie followed laura may out where are you going milton asked his daughter but she didnt reply jesus he shouted after her registering what hed seen whered you get the goddamn gun the rain was torrential it beat on the ground on the last leaves of the cottonwood on the roof on the skull it flattened laura mays hair in seconds pasting it to her forehead and neck earl she yelled where are you earl she began to run across the lot yelling his name as she went the rain had turned the dust to a deep brown mud it slopped up against her shins she crossed to the other building a number of guests already woken by gyers barrage watched her from their windows several doors were open one man standing on the walkway with a beer in his hand demanded to know what was going on people running around like crazies he said all this yelling we came here for some privacy for christs sake a girlfully twenty years his junioremerged from the room behind the beer drinker shes got a gun dwayne she said see that where did they go laura may asked the beer drinker who dwayne replied the crazies laura may yelled back above another peal of thunder they went around the back of the office dwayne said his eyes on the gun rather than laura may theyre not here really theyre not laura may doubled back toward the office building the rain and lightning were blinding and she had difficulty keeping her balance in the swamp underfoot earl she called are you there sadie kept pace with her the cade woman had pluck no doubt of that but there was an edge of hysteria in her voice which sadie didnt like too much this kind of business required detachment the trick was to do it almost casually as you might flick on the radio or swat a mosquito panic would only cloud the issue passion the same why when shed raised that and pointed it at buck thered been no anger to spoil her aim not a trace in the final analysis that was why theyd sent her to the chair not for doing it but for doing it too well laura may was not so cool her breath had become ragged and from the way she sobbed earls name as she ran it was clear she was close to the breaking point she rounded the back of the office building where the motel sign threw a cold light on the waste ground and this time when she called for earl there was an answering cry she stopped peering through the veil of rain it was earls voice as shed hoped but he wasnt calling to her bastard he was yelling youre out of your mind let me alone now she could make out two figures in the middle distance earl his paunchy torso spattered and streaked with mud was on his knees in among the soap weed and the scrub gyer stood over him his hands on earls head pressing it down toward the earth admit your crime sinner damn you no you came to destroy my crusade admit it admit it go to hell confess your complicity or so help me ill break every bone in your body earl fought to be free of gyer but the evangelist was easily the stronger of the two men pray he said pressing earls face into the mud pray go fuck yourself earl shouted back gyer dragged earls head up by the hair his other hand raised to deliver a blow to the upturned face but before he could strike laura may entered the fray taking three or four steps through the dirt toward them the held in her quaking hands get away from him she demanded sadie calmly noted that the womans aim was not all it could be even in clear weather she was probably no sharpshooter but here under stress in such a downpour who but the most experienced marksman could guarantee the outcome gyer turned and looked at laura may he showed not a flicker of apprehension hes made the same calculation ive just made sadie thought he knows damn well the odds are against him getting harmed the whore gyer announced turning his eyes heavenward do you see her lord see her shame her depravity mark her she is one of the court of babylon laura may didnt quite comprehend the details but the general thrust of gyers outburst was perfectly clear im no whore she yelled back the almost leaping in her hand as if eager to be fired dont you dare call me a whore please laura may earl said wrestling with gyer to get a look at the woman get out of here hes lost his mind she ignored the imperative if you dont let go of him she said pointing the gun at the man in black yes gyer taunted her what will you do whore ill shoot i will ill shoot over on the other side of the office building virginia spotted one of the pill bottles gyer had thrown out into the mud she stooped to pick it up and then thought better of the idea she didnt need pills any more did she shed spoken to a dead man her very touch had made buck durning visible to her what a skill that was her visions were real and always had been more true than all the secondhand revelations her pitiful husband could spout what could pills do but befuddle this newfound talent let them lie a number of guests had now donned jackets and emerged from their rooms to see what the commotion was all about has there been an accident a woman called to virginia as the words left her lips a shot sounded john virginia said before the echoes of the shot had died she was making her way toward their source she already pictured what she would find there her husband laid flat on the ground the triumphant assassin taking to his muddied heels she picked up her pace a prayer coming as she ran she prayed not that the scenario she had imagined was wrong but rather that god would forgive her for willing it to be true the scene she found on the other side of the building confounded all her expectations the evangelist was not dead he was standing untouched it was earl who lay flat on the miry ground beside him close by stood the woman whod come with the ice water hours earlier she had a gun in her hand it still smoked even as virginias eyes settled on laura may a figure stepped through the rain and struck the weapon from the womans hand it fell to the ground virginia followed the descent laura may looked startled she clearly didnt understand how shed come to drop the gun virginia knew however she could see the phantom albeit fleetingly and she guessed its identity this was surely sadie durning she whose defiance had christened this establishment the slaughterhouse of love laura mays eyes found earl she let out a cry of horror and ran towards him dont be dead earl i beg you dont be dead earl looked up from the mud bath hed taken and shook his head missed me by a mile he said at his side gyer had fallen to his knees hands clasped together face up to the driving rain oh lord i thank you for preserving this your instrument in his hour of need virginia shut out the idiot drivel this was the man who had convinced her so deeply of her own deluded state that shed given herself to buck durning well no more shed been terrorized enough shed seen sadie act upon the real world shed felt buck do the same the time was now ripe to reverse the procedure she walked steadily across to where the lay in the grass and picked it up as she did so she sensed the presence of sadie durning close by a voice so soft she barely heard it said is this wise in her ear virginia didnt know the answer to that question what was wisdom anyhow not the stale rhetoric of dead prophets certainly maybe wisdom was laura may and earl embracing in the mud careless of the prayers gyer was spouting or of the stares of the guests whod come running out to see whod died or perhaps wisdom was finding the canker in your life and rooting it out once and for all gun in hand she headed back toward room seven aware that the benign presence of sadie durning walked at her side not buck sadie whispered surely not he attacked me virginia said you poor lamb im no lamb virginia replied not anymore realizing that the woman was perfectly in charge of her destiny sadie hung back fearful that her presence would alert buck she watched as virginia crossed the lot past the cottonwood tree and stepped into the room where her tormentor had said he would be waiting the lights still burned bright after the blue darkness outside there was no sign of durning virginia crossed to the interconnecting door room eight was deserted too then the familiar voice you came back buck said she wheeled around hiding the gun from him he had emerged from the bathroom and was standing between her and the door i knew youd come back be said to her they always do i want you to show yourself virginia said im naked as a babe as it is said buck what do you want me to do skin myself might be fun at that show yourself to john my husband make him see his error oh poor john i dont think he wants to see me do you he thinks im insane insanity can be very useful buck smirked they almost saved sadie from old sparky on a plea of insanity but she was too honest for her own good she just kept telling them over and over i wanted him dead so i shot him she never had much sense but you now i think you know whats best for you the shadowy form shifted virginia couldnt quite make out what durning was doing with himself but it was unequivocally obscene come and get it virginia he said grubs up she took the from behind her back and leveled it at him not this time she said you cant do me any harm with that he replied im already dead remember you hurt me why shouldnt i be able to hurt you back buck shook his ethereal head letting out a low laugh as he was so engaged the wail of police sirens rose from down the highway well what do you know buck said such a fuss and commotion wed better get down to some jazzing honey before we get interrupted i warn you this is sadies gunyou wouldnt hurt me buck murmured i know you women you say one thing and you mean the opposite he stepped toward her laughing dont she warned he took another step and she pulled the trigger in the instant before she heard the sound and felt the gun leap in her hand she saw john appear in the doorway had he been there all along or was he coming out of the rain prayers done to read revelations to his erring wife she would never know the bullet sliced through buck dividing the smoky body as it went and sped with perfect accuracy toward the evangelist he didnt see it coming it struck him in the throat and blood came quickly splashing down his shirt bucks form dissolved like so much dust and he was gone suddenly there was nothing in room seven but virginia her dying husband and the sound of the rain john gyer frowned at virginia then reached out for the door frame to support his considerable bulk he failed to secure it and fell backward out of the door like a toppled statue his face washed by the rain the blood did not stop coming however it poured out in gleeful spurts and it was still pumping when alvin baker and his deputy arrived outside the room guns at the ready now her husband would never know she thought that was the pity of it he could never now be made to concede his stupidity and recant his arrogance not this side of the grave anyhow he was safe damn him and she was left with a smoking gun in her hand and god alone knew what price to pay put down the gun and come out of there the voice from the lot sounded harsh and uncompromising virginia didnt answer you hear me in there this is sheriff baker the place is surrounded so come on out or youre dead virginia sat on the bed and weighed up the alternatives they wouldnt execute her for what shed done the way they had sadie but shed be in prison for a long time and she was tired of regimes if she wasnt mad now incarceration would push her to the brink and over better to finish here she thought she put the warm under her chin tilting it to make sure the shot would take off the top of her skull is that wise sadie inquired as virginias finger tightened theyll lock me away she replied i couldnt face that true said sadie theyll put you behind bars for a while but it wont be for long you must be joking i just shot my husband in cold blood you didnt mean to sadie said brightly you were aiming at buck was i virginia said i wonder you can plead insanity the way i should have done just make up the most outrageous story you can and stick to it virginia shook her head shed never been much of a liar and when youre set free sadie went on youll be notorious thats worth living for isnt it virginia hadnt thought of that the ghost of a smile illuminated her face from outside sheriff baker repeated his demand that she throw her weapon through the door and come out with her hands high youve got ten seconds lady he said and i mean ten i cant face the humiliation virginia murmured i cant sadie shrugged pity she said the rains clearing theres a moon a moon really baker had started counting you have to make up your mind sadie said theyll shoot you given half the chance and gladly baker had reached eight virginia stood up stop she called through the door baker stopped counting virginia threw out the gun it landed in the mud good said sadie im so pleased i cant go alone virginia replied no need a sizeable audience had gathered in the lot earl and laura may of course milton cade dwayne and his girl sheriff baker and his deputy an assortment of motel guests they stood in respectful silence staring at virginia gyer with mingled expressions of bewilderment and awe put your hands up where i can see them baker said virginia did as she was instructed look said sadie pointing the moon was up wide and white whyd you kill him dwaynes girl asked the devil made me do it virginia replied gazing up at the moon and putting on the craziest smile she could muster down satan circumstances had made gregorius rich beyond all calculation he owned fleets and palaces stallions cities indeed he owned so much that to those who were finally charged with enumerating his possessionswhen the events of this story reached their monstrous conclusionit sometimes seemed it might be quicker to list the items gregorius did not own rich he was but far from happy he had been raised a catholic and in his early yearsbefore his dizzying rise to fortunehed found succor in his faith but hed neglected it and it was only at the age of fiftyfive with the world at his feet that he woke one night and found himself godless it was a bitter blow but he immediately took steps to make good his loss he went to rome and spoke with the supreme pontiff he prayed night and day he founded seminaries and leper colonies god however declined to show so much as his toenail gregorius it seemed was forsaken almost despairing he took it into his head that he could only win his way back into the arms of his maker if he put his soul into the direst jeopardy the notion had some merit suppose he thought i could contrive a meeting with satan the archfiend seeing me in extremis would not god be obliged to step in and deliver me back into the fold it was a fine plot but how was he to realize it the devil did not just come at a call even for a tycoon such as gregorius and his researches soon proved that all the traditional methods of summoning the lord of verminthe defiling of the blessed sacrament the sacrificing of babeswere no more effective than his good works had been at provoking yahweh it was only after a year of deliberation that he finally fell upon his master plan he would arrange to have built a hell on eartha modern inferno so monstrous that the tempter would be tempted and come to roost there like a cuckoo in a usurped nest he searched high and low for an architect and found languishing in a madhouse outside florence a man called leopardo whose plans for mussolinis palaces had a lunatic grandeur that suited gregoriuss project perfectly leopardo was taken from his cella fetid wretched old manand given his dreams again his genius for the prodigious had not deserted him in order to fuel his invention the great libraries of the world were scoured for descriptions of hells both secular and metaphysical museum vaults were ransacked for forbidden images of martyrdom no stone was left unturned if it was suspected something perverse was concealed beneath the finished designs owed something to de sade and to dante and something more to freud and krafftebing but there was also much there that no mind had conceived of before or at least ever dared set to paper a site in north africa was chosen and work on gregoriuss new hell began everything about the project broke the records its foundations were vaster its walls thicker its plumbing more elaborate than any edifice hitherto attempted gregorius watched its slow construction with an enthusiasm he had not tasted since his first years as an empire builder needless to say he was widely thought to have lost his mind friends he had known for years refused to associate with him several of his companies collapsed when investors took fright at reports of his insanity he didnt care his plan could not fail the devil would be bound to come if only out of curiosity to see this leviathan built in his name and when he did gregorius would be waiting the work took four years and the better part of gregoriuss fortune the finished building was the size of half a dozen cathedrals and boasted every facility the angel of the pit could desire fires burned behind its walls so that to walk in many of its corridors was almost unendurable agony the rooms off those corridors were fitted with every imaginable device of persecutionthe needle the rack the darkthat the genius of satans torturers be given fair employ there were ovens large enough to cremate families pools deep enough to drown generations the new hell was an atrocity waiting to happen a celebration of inhumanity that only lacked its first cause the builders withdrew and thankfully it was rumored among them that satan had long been watching over the construction of his pleasure dome some even claimed to have glimpsed him on the deeper levels where the chill was so profound it froze the piss in your bladder there was some evidence to support the belief in supernatural presences converging on the building as it neared completion not least the cruel death of leopardo who had either thrown himself orthe superstitious arguedbeen pitched through his sixthstory hotel window he was buried with due extravagance so now alone in hell gregorius waited he did not have to wait long he had been there a day no more when he heard noises from the lower depths anticipation brimming he went in search of their source but found only the roiling of excrement baths and the rattling of ovens he returned to his suite of chambers on the ninth level and waited the noises came again again he went in search of their source again he came away disappointed the disturbances did not abate however in the days that followed scarcely ten minutes would pass without his hearing some sound f occupancy the prince of darkness was here gregorius could have no doubt of it but he was keeping to the shadows gregorius was content to play along it was the devils party after all his to play whatever game he chose but during the long and often lonely months that followed gregorius wearied of this hideandseek and began to demand that satan show himself his voice rang unanswered down the deserted corridors however until his throat was bruised with shouting thereafter he went about his searches stealthily hoping to catch his tenant unawares but the apostate angel always flitted away before gregorius could step within sight of him they would play a waiting game it seemed he and satan chasing each others tails through ice and fire and ice again gregorius told himself to be patient the devil had come hadnt he wasnt that his fingerprint on the door handle his turd on the stairs sooner or later the fiend would show his face and gregorius would spit on it the world outside went on its way and gregorius was consigned to the company of other recluses who had been ruined by wealth his folly as it was known was not entirely without visitors however there were a few who had loved him too much to forget hima few also who had profited by him and hoped to turn his madness to their further profitwho dared the gates of the new hell these visitors made the journey without announcing their intentions fearing the disapproval of their friends the investigations into their subsequent disappearance never reached as far as north africa and in his folly gregorius still chased the serpent and the serpent still eluded him leaving only more and more terrible signs of his occupany as the months went by it was the wife of one of the missing visitors who finally discovered the truth and alerted the authorities gregoriuss folly was put under surveillance and finallysome three years after its completiona quartet of officers braved the threshold without maintenance the folly had begun to deteriorate badly the lights had failed on many of the levels its walls had cooled its pitch pits solidified but as the officers advanced through the gloomy vaults in search of gregorius they came upon ample evidence that despite its decrepit condition the new hell was in good working order there were bodies in the ovens their faces wide and black there were human remains seated and strung up in many of the rooms gouged and pricked and slit to death their terror grew with every door they pressed open every new abomination their fevered eyes fell upon two of the four who crossed the threshold never reached the chamber at its center terror overtook them on their way and they fled only to be waylaid in some choked passageway and added to the hundreds who had perished in the folly since satan had taken residence of the pair who finally unearthed the perpetrator only one had courage enough to tell his story though the scenes he faced there in the follys heart were almost too terrible to bear relating there was no sign of satan of course there was only gregorius the master builder finding no one to inhabit the house he had sweated over had occupied it himself he had with him a few disciples whom hed mustered over the years they like him seemed unremarkable creatures but there was not a torture device in the building they had not made thorough and merciless use of gregorius did not resist his arrest indeed he seemed pleased to have a platform from which to boast of his butcheries then and later at his trial he spoke freely of his ambition and his appetite and of how much more blood he would spill if they would only set him free to do so enough to drown all belief and its delusions he swore and still he would not be satisfied for god was rotting in paradise and satan in the abyss and who was to stop him he was much reviled during the trial and later in the asylum where under some suspicious circumstances he died barely two months later the vatican expunged all report of him from its records the seminaries founded in his unholy name were dissolved but there were those even among the cardinals who could not put his unrepentant malice out of their heads andin the privacy of their doubtwondered if he had not succeeded in his strategy if in giving up all hope of angelsfallen or otherwisehe had not become one himself or all that earth could bear of such phenomena the age of desire the burning man propelled himself down the steps of the hume laboratories as the police carsummoned he presumed by the alarm either welles or dance had set off upstairsappeared at the gate and swung up the driveway as he ran from the door the car screeched up to the steps and discharged its human cargo he waited in the shadows too exhausted by terror to run any farther certain that they would see him but they disappeared through the swing doors without so much as a glance toward his torment am i on fire at all he wondered was this horrifying spectaclehis flesh baptized with a polished flame that seared but failed to consumesimply a hallucination for his eyes and his eyes only if so perhaps all that he had suffered up in the laboratory had also been delirium perhaps he had not truly committed the crimes he had fled from the heat in his flesh licking him into ecstasies he looked down his body his exposed skin still crawled with livid dots of fire but one by one they were being extinguished he was going out he realized like a neglected bonfire the sensations that had suffused himso intense and so demanding that they had been as like pain as pleasurewere finally deserting his nerve endings leaving a numbness for which he was grateful his body now appearing from beneath the veil of fire was in a sorry condition his skin was a panicmap of scratches his clothes torn to shreds his hands sticky with coagulating blood blood he knew that was not his own there was no avoiding the bitter truth he had done all he had imagined doing even now the officers would be staring down at his atrocious handiwork he crept away from his niche beside the door and down the driveway keeping a lookout for the return of the two policemen neither reappeared tile street beyond the gate was deserted he started to run he had managed only a few paces when the alarm in the building behind him was abruptly cut off for several seconds his ears rang in sympathy with the silenced bell then eerily he began to hear the sound of heatthe surreptitious murmuring of embersdistant enough that he didnt panic yet close as his heartbeat he limped on to put as much distance as he could between him and his felonies before they were discovered but however fast he ran the heat went with him safe in some backwater of his gut threatening with every desperate step he took to ignite him afresh it took dooley several seconds to identify the cacophony he was hearing from the upper floor now that mcbride had hushed the alarm bell it was the highpitched chattering of monkeys and it came from one of the many rooms down the corridor to his right virgil he called down the stairwell get up here not waiting for his partner to join him dooley headed off toward the source of the din halfway along the corridor the smell of static and new carpeting gave way to a more pungent combination urine disinfectant and rotting fruit dooley slowed his advance he didnt like the smell any more than he liked the hysteria in the babble of monkey voices but mcbride was slow in answering his call and after a short hesitation dooleys curiosity got the better of his disquiet hand on truncheon he approached the open door and stepped in his appearance sparked off another wave of frenzy from the animals a dozen or so rhesus monkeys they threw themselves around in their cages somersaulting screeching and berating the wire mesh their excitement was infectious dooley could feel the sweat begin to squeeze from his pores is there anybody here he called out the only reply came from the prisoners more hysteria more cage rattling he stared across the room at them they stared back their teeth bared in fear or welcome dooley didnt know which nor did he wish to test their intentions he kept well clear of the bench on which the cages were lined up as he began a perfunctory search of the laboratory i wondered what the hell the smell was mcbride said appearing at the door just animals dooley replied dont they ever wash filthy buggers anything downstairs nope mcbride said crossing to the cages the monkeys met his advance with more gymnastics just the alarm nothing up here either dooley said he was about to add dont do that to prevent his partner putting his finger to the mesh but before the words were out one of the animals seized the proffered digit and bit it mcbride wrested his finger free and threw a blow back against the mesh in retaliation squealing its anger the occupant flung its scrawny body about in a lunatic fandango that threatened to pitch cage and monkey alike onto the floor youll need a tetanus shot for that dooley commented shit said mcbride whats wrong with the little bastard anyhow maybe they dont like strangers theyre out of their tiny minds mcbride sucked ruminatively on his finger then spat i mean look at them dooley didnt answer i said look mcbride repeated very quietly dooley said over here what is it just come over here mcbride drew his gaze from the row of cages and across the cluttered work surfaces to where dooley was staring at the ground the look on his face one of fascinated revulsion mcbride neglected his finger sucking and threaded his way among the benches and stools to where his partner stood under there dooley murmured on the scuffed floor at dooleys feet was a womans beige shoe beneath the bench was the shoes owner to judge by her cramped position she had either been secreted there by the miscreant or dragged herself out of sight and died in hiding is she dead mcbride asked look at her for christs sake dooley replied shes been torn open weve got to check for vital signs mcbride reminded him dooley made no move to comply so mcbride squatted down in front of the victim and checked for a pulse at her ravaged neck there was none her skin was still warm beneath his fingers however a gloss of saliva on her cheek had not yet dried dooley calling in his report looked down at the deceased the worst of her wounds on the upper torso were masked by mcbrides crouching body all he could see was a fall of auburn hair and her legs one foot shoeless protruding from her hiding place they were beautiful legs he thought he might have whistled after such legs once upon a time shes a doctor or a technician mcbride said shes wearing a lab coat or she had been in fact the coat had been ripped open as had the layers of clothing beneath and then as if to complete the exhibition the skin and muscle beneath that mcbride peered into her chest the sternum had been snapped and the heart teased from its seat as if her killer had wanted to take it as a keepsake and been interrupted in the act he perused her without squeamishness he had always prided himself on his strong stomach are you satisfied shes dead never saw deader carnegies coming down dooley said crossing to one of the sinks careless of fingerprints he turned on the tap and splashed a handful of cold water onto his face when he looked up from his ablutions mcbride had left off his tкteаtкte with the corpse and was walking down the laboratory toward a bank of machinery what do they do here for christs sake he remarked look at all this stuff some kind of research facility dooley said what do they research how the hell do i know dooley snapped the ceaseless chatterings of the monkeys and the proximity of the dead woman made him want to desert the place lets leave it be huh mcbride ignored dooleys request equipment fascinated him he stared entranced at the encephalograph and electrocardiograph at the printout units still disgorging yards of blank paper onto the floor at the video display monitors and the consoles the scene brought the marie celeste to his mind this was like some deserted ship of sciencestill humming some tuneless song to itself as it sailed on though there was neither captain nor crew left behind to attend upon it beyond the wall of equipment was a window no more than a yard square mcbride had assumed it let on to the exterior of the building but now that he looked more closely he realized it did not a test chamber lay beyond the banked units dooley he said glancing around the man had gone however down to meet carnegie presumably content to be left to his exploration mcbride returned his attention to the window there was no light on inside curious he walked around the back of the banked equipment until he found the chamber door it was ajar without hesitation he stepped through most of the light through the window was blocked by the instruments on the other side the interior was dark it took mcbrides eyes a few seconds to get a true impression of the chaos the chamber contained the overturned table the chair of which somebody had made matchwood the tangle of cables and demolished equipmentcameras perhaps to monitor proceedings in the chamberclusters of lights which had been similarly smashed no professional vandal could have made a more thorough job of breaking up the chamber than had been made there was a smell in the air which mcbride recognized but irritatingly couldnt place he stood still tantalized by the scent the sound of sirens rose from down the corridor outside carnegie would be here in moments suddenly the smells association came to him it was the same scent that twitched in his nostrils when after making love to jessica andas was his ritualwashing himself he returned from the bathroom to bedroom it was the smell of sex he smiled his face was still registering pleasure when a heavy object sliced through the air and met his nose he felt the cartilage give and a rush of blood come he took two or three giddy steps backward thereby avoiding the subsequent slice but lost his footing in the disarray he fell awkwardly in a litter of glass shards and looked up to see his assailant wielding a metal bar moving toward him the mans face resembled one of the monkeys the same yellowed teeth the same rabid eyes no the man shouted as he brought his makeshift club down on mcbride who managed to ward off the blow with his arm snatching at the weapon in so doing the attack had taken him unawares but how with the pain in his mashed nose to add fury to his response he was more than the equal of the aggressor he plucked the club from the man sweets from a babe and leaped roaring to his feet any precepts he might once have been taught about arrest techniques had fled from his mind he lay a hail of blows on the mans head and shoulders forcing him backward across the chamber the man cowered beneath the assault and eventually slumped whimpering against the wall only now with his antagonist abused to the verge of unconsciousness did mcbrides furor falter he stood in the middle of the chamber gasping for breath and watched the beaten man slip down the wall he had made a profound error the assailant he now realized was dressed in a white laboratory coat he was as dooley was irritatingly fond of saying on the side of the angels damn said mcbride shit hell and damn the mans eyes flickered open and he gazed up at mcbride his grasp on consciousness was evidently tenuous but a look of recognition crossed his widebrowed somber face or rather recognitions absence youre not him he murmured who said mcbride realizing he might yet salvage his reputation from this fiasco if he could squeeze a clue from the witness who did you think i was the man opened his mouth but no words emerged eager to hear the testimony mcbride crouched beside him and said who did you think you were attacking again the mouth opened again no audible words emerged mcbride pressed his suit its important he said just tell me who was here the man strove to voice his reply mcbride pressed his ear to the trembling mouth in a pigs eye the man said then passed out leaving mcbride to curse his father whod bequeathed him a temper he was afraid he would probably live to regret but then what was living for inspector carnegie was used to boredom for every rare moment of genuine discovery his professional life had furnished him with he had endured hour upon hour of waiting for bodies to be photographed and examined for lawyers to be bargained with and suspects intimidated he had long ago given up attempting to fight this tide of ennui and after his fashion had learned the art of going with the flow the processes of investigation could not be hurried the wise man he had come to appreciate let the pathologists the lawyers and all their tribes have their tardy way all that mattered in the fullness of time was that the finger be pointed and that the guilty quake now with the clock on the laboratory wall reading twelve fiftythree am and even the monkeys hushed in their cages he sat at one of the benches and waited for hendrix to finish his calculations the surgeon consulted the thermometer then stripped off his gloves like a second skin and threw them down onto the sheet on which the deceased lay its always difficult the doctor said fixing time of death shes lost less than three degrees id say shes been dead under two hours the officers arrived at a quarter to twelve carnegie said so she died maybe half an hour before that something of that order was she put in there he asked indicating the place beneath the bench oh certainly theres no way she hid herself away not with those injuries theyre quite something arent they carnegie stared at hendrix the man had presumably seen hundreds of corpses in every conceivable condition but the enthusiasm in his pinched features was unqualified carnegie found that mystery more fascinating in its way than that of the dead woman and her slaughterer how could anyone possibly enjoy taking the rectal temperature of a corpse it confounded him but the pleasure was there gleaming in the mans eyes motive carnegie asked pretty explicit isnt it rape theres been very thorough molestation contusions around the vagina copious semen deposits plenty to work with and the wounds on her torso ragged tears more than cuts weapon dont know hendrix made an inverted u of his mouth i mean the flesh has been mauled if it werent for the rape evidence id be tempted to suggest an animal dog you mean i was thinking more of a tiger hendrix said carnegie frowned tiger joke hendrix replied i was making a joke carnegie my christ do you have any sense of irony this isnt funny carnegie said im not laughing hendrix replied with a sour look the man mcbride found in the test chamber what about him suspect not in a thousand years were looking for a maniac carnegie big strong wild and the wounding before or after hendrix scowled i dont know postmortem will give us more but for what its worth i think our man was in a frenzy id say the wounding and the rape were probably simultaneous carnegies normally phlegmatic features registered something close to shock simultaneous hendrix shrugged lusts a funny thing he said hilarious came the appalled reply as was his wont carnegie had his driver deposit him half a mile from his doorstep to allow him a headclearing walk before home hot chocolate and slumber the ritual was observed religiously even when the inspector was dogtired he used to stroll to wind down before stepping over the threshold long experience had taught him that taking his professional concerns into the house assisted neither the investigation nor his domestic life he had learned the lesson too late to keep his wife from leaving him and his children from estrangement but he applied the principle still tonight he walked slowly to allow the distressing scenes the evening had brought to recede somewhat the route took him past a small cinema which he had read in the local press was soon to be demolished he was not surprised though he was no cineaste the fare the flea pit provided had degenerated in recent years the weeks offering was a case in point a double bill of horror movies lurid and derivative stuff to judge by the posters with their crude graphics and their unashamed hyperbole you may never sleep again one of the hook lines read and beneath it a womanvery much awakecowered in the shadow of a twoheaded man what trivial images the populists conjured to stir some fear in their audiences the walking dead nature grown vast and rampant in a miniature world blood drinkers omens fire walkers thunderstorms and all the other foolishness the public cowered before it was all so laughably trite among that catalogue of penny dreadful there wasnt one that equaled the banality of human appetite which horror he saw every week of his working life thinking of it his mind thumbed through a dozen snapshots the dead by torchlight face down and thrashed to oblivion and the living too meeting his minds eye with hunger in theirsfor sex for narcotics for others pain why didnt they put that on the posters as he reached his home a child squealed in the shadows beside his garage the cry stopped him in his tracks it came again and this time he recognized it for what it was no child at all but a cat or cats exchanging love calls in the darkened passageway he went to the place to shoo them off their venereal secretions made the passage stink he didnt need to yell his footfall was sufficient to scare them away they darted in all directions not two but half a dozen of them a veritable orgy had been underway apparently he had arrived on the spot too late however the stench of their seductions was overpowering carnegie looked blankly at the elaborate setup of monitors and video recorders that dominated his office what in christs name is this about he wanted to know the video tapes said boyle his number two from the laboratory i think you ought to have a look at them sir though they had worked in tandem for seven months boyle was not one of carnegies favorite officers you could practically smell the ambition off his smooth hide in someone half his age again such greed would have been objectionable in a man of thirty it verged on the obscene this present displaythe mustering of equipment ready to confront carnegie when he walked in at eight in the morningwas just boyles style flashy and redundant why so many screens carnegie asked acidly do i get it in stereo too they had three cameras running simultaneously sir covering the experiment from several angles what experiment boyle gestured for his superior to sit down obsequious to a fault arent you thought carnegie much good itll do you right boyle instructed the technician at the recorders roll the tapes carnegie sipped at the cup of hot chocolate he had brought in with him the beverage was a weakness of his verging on addiction on the days when the machine supplying it broke down he was an unhappy man indeed he looked at the three screens suddenly a title project blind boy the words read restricted blind boy said carnegie what or who is that its obviously a code word of some kind boyle said blind boy blind boy carnegie repeated the phrase as if to beat it into submission but before he could solve the problem the images on the three monitors diverged they pictured the same subjecta bespectacled male in his late twenties sitting in a chairbut each showed the scene from a different angle one took in the subject full length and in profile the second was a threequarter mediumshot angled from above the third a straightforward closeup of the subjects head and shoulders shot through the glass of the test chamber and from the front the three images were in black and white and none were completely centered or focused indeed as the tapes began to run somebody was still adjusting such technicalities a backwash of informal chatter ran between the subject and the womanrecognizable even in brief glimpses as the deceasedwho was applying electrodes to his forehead much of the talk between them was difficult to catch the acoustics in the chamber frustrated microphone and listener alike the womans doctor dance boyle offered the victim yes said carnegie watching the screens intently i recognize her how long does this preparation go on for quite a while most of its unedifying well get to the edifying stuff then fast forward boyle said the technician obliged and the actors on the three screens became squeaking comedians wait said boyle back up a short way again the technician did as instructed there said boyle stop there now run on at normal speed the action settled back to its natural pace this is where it really begins sir carnegie had come to the end of his hot chocolate he put his finger into the soft sludge at the bottom of the cup delivering the sicklysweet dregs to his tongue on the screens doctor dance had approached the subject with a syringe was now swabbing the crook of his elbow and injecting him not for the first time since his visit to the hume laboratories did carnegie wonder precisely what they did at the establishment was this kind of procedure de rigueur in pharmaceutical research the implicit secrecy of the experimentlate at night in an otherwise deserted buildingsuggested not and there was that imperative on the title cardrestricted what they were watching had clearly never been intended for public viewing are you comfortable a man off camera now inquired the subject nodded his glasses had been removed and he looked slightly bemused without them an unremarkable face thought carnegie the subjectas yet unnamedwas neither adonis nor quasimodo he was receding slightly and his wispy dirtyblond hair touched his shoulders im fine doctor welles he replied to the offcamera questioner you dont feel hot at all sweaty not really the guinea pig replied slightly apologetically feel ordinary that you are carnegie thought then to boyle have you been through the tapes to the end no sir boyle replied i thought youd want to see them first i only ran them as far as the injection any word from the hospital on doctor welles at the last call he was still comatose carnegie grunted and returned his attention to the screens following the burst of action with the injection the tapes now settled into nonactivity the three cameras fixed on their shortsighted subject with beady stares the torpor occasionally interrupted by an inquiry from welles as to the subjects condition it remained the same after three or four minutes of this eventless study even his occasional blinks began to assume major dramatic significance dont think much of the plot the technician commented carnegie laughed boyle looked discomforted two or three more minutes passed in a similar manner this doesnt look too hopeful carnegie said run through it at speed will you the technician was about to obey when boyle said wait carnegie glanced across at the man irritated by his intervention and then back at the screens something was happening a subtle transformation had overtaken the insipid features of the subject he had begun to smile to himself and was sinking down in his chair as if submerging his gangling body in a warm bath his eyes which had so far expressed little but affable indifference now began to flicker closed and then once closed opened again when they did so there was a quality in them not previously visible a hunger that seemed to reach out from the screen and into the calm of the inspectors office carnegie put down his chocolate cup and approached the screens as he did so the subject also got up out of his chair and walked toward the glass of the chamber leaving two of the cameras ranges the third still recorded him however as he pressed his face against the window and for a moment the two men faced each other through layers of glass and time seemingly meeting each others gaze the look on the mans face was critical now the hunger was rapidly outgrowing sane control eyes burning he laid his lips against the chamber window and kissed it his tongue working against the glass what in christs name is going on carnegie said a prattle of voices had begun on the soundtrack doctor welles was vainly asking the testee to articulate his feelings while dance called off figures from the various monitoring instruments it was difficult to hear much clearlythe din was further supplemented by an eruption of chatter from the caged monkeysbut it was evident that the readings coming through from the mans body were escalating his face was flushed his skin gleamed with a sudden sweat he resembled a martyr with the tinder at his feet freshly lit wild with a fatal ecstasy he stopped frenchkissing the window tearing off the electrodes at his temples and the sensors from his arms and chest dance her voice now registering alarm called out for him to stop then she moved across the cameras view and out again crossing carnegie presumed to the chamber door better not he said as if this drama were played out at his behest and at a whim he could prevent the tragedy but the woman took no notice a moment later she appeared in long shot as she stepped into the chamber the man moved to greet her throwing over equipment as he did so she called out to himhis name perhaps if so it was inaudible over the monkeys hullabaloo shit said carnegie as the testees flailing arms caught first the profile camera and then the threequarter mediumshot two of the three monitors went dead only the headon shot the camera safe outside the chamber still recorded events but the tightness of the shot precluded more than an occasional glimpse of a moving body instead the cameras sober eye gazed on almost ironically at the saliva smeared glass of the chamber window blind to the atrocities being committed a few feet out of range what in christs name did they give him carnegie said as somewhere off camera the womans screams rose over the screeching of the apes jerome woke in the early afternoon feeling hungry and sore when he threw the sheet off his body he was appalled at his state his torso was scored with scratches and his groin region was redraw wincing he moved to the edge of the bed and sat there for a while trying to piece the previous evening back together again he remembered going to the laboratories but very little after that he had been a paid guinea pig for several months giving of his blood comfort and patience to supplement his meager earnings as a translator the arrangement had begun courtesy of a friend who did similar work but whereas figley had been part of the laboratories mainstream program jerome had been approached after one week at the place by doctors welles and dance who had invited himsubject to a series of psychological teststo work exclusively for them it had been made clear from the outset that their project was of a secret nature and that they would demand his total dedication and discretion he had needed the funds and the recompense they offered was marginally better than that paid by the laboratories so he had agreed although the hours they had demanded of him were unsociable for several weeks now he had been required to attend the research facility late at night and often working into the small hours of the morning as he endured welless interminable questions about his private life and dances glassy stare thinking of her cold look he felt a tremor in him was it because once he had fooled himself that she had looked upon him more fondly than a doctor need such selfdeception he chided himself was pitiful he was not the stuff of which women dreamed and each day he walked the streets reinforced that conviction he could not remember one occasion in his adult life when a woman had looked his way and kept looking a time when an appreciative glance of his had been returned why this should bother him now he wasnt certain his loveless condition was he knew commonplace and nature had been kind knowing it seemed that the gift of allurement had passed him by it had seen fit to minimize his libido weeks passed without his conscious thoughts mourning his enforced chastity once in a while when he heard the pipes roar he might wonder what mrs morrisey his landlady looked like in her bath might imagine the firmness of her soapy breasts or the dark divide of her rump as she stooped to put talcum powder between her toes but such torments were blissfully infrequent and when his cup brimmed he would pocket the money he had saved from his sessions at the laboratories and buy an hours companionship from a woman called angela on greek street it would be several weeks before he did so again he thought whatever he had done last night or more correctly had done to him the bruises alone had nearly crippled him the only plausible explanationthough he couldnt recall any detailswas that hed been beaten up on the way back from the laboratories either that or hed stepped into a bar and somebody had picked a fight with him it had happened before on occasion he had one of those faces that woke the bully in drunkards he stood up and hobbled to the small bathroom adjoining his room his glasses were missing from their normal spot beside the shaving mirror and his reflection was woefully blurred but it was apparent that his face was as badly scratched as the rest of his anatomy and more a clump of hair had been pulled out from above his left ear clotted blood ran down to his neck painfully he bent to the task of cleaning his wounds then bathing them in a stinging solution of antiseptic that done he returned into his room to seek out his spectacles but search as he might he could not locate them cursing his idiocy he rooted among his belongings for his old pair and found them their prescription was out of datehis eyes had worsened considerably since hed worn thembut they at least brought his surroundings into a dreamy kind of focus an indisputable melancholy had crept up on him compounded of his pain and those unwelcome thoughts of mrs morrisey to keep its intimacy at bay he turned on the radio a sleek voice emerged purveying the usual palliatives jerome had always had contempt for popular music and its apologists but now as he mooched around the small room unwilling to clothe himself with chafing weaves when his scratches still pained him the songs began to stir something other than scorn in him it was as though he were hearing the words and music for the first time as though all his life he had been deaf to their sentiments enthralled he forgot his pain and listened the songs told one seamless and obsessive story of love lost and found only to be lost again the lyricists filled the airwaves with metaphormuch of it ludicrous but no less potent for that of paradise of hearts on fire of birds bells journeys sunsets of passion as lunacy as flight as unimaginable treasure the songs did not calm him with their fatuous sentiments they flayed him evoking despite feeble rhyme and trite melody a world bewitched by desire he began to tremble his eyes strained by the unfamiliar spectacles began to delude him it seemed as though he could see traces of light in his skin sparks flying from the ends of his fingers he stared at his hands and arms the illusion far from retreating in the face of this scrutiny increased beads of brightness like the traces of fire in ash began to climb through his veins multiplying even as he watched curiously he felt no distress this burgeoning fire merely reflected the passion in the story the songs were telling him love they said was in the air around ever corner waiting to be found he thought again of the widow morrissey in the flat below him going about her business sighing no doubt as he had done awaiting her hero the more he thought of her the more inflamed he became she would not reject him of that the songs convinced him or if she did he must press his case until she surrendered to him suddenly at the thought of her surrender the fire engulfed him laughing he left the radio singing behind him and made his way downstairs it had taken the best part of the morning to assemble a list of testees employed at the laboratories carnegie had sensed a reluctance on the part of the establishment to open their files to the investigation despite the horror that had been committed on its premises finally lust after noon they had presented him with a hastily assembled whos who of subjects four and a half dozen in toto and their addresses none the offices claimed matched the description of welless testee the doctors it was explained had been clearly using laboratory facilities to work on private projects though this was not encouraged both had been senior researchers and allowed leeway on the matter it was likely therefore that the man carnegie was seeking had never even been on the laboratories payroll undaunted carnegie ordered a selection of photographs taken off the video recording and had them distributedwith the list of names and addressesto his officers from then on it was down to footwork and patience leo boyle ran his finger down the list of names he had been given another fourteen he said his driver grunted and boyle glanced across at him you were mcbrides partner werent you he said thats right dooley replied hes been suspended why dooley scowled lacks finesse that virgil cant get the hang of arrest technique dooley drew the car to a halt is this it boyle asked you said number eighty this is eighty on the door eight oh ive got eyes boyle got out of the car and made his way up the pathway the house was sizeable and had been divided into flats there were several bells he pressed for j tredgoldthe name on his listand waited of the five houses they had so far visited two had been unoccupied and the residents of the other three had born no resemblance to the malefactor boyle waited on the step a few seconds and then pressed the bell again a longer ring this time nobody in dooley said from the pavement looks like it even as he spoke boyle caught sight of a figure flitting across the hallway its outline distorted by the cobblestone glass in the door wait a minute he said what is it somebodys in there and not answering he pressed the first bell again and then the others dooley approached up the pathway flicking away an over attentive wasp you sure he said i saw somebody in there press the other bells dooley suggested i already did theres somebody in there and they dont want to come to the door he rapped on the glass open up he announced police clever thought dooley why not a loudspeaker so heaven knows too when the door predictably remained unanswered boyle turned to dooley is there a side gate yes sir then get around the back pronto before hes away shouldnt we call do it ill keep watch here if you can get in the back come through and open the front door dooley moved leaving boyle alone at the front door he rang the series of bells again and cupping his hand to his brow put his face to the glass there was no sign of movement in the hallway was it possible that the bird had already flown he backed down the path and stared up at the windows they stared back vacuously ample time had now passed for dooley to get around the back of the house but so far he had neither reappeared nor called stymied where he stood and nervous that his tactics had lost them their quarry boyle decided to follow his nose around the back of the house the side gate had been left open by dooley boyle advanced up the side passage glancing through a window into an empty living room before heading around to the back door it was open dooley however was not in sight boyle pocketed the photograph and the list and stepped inside loath to call dooleys name for fear it alert any felon to his presence yet nervous of the silence cautious as a cat on broken glass he crept through the flat but each room was deserted at the apartment door which let on to the hallway in which he had first seen the figure he paused where had dooley gone the man had apparently disappeared from sight then a groan from beyond the door dooley boyle ventured another groan he stepped into the hallway three more doors presented themselves all were closed other flats presumably on the coconut mat at the front door lay dooleys truncheon dropped there as if its owner had been in the process of making his escape boyle swallowed his fear and walked into the body of the hall the complaint came again close by he looked around and up the stairs there on the halflanding lay dooley he was barely conscious a rough attempt had been made to rip his clothes large portions of his flabby lower anatomy were exposed whats going on dooley boyle asked moving to the bottom of the stairs the officer heard his voice and rolled himself over his bleary eyes settling on boyle opened in terror its all right boyle reassured him its only me too late boyle registered that dooleys gaze wasnt fixed on him at all but on some sight over his shoulder as he pivoted on his heel to snatch a glance at dooleys bugaboo a charging figure slammed into him winded and cursing boyle was thrown off his feet he scrabbled about on the floor for several seconds before his attacker seized hold of him by jacket and hair and hauled him to his feet he recognized at once the wild face that was thrust into histhe receding hairline the weak mouth the hungerbut there was much too he had not anticipated for one the man was naked as a babe though scarcely so modestly endowed for another he was clearly aroused to fever pitch if the beady eye at his groin shining up at boyle were not evidence enough the hands now tearing at his clothes made the assailants intention perfectly apparent dooley boyle shrieked as he was thrown across the hallway in christs name dooley his pleas were silenced as he hit the opposite wall the wild man was at his back in half a heartbeat smearing boyles face against the wallpaper birds and flowers intertwined filled his eyes in desperation boyle fought back but the mans passion lent him ungovernable strength with one insolent hand holding the policemans head he tore at boyles trousers and underwear leaving his buttocks exposed god boyle begged into the pattern of the wallpaper please god somebody help me but the prayers were no more fruitful than his struggles he was pinned against the wall like a butterfly spread on cork about to be pierced through he closed his eyes tears of frustration running down his cheeks the assailant left off his hold on boyles head and pressed his violation home boyle refused to cry out the pain he felt was not the equal of his shame better perhaps that dooley remained comatose that this humiliation be done and finished with unwitnessed stop he murmured into the wall not to his attacker but to his body urging it not to find pleasure in this outrage but his nerve endings were treacherous they caught fire from the assault beneath the stabbing agony some unforgivable part of him rose to the occasion on the stairs dooley hauled himself to his feet his lumbar region which had been weak since the car accident the previous christmas had given out almost as soon as the wild man had sprung him in the hall now as he descended the stairs the least motion caused excruciating agonies crippled with pain he stumbled to the bottom of the stairs and looked amazed across the hallway could this be boylehe the supercilious he the rising man being pummeled like a street kid in need of dope money the sight transfixed dooley for several seconds before he unhinged his eyes and swung them down to the truncheon on the mat he moved cautiously but the wild man was too occupied with the deflowering to notice him jerome was listening to boyles heart it was a loud seductive beat and with every thrust into the man it seemed to get louder he wanted it the heat of it the life of it his hand moved around to boyles chest and dug at the flesh give me your heart he said it was like a line from one of the songs boyle screamed into the wall as his attacker mauled his chest hed seen photographs of the woman at the laboratories the open wound of her torso was lightningclear in his minds eye now the maniac intended the same atrocity give me your heart panicked to the ledge of his sanity he found new stamina and began to fight afresh reaching around and clawing at the mans torso nothingnot even the bloody loss of hair from his scalpbroke the rhythm of his thrusts however in extremis boyle attempted to insinuate one of his hands between his body and the wall and reach between his legs to unman the bastard as he did so dooley attacked delivering a hail of truncheon blows upon the mans head the diversion gave boyle precious leeway he pressed hard against the wall the man his grip on boyles chest slicked with blood lost his hold again boyle pushed this time he managed to shrug the man off entirely the bodies disengaged boyle turned bleeding but in no danger and watched dooley follow the man across the hallway beating at his greasy blond head he made little attempt to protect himself however his burning eyes were still on the object of his affections kill him boyle said quietly as the man grinnedgrinnedthrough the blows break every bone in his body even if dooley hobbled as he was had been in any fit state to obey the imperative he had no chance to do so his berating was interrupted by a voice from down the hallway a woman had emerged from the flat boyle had come through she too had been a victim of this marauder to judge by her state but dooleys entry into the house had clearly distracted her molester before he could do serious damage arrest him she said pointing at the leering man he tried to rape me dooley closed in to take possession of the prisoner but jerome had other intentions he put his hand in dooleys face and pushed him back against the front door the coconut mat slid from under him he all but fell by the time hed regained his balance jerome was up and away boyle made a wretched attempt to stop him but the tatters of his trousers were wrapped about his lower legs and jerome fleetfooted was soon halfway up the stairs call for help boyle ordered dooley and make it quick dooley nodded and opened the front door is there any way out from upstairs boyle demanded of mrs morrisey she shook her head then weve got the bastard trapped havent we he said go on dooley dooley hobbled away down the path and you he said to the woman fetch something in the way of weaponry anything solid the woman nodded and returned the way shed come leaving boyle slumped beside the open door a soft breeze cooled the sweat on his face at the car outside dooley was calling up reinforcements all too soon boyle thought the cars would be here and the man upstairs would be hauled away to give his testimony there would be no opportunity for revenge once he was in custody the law would take its placid course and he the victim would be only a bystander if he was ever to salvage the ruins of his manhood now was the time if he didntif he languished here his bowels on firehe would never shrug off the horror he felt at his bodys betrayal he must act nowmust beat the grin off his ravishers face once and for allor else live in selfdisgust until memory failed him the choice was no choice at all without further debate he got up from his squatting position and began up the stairs as he reached the halflanding he realized he hadnt brought a weapon with him he knew however that if he descended again hed lose all momentum prepared in that moment to die if necessary he headed on up there was only one door open on the top landing through it came the sound of a radio downstairs in the safety of the hall he heard dooley come in to tell him that the call had been made only to break off in midannouncement ignoring the distraction boyle stepped into the flat there was nobody there it took boyle a few moments only to check the kitchen the tiny bathroom and the living room all were deserted he returned to the bathroom the window of which was open and put his head out the drop to the grass of the garden below was quite manageable there was an imprint in the ground of the mans body he had leaped and gone boyle cursed his tardiness and hung his head a trickle of heat ran down the inside of his leg in the next room the love songs played on for jerome there was no forgetfulness not this time the encounter with mrs morrisey which had been interrupted by dooley and the episode with boyle that had followed had all merely served to fan the fire in him now by the light of those flames he saw clearly what crimes he had committed he remembered with horrible clarity the laboratory the injection the monkeys the blood the acts he recalled however woke no sense of sinfulness in him all moral consequence all shame or remorse was burned out by the fire that was even now licking his flesh to new enthusiasms he took refuge in a quiet culdesac to make himself presentable the clothes he had managed to snatch before making his escape were motley but would serve to keep him from attracting unwelcome attention as he buttoned himself uphis body seeming to strain from its covering as if resentful of being concealedhe tried to control the holocaust that raged between his ears but the flames wouldnt be dampened his every fiber seemed alive to the flux and flow of the world around him the marshaled trees along the road the wall at his back the very paving stones beneath his bare feet were catching a spark from him and burning now with their own fire he grinned to see the conflagration spread the world in its every eager particular grinned back aroused beyond control he turned to the wall he had been leaning against the sun had fallen full upon it and it was warm the bricks smelled ambrosial he laid kisses on their gritty faces his hands exploring every nook and cranny murmuring sweet nothings he unzipped himself found an accommodating niche and filled it his mind was running with liquid pictures mingled anatomies female and male in one undistinguishable congress above him even the clouds had caught fire enthralled by their burning heads he felt the moment rise in his gristle breath was short now but the ecstasy surely that would go on forever without warning a spasm of pain traveled down his spine from cortex to testicles and back again convulsing him his hands lost grip of the brick and he finished his agonizing climax on the air as he fell across the pavement for several seconds he lay where he had collapsed while the echoes of the initial spasm bounced back and forth along his spine diminishing with each return he could taste blood at the back of his throat he wasnt certain if hed bitten his lip or tongue but he thought not above his head the birds circled on rising lazily on a spiral of warm air he watched the fire in the clouds gutter out he got to his feet and looked down at the coinage of semen hed spent on the pavement for a fragile instant he caught again a whiff of the vision hed just had imagined a marriage of his seed with the paving stone what sublime children the world might boast he thought if he could only mate with brick or tree he would gladly suffer the agonies of conception if such miracles were possible but the paving stone was unmoved by his seeds entreaties the vision like the fire above him cooled and hid its glories he put his bloodied member away and leaned against the wall turning the strange events of his recent life over and over something fundamental was changing in him of that he had no doubt the rapture that had possessed him was like nothing he had hitherto experienced and whatever they had injected into his system it showed no signs of being discharged naturally far from it he could feel the heat in him still as he had leaving the laboratories but this time the roar of its presence was louder than ever it was a new kind of life he was living and the thought though frightening exulted him not once did it occur to his spinning eroticized brain that this new kind of life would in time demand a new kind of death carnegie had been warned by his superiors that results were expected he was now passing the verbal beating hed received to those under him it was a line of humiliation in which the greater was encouraged to kick the lesser man and that man in turn his lesser carnegie had sometimes wondered what the man at the end of the line took his ire out on his dog presumably this miscreant is still loose gentlemen despite his photograph in many of this mornings newspapers and an operating method which is to say the least insolent we will catch him of course but lets get the bastard before we have another murder on our hands the phone rang boyles replacement migeon picked it up while carnegie concluded his pep talk to the assembled officers i want him in the next twentyfour hours gentlemen thats the time scale ive been given and thats what weve got twentyfour hours migeon interrupted sir its johannson he says hes got something for you its urgent right the inspector claimed the receiver carnegie the voice at the other end was soft to the point of inaudibility carnegie johannson said weve been right through the laboratory dug up every piece of information we could find on dance and welless tests and weve also analyzed traces of the agent from the hypo they used on the suspect i think weve found the boy carnegie what boy carnegie wanted to know he found johann sons obfuscation irritating the blind boy carnegie and for some inexplicable reason carnegie was certain the man smiled down the phone before replying i think perhaps you d better come down and see for yourself sometime around noon suit you johannson could have been one of historys greatest poisoners he had all the requisite qualifications a tidy mind a patient nature and most importantly an encyclopedic knowledge of toxicology watching him at work which carnegie had done on two previous cases was to see a subtle man at his subtle craft and the spectacle made carnegies blood run cold johannson had installed himself in the laboratory on the top floor where doctor dance had been murdered rather than use police facilities for the investigation because as he explained to carnegie much of the equipment the hume organization boasted was simply not available elsewhere his dominion over the place accompanied by his two assistants had however transformed the laboratory from the clutter left by the experimenters to a dream of order only the monkeys remained a constant try as he might johannson could not control their behavior we didnt have much difficulty finding the drug used on your man johannson said we simply crosschecked traces remaining in the hypodermic with materials found in the room in fact they seem to have been manufacturing this stuff or variations on the theme for some time the people here claim they know nothing about it of course im inclined to believe them what the good doctors were doing here was im sure in the nature of a personal experiment what sort of experiment johannson took off his spectacles and set about cleaning them with the tongue of his red tie at first we thought they were developing some kind of hallucinogen he said in some regards the agent used on your man resembles a narcotic in factmethods aparti think they made some very exciting discoveries developments which take us into entirely new territory its not a drug then oh yes of course its a drug johannson said replacing the spectacles but one created for a very specific purpose see for yourself johannson led the way across the laboratory to the row of monkeys cages instead of being confined separately the toxicologist had seen fit to open the interconnecting doors between one cage and the next allowing the animals free access to gather in groups the consequence was absolutely plainthe animals were engaged in an elaborate series of sexual acts why carnegie wondered did monkeys perpetually perform obscenities it was the same torrid display whenever hed taken his offspring as children to regents park zoo the ape enclosure elicited one embarrassing question upon another hed stopped taking the children after a while he simply found it too mortifying havent they got anything better to do he asked of johannson glancing away and then back at a menage a trois that was so intimate the eye could not ascribe member to monkey believe me johannson smirked this is mild by comparison with much of the behavior weve seen from them since we gave them a shot of the agent from that point on they neglected all normal behavior patterns they bypassed the arousal signals the courtship rituals they no longer show any interest in food they dont sleep they have become sexual obsessive all other stimuli are forgotten unless the agent is naturally discharged i suspect they are going to screw themselves to death carnegie looked along the rest of the cages the same pornographic scenes were being played out in each one mass rape homosexual liaisons fervent and ecstatic masturbation its no wonder the doctors made a secret project of their discovery johannson went on they were on to something that could have made them a fortune an aphrodisiac that actually works an aphrodisiac most are useless of course rhinoceros horn live eels in cream sauce symbolic stuff theyre designed to arouse by association carnegie remembered the hunger in jeromes eyes it was echoed here in the monkeys hunger and the desperation that hunger brings and the ointments too all useless cantharis vesticatorawhats that you know the stuff as spanish fly perhaps its a paste made from a beetle again useless at best these things are irritants but this he picked up a vial of colorless fluid this is damn near genius they dont look too happy with it to me oh its still crude johannson said i think the researchers were greedy and moved into tests on living subjects a good two or three years before it was wise to do so the stuff is almost lethal as it stands no doubt of that but it could be made to work given time you see theyve sidestepped the mechanical problems this stuff operates directly on the sexual imagination on the libido if you arouse the mind the body follows thats the trick of it a rattling of the wire mesh close by drew carnegies attention from johannsons pale features one of the female monkeys apparently not satisfied with the attentions of several males was spreadeagled against her cage her nimble fingers reaching for carnegie her spouses not to be left loveless had taken to sodomy blind boy said carnegie is that jerome its cupid isnt it johannson said love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is winged cupid painted blind its midsummer nights dream the bard was never my strongest suit said carnegie he went back to staring at the female monkey and jerome he said he has the agent in his system a sizeable dose so hes like this lot i would presumehis intellectual capacities being greaterthat the agent may not be able to work in quite such an unfettered fashion but having said that sex can make monkeys out of the best of us cant it johannson allowed himself a halfsmile at the notion all our socalled higher concerns become secondary to the pursuit for a short time sex makes us obsessive we can perform or at least think we can perform what with hindsight may seem extraordinary feats i dont think theres anything so extraordinary about rape carnegie commented attempting to stem johannsons rhapsody but the other man would not be subdued sex without end without compromise or apology he said imagine it the dream of casanova the world had seen so many ages the age of enlightenment of reformation of reason now at last the age of desire and after this an end to ages an end perhaps to everything for the fires that were being stoked now were fiercer than the innocent world suspected they were terrible fires fires without end which would illuminate the world in one last fierce light so welles thought as he lay in his bed he had been conscious for several hours but had chosen not to signify such whenever a nurse came to his room be would clamp his eyes closed and slow the rhythm of his breath he knew he could not keep the illusion up for long but the hours gave him a while to think through his itinerary from here his first move had to be back to the laboratories there were papers there he had to shred tapes to wipe clean from now on he was determined that every scrap of information about project blind boy exist solely in his head that way he would have complete control over his masterwork and nobody could claim it from him he had never had much interest in making money from the discovery although he was well aware of how lucrative a workable aphrodisiac would be he had never given a fig for material wealth his initial motivation for the development of the drugwhich they had chanced upon quite by accident while testing an agent to aid schizophrenicshad been investigative but his motives had matured through their months of secret work he had come to think of himself as the bringer of the millennium he would not have anyone attempt to snatch that sacred role from him so he thought lying in his bed waiting for a moment to slip away as he walked the streets jerome would have happily affirmed welless vision perhaps he of all men was most eager to welcome the age of desire he saw its portents everywhere on advertising billboards and cinema marquees in shop windows on television screenseverywhere the body as merchandise where flesh was not being used to market artifacts of steel and stone those artifacts were taking on its properties automobiles passed him by with every voluptuous attribute but breaththeir sinuous bodywork gleamed their interiors invited plushy the buildings beleaguered him with sexual puns spires passageways shadowed plazas with whitewater fountains beneath the raptures of the shallowthe thousand trivial distractions he encountered in street and squarehe sensed the ripe life of the body informing every particular the spectacle kept the fire in him well stoked it was all that will power could do to keep him from pressing his attentions on every creature that he met eyes with a few seemed to sense the heat in him and gave him wide berth dogs sensed it too several followed him aroused by his arousal flies orbited his head in squadrons but his growing ease with his condition gave him some rudimentary control over it he knew that to make a public display of his ardor would bring the law down upon him and that in turn would hinder his adventures soon enough the fire that he had begun would spread then he would emerge from hiding and bathe in it freely until then discretion was best he had on occasion bought the company of a young woman in soho he went to find her now the afternoon was stiflingly hot but he felt no weariness he had not eaten since the previous evening but he felt no hunger indeed as he climbed the narrow stairway up to the room on the first floor which angela had once occupied he felt as primed as an athlete glowing with health the immaculately dressed and walleyed pimp who usually occupied a place at the top of the stairs was absent jerome simply went to the girls room and knocked there was no reply he rapped again more urgently the noise brought an early middleaged woman to the door at the end of the landing what do you want the woman he replied simply angelas gone and youd better get out of here too in that state this isnt a flophouse when will she be back he asked keeping as tight a leash as he could on his appetite the woman who was as tall as jerome and half as heavy again as his wasted frame advanced toward him the girl wont be back she said so you get the hell out of here before i call isaiah jerome looked at the woman she shared angelas profession no doubt if not her youth or prettiness he smiled at her i can hear your heart he said i told you before she could finish the words jerome moved down the landing toward her she wasnt intimidated by his approach merely repulsed if i call isaiah youll be sorry she informed him the pace of her heartbeat had risen he could hear it im burning he said she frowned she was clearly losing this battle of wits stay away from me she told im warning you the heartbeat was getting more rapid still tile rhythm buried in her substance drew him on from that source all life all heat give me your heart he said isaiah nobody came running at her shout however jerome gave her no opportunity to cry out a second time he reached to embrace her clamping a hand over her mouth she let fly a volley of blows against him but the pain only fanned the flames he was brighter by the moment his every orifice let onto the furnace in belly and loins and head her superior bulk was of no advantage against such fervor he pushed her against the wallthe beat of her heart loud in his earsand began to apply kisses to her neck tearing her dress open to free her breasts dont shout he said trying to sound persuasive theres no harm meant she shook her head and said i wont against his palm he took his hand from her mouth and she dragged in several desperate breaths where was isaiah she thought not far surely fearing for her life if she tried to resist this interloperhow his eyes shoneshe gave up any pretense to resistance and let him have his way mens supply of passion she knew from long experience was easily depleted though they might threaten to move earth and heaven too half an hour later their boasts would be damp sheets and resentment if worst came to worst she could tolerate his inane talk of burning shed heard far obscener bedroom chat as to the prong he was even now attempting to press into her it and its comical like held no surprises for her jerome wanted to touch the heart in her wanted to see it splash up into his face to bathe in it he put his hand to her breast and felt the beat of her under his palm you like that do you she said as he pressed against her bosom youre not the first he clawed her skin gently sweetheart she chided him looking over his shoulder to see if there was any sign of isaiah be gentle this is the only body ive got he ignored her his nails drew blood dont do that she said wants to be out he replied digging deeply and it suddenly dawned on her that this was no lovegame he was playing stop it she said as he began to tear at her this time she screamed downstairs and a short way along the street isaiah dropped the slice of tarte francaise hed just bought and ran to the door it wasnt the first time his sweet tooth had tempted him from his post butunless he was quick to undo the damageit might very well be his last there were terrible noises from the landing he raced up the stairs the scene that met his eyes was in every way worse than that his imagination had conjured simone was trapped against the wall beside her door with a man battened upon her blood was coming from somewhere between them he couldnt see where isaiah yelled jerome hands bloody looked around from his labors as a giant in a savile row suit reached for him it took jerome vital seconds to uproot himself from the furrow by which time the man was upon him isaiah took hold of him and dragged him off the woman she took shelter sobbing in her room sick bastard isaiah said launching a fusillade of punches jerome reeled but he was on fire and unafraid in a moments respite he leaped at his man like an angered baboon isaiah taken unawares lost balance and fell back against one of the doors which opened inward against his weight he collapsed into a squalid lavatory his head striking the lip of the toilet bowl as he went down the impact disoriented him and he lay on the stained linoleum groaning legs akimbo jerome could hear his blood eager in his veins could smell sugar on his breath it tempted him to stay but his instinct for selfpreservation counseled otherwise isaiah was already making an attempt to stand up again before he could get to his feet jerome turned about and made a getaway down the stairs the dog day met him at the doorstep and he smiled the street wanted him more than the woman on the landing and he was eager to oblige he started out onto the pavement his erection still pressing from his trousers behind him he heard the giant pounding down the stairs he took to his heels laughing the fire was still uncurbed in him and it lent speed to his feet he ran down the street not caring if sugar breath was following or not pedestrians unwilling in this dispassionate age to register more than casual interest in the bloodspattered satyr parted to let him pass a few pointed assuming him an actor perhaps most took no notice at all he made his way through a maze of back streets aware without needing to look that isaiah was still on his heels perhaps it was accident that brought him to the street market perhaps and more probably it was that the swelter carried the mingled scent of meat and fruit to his nostrils and he wanted to bathe in it the narrow thoroughfare was thronged with purchasers sightseers and stalls heaped with merchandise he dove into the crowd happily brushing against buttock and thigh meeting the plaguing gaze of fellow flesh on every side such a day he and his prick could scarcely believe their luck behind him he heard isaiah shout he picked up his pace heading for the most densely populated area of the market where he could lose himself in the hot press of people each contract was a painful ecstasy each climaxand they came one upon the other as he pressed through the crowdwas a dry spasm in his system his back ached his balls ached but what was his body now just a plinth for that singular monument his prick head was nothing mind was nothing his arms were simply made to bring love close his legs to carry the demanding rod any place where it might find satisfaction he pictured himself as a walking erection the world gaping on every side flesh brick steel he didnt carehe would ravish it all suddenly without his seeking it the crowd parted and he found himself off the main thoroughfare and in a narrow street sunlight poured between the buildings its zeal magnified he was about to turn back to join the crowd again when he caught a scent and sight that drew him on a short way down the heatdrenched street three shirtless young men were standing amid piles of fruit crates each containing dozens of baskets of strawberries there had been a glut of the fruit that year and in the relentless heat much of it had begun to soften and rot the trio of workers was going through the baskets sorting bad fruit from good and throwing the spoiled strawberries into the gutter the smell in the narrow space was overpowering a sweetness of such strength it would have sickened any interloper other than jerome whose senses had lost all capacity for revulsion or rejection the world was the world was the world he would take it as in marriage for better or worse he stood watching the spectacle entranced the sweating fruit sorters bright in the fall of sun hands arms and torsoes spattered with scarlet juice the air mazed with every nectarseeking insect the discarded fruit heaped in the gutter in seeping mounds engaged in their sticky labors the sorters didnt even see him at first then one of the three looked up and took in the extraordinary creature watching them the grin on his face died as he met jeromes eyes what the hell now the other two looked up from their work sweet said jerome he could hear their hearts tremble look at him said the youngest of the three pointing at jeromes groin fucking exposing himself they stood still in the sunlight he and they while the wasps whirled around the fruit and in the narrow slice of blue summer sky between the roofs birds passed over jerome wanted the moment to go on forever his toonaked head tasted eden here and then the dream broke he felt a shadow on his back one of the sorters dropped the basket he was sorting through the decayed fruit broke open on the gravel jerome frowned and halfturned isaiah had found the street his weapon was steel and shone it crossed the space between him and jerome in one short second jerome felt an ache in his side as the knife slid into him christ the young man said and began to run his two brothers unwilling to be witnesses at the scene of a wounding hesitated only moments longer before following the pain made jerome cry out but nobody in the noisy market heard him isaiah withdrew the blade heat came with it he made to stab again but jerome was too fast for the spoiler he moved out of range and staggered across the street the wouldbe assassin fearful that jeromes cries would draw too much attention moved quickly in pursuit to finish the lob but the tarmac was slick with rotted fruit and his fine suede shoes had less grip than jeromes bare feet the gap between them widened by a pace no you dont isaiah said determined not to let his humiliator escape he pushed over a tower of fruit cratesbaskets toppled and strewed their contents across jeromes path jerome hesitated to take in the bouquet of bruised fruit the indulgence almost killed him isaiah closed in ready to take the man jerome his system taxed to near eruption by the stimulus of pain watched the blade come close to opening up his belly his mind conjured the wound the abdomen slitthe heat spilling out to join the blood of the strawberries in the gutter the thought was so tempting he almost wanted it isaiah had killed before twice he knew the wordless vocabulary of the act and he could see the invitation in his victims eyes happy to oblige he came to meet it knife at the ready at the last possible moment jerome recanted and instead of presenting himself for slitting threw a blow at the giant isaiah ducked to avoid it and his feet slid in the mush the knife fled from his hand and fell among the debris of baskets and fruit jerome turned away as the hunterthe advantage loststooped to locate the knife but his prey was gone before his hamfisted grip had found it lost again in the crowdfilled streets he had no opportunity to pocket the knife before the uniform stepped out of the crowd and joined him in the hot passageway whats the story the policeman demanded looking down at the knife isaiah followed his gaze the bloodied blade was black with flies in his office inspector carnegie sipped at his hot chocolate his third in the past hour and watched the processes of dusk he had always wanted to be a detective right from his earliest rememberings and in those rememberings this had always been a charged and magical hour night descending on the city myriad evils putting on their glad rags and coming out to play a time for vigilance for a new moral stringency but as a child he had failed to imagine the fatigue that twilight invariably brought he was tired to his bones and if he snatched any sleep in the next few hours he knew it would be here in his chair with his feet up on the desk amid a clutter of plastic cups the phone rang it was johannson still at work he said impressed by johannsons dedication to the job it was well after nine perhaps johannson didnt have a home worth calling such to go back to either i heard our man had a busy day johannson said thats right a prostitute in soho then got himself stabbed he got through the cordon i gather these things happen carnegie replied too tired to be testy what can i do for you i just thought youd want to know the monkeys have started to die the words stirred carnegie from his fatiguestupor how many he asked three from fourteen so far but the rest will be dead by dawn id guess whats killing them exhaustion carnegie recalled the desperate saturnalia hed seen in the cages what animalhuman or otherwisecould keep up such revelry without cracking up its not physical johannson said or at least not in the way youre implying well have to wait for the dissection results before we get any detailed explanations your best guess for what its worth johannson said which is quite a lot i think theyre going bang what cerebral overload of some kind their brains are simply giving out the agent doesnt disperse you see it feeds on itself the more fevered they get the more of the drug is produced the more of the drug there is the more fevered they get its a vicious circle hotter and hotter wilder and wilder eventually the system cant take it and suddenly im up to my armpits in dead monkeys the smile came back into the voice again cold and wry not that the others let that spoil their fun necrophilias quite the fashion down here carnegie peered at his cooling hot chocolate it had acquired a thin skin which puckered as he touched the cup so its just a matter of time he said before our man goes for bust yes id think so all right thank you for the update keep me posted you want to come down here and view the remains monkey corpses i can do without thank you johannson laughed carnegie put down the receiver when he turned back to the window night had well and truly fallen in the laboratory johannson crossed to the light switch by the door in the time hed been calling carnegie the last of the daylight had fled he saw the blow that felled him coming a mere heartbeat before it landed it caught him across the side of his neck one of his vertebrae snapped and his legs buckled he collapsed without reaching the light switch but by the time he hit the ground the distinction between day and night was academic welles didnt bother to check whether his blow had been lethal or not time was at a premium he stepped over the body and headed across to the bench where johannson had been working there lying in a circle of lamplight as if for the final act of a simian tragedy lay a dead monkey it had clearly perished in a frenzy its face was knitted up mouth wide and spittlestained eyes fixed in a final took of alarm its fur had been pulled out in tufts in the throes of its copulations its body wasted with exertion was a mass of contusions it took welles half a minute of study to recognize the implications of the corpse and of the other two he now saw lying on a nearby bench love kills he murmured to himself philosophically and began his systematic destruction of blind boy im dying jerome thought im dying of terminal joy the thought amused him it was the only thought in his head which made much sense since his encounter with isaiah and the escape from the police that had followed he could remember little with any coherence the hours of hiding and nursing his woundsof feeling the heat grow again and of discharging ithad long since merged into one midsummer dream from which he knew with pleasurable certainty only death would wake him the blaze was devouring him utterly from the entrails out if he were to be eviscerated now what would the witnesses find only embers and ashes yet still his oneeyed friend demanded more still as he wove his way back to the laboratorieswhere else for a made man to go when the stitches slipped but back to the first heatstill the grids gaped at him seductively and every brick wall offered up a hundred gritty invitations the night was balmy a night for love songs and romance in the questionable privacy of a parking lot a few blocks from his destination he saw two people having sex in the back of a car the doors open to accommodate limbs and draft jerome paused to watch the ritual enthralled as ever by the tangle of bodies and the soundso loud it was like thunderof twin hearts beating to one escalating rhythm watching his rod grew eager the female saw him first and alerted her partner to the wreck of a human being who was watching them with such childish delight the male looked around from his gropings to stare do i burn jerome wondered does my hair flame at the last does the illusion gain substance to judge by the look on their faces the answer was surely no they were not in awe of him merely angered and revolted im on fire he told them the male got to his feet and spat at jerome he almost expected the spittle to turn to steam as it approached him but instead it landed on his face and upper chest as a cooling shower go to hell the woman said leave us alone jerome shook his head the male warned him that another step would oblige him to break jeromes head it disturbed our man not a jot no words no blows could silence the imperative of the rod their hearts he realized as he moved toward them no longer beat in tandem carnegie consulted the map five years out of date now on his office wall to pinpoint the location of the attack that had just been reported neither of the victims had come to serious harm apparently the arrival of a carload of revelers had dissuaded jerome from lingering now the area was being flooded with officers half a dozen of them armed in a matter of minutes every street in the vicinity of the attack would be cordoned off unlike soho which had been crowded the area would furnish the fugitive with few hiding places carnegie pinpointed the location of the attack and realized that it was within a few blocks of the laboratories no accident surely the man was heading back to the scene of his crime wounded and undoubtedly on the verge of collapsethe lovers had described a man who looked more dead than alivejerome would probably be picked up before he reached home but there was always the risk of his slipping through the net and getting to the laboratories johannson was working there alone the guard on the building was in these straitened times necessarily small carnegie picked up the phone and dialed through to the johannson the phone rang at the other end but nobody picked it up the mans gone home carnegie thought happy to be relieved of his concern its tenfifty at night and hes earned his rest just as he was about to put the receiver down however it was picked up at the other end johannson nobody replied johannson this is carnegie and still no reply answer me damn it who is this in the laboratories the receiver was forsaken it was not replaced on the cradle hut left to lie on the bench down the buzzing line carnegie could clearly hear the monkeys their voices shrill johannson carnegie demanded are you there johannson but the apes screamed on welles had built two bonfires of the blind boy material in the sinks and then set them alight they flared up enthusiastically smoke heat and ashes filled the large room thickening the air when the fires were fairly raging he threw all the tapes he could lay hands upon into the conflagration and added all of johannsons notes for good measure several of the tapes had already gone from the files he noted but all they could show any thief was some teasing scenes of transformation the heart of the secret remained his with the procedures and formulae now destroyed it only remained to wash the small amounts of remaining agent down the drain and kill and incinerate the animals he prepared a series of lethal hypodermics going about the business with uncharacteristic orderliness this systematic destruction gratified him he felt no regret at the way things had turned out from that first moment of panic when hed helplessly watched the blind boy serum work its awesome effects upon jerome to this final elimination of all that had gone before had been he now saw one steady process of wiping clean with these fires he brought an end to the pretense of scientific inquiry after this he was indisputably the apostle of desire its john in the wilderness the thought blinded him to any other careless of the monkeys scratching he hauled them one by one from their cages to deliver the killing dose he had dispatched three and was opening the cage of the fourth when a figure appeared in the doorway of the laboratory through the smoky air it was impossible to see who the surviving monkeys seemed to recognize him however they left off their couplings and set up a din of welcome welles stood still and waited for the newcomer to make his move im dying said jerome welles had not expected this of all the people he had anticipated here jerome was the last did you hear me the man wanted to know welles nodded were all dying jerome life is a slow disease no more nor less but such a light eh in the going you knew this would happen jerome said you knew the fire would eat me away no came the sober reply no i didnt really jerome walked out of the door frame and into the murky light he was a wasted shambles a patchwork man blood on his body fire in his eyes but welles knew better than to trust the apparent vulnerability of this scarecrow the agent in his system had made him capable of superhuman acts he had seen dance torn open with a few nonchalant strokes tact was required though clearly close to death jerome was still formidable i didnt intend this jerome welles said attempting to tame the tremor in his voice i wish in a way i could claim that i had but i wasnt that farsighted its taken me time and pain to see the future plainly the burning man watched him gaze intent such fires jerome waiting to be lit i know jerome replied believe me i know you and i we are the end of the world the wretched monster pondered this for a while and then nodded slowly welles softly exhaled a sigh of relief the deathbed diplomacy was working but he had little time to waste with talk if jerome was here could the authorities be far behind i have urgent work to do my friend he said calmly would you think me uncivil if i continued with it without waiting for a reply he unlatched another cage and hauled the condemned monkey out expertly turning its body around to facilitate the injection the animal convulsed in his arms for a few moments then died welles disengaged its wizened fingers from his shirt and tossed the corpse and the discharged hypodermic on to the bench turning with an executioners economy to claim his next victim why jerome asked staring at the animals open eyes act of mercy welles replied picking up another primed hypodermic you can see how theyre suffering he reached to unlatch the next cage dont jerome said no time for sentiment welles replied i beg you an end to that sentiment jerome thought muddily remembering the songs on the radio that had first rewoken the fire in him didnt welles understand that the processes of heart and head and groin were indivisible that sentiment however trite might lead to undiscovered regions he wanted to tell the doctor that to explain all that he had seen and all that he had loved in these desperate hours but somewhere between mind and tongue the explanations absconded all he could say to state the empathy he felt for all the suffering world was dont as welles unlocked the next cage the doctor ignored him and reached into the wiremesh cell it contained three animals he took hold of the nearest and drew it protesting from its companions embraces without doubt it knew what fate awaited it a flurry of screeches signaled its terror jerome couldnt stomach this casual disposal he moved the wound in his side a torment to prevent the killing welles distracted by jeromes advance lost hold of his wriggling charge the monkey scampered away across the bench tops as he went to recapture it the prisoners in the cage behind him took their chance and slipped out damn you welles yelled at jerome dont you see weve no time dont you understand jerome understood everything and yet nothing the fever he and the animals shared he understood its purpose to transform the world he understood too but why it should end like thisthat joy that visionwhy it should all come down to a sordid room filled with smoke and pain to frailty to despair that he did not comprehend nor he now realized did welles who had been the architect of these contradictions as the doctor made a snatch for one of the escaping monkeys jerome crossed swiftly to the remaining cages and unlatched them all the animals leaped to their freedom welles had succeeded with his recapture however and had the protesting monkey in his grip about to deliver the panacea jerome made toward him let it be he yelled welles pressed the hypodermic into the monkeys body but before he could depress the plunger jerome had pulled at his wrist the hypodermic spat its poison into the air and then fell to the ground the monkey wresting itself free followed jerome pulled welles close i told you to let it be he said welless response was to drive his fist into jeromes wounded flank tears of pain spurted from his eyes but he didnt release the doctor the stimulus unpleasant as it was could not dissuade him from holding that beating heart close he wished embracing welles like a prodigal that he could ignite himself that the dream of burning flesh he had endured would now become a reality consuming maker and made in one cleansing flame but his flesh was only flesh his bone bone what miracles he had seen had been a private revelation and now there was no time to communicate their glories or their horrors what he had seen would die with him to be rediscovered by some future self only to be forgotten and discovered again like the story of love the radio had told the same joy lost and found found and lost he stared at welles with new comprehension dawning hearing still the terrified beat of the mans heart the doctor was wrong if he left the man to live he would come to know his error they were not presagers of the millennium they had both been dreaming dont kill me welles pleaded i dont want to die more fool you jerome thought and let the man go welless bafflement was plain he couldnt believe that his appeal for life had been answered anticipating a blow with every step he took he backed away from jerome who simply turned his back on the doctor and walked away from downstairs there came a shout and then many shouts police welles guessed they had presumably found the body of the officer whod been on guard at the door in moments only they would be coming up the stairs there was no time now for finishing the tasks hed come here to perform he had to be away before they arrived on the floor below carnegie watched the armed officers disappear up the stairs there was a faint smell of burning in the air he feared the worst i am the man who comes after the act he thought to himself i am perpetually upon the scene when the best of the action is over used as he was to waiting patient as a loyal dog this time he could not hold his anxieties in check while the others went ahead disregarding the voices advising him to wait be began up the stairs the laboratory on the top floor was empty but for the monkeys and johannsons corpse the toxicologist lay on his face where he bad fallen neck broken the emergency exit which let on to the fire escape was open smoky air was being sucked out through it as carnegie stepped away from johannsons body officers were already on the fire escape calling to their colleagues below to seek out the fugitive sir carnegie looked across at the mustachioed individual who had approached him what is it the officer pointed to the other end of the laboratory to the test chamber there was somebody at the window carnegie recognized the features even though they were much changed it was jerome at first he thought the man was watching him but a short perusal scotched that idea jerome was staring tears on his face at his own reflection in the smeared glass even as carnegie watched the face retreated with the gloom of the chamber other officers had noticed the man too they were moving down the length of the laboratory taking up positions behind the benches where they had a good line on the door weapons at the ready carnegie had been present in such situations before they had their own terrible momentum unless he intervened there would be blood no he said hold your fire he pressed the protesting officer aside and began to walk down the laboratory making no attempt to conceal his advance he walked past sinks in which the remains of blind boy guttered past the bench under which a short age ago theyd found the dead dance a monkey its head bowed dragged itself across his path apparently deaf to his proximity he let it find a hole to die in then moved on to the chamber door it was ajar he reached for the handle behind him the laboratory had fallen completely silent all eyes were on him he pulled the door open fingers tightened on triggers there was no attack however carnegie stepped inside jerome was standing against the opposite wall if he saw carnegie enter or heard him he made no sign of it a dead monkey lay at his feet one hand still grasping the hem of his trousers another whimpered in the corner holding its head in its hands jerome was it carnegies imagination or could he smell strawberries jerome blinked youre under arrest carnegie said hendrix would appreciate the irony of that he thought tile man moved his bloody hand from the stab wound in his side to the front of his trousers and began to stroke himself too late jerome said he could feel the last fire rising in him even if this intruder chose to cross the chamber and arrest him now the intervening seconds would deny him his capture death was here and what was it now that he saw it clearly just another seduction another sweet darkness to be filled up and pleasured and made fertile a spasm began in his perineum and lightning traveled in two directions from the spot up his rod and up his spine a laugh began in his throat in the corner of the chamber the monkey hearing jeromes humor began to whimper again the sound momentarily claimed carnegies attention and when his gaze flitted back to jerome the shortsighted eyes had closed the hand had dropped and he was dead standing against the wall for a short time the body defied gravity then gracefully the legs buckled and jerome fell forward he was carnegie saw a sack of bones no more it was a wonder the man had lived so long cautiously he crossed to the body and put his finger to the mans neck there was no pulse the remnants of jeromes last laugh remained on his face however refusing to decay tell me carnegie whispered to the man sensing that despite his preemption he had missed the moment that once again he was and perhaps would always be merely a witness of consequences tell me what was the joke but the blind boy as is the wont of his clan wasnt telling end
