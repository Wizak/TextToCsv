 chapter one the holiday begins blow ive got a puncture said dick my tyres going flat worst time it could possibly happen julian glanced down at dicks back tyre then he looked at his watch youve just got time to pump it up and hope for the best he said weve got seven minutes before the train goes dick jumped off and took his pump the others got off their bicycles too and stood round watching to see if the tyre blew up well or not they were on their way to kirrin station to catch the train bicycles and all their luggage had gone on in advance and they thought they had left plenty of time to ride to the station get their bicycles labelled and put in the luggage van and catch the train comfortably we cant miss the train said george putting on her best scowl she always hated it when things went wrong we can easiest thing in the world said julian grinning at georges fierce face what do you say timmy timmy barked sharply as if to say he certainly agreed he licked georges hand and she patted him the scowl left her face as she saw dicks tyre coming up well theyd just do it dick felt his tyre gave a sigh of relief and put his pump back in its place phew that was hot work he said mounting his bicycle hope it will last till we get to the station i was afraid youd have to go without me oh no said anne wed have caught the next train come on timmy the four cousins and timmy the dog raced on towards the station they cycled into the station yard just as the signal went up to show the train was due the porter came towards them his big round face red and smiling i sent your luggage off for you he said not much between you i must say just one small trunk well we dont wear much on holidays said julian can you label our bikes quickly for us i see the train is due the porter began to label the four bicycles he didnt hurry he wouldnt let the train go off again till he had done his job that was certain there it was now coming round the bend you going off to cornwall i see said the porter and to tremannon too you want to be careful of bathing there thats a fierce coast and a hungry sea oh do you know it said anne surprised is it a nice place nice well i dunno about that said the porter raising his voice as the train came rumbling in i used to go out in my uncles fishingboat all round there and its wild and lonely i shouldnt have thought it was much of a place for a holiday no pier no icecream sellers no concert parties no cinema no good said julian we can do without all those thank you we mean to bathe and hire a boat and fish and bike all round about thats our kind of holiday woof said timmy wagging his tail yes and yours too said george rubbing his big head come on wed better get into a carriage ill see to your bikes said the porter have a good holiday and if you see my uncle tell him you know me his names same as mine john polpenny by tre pol and pen you may know the cornishmen quoted julian getting into a carriage with the others thanks john well look up your uncle if we can they each took a corner seat and timmy went to the opposite door put his feet up on the ledge and his nose out of the window he meant to stand like that all the way he loved the rush of air past his nose timmy come down said george timmy took no notice he was happy it was holidays again and he was with everybody he loved they were going away together there might be rabbits to chase timmy had never yet caught a rabbit but he went on hoping now were off again said julian settling into his corner gosh how i do like the beginnings of a holiday getting ready looking at maps planning how to get there and then at last setting off on a lovely fine day like this said anne george how did your mother hear of tremannon farm well it was father who heard about it really said george you know fathers got a lot of scientist friends who like to go off to lonely places and work out all kinds of ideas in peace and quiet well one of them went to tremannon farm because he heard it was one of the quietest places in the kingdom father said his friend went there all skin and bone and came back as fat as a christmas goose and mother said that sounded just the place for us to go to these hols shes right said dick i feel a bit skinandbonish myself after slaving at school for three months i could do with fattening up they all laughed you may feel skinandbonish but you dont look it said julian you want a bit of exercise to take your fat off well get it too well walk and bike and bathe and climb and eat said george timmy you must be polite to the farm dogs or youll have a bad time and you must remember that when you go out to play youll have to ask the other dogs permission before you can chase their rabbits said dick solemnly timmy thumped his tail against dicks knees and opened his mouth to let his tongue hang out he looked exactly as if he were laughing thats right grin at my jokes said dick im glad youre coming tim it would be awful without you he always has come with us on every holiday said george and hes shared in every single adventure weve ever had good old timmy said julian well he may share in one this time too you never know im not going to have any adventures this time said anne in a firm voice i just want a holiday nothing more lets have a jolly good time and not go on looking for anything strange or mysterious or adventurous right said julian adventures are off this time definitely off and if anything does turn up we poohpooh it and walk off is that agreed yes said anne all right said george doubtfully fine said dick julian looked surprised gosh youre a poor lot i must say well ill fall in with you if youre all agreed even if we find ourselves right in the very middle of goodness knows what we say no thank you and walk away thats agreed well began george im not sure if but what she wasnt sure about nobody knew because timmy chose that moment to fall off the seat he yelped as he hit the floor with a bang and immediately went back to his post at the window putting his head right out well have to get him in and shut the windows said george he might get something in his eye no im not going to cook slowly to a cinder in this hot carriage with all the windows shut not even for the sake of timmys eyes said julian firmly if you cant make him obey you and come inside he can jolly well get something in his eye however the problem was solved very quickly because at that moment the train gave a most unearthly shriek and disappeared headlong into utter blackness timmy astounded fell back into the carriage and tried to get on to georges knee terrified dont be a baby timmy said george its only a tunnel ju haul him off me its too hot to try and nurse a heavy dog like timmy stop it timmy i tell you its only a tunnel the journey seemed very long the carriage was so hot and the train stopped at so many little outoftheway places sometimes for ten minutes at a time they had to change twice and sit on sunbaked stations waiting for their next train to come along timmy panted loudly and hung his tongue out george begged the porters for water at each changingplace they had their lunch with them but somehow they werent hungry they got dirtier and dirtier and thirstier and thirstier for they very quickly drank the orangeade they had brought with them phew said julian fanning himself with a magazine what wouldnt i give for a bathe timmy dont pant all over me you make me feel hotter still what time do we get there asked anne well we have to get out at polwilly halt said julian thats the nearest place to tremannon farm we bike from there with luck we should be there by teatime we ought to have brought masses more to drink said dick i feel like a man whos been lost in a sunscorched desert for weeks they were all extremely glad when they at last arrived at polwilly halt at first they didnt think it was a halt but it was it was nothing but a tiny wooden stage built beside the railway the children sat and waited they hadnt even seen the little wooden stage or the small sign that said polwilly halt the sound of impatient feet came along the little platform the guards perspiring face appeared at the window well didnt you want to get out here you going to sit there all day gosh is this polwilly said julian leaping up sorry we didnt know it was a halt well be out in half a tick the train started off almost before they had banged the door they stood there on the funny little staging all alone save for their four bicycles at the other end the little halt seemed lonely and lost set in the midst of rolling fields and rounded hills not a building was in sight but not far off to the west georges sharp eyes saw something lovely she pulled julians arm look the sea over there between the hills in the dip cant you see it im sure its the sea what a heavenly blue its always that gorgeous blue on the cornish coast said dick ah i feel better when i see that come on lets get our bikes and find our way to tremannon farm if i dont get something to drink soon i shall certainly hang my tongue out like timmy they went to get their bikes dick felt his back tyre it was a bit soft but not too bad he could easily pump it up again how far is it to tremannon farm he asked julian looked at his notes get out at polwilly halt then bike four miles to tremannon farm along narrow lanes tremannon village is about one mile before you get to the farm not too bad we might get some lemonade or even an icecream in the village woof woof said timmy who knew the word icecream very well indeed poor tim said anne hell be so hot running beside our bikes wed better go slowly well if anyone thinks im going to tear along he can think again said dick ill go as slowly as you like anne they set off with timmy down a queer little lane deepset between high hedges they went slowly for timmys sake he panted along valiantly good old timmy he would never give up as long as he was with the four children it was about five oclock and a very lovely evening they met nobody at all not even a slow old farm cart it was even too hot for the birds to sing no wind blew there seemed a curious silence and loneliness everywhere julian looked back at the other three with a grin adventure is in the air i feel it were all set for adventure but no well turn our backs on it and say away with you thats agreed chapter two tremannon farm it certainly was a lovely ride to tremannon farm poppies blew by the wayside in hundreds and honeysuckle threw its scent out from the hedges as they passed the corn stood high in the fields touched with gold already and splashed with the scarlet of the poppies they came to tremannon village at last it was really nothing but a winding street set with a few shops and houses and beyond that straggling out were other houses farther off set in the hills were a few farmhouses their grey stone walls gleaming in the sun the four children found the general store and went in any icecream said julian hopefully but there was none what a blow there was orangeade and lemonade however quite cool through being kept down in the cellar of the store you be the folks that old mrs penruthlan be having in said the village shopkeeper she do be expecting of you furriners baint you well not exactly said julian remembering that to many cornish folk anyone was a foreigner who did not belong to cornwall my mother had a greataunt who lived in cornwall all her life so were not exactly furriners are we youre furriners all right said the bent little shopkeeper looking at julian with birdlike eyes your talk is furrinlike too like that man mrs penruthlan had before we reckoned he was mad though he was harmless enough really said julian pouring himself out a third lemonade well he was a scientist and if youre going to be a really good one you have to be a bit mad you know at least so ive heard golly this lemonade is good can i have another bottle please the old woman suddenly laughed sounding just like an amused hen well well marty penruthlans got a fine meal ready for you but seems like you wont be able to eat a thing not with all that lemonade splashing about in your innards dont say you can hear the splashing said julian earnestly very bad manners that furriners manners im sure well how much do we owe you that was jolly good lemonade he paid the bill and they all mounted their bicycles once more having been given minute directions as to how to get to the farm timmy set off with them feeling much refreshed having drunk steadily for four minutes without stopping i should think youve had about as much water as would fill a horsetrough timmy julian told him my word if this weather holds were going to look like red indians it was an uphill ride to tremannon farm but they got there at last as they cycled through the open gates a fusillade of barks greeted them and four large dogs came flying to meet them timmy put up his hackles at once and growled warningly he went completely stiff and stood there glaring a woman came out behind the dogs her face one large smile now ben now bouncer here nellie here bad dog willy its all right children thats their way of saying welcome to tremannon farm the dogs now stood in a ring round the four children their tongues out their tails wagging vigorously they were lovely dogs three collies and one small black scottie timmy eyed them one by one george had her hand on his collar just in case he should feel foolhardy all of a sudden and imagine he could take on all four dogs singlehanded but he didnt he behaved like a perfect gentleman his tail wagged politely and his hackles went down the little scottie ran up to him and sniffed his nose timmy sniffed back his tail wagging more vigorously then the three sheepdogs ran up beautiful collies with plumy tails and the children heaved sighs of relief to see that the farm dogs evidently were not going to regard timmy as a furriner theyre all right now said mrs penruthlan theyve introduced themselves to one another now come along with me you must be tired and dirty and hungry and thirsty ive high tea waiting for you she didnt talk in the cornish way she was pleased to see them and gave them a grand welcome she took them upstairs to a bathroom big but primitive there was one tap only and that was for cold water it ran very slowly indeed but it was really cold and was lovely and soft to wash in the tired children cleaned themselves and combed their hair they had two bedrooms between them one for the girls and one for the boys they were rather small with little windows that gave a meagre amount of light so that the rooms looked dark even in the bright evening sunshine they were bare little rooms with two beds in each one chair one chest of drawers one cupboard and two small rugs nothing else but oh the views out of the windows miles and miles of countryside set with cornfields pasture land tall hedges and glimpses of winding lanes heather was out on some of the hills blazing purple in the sun and gleaming in the distance was the dark blue brilliance of the cornish sea lovely well bike to the sea as soon as we can said dick trying to flatten the few hairs that would stick up straight on the top of his head there are caves on this coast well explore them i wonder if mrs penruthlan would give us picnic lunches so that we can go off for the day when we want to sure to said julian shes a pet ive never felt so welcome in my life are we ready come on down then im beginning to feel very empty indeed the high tea that awaited them was truly magnificent a huge ham gleaming as pink as timmys tongue a salad fit for a king in fact as dick said fit for several kings it was so enormous it had in it everything that anyone could possibly want lettuce tomatoes onions radishes mustard and cress carrot grated up that is carrot isnt it mrs penruthlan said dick and lashings of hardboiled eggs there was an enormous tureen of new potatoes all gleaming with melted butter scattered with parsley there was a big bottle of homemade salad cream look at that cream cheese too marvelled dick quite overcome and that fruit cake and are those dropscones or what are we supposed to have something of everything mrs penruthlan oh yes said the plump little woman smiling at dicks pleasure and theres a cherry tart made with our own cherries and our own cream with it i know what hungry children are ive had seven of my own all married and gone away so i have to make do with other peoples when i can get them im jolly glad you happened to get hold of us said dick beginning on ham and salad well well keep you busy mrs penruthlan weve all got big appetites ah ive not met any children yet that could eat like mine said mrs penruthlan sounding really sorry same as ive not met any man that can eat like mr penruthlan hes a fine eater he is hell be in soon i hope we shall leave enough for him said anne looking at the ham and the halfempty salad dish no wonder my uncles friend the man who came to stay here went away as fat as butter mrs penruthlan oh the poor man said their hostess who was now filling up their glasses with rich creamy milk thin as my husbands old rake he was and all his bones showing and creaking he said no to this and no to that but i took no notice of him at all if he didnt eat his dinner id take his tray away and tidy it up and then in ten minutes id take it back again and say dinnertime sir and i hope youre hungry and hed start all over again and maybe that time hed really tuck in but didnt he know youd already taken him his dinnertray once said julian astonished goodness he must have been a dreamer i took his tray in three times once said mrs penruthlan so you be careful in case i do the same kind of thing to you i should love it grinned julian yes please id like some more ham and more salad footsteps came outside the room on the stone floor of the hall the door opened and the farmer himself came in the children stared at him in awe he was a strange and magnificent figure of a man tall well over six feet broadly built and as dark as a sunburnt spaniard his mane of hair was black and curly and his eyes were as black as his hair this is mr penruthlan said his wife and the children stood up to shake hands feeling half afraid of this dark giant he nodded his head and shook hands his hand was enormous and was covered with hairs so thick and black that it was like fur anne felt that it would be quite nice and soft to stroke like a cats back he didnt say a word but sat down and let his wife serve him well mr penruthlan she said and hows the cow getting along ah said the farmer taking a plate of ham the children gazed at the slices in awe seven or eight of them goodness oh im glad shes all right said mrs penruthlan stacking up some dirty plates and is the calf a dear little thing and whats the colour ah said mr penruthlan nodding his head red and white like its mother thats good isnt it said his wife who seemed to have a miraculous way of interpreting his ahs what shall we call it everyone badly wanted to say ah but nobody dared however mr penruthlan didnt say ah that time but something that sounded like ock yes well call it buttercup then said his wife nodding her head you always have such good ideas mr penruthlan it sounded odd to hear her call her husband by his surname like that and yet somehow the children couldnt imagine this giant of a fellow even owning a name like jack or jim they went on with their own meal enjoying every minute of it watching mr penruthlan shovel in great mouthfuls and working his way quickly through every dish mrs penruthlan saw them watching him hes a grand eater isnt he she said proudly so were all my children when they were at home i was kept really busy but now with only mr penruthlan to feed i feel quite lost thats why i like people here youll tell me if you dont have enough to eat wont you they all laughed and timmy barked he had had a wonderful meal too it was the remains of mrs penruthlans big stockpot and was very tasty indeed he had also got the largest bone he had ever had in his life the only thing that really worried the wellfed timmy now was where could he put the bone out of the way of the farm dogs mr penruthlan suddenly made a peculiar noise and began undoing a trouser pocket at the back ooah he said and brought out a dirty folded piece of paper he handed it to his wife who unfolded it and read it she looked up at the children smiling now heres a bit of excitement she said the barnies will be along this week youll love them what are the barnies asked george puzzled at mrs penruthlans evident pleasure and excitement oh theyre travelling players that wander round the countryside and play and act in our big barns said mrs penruthlan weve no cinemas for miles you know so the barnies are always very welcome oh you call them barnies because they use your barns for their shows said anne seeing light yes we shall love to see them mrs penruthlan will they play in your barn yes well have all the village here when the barnies come said mrs penruthlan her cheeks going red with delight and maybe people from trelin village too now theres a treat for you ah said mr penruthlan and nodded his great head evidently he liked the barnies too he gave a sudden laugh and said something short and quite incomprehensible he says youll like clopper the horse said his wife laughing the things he does the way he sits down and crosses his legs well you wait and see that horse this sounded rather astonishing a horse that sat down and crossed its legs julian winked at dick they would most certainly see the barnies chapter three the first evening after their wonderful high tea the four children didnt really feel like doing very much dick thought he ought to mend his puncture but wasnt sure that he could bend over properly mrs penruthlan began to stack the dishes and clear away george and anne offered to help her well thats kind of you anne and georgina said the farmers wife but youre tired tonight you can give me a hand some other time by the way which of you is which im anne said anne and im george not georgina said george so please dont call me that i hate it i always wanted to be a boy so i only like to be called george what she really means is that she wont answer unless you do call her george said anne well if you really are sure you dont need our help well go out with the boys so out they went george really looking far more like a boy than a girl with her grey shorts and shirt and her short curly hair and freckled face she put her hands in her pockets and tried to walk like dick dick soon found his puncture and mended it mr penruthlan came by with some straw for his cow and new calf the boys watched him in awe for he was carrying almost a wagon load of straw tied up in bales what strength he had he nodded to them and passed without a word why doesnt he talk wondered dick i suppose all his seven children take after their talkative mother and he never had a chance to get a word in and its too late now hes forgotten how to they laughed what a giant of a man said julian i hope i grow as big as that i dont id hate to have my bare feet poking out of the bottom of the bed every night said dick there ive finished that puncture see the nail that made it i must have run over it on the way to the station this morning do look at timmy said julian hes having the time of his life with those farm dogs acting just like a puppy so he was bounding here and there rushing round the dogs and then rushing away jumping on first one and then another till they all went down in an excited yapping scrum the little scottie doing his best to keep up with everything timmys going to have a good time here said dick and hell soon lose his beautiful waistline if he eats as well as we do well take him on long bike rides said julian he cant grow much tummy if he runs for miles the girls came up just then a few feet behind trotted a queer little boy barefooted shockheaded and very dirty whos this said dick i dont know said george he suddenly appeared behind us and has been following us ever since ht just wont go away the boy wore a ragged pair of pants and a shirt with no sleeves or buttons he was blackeyed and burnt darkbrown by the sun he stood a few feet away and stared who are you said dick the boy went back a few steps in fright he shook his head i said who are you said dick again or if you prefer it another way whats your name yan said the boy yan said dick thats a queer name he probably means jan said george the boy nodded iss yan he said i suppose iss means yes said anne all right jan you can go now i stay said the boy solemnly iss and stay he did following them about everywhere gazing at all they did with the utmost curiosity as if he had never in his life seen children before hes like a mosquito said dick always buzzing around im getting tired of it hey yan iss clear out now understand get away go run off vamoose bunk scoot explained dick sternly yan stared mrs penruthlan came out and heard all this jan bothering you she said hes as full of curiosity as a cat go home jan take this to your old grandad and heres some for you jan came up eagerly and took the packet of food mrs penruthlan held out to him and the slice of cake he ran off without a word his bare feet making no sound who is he asked george what a little scarecrow hes a poor little thing said the farmers wife hes got no kith or kin except for his old greatgrandad and theres more than eighty years between them the old man is our shepherd do you see that hill over there well hes got a hut on the other side and there he lives winter and summer alike and that child with him surely he ought to go to school said julian perhaps he does no said mrs penruthlan he plays truant nearly all the time you ought to go and talk to his old greatgrandad his father was one of the wreckers on this coast and he can tell you some strange stories about those dreadful days well certainly go and talk to him said dick id forgotten that this cornish coast was the haunt of wreckers they shone false lights to bring ships in close to shore so that they would be smashed to pieces on the rocks didnt they yes and then they robbed the poor groaning ship when she was helpless said mrs penruthlan and its said they paid no heed to the drowning folk either those were wicked days how far is it to cycle to the sea said george i can see it from my bedroom window oh it wont take you more than ten minutes said the farmers wife go tomorrow if you like you all look very tired now why dont you take a short walk and go to bed ill have a snack ready for you when you come in oh we couldnt possibly eat any more tonight thank you said dick hurriedly but the walk is quite a good idea wed like to see round the farm mrs penruthlan left them and dick looked round at the others a snack he said i never thought id groan at the thought but i bet mr penruthlan will want a jolly good snack when he comes in come on lets go up by those sheds they went off together timmy following behind with his four friends their tails wagging amiably it was still a lovely evening and a cool breeze came down from the hills making it lovelier still the children wandered round enjoying the familiar farm sights the ducks on the pond a few hens still clucking round the grey sheep dotting the hills cows were peacefully grazing and an old farm horse came to a gate to stare at them they rubbed his velvety nose and he bent down to sniff at timmy whom he didnt know timmy sniffed solemnly back they went into the barns and looked around big dark sweetsmelling places stored with many things dick was sure that the biggest one would be the one used by the barnies what fun i bet theyll be pretty awful but good fun all the same he said it must be grand to wander round the countryside with all your belongings done up in a parcel or two and then amaze the country people with your songs and dances and acting i wouldnt mind trying it myself im pretty good at a spot of conjuring for instance yes you are said anne wouldnt it be fun if we could give a little show too if the barnies would let us join them just for one evening we wouldnt be allowed to because were furriners said dick grinning i say whats that over there behind that sack timmy at once went to see and stood there barking the others went over to look its that kid yan again said julian in disgust he pulled the boy out from his hidingplace what are you following us around for you little idiot he demanded we dont like it see go and find your old grandad before you eat all the food mrs penruthlan gave you go on now he pushed the boy out of the barn and watched him go into the next field thats got rid of him he said i think hes a bit simple well go and see that grandad of his one day and see if he really has got anything interesting to say about the old wreckers lets go back now said dick yawning ive seen enough of this place to know im going to like it a lot im going to like my bed tonight too coming ju they all felt the same as dick his yawn had set them yawning too and they thought longingly of bed they made their way back to the farm followed closely by timmy at their heels and the other four dogs a respectful distance away they said good night to the two penruthlans who were sitting peacefully listening to their radio mrs penruthlan wanted to come up with them but they wouldnt let her they said good night to the farmer who grunted ah without even looking at them and went on listening to the radio programme then up the stairs they went and into their rooms when julian was in bed and almost asleep he heard a scrabbling noise outside his window he halfopened his eyes and listened he hoped it wasnt rats if it was anne would probably hear them too and be scared and timmy would hear them and bark the place down the scrabbling noise came again julian spoke softly to dick dick are you awake did you hear that noise at the window no answer dick was sound asleep dreaming that he had a puncture in his foot and couldnt walk till it was mended julian lay and listened yes there it was again and now surely there was someone trying to peep in at the tiny window he slid out of bed and went to the side of the window thick ivy grew outside somebody was still there for julian could see the leaves shaking he put his head suddenly out of the window and a scared face quite close to his stared in fright yan what do you think youre doing said julian fiercely ill spank you if you go on like this staring and peeping whats so queer about us yan was terrified he suddenly slithered down the ivy like a cat landed with a slight thud on the ground and then ran off into the twilight at top speed i hope hes not going to follow us around all the time thought julian getting into bed again ill teach him a lesson if he does blow him now hes made me wide awake rut it wasnt long before julian was sleeping as soundly as dick neither of them stirred until a cock outside their window decided that it was time the whole world woke up and crowed at the top of his voice cockadoodledoo the boys woke with a jump the early sun streamed into the room and julian glanced at his watch how early it was and yet he could hear movements downstairs that told him mrs penruthlan was up and about and so was her giant of a husband he fell asleep again and was awakened by a loud knock at his door and mrs penruthlans voice its half past seven and breakfast will be on the table for you at eight wake up how lovely to wake in a strange place at the beginning of a holiday to think of bathing and biking and picnicking and eating and drinking forgetting all about exams and rules and punishments the four children and timmy stretched themselves and stared at the sunshine outside what a day downstairs breakfast awaited them super said dick eyeing the bacon and fried eggs the cold ham and the homemade jam and marmalade mrs penruthlan your seven children must have been very sorry to marry and leave home i feel if id been one of them id have stayed with you for the rest of my life chapter four down in the cove the first three days at tremannon farm were lazy uneventful days full of sunshine good food dogs and of little yan he really was a perfect nuisance the four children seemed to have a real fascination for him and he trailed them everywhere following them barefooted he turned up behind hedges along lanes at their picnicking places his dark eyes watching them intently whats the good of telling him to go groaned julian he disappears behind one hedge and appears out of another youd think hed get bored doing this shadowing business all the time whats the point of it anyway no point said george just curiosity what i cant understand is why timmy puts up with him youd think hed bark or growl or something but hes quite silly with yan lets him play with him and roll him over as if he was a mad puppy well im going to find this greatgrandad of his tomorrow and tell him to keep yan with him said julian hes maddening i feel i want to swot him like a gnat always buzzing round us gosh there he is again so he was a pair of dark eyes were gazing round a treetrunk half hidden by a sheaf of leaves timmy bounded up to him in glee and made such a fuss of yan that george was quite disgusted timmy come here she called imperiously dont you understand that you ought to chase yan away when he comes and not encourage him im ashamed of you timmy put his tail down and went to her he sat down beside her with a bump dick laughed hes sulking he wont look at you george hes turning his head away on purpose julian chased yan away threatening him with all sorts of things if he caught him but the boy was as fast as a hare and seemed suddenly to disappear into thin air he had a wonderful way of vanishing and an equally remarkable way of appearing again i dont like that kid said julian he makes me shiver down my back whenever i see him suddenly peeping somewhere he cant be a bad kid though because timmy likes him so much said anne who had great faith in timmys judgment timmy never likes anyone horrid well hes made a mistake this time then said george who was cross with timmy hes being very stupid im not pleased with you timmy lets go down to the sea and bathe said dick well go on our bikes and yan wont be able to pop up and watch us there they took their bicycles and rode off to the coast mrs penruthlan made them sandwiches and gave them fruit cake and drinks to take with them they saw yan watching them from behind a hedge as they went they took the road to the sea it was no more than a narrow lane and wound about like a stream twisting and turning so that they couldnt get up any speed at all look the sea cried dick as they rounded one last bend the lane had run down between two high rocky cliffs and in front of them was a cove into which raced enormous breakers throwing spray high into the air they left their bicycles at the top of the cove and went behind some big rocks to change into bathing things when they came out julian looked at the sea it was calm beyond the rocks but over these the waters raged fiercely and it was impossible to venture in they walked a little way round the cliffs and came to a great pool lying in a rocky hollow just the thing cried george and plunged in gosh its cold it should have been hot from the sun but every now and again an extra large wave broke right into the pool itself bringing in cooler water it was fun when that happened the four of them swam to their hearts content and timmy had a fine time too they picnicked on the rocks with spray flying round them and then went to explore round the foot of the cliffs this is exciting said george caves and more caves and yet more caves and cove after cove all as lovely as the one before i suppose when the tides in all these coves are shoulderhigh in water my word yes said julian who was keeping a very sharp eye indeed on the tide and a good many of these caves would be flooded too no wonder mrs penruthlan warned us so solemnly about the tides here i wouldnt want to try and climb up these cliffs if we were caught anne looked up and shivered they were so very steep and high they frowned down at her as if to say we stand no nonsense from anyone so look after yourself well im blessed look there isnt that that tiresome little wretch of a yan said dick suddenly he pointed to a rock covered with seaweed peeping from behind it was yan he must have run all the way here and found us said julian in disgust well well leave him here its time we went the tides coming in itll serve him right to find us gone as soon as he arrives he must be mad do you think he knows about the tide said anne looking worried i mean knows that its coming in and might catch him of course he knows said julian dont be silly but well wait and have our tea at the top part of the cove if you like thats the only way back if he wants to escape the tide short of climbing the cliff which no one would be mad enough to try they had put aside some cake and biscuits for their tea and they found a good picnicking place at the top of the cove where they had left their bicycles they settled down to munch the solid fruit cake that mrs penruthlan had given them there was no doubt about it she was a wonderful cook the tide swept in at a great rate and soon the noise of enormous waves pounding on the rocks grew louder yan hasnt appeared yet said anne do you think hes all right he must be having a good old wetting if hes still there said dick i think wed better go and see much as i dislike him i dont want him to be drowned the two boys went down the cove as far as they could peering round the cliff to where they had seen yan hiding but how different it all looked now gosh the beach is gone already said julian startled i can see how easily anyone could get caught by the tide now see that last wave it swept right into that cave we explored whats happened to yan said dick hes nowhere to be seen he didnt come out of the cove weve been sitting there all the time where is he dick spoke urgently and julian began to feel scared too he hesitated should they wade over the rocks a little way the next wave decided him it would be folly to do any such thing another wave like that and both he and dick would be flung off the rock they were standing on look out here comes an even bigger one yelled julian and the two boys leapt off their rock and raced back up the cove even so the wave lapped right up to their feet they went back to the girls cant see him anywhere said julian speaking more cheerfully than he felt the whole beach is covered with the tide now more than covered the lower caves are full too he he wont be drowned will he said anne fearfully oh i expect he can look after himself said julian hes used to this coast come on its time we went they all rode off timmy running beside their bicycles nobody said anything they couldnt help feeling worried about yan whatever could have happened to him they arrived at the farm and put their bicycles away they went in to find mrs penruthlan they told her about yan and how he had disappeared you dont think he might have been swept off his feet and drowned do you asked anne mrs penruthlan laughed good gracious no that boy knows his way about the countryside and the seashore blindfold hes cleverer than you think he never misses anything hes a poor little thing but he looks after himself all right this was rather comforting perhaps yan would turn up again with his dark eyes fixed unblinkingly on them after a hightea as good as any they had had they went for a walk down the honeysucklescented lanes accompanied as usual by the five dogs they sat on a stile and dick handed round some barleysugar look said george suddenly do you see what i see look she nodded her head towards an oak tree in the hedge not far off the others stared up into it two dark eyes stared back yan he had followed them as usual and had hidden himself to watch them anne was so tremendously relieved to see him that she called to him in delight oh yan have a barleysugar yan slithered down the tree at top speed and came up he held out his hand for the barleysugar for the first time he smiled and his dirty sullen face lighted up enchantingly anne stared at him why he was a dear little fellow his eyes shone and twinkled and a dimple came in each cheek here you are heres a couple more sweets for you dick said very glad to see that the small boy hadnt been drowned yan almost snatched them from him lt was plain that he very very seldom had any sweets timmy was making a fuss of him as usual he lay down on his back and rolled over yans feet he licked his bare knees and arms and jumped up at him almost knocking the boy down yan laughed and fell on timmy rolling over and over with him julian dick and anne watched and laughed but george was not pleased timmy was her dog and she didnt like him to make a fuss of anyone she disapproved of she was glad that yan was safe but she still didnt like him so she scowled and julian nudged dick to make him see the scowl george saw him and scowled worse than ever youll be sorry you gave him sweets she said hell be round us worse than ever now yan came up after a minute or two sucking all three sweets at once so that his right cheek was very swollen indeed come see my granddad he said earnestly talking even worse than usual because of the sweets i tell him bout you all he tell you many things he stared at them all seriously grandad likes sweets too he added solemnly iss iss he do julian laughed all right well come and see him tomorrow afternoon now you clear off or you wont get any more sweets understand iss said yan nodding his head he took the three sweets out of his mouth looked at them to see how much he had sucked them and then put them back again clear off now said julian again but wait a bit ive just thought how did you get away from that beach this afternoon did you climb that cliff no said yan shifting his sweets to the other cheek i came the wreckers way my grandad learnt it me he was off and away before anyone could ask him another question the four looked at one another did you hear that said julian he went the wreckers way whats that do you suppose we must have been on one of the beaches the wreckers used long long ago yes but how did he get off that beach and away into safety said dick id like to know more about the wreckers way i certainly think wed better pay a visit to old greatgrandad tomorrow he might have some very interesting things to tell us well well go and see him said george getting up but just you remember what i said yan will pester us more than ever now weve encouraged him oh well he doesnt seem such a bad kid after all said dick remembering that sudden smile and the eager acceptance of a few sweets and if he persuades grandad to let us into the secret of wreckers way we might have some fun doing a bit of exploring dont you think so ju it might even lead to an adventure said julian laughing at annes serious face cheer up anne i cant even smell an adventure in tremannon im just pulling your leg i think youre wrong said anne if you cant smell one somewhere i can i dont want to but i can chapter five yan and his grandad the next day was sunday it made no difference to the time that the two penruthlans got up however as mrs penruthlan said the cows and horses hens and ducks didnt approve of late sunday breakfasts they wanted attending to at exactly the same time each day will you be going to church asked mrs penruthlan its a beautiful walk across the fields to tremannon church and youd like parson hes a good man he is yes were all going said julian we can tie timmy up outside hes used to that and we thought wed go up and see your old shepherd this afternoon mrs penruthlan and see what tales he has to tell yan will show you the way said the farmers wife bustling off to her cooking ill get you a fine sunday dinner do you like fresh fruit salad with cream rather said everyone at once cant we help you to do something said anne ive just seen all the peas youre going to shell piles of them and dont you want help with those red currant i love getting the currants off their stalks with a fork well youll have a few odd minutes before you go to church i expect said mrs penruthlan looking pleased it would be a bit of help today but the boys neednt help i like that said george indignantly how unfair why shouldnt they just because theyre boys dont fly off the handle george grinned dick were going to help dont worry we like podding peas too youre not going to have all the treats dick had a very neat way of turning the tables on george when he saw her flying into a tantrum she smiled unwillingly she was always jealous of the boys because she so badly wanted to be one herself and wasnt she hitched up her shorts and went to get a pan of peas to shell soon the noise of the popping of pads was to be heard a very pleasant noise anne thought the four of them sat on the big kitchen step out in the sun with timmy sitting beside them watching with interest he didnt stay with them long though up came his four friends the little scottie trotting valiantly behind trying to keep up with the longer legs of the others woof said the biggest collie timmy wagged his tail politely but didnt stir woof said the collie again and pranced around invitingly timmy he says will you come and play said george arent you going you arent the least help with shelling peas and you keep breathing down my neck timmy gave george a flying lick and leapt off the step joyfully he pounced on the scottie rolled him over and then took on all three collies at once they were big strong dogs but no match for timmy look at him said george proudly he can manage the whole lot singlehanded singlefooted said dick hes faster than even that biggest collie and stronger than the whole lot good old tim hes come in jolly useful in some of our adventures ive no doubt he will again said julian id rather have one timmy than two policedogs i should think his ears are burning the way were talking about him said anne oh sorry dick that pod popped unexpectedly thats the second lot of peas youve shot all over me said dick scrabbling inside his shirt i must just find one that went down my neck or i shall be fidgeting all through church you always do said anne look isnt that yan it was he came sidling up looking as dirty as ever and gave them a quick smile that once more entirely changed his sullen little face he held out his hand palm upwards and said something whats he saying said dick oh hes asking for a sweet dont give him one said julian quickly dont turn him into a little beggar make him work for a sweet this time yan if you want a sweet you can help pod these peas mrs penruthlan appeared at once but see he washes those filthy hands first she commanded and disappeared again yan looked at his hands then put them under his armpits go and wash them said julian but yan shook his head and sat down a little way away from them all right dont wash your hands dont shell the peas dont have a sweet said george yan scowled at george he didnt seem to like her any more than she liked him he waited till someone split a pod and a few peas shot out on to the ground instead of into the dish then he darted at them picked them up and ate them he was as quick as a cat my grandad says come see him announced yan i take you right said julian well come this afternoon well get mrs penruthlan to pack us up a basket and well have tea in the hills you can share it if you wash your hands and face i shouldnt think hes ever washed himself in his life said george oh heres timmy come back i will not have him fawn round that dirty little boy here timmy but timmy darted to yan with the greatest delight and pawed at him to come and have a game they began to roll over and over like two puppies if youre going to church youd better get ready said mrs penruthlan appearing again this time with arms floured up to the elbow my what a lot of peas youve done for me i wish i had time to do the red currants said anne weve practically finished the peas anyway mrs penruthlan weve done thousands i should think ah mr penruthlan is real fond of peas said the farmers wife he can eat a whole tureen at one sitting she disappeared again the children went to get ready for church and then off they went it certainly was a lovely walk over the fields with honeysuckle trailing everywhere the church was small and old and lovely yan went with them trailing behind right to the church door when he saw george tying timmy up to a railing he sat down beside him and looked pleased george didnt look pleased however now timmy and yan would play about together all the time she was in church how annoying the church was cool and dark except for three lovely stainedglass windows through which the sun poured its brilliance dimmed by the colours of the glass parson was as nice as mrs penruthlan had said a simple friendly person whose words were listened to by everyone from an old old woman bent almost double in a corner to a solemneyed five year old clutching her mothers hand it was dazzling to come out into the sun again from the cool dimness of the church timmy barked a welcome yan was still there sitting with his arm round timmys neck he gave them his sudden smile and untied timmy who promptly went mad and tore out of the churchyard at sixty miles an hour he always did that when he had been tied up you come see grandad said yan to dick and pulled at his arm this afternoon said dick you can show us the way come after dinner so after the children had had a dinner of cold boiled beef and carrots with a dumpling each and lashings of peas and new potatoes followed by a truly magnificent fruit salad and cream yan appeared at the door to take them to his grandad did you see the amount of peas that mr penruthlan got through said anne in awe i should think he really did manage a tureen all to himself i wish hed say something beside ah and ock and the other peculiar sounds he makes conversation is awfully difficult with him is yan taking you up to grandad called mrs penruthlan ill put a few cakes in the basket for him too then and for grandad dont put us up a big tea begged dick we only want a snack just to keep us going till hightea but all the same the basket was quite heavy when mrs penruthlan had finished packing it it was a long walk over the fields to the shepherds hut yan led the way proudly they crossed the fields and climbed stiles walked up narrow cartpaths and at last came to a coneshaped hill on which sheep grazed peacefully halfgrown lambs wearing their woolly coats unlike the shorn sheep gambolled here and there then remembered that they were nearly grown up and walked sedately the old shepherd was sitting outside his hut smoking a clay pipe he wasnt very big and he seemed shrivelled up like an apple stored too long but there was still sweetness in him and the children liked him at once he had yans sudden smile that lighted up eyes that were still as blue as the summer sky above them his face had a thousand wrinkles that creased and ran into one another when he smiled his shaggy eyebrows curly beard and hair were all grey as grey as the woolly coats of the sheep he had lived with all his life you be welcome he said in his slow cornish voice yan here have told me about you weve brought our tea to share with you said dick well have it later on is it true that your father was one of the wreckers in the old days the old fellow nodded his head julian got out a bag of boiled sweets and offered them to the old man he took one eagerly yan edged up at once and was given one too judging by the crunching that went on old grandad still had plenty of teeth when the sweet had gone he began to talk he talked slowly and simply almost as yan might have done and sometimes paused to find a word he wanted living with sheep all his life doesnt make for easy talking thought julian interested in this old man with the wise keen eyes he must be much more at home with sheep than with human beings grandad certainly had some interesting things to tell them dreadful things anne thought youve seen them rocks down on tremannon coast began grandad wicked rocks they be hungry for ships and men theres many a ship been wrecked on purpose ay you can look disbelievinglike but its true how did they get wrecked on purpose asked dick were they lured here by a false light or something the old man lowered his voice as if he was afraid of being overheard way back up the coast more than a hundred years ago there was a light set to guide the ships that sail round here said grandad they were to sail towards that light and then hug the coast and avoid the rocks that stood out to sea they were safe then but on wild nights a light was set two miles farther down the coast to bemuse lost ships and drag them to the rocks round tremannon coves how wicked said anne and george together how could men do that its fair amazing what men will do said grandad nodding his head take my old dad now a kind man he was and went to church so he did and took me with him but he was the one that set the false light burning every time and sent men to watch the ship coming in on the rocks crashing over them to break into pieces did you did you ever see a ship crashing to its death asked dick imagining the groaning of the sailing ships and the groaning of the men flung into the raging sea ay i did so said grandad his eyes taking on a very faraway look i were sent to the cove with the men and had to hold a lantern to bemuse the ship again when she came to the rocks poor thing she groaned like a live thing she did when she ran into them wicked rocks and split into pieces and next day i went to the cove to help get the goods that were scattered all around the cove there were lots drownded that night and dont tell us about that said dick feeling sick where did they flash the false light from from these hills or from the cliff somewhere ill show you where my dad flashed it from said grandad and he got up slowly theres only one place on these hills where you could see the light aflashing the wreckers had to find somewhere well hidden so that their wicked light couldnt be seen from inland or the police would stop it but it could be seen plainly by any ship on the sea near this coast he took them round his hill and then pointed towards the coast set between two hills there the roof of a house could just be seen and from it rose a tower it could only be seen from that one spot dick took a few steps to each side of it and at once the house disappeared behind one or other of the hills on each side of it i were the only one that ever knew the false light could be seen from inland said grandad pointing with his pipestem towards the faroff square tower i were watching lambs one night up here and i saw the light aflashing and i heard there was a ship wrecked down in tremannon cove that night so i reckoned it were the wreckers at work did you often see the light flashing over there when you watched the sheep asked george oh ay many a time said the shepherd and always on wild stormy nights when ships were labouring along and in trouble looking for some light to guide them into shore then a light would flare out over there and id say to meself now may the good god help those sailors tonight for its sure that nobody else will how horrible said george quite appalled at such wickedness you must be glad that you never see that false light shining there on stormy nights now grandad looked at george and his eyes were scared and strange he lowered his voice and spoke to george as if she were a boy little master he said that light still flares on dark and stormy nights the place is a ruin and jackdaws build in the tower but three times this year ive seen that light again come a stormy night itll flare again i know it in my bones little master i know it in my bones chapter six a queer tale the four children shivered suddenly in the hot sun as they listened to the shepherds strange words were they true did the wreckers light still flash in the old tower on wild and stormy nights but why should it surely no wreckers any longer did their dreadful work on this lonely rocky coast dick voiced the thoughts of the others but surely there are no wrecks on this coast now isnt there a good lighthouse farther up to warn ships to keep right out to sea grandad nodded his grey head yes theres a lighthouse and theres not been a wreck along this coast for more years than i can remember but i tell you that light flares up just as it used to do i seen it with my own eyes and theres nought wrong with them yet i seen it too put in yan suddenly grandad looked at yan annoyed you hold your noise you he commanded youve never seen no light you sleeps like a babe at nights i seen it said yan obstinately and moved out of grandads way quickly as the old man raised his hand to cuff the small boy dick changed the subject grandad do you know anything about the wreckers way he asked is it a secret way to get down to the coves from inland was it used by the wreckers grandad frowned that be a secret he said shortly my dad he showed it to me and i swore as i never would tell us all had to swear and promise that but yan here said that you taught the way to him said dick puzzled yan promptly removed himself from the company and disappeared round a clump of bushes his old greatgrandad glared round at the disappearing boy yan that boy he doesnt know anything about the wreckers way its lost and forgotten by every man living im the last one left as knows of it yan hes dreaming maybe hes heard tell of an old wreckers way but thats all oh said dick disappointed he had hoped that grandad would tell them the old way and then they could go and explore it perhaps they could go and search for it anyhow it would be fun to do that julian came back to the question of the light flashing from the old tower by the coast he was puzzled who could possibly flash that light he said to grandad you say the place is a ruin are you sure it wasnt lightning you saw you said it came on a wild and stormy night it werent lightning said the old man shortly i first saw that light near ninety years ago and i tell you i saw it again three times this year same place same light same weather and if you telled me it werent flashed by mortal hands id believe you there was a silence after this extraordinary statement anne looked over towards the faroff tower that showed just between the two distant hills how queer that this spot where they were standing was the only place from which the tower could be seen from inland the wreckers had been clever to choose a spot like that to flash a light from no one but old grandad up on the hills could possibly have seen the light and guessed what was going on no one but the callous wreckers themselves grandad delved deep into more memories stored in his mind he poured them out tales of the old days queer unbelievable stories one was about an old woman who was said to be a witch the things she did the four stared at the old shepherd marvelling to think they were in a way linked with the witches and brownies the wreckers and the killers of longago days through this old old man yan appeared again as soon as julian opened the teabasket they had now gone back to the hut and sat outside in the sunshine surrounded by nibbling sheep one or two of the halfgrown lambs came up looking hot in their unshorn woolly coats they nosed round the old shepherd and he rubbed their woolly noses these be lambs i fed from a bottle he explained they always remember go away now woolly cakes wasted on you yan wolfed quite half the tea he gave anne a quick grin of pure pleasure showing both his dimples at once she smiled back she liked this funny little boy now and felt sorry for him she was sure that his old grandad didnt give him enough to eat the church bells began to ring and the sun was now sliding down the sky we must go said julian reluctantly its quite a long walk back thanks for a most interesting afternoon grandad i expect youll be glad to be rid of us now and smoke your pipe in peace with your sheep around you ay i will said grandad truthfully i do be one for my own company and i likes to think my own thoughts long thoughts they be too going back nigh on a hundred years if i wants to talk i talks to my sheep its rare and wunnerful how they listen the children laughed but grandad was quite solemn and meant every word he said they packed up the basket and said goodbye to the old man well what do you think he meant when he talked about the light still flashing in the old tower said dick as they went over the hills back to the farm what an extraordinary thing to say was it true do you suppose theres only one way to find out said george her eyes dancing wait for a wild and stormy night and go and see but what about our agreement said julian solemnly if anything exciting seems about to happen we turn our backs on it thats what we decided dont you remember pooh said george we ought to keep the agreement said anne doubtfully she knew quite well that the others didnt think so look who are all these people said dick suddenly they were just climbing over a stile to cross a lane to another field they sat on the stile and stared some carts were going by open wagons their canvas tops folded down they were the most oldfashioned carts the children had ever seen not in the least like gipsy caravans ten or eleven people were with the wagons dressed in the clothes of other days some rode in the wagons and some walked some were middleaged some were young but they all looked cheerful and gay the children stared after grandads tales of long ago these oldtime folk seemed just right for a few moments anne felt herself back in grandads time when he was a boy he must have seen people dressed like these who are they she said wonderingly and then the children saw red lettering painted on the biggest cart the barnies oh its the barnies dont you remember mrs penruthlan telling us about them said anne the strolling players who play to the countryfolk around in the barns what fun the barnies waved to the watching children one man dressed in velvet and lace with a sword at his side and a wig of curly hair threw a leaflet or two to them they read them with interest the barnies are coming they will sing they will dance they will fiddle they will perform plays of all kinds edith wells the nightingale singer bonnie carter the oldtime dancer janie coster and her fiddle john walters finest tenor in the world georgie roth hell make you laugh and others we also present clopper the funniest horse in the world the barnies are coming thisll be fun said george pleased she called out to the passing wagons will you be playing at tremannon farm oh yes called a man with bright merry eyes we always play there you staying there yes said george well look out for you all where are you going now to poltelly farm for the night called the man well be at tremannon soon the wagons passed and the gay queerlydressed players went out of sight good said dick their show may not be firstrate but its sure to be funny they looked a merry lot all but the man driving the front cart did you see him said anne he looked pretty grim i thought nobody else had noticed him he was probably the owner of the barnies said dick and has got all the organization on his shoulders well come on wheres timmy they looked round for him and george frowned yan had followed them as usual and timmy was playing with him bother yan was he going to trail them all day and every day they went back to the peaceful farmhouse hens were still clucking around and ducks were quacking a horse stamped somewhere near by and the grunting of pigs came on the air it all looked quite perfect footsteps came through the farmyard and mr penruthlan came by he grunted at them and went into a barn anne spoke in almost a whisper i can imagine him living in the older days and being a wrecker i can really yes i know what you mean said dick hes so fiercelooking and determined whats the word i want ruthless im sure he would have made a good wrecker do you suppose there are any wreckers now and that light really is flashed to make ships go on the rocks said george well i shouldnt have thought there were any wreckers in this country anyway said dick i cant imagine that such a thing would be tolerated for an instant but if that light is flashed what is it flashed for old grandad said there hadnt been any wrecks on this coast for ages said julian i think really that the old man is wandering a bit in his mind about that light but yan said he had seen it too said anne im not sure that yans as truthful as he might be said julian why did grandad say that the light isnt fiashed by mortal hands now asked george it must be i cant imagine any other hands working it he surely doesnt think that his father is still doing it there was a pause we could easily find out if we popped over to that tower and had a look at it said dick there was another pause i thought we said we wouldnt go poking about in anything mysterious said anne this isnt really mysterious argued dick its just a story an old man remembers and i really cant believe that that light still flashes on a wild stormy night grandad must have seen lightning or something why dont we settle the matter for good and all and go and explore the old house with the tower i should like to said george firmly i never was keen on this keep away from anything unusual idea we suddenly had weve got timmy with us we cant possibly come to any harm all right said anne with a sigh i give up well go if you want to good old anne said dick giving her a friendly slap on the back but you neednt come you know why dont you stay behind and hear our story when we come back certainly not said anne quite cross i may not want to go as much as you do but im not going to be left out of anything so dont think it all right its settled then said julian we take our opportunity and go as soon as we can tomorrow perhaps mrs penruthlan came to the door and called them your high tea is ready you must be hungry come along indoors the sun suddenly went in julian looked up at the sky in surprise my word look at those black clouds he said theres a storm coming well i thought there might be its been so terribly hot all day a storm said george that light flashes on wild and stormy nights oh julian do you think it will flash tonight cant we cant we go and see chapter seven out in the night before the children had finished their high tea the big kitchensittingroom was quite dark thunder clouds had moved up from the west gathering together silently frowning and sinister then from far off came the first rumble of thunder the little scottie came and cowered against mrs penruthlans skirts he hated storms the farmers wife comforted him and her big husband gave a little unexpected snort of laughter he said something that sounded like oose hes not as timid as a mouse said his wife who was really marvellous at interpreting her husbands peculiar noises he just doesnt like the thunder he never did he can sleep with us in our room tonight there were a few more sounds from mr penruthlan to which his wife listened anxiously very well if you have to get up and see to jenny the horse in the night ill see benny doesnt bark the house down she said she turned to the children dont worry if you hear him barking she said it will only be mr penruthlan stirring the thunder crashed and rumbled again this time a little nearer and then lightning flashed then down came the rain how it poured it rattled and clattered on the roof in enormous drops and then settled down into a steady downpour the four children got out their cards and played games by the light of the oil lamp there was no electricity at tremannon timmy sat with his head on georges knee he didnt mind the thunder but he didnt particularly like it well i think wed better go to bed said julian at last he knew that the penruthlans liked to go to bed early because they got up so early and as they did not go upstairs until after the children did julian saw to it that they too went early they said good night and went up to their bare little rooms the windows were still open and the small curtains drawn back so that the hills lit now and again by lightning showed up clearly the children went and stood there watching they all loved a storm especially dick there was something powerful and most majestic about this kind of storm sweeping over hills and sea rumbling all round and tearing the sky in half with flashes of lightning julian is it possible to go up to that place the shepherd showed us and see if the light flashes tonight said george you only laughed when i asked you before well i laugh again said julian of course not wed be drenched and i dont fancy being out in this lightning on those exposed hills either all right said george anyway i dont feel quite such an urge to go now that its so pitch dark just as well said julian come on dick lets go to bed the storm went on for some time rumbling all round the hills again as if it were going round in a circle the girls fell asleep but the boys tossed about feeling hot and sticky dick said julian suddenly lets get up and go out its stopped raining lets go and see if that light is flashing tonight it should be just the night for it according to old grandad right said dick and sat up feeling for his clothes i simply cant go to sleep even though i felt really sleepy when i undressed they pulled on as few clothes as possible for the night was still thundery and hot julian took his torch and dick hunted for his got it he said at last are you ready come on then lets tiptoe past the penruthlans door or we may wake that dog scottie hes sleeping there tonight dont forget they tiptoed along the passage past the penruthlans door and down the stairs one stair creaked rather alarmingly and they stopped in dismay wondering if ben the scottie would break out into a storm of barking but he didnt good down they went again switching on their torches to see the way they came to the bottom of the stairs shall we go out by the front door or back door ju whispered dick back said julian the front doors so heavy to open come on so they went down the passage to the back door that led out from the kitchen it was locked and bolted but the two boys opened it without too much noise they stepped out into the night the rain had now stopped but the sky was still dark and overclouded tne thunder rumbled away in the distance a wind had got up and blew coolly against the boys faces nice cocl breeze whispered dick now do we go through the farmyard is that the shortest way to the stile we have to climb over into that first field yes i think so said julian they made their way across the silent farmyard where in the daytime such a lot of noise went on clucking quacking grunting clipclopping and shouting now it was dark and deserted they passed the barns and the stables a little hrrrrrrumphing came from one of the stables thats jenny the horse thats not well said julian stopping lets just have a look at her and see if shes all right she was lying down feeling very sorry for herself when i saw her last they flashed their torch over the top half of the stable door which was pulled back to let in air they looked in with interest jenny was no longer lying down she was standing up munching something goodness she must be quite all right again she whinnied to the two boys they left her and went on they came to the stile and climbed over the rain began drizzling again and if the boys had not had their torches with them they would not have been able to see a step in front of them it was so dark i say ju did you hear that said dick stopping suddenly no what said julian listening well it sounded like a cough said dick one of the sheep suggested julian i heard one old sheep coughing just like uncle quentin does sometimes sort of hollow and mournful no it wasnt a sheep said dick anyway there arent any in this field you imagined it said julian i bet theres nobody idiotic enough to be out on a night like this except ourselves they went on cautiously over the field the thunder began again a little nearer then came a flash and again the thunder dick stopped dead once more and clutched julians arm theres somebody a good way in front of us the lightning just lighted him up for half a second he was climbing over that stile the one were making for who do you suppose it is on a night like this hes apparently going the same way that we are said julian well i suppose if we saw him hes quite likely to have seen us not unless he was looking backwards said dick come on lets see where hes going they went on cautiously towards the stile they came to it and climbed over and then a hand suddenly clutched hold of dicks shoulder he jumped almost out of his skin the hand gripped him so hard and so fiercely that dick shouted in pain and tried to wriggle away from the powerful grip julian felt a hand lunge at him too but dodged and pressed himself into the hedge he switched off his torch at once and stood quite still his heart thumping quickly let me go shouted dick wriggling like an eel his shirt was almost tom off his back in his struggles he kicked out at the mans ankles and for one moment his captor loosened his grasp that was enough for dick he ripped himself away and left his shirt in the mans hand he ran up the lane into which the stile had led and flung himself under a bush in the darkness panting he heard his captor coming along muttering and dick pressed himself farther into the bush a torchlight swept the ground near him but missed him dick waited till the footsteps had gone and then crawled out he went quietly down tht lane julian he whispered and jumped as a voice answered almost in his ear just above his head im here are you all right dick looked up into the darkness of a tree but could see nothing ive dropped my torch somewhere he said where are you ju up in the tree a hand groped out and felt his head here i am on the first branch said julian i hid in the hedge first and then climbed up here i darent put on my torch in case that fellows anywhere around and sees it hes gone up the lane said dick my word he nearly wrenched my shoulder off half my shirts gone who was he did you see no i didnt said julian clambering down lets find your torch before we go home its too good to lose it must be by that stile they went to look julian still didnt like to put on his torch so that it was more a question of feeling for dicks torch not looking dick suddenly trod on it and picked it up thankfully listen theres that fellow coming back again im sure said dick i heard the same dry little cough what shall we do well i dont now feel like going up to the shepherds hill to see if that light is flashing from the tower said julian i vote we hide and follow this chap to see where he goes i dont think anyone who is wandering out tonight can be up to any good yes good idea said dick squash into the hedge again blow there are nettles here just my luck the footsteps came nearer and the cough came again i seem to know that cough whispered dick sh said julian the man came up to the stile and they heard him climbing over it after a short time both boys followed cautiously they couldnt hear the mans footsteps across the grass but the sky had cleared a little and they could just make out a moving shadow ahead of them they followed him at a distance holding their breath whenever they kicked against a stone or cracked a twig beneath their feet now and again they heard the cough hes making for the farm whispered julian he could just see the outline of the big barns against the sky do you think hes one of the labourers they live in cottages round about the man came to the farmyard and walked through it trying to make as little sound as possible the boys followed he went round the barns and into the little garden that mrs penruthlan tended herself still the boys followed round to the front door went the man and the boys held their breath was he going to burgle the farmhouse they tiptoed nearer there came the sound of a soft click and then of bolts being shot home after that there was silence hes gone in said julian in amazement dont you know who it was cant you guess now said dick we both ought to have known when we heard that cough it was mr penruthlan no wonder he almost dislocated my shoulder with his strong hand mr penruthlan gosh yes youre right said julian astonished almost forgetting to speak in a whisper we didnt notice that the front door was undone because we went out the back way so it was he we followed how silly but what was he doing out on the hills he didnt go to see the horse she wasnt ill perhaps he likes a walk at night suggested dick come on lets go in ourselves i feel a bit chilly with practically no shirt on they crept round to the back door it was still open thank goodness they went inside bolted and locked it and tiptoed upstairs they heaved sighs of relief when they were safely in their room again switch on your torch julian and see if my shoulder is bruised said dick it feels jolly painful julian flashed his torch on dicks shoulder he gave a low whistle my word youve got a wonderful bruise all down your right shoulder he must have given you an awful wrench he did said poor dick well i cant say we had a very successful time followed our host through the night got caught by him and followed him all the way back here not very clever well never mind i bet no light flashed in that tower said julian getting into bed we havent lost much by not going all the way to see chapter eight here come the barnies the two boys looked curiously at mr penruthlan the next morning it seemed strange to think of their little adventure the night before with him and he didnt even know it was they he had tried to catch he gave the curious little dry cough again and julian nudged dick and grinned mrs penruthlan was beaming at the head of the breakfast table as usual did you sleep well all of you she asked the storm soon died down didnt it mr penruthlan got up said ah ock oooh or something that sounded like that and went out what did he say asked anne curiously she could not think how anyone could possibly understand mr penruthlans extraordinary speech julian had said that he thought he must talk in shorthand he said he might not be back for dinner said mrs penruthlan i hope hell get some somewhere he had his breakfast at half past six and thats very early im glad he came in and had a cup of your breakfast tea now the poor man had a very bad night im sorry to say the boys pricked up their ears what happened asked julian at once oh he had to get up and go and spend two hours with poor jenny said mrs penruthlan i woke when he left but luckily benny didnt bark and it wasnt till two hours later he came back hed been sitting with the horse all that time poor man julian and dick did not feel at all sympathetic they knew quite well where mr penruthlan had been not with the horse that was certain anyway jenny hadnt been ill when they had looked at her in the night what a lot of untruths they were puzzled why should mr penruthlan deceive his wife and tell her what wasnt true what had he been doing that he didnt even want her to know they told the girls everything immediately after breakfast when they went to pick currants raspberries and plums for a fruit salad anne and george listened in surprise you never told us you were going said george reproachfully id like to have come with you i always thought mr penruthlan looked sort of strange and and sinister said anne im sure hes up to no good what a pity his wife is so very nice they went on picking the endless redcurrants anne suddenly got the feeling that somebody was hiding somewhere near she looked round uncomfortably yes there was someone in the tall raspberry canes she was sure she watched it was yan of course she might have guessed he flashed his smile at her and came towards her he liked anne best of all he held out his hand no ive no sweets said anne how did you get on last night in the storm yan were you frightened yan shook his head then he came nearer and spoke softly i seen the light last night anne stared at him astonished what light you dont mean the light that flashes in that old hidden tower she said he nodded anne went quickly to julian and dick who were picking white currants and eating just about as many as they put into the basket julian dick yan says he saw that light flashing last night the one in the tower gosh said the boys together they turned to yan who had followed anne you saw that light said julian yan nodded big light very big he said like like a fire shining from the tower said dick and yan nodded again did your grandad see it asked dick yan nodded he seen it too are you telling the truth demanded julian wondering how far he could believe yan yan nodded again what time was this asked dick but that yan couldnt tell him he had no watch and if he had had he wouldnt have been able to use it he couldnt tell the time blow said julian to dick we missed it if yans telling the truth we would have seen that light last night yes well well go tonight and watch for it said dick determined its a wild enough day all wind and scurrying clouds if that light is used at night in weather like this well be able to see it again but im blessed if i can understand why the wreckers tower should be used nowadays no ship would take any notice of an odd light like that when theyve got the lighthouse signalling hard all the time i go too nodded yan who had overheard this no you wont said julian you can stay with grandad hell wonder where you are if youre not there it began to rain blow said george i do hope the weather hasnt broken up its been so gorgeous its quite cold today with this tearing wind come on lets go in anne weve got enough now to feed an army i should think they all went in just as the rain came down properly mrs penruthlan greeted them in excitement the barnies want our barn for tomorrow night she said theyre giving their first show in our barn and after that they go to another place would you like to help clear out the barn and get ready rather said julian well go now theres a lot of stuff to clear out where shall we put it in the other barn the barnies arrived in about twenty minutes and went straight to the barn which they had been lent several times before for their shows they were pleased to see the children and were glad of their help they were no longer dressed in fancy clothes as they had been when the children had seen them on the sunday evening they were practically all dressed in slacks the women too ready for the hard work of clearing the barn and setting up a simple stage and background julian caught sight of a horses head being carried in by a little nimble fellow who pranced along with it comically whats that for he said oh is that cloppers head the horse that can sit down and cross its legs thats right said the little fellow im in charge of it never let it out of my sight guvnors orders whos the guvnor asked julian the fellow over there he nodded to a grimfaced man who was supervising the moving of some bales of straw thats him said the little man with a grin his lordship himself what do you think of my horse chum julian looked at the horses head it was beautifully made and had a most comical look in its eye its mouth could open and shut and so could its big eyes im only the hind legs said the little man regretfully but l work his tail too mr binks over there is his front legs and works his head the horses head i mean you should see old clopper when he performs my there isnt a horse like him in the world he can do everything short of fly where are his back and front legs and er his body part asked dick coming up and looking with great interest at the horses head over there said the little man by the way my names sid whats yours and how is it youre here julian introduced himself and dick and explained that they were helping because they were staying at the farm he caught hold of a bale of straw thinking it was about time he did some work like to give me a hand he asked sid shook his head sorry orders are im not to put this horses head down anywhere where i go it goes i can tell you me and clopper are quite attached to one another why is it so valuable asked dick its not so much that said sid its just that cloppers so popular you know and hes important you see whenever we think the shows flopping a bit we bring clopper on and then we get the laughs and the claps and the audience is in a good temper oh cloppers saved the show times without number hes a jolly good horse is clopper mr binks came up he was bigger than sid and much stronger he grinned at the two boys admiring old clopper he said did sid tell you about the time cloppers head dropped off the wagon and we didnt miss him till we were miles away my word what a state the guvnor was in said we couldnt give a show without clopper and nearly gave us all the sack were important we are said sid throwing out his chest and doing a funny little strut with the horses head in front of him me and binks and clopper no show without us dont you put that horse down even for a moment warned mr binks the guvnors got his eye on you sid look hes calling you sid went over to the guvnor looking rather alarmed he carried the horses head safely under his arm the grimfaced man said a few sharp words and sid nodded julian went up to him when he came back let me feel how heavy the horses head is he said ive often wondered when ive seen something like this on the stage sid immediately put the horse under his other arm and glared at julian looking round quickly to see if the guvnor had heard thats a fool thing to ask me he said after ive told you im not allowed to put the horse down and didnt the guvnor just this minute say to me keep away from those kids you know what tricks theyre up to theyll have that horse away from you if youre not careful see do you want me to lose my job julian laughed dont be silly you wouldnt lose your job for that when are you and mr binks going to do a bit of practice we want to see you oh well we could manage that all right said sid calming down here binks bit of practice wanted get the legs binks and sid went to a cleared space in the big barn and proceeded to clothe themselves in the horses canvas skin and legs sid showed the boys how he worked the tail with one of his hands when he wanted to binks put on the head and the front legs his head only went into the neck of the horse no farther he was able to use his hands for pulling strings to open the horses mouth and work its rolling eyes sid got his legs in the horses back legs bent over and put his head and arms over towards binks so making the horses back somebody came up and zipped up the two halves of the horses skin oh what a jolly good horse said dick delighted it looked a lively comical extremely supple beast and the two men inside at once proceeded to make it do ridiculous things it marched leftright leftright leftright it did a little tapdance with its front feet which then remained perfectly still and then the back feet did the same little tapdance the back feet got themselves entangled and fell over and the horses head looked round at itself in astonishment all four children were now watching and yan was peeping in at the door they roared with laughter at the ridiculous horse it took its tail in its mouth and marched round and round itself it stood up on its hind legs only it jumped like a kangaroo and made peculiar noises the whole company stood and watched and even the grimfaced guvnor had to smile then it sat down on its hindlegs and crossed its front ones in the air looking round comically it then gave an enormous yawn that showed dozens of large teeth oh dont do any more cried anne who was weak with laughing dont oh i can quite well see how important you are clopper youll be the best part of the show it was a mad gay morning for the barnies were full of chatter and jokes and laughter sid and binks took off their horse garments and sid thereupon went about as before the horses head grinning comically tucked safely under his arm mrs penruthlan called the children in to dinner yan ran after julian and caught hold of his arm i seen that light he said urgently you come see it tonight dont forget i seen that light julian had forgotten it in the excitement of the morning he grinned down at the small boy all right all right i wont forget were coming along tonight but youre not coming yan so get that out of your head look heres a sweet for you now scoot chapter nine the light in the tower by the end of the day the big barn was quite transformed it had been cleared of all straw sacks of corn bags of fertilizer and odd machines that had been stored in it it looked enormous now and the barnies were very pleased with it weve been here plenty of times they told the children its the best barn in the district we dont get the best audience though because its rather a lonely spot here and there are only two villages near enough to send people to see us still we have a good time and mrs penruthlan gives us a marvellous supper afterwards i bet she does said dick grinning i bet thats why you come to this lonely spot too to taste mrs penruthlans cooking i dont blame you id come a good few miles myself a stage had been set up made of long boards supported on barrels a backcloth had been unrolled and hung over the wooden wall of the barn at the back of the stage it showed a country scene and had been painted by the company themselves bit by bit thats my bit said sid showing dick a horse standing in one of the fields painted on the backcloth i had to put old clopper in see him the barnies had plenty of homemade scenery which they were used to changing several times during their performance this was all homemade too and they were very proud of it especially some that represented a castle with a tower the tower reminded the boys of the one yan had said he had seen flashing a light the night before they looked at one another secretly and julian nodded slightly they would certainly watch to see that light themselves then they would know for certain whether grandad and yan were telling the truth julian wondered if they would have to look out for mr penruthlan again that night jenny the horse was quite better now if she had ever been ill and was out in the fields again so mr penruthlan had no excuse for creeping about the countryside at night again neither of the boys could imagine what had taken him out the night before on such a wild night too was he meeting somebody he hadnt had time to go up to see the shepherd about anything and there wouldnt have been much point in that anyway he had seen grandad in the morning already mrs penruthlan came to see the barn now that it was almost ready for the show the next night she looked red and excited this was a grand time for her the barnies in her barn the villagers all coming up the next night a grand supper to be held afterwards what an excitement she was very busy in her kitchen cooking cooking cooking her enormous larder was already full of the most appetizing looking pies tarts hams brawns and cheeses the children took turns at looking into it and sniffing in delight mrs penruthlan laughed at them and shooed them out youll have to help me tomorrow she said shelling peas scraping potatoes stringing beans picking currants and raspberries and youll find hundreds of wild strawberries in the copse too which can go to add a flavour to the fruit salad we shall love to help said anne all this is grand fun but surely you arent going to do all the supper singlehanded mrs penruthlan oh one or two of the villagers will stay behind to help me serve it said the plump little farmers wife who looked as happy as could be in the midst of so much hard work anyway ill be up at five oclock tomorrow morning ill have plenty of time youd better go to bed early tonight then said george we all will said mrs penruthlan well be up early and abed late tomorrow and well need some sleep tonight its no trouble to get mr penruthlan to bed early hes always ready to go the children felt sure he would be ready to go early that night because he had spent so much time out in the storm the night before julian and dick were tired too but they were quite determined to go up to the shepherds hill and find the place where they could watch and see if that light really did flash out they had a high tea as usual at which mr penruthlan was present he ate solidly and solemnly not saying a word except something that sounded like ooahah ooh well im glad you like the pie mr penruthlan said his wife though i says it as shouldnt its a good one it really was wonderful the way she understood her husbands speech it was also very queer to hear her speak to her husband as if he was someone to whom she had to be polite and call mister anne wondered if she called him mr penruthlan when they were alone together she looked at him earnestly what a dark giant he was and how he ate he looked up and saw anne watching him he nodded at her and said ah oooh ock ukker it might have been a foreign language for all anne could understand she looked startled and didnt know what to say now mr penruthlan dont you tease the child said his wife she doesnt know what to answer do you anne well i er i didnt really catch what he said said anne going scarlet there now mr penruthlan see how badly you talk without your teeth in said the farmers wife scoldingly havent i told you you should wear your teeth when you want to make conversation i understand you all right but others dont it must sound just a mumble to them mr penruthlan frowned and muttered something the children all stared at him dumbfounded to hear that he had no teeth goodness gracious how did he manage to eat all he did then he seemed to chew and munch and crunch and yet he had no teeth so thats why he speaks so queerly thought dick amused but fancy eating as much as he does with no teeth in his head goodness what would he eat if he had got all his teeth mrs penruthlan changed the conversation because it was clear that her husband was annoyed with her she talked brightly about the barnies that horse clapper you wait till you see him prance on to the stage and fall off it youll see mr penruthlan almost fall out of his seat he laughs so much hes fair set on that horse hes seen it a dozen times and it tickles him to death i think its jolly funny myself said julian ive always thought id like to put on an act like that at our endofterm concert at school dick and i could do it all right i wish sid and mr binks would let us try the meal was finished at last most of the dishes were empty and mrs penruthlan looked pleased there now youve done really well she said thats what i do like to see people finishing up everything put before them its easy when its food you put before us said george isnt it timmy i bet timmy wishes he lived here always mrs penruthlan im sure he keeps telling your dogs how lucky they are after the washingup in which everyone but mr penruthlan helped they went to sit down for a while and read but the farmer kept giving such enormous yawns that he set everyone else yawning too and mrs penruthlan began to laugh come on to bed all of you she said ive never heard so many yawns in my life poor mr penruthlan hes tired out with sitting up with jenny the horse half the night the children exchanged glances they knew better everyone went up to bed and the children laughed to hear mr penruthlan still yawning loudly in his room julian looked out of his window it was a dark blustery night with sudden spurts of sharp rain the wind howled and julian almost thought he could hear the great waves crashing on the rocks in the nearest caves how enormous they would be in this wind a good night for wreckers if there were any nowadays he said to dick not much chance for any ship that went too near those coves tonight theyd be on the rocks and dashed to pieces in half an hour the beach would be strewn with thousands of pieces of wreckage the next day wed better wait a bit before we go said dick its really very early on a bright sunny evening the hills would still be full of daylight but this stormy evening is very dark lets light our candles and read the wind became even stronger and grew almost to a gale it made a howling noise round the old farmhouse and sounded angry and in pain not a very nice night to go out on the hills well go now i think said julian at last its quite dark and getting late come on they hadnt undressed so they went down the stairs at once and out of the back door as before closing it silently behind them they made their way through the farmyard not daring to shine their torches till they were well away from the house they had had a quick look at the front door when they had stood in the hall it was locked and bolted mr penruthlan was not out tonight that was certain they walked steadily through the gale gasping when it caught them full in the face they each had their warm jerseys on for it was quite cold and the wind blew all the time across the fields over one stile after another across more fields the boys stopped once or twice to make sure they were right they were relieved when they came to the great flock of sheep and knew they must be near the shepherds hut theres the hut whispered julian at last you can just see its dark outline we must go quietly now they stole by the hut not a sound came from inside and no candlelight showed through the cracks old grandad must be fast asleep julian pictured yan curled up with him on their bed of old sheepskins the boys went quietly along now they must make for the spot from which the old tower could be seen and it must be the exact spot for the tower could be seen from nowhere else they couldnt find it or if they had found it and were standing on it they were unable to see the tower far off in the darkness if it didnt happen to be flashing a light we wouldnt know if we were looking in the right direction or not said julian wed never see it in the dark why didnt we think of that somehow i thought wed see the tower whether it was lighted up or not were asses they wandered about a little continually looking in the direction where they thought the tower should be but they saw nothing at all what a waste of a long walk then julian suddenly gave an exclamation whos that i saw you there who is it dick jumped what was this now then someone sidled up against them both and a voice spoke timidly its me yan good gracious you turn up everywhere said julian i suppose you were watching out for us iss come with me said yan and tugged at julians arm the two boys went with him a few yards to the right then higher up the hill then yan stopped the boys saw the distant light at once there was no doubt about it at all it flashed continually rather like a small lighthouse light each time it flashed they could see the faint outline of the tower it seems to be some kind of signal said julian flash flashflashflash flashflash flash my word how weird whos doing it and why surely there are no wreckers nowadays grandad says its his old dad said yan in an awed voice julian laughed dont be silly all the same its a bit of a mystery isnt it dick could any ship out at sea be deceived and come near to the shore and be wrecked its a wicked night just the night for great waves to pound a ship to pieces if it came near this coast yes well we shall hear tomorrow if there has been a wreck said dick soberly i hope there wont be i cant bear thinking of it anyway surely surely there arent wreckers here now if there are they will be creeping down the hidden wreckers way wherever it is said julian and watching for the ship to crash to pieces then they will collect sacks upon sacks of booty and creep away back dick felt a chill of horror shut up ju he said sharply dont talk like that now what are we going to do about that light ill tell you said julian firmly were going to find that tower and see whats going on thats what were going to do and as soon as ever we can too maybe tomorrow chapter ten getting ready for the show julian and dick watched the light for a little longer and then turned to go back to the farm the wind was so strong and so cold that even on that summers night they found themselves shivering im glad you found us yan said dick putting an arm round the small shivering boy thanks for your help were going to explore that old tower would you like to show us the way to it yan shivered all the more from fright as much as cold no im frit he said im frit of that tower now what does he mean frit said dick short for frightened i suppose all right yan you neednt come it is pretty peculiar i must admit now go back to your hut yan shot off in the dark like a scared rabbit the boys made their way home not very cautiously for they felt sure they were the only people out that night but when they came to the farmyard they saw something that made them stop suddenly theres a light in the big barn whispered dick its gone no there it is again its somebody with a torch flashing it on and off who is it one of the barnies perhaps whispered back julian lets go and see we know the barnies are sleeping in the nearby sheds tonight they tiptoed to the barn and looked through a crack they saw nothing at first then a torch flashed shedding its light on some of the properties of the barnies stacked in a corner scenery dresses coats and other things somebodys going through the pockets said julian indignantly look at that a thief who is it said dick one of the barnies pickpocketing for a moment or two the torch lighted up the back of the intruders hand in the barn and the boys stifled an exclamation they knew that hand it was covered with black hairs almost as thick as fur mr penruthlan whispered dick yes i see its him now look at his enormous shadow whats he doing he must be mad walking about at night on the hills stealing into the barn going through pockets look what hes doing now looking in the drawers of that chest the barnies are going to use in one of their scenes yes hes mad julian felt most uncomfortable he didnt like spying on his host like this what a strange man he was he told untruths he crept about at night he went through peoples pockets yes he must be mad did mrs penruthlan know she couldnt know or she would be unhappy and she really seemed the most cheerful gay little person in the world come on said julian in dicks ear hes going through everything though what he expects to find in the barnies stage clothes and properties i dont know hes got a kink come on i really dont want to spot him taking something stealing it it would be so awkward if we had to say we saw him stealing they left the barn and went back to the farmhouse creeping in once more at the back door they looked at the front door it was shut but no longer locked or bolted the boys went upstairs puzzled what a strange night the howling wind the flashing light the furtive man in the barn they didnt know what to make of it at all lets wake the girls and tell them said julian i feel as if i cant wait till the morning george was awake and so was timmy timmy had heard them going out and had lain awake waiting for them to come back he had stirred and had awakened george she was quite prepared to hear a whisper at the door anne george weve got some news whispered julian timmy gave a little welcoming whine and leapt off the bed soon anne was awake too and the girls were listening in amazement at the boys news they were almost as surprised to hear about mr penruthlan in the barn as to hear about the light actually flashing in the tower so it was true what old grandad said then whispered anne he had seen the light again i do think its weird all this julian you dont think well hear of a wreck tomorrow do you i couldnt bear it nor could i said george listening to the wind howling outside fancy being wrecked on a night like this and being dashed on the rocks by those pounding waves i feel as if we ought to rush off to the caves here and now and see if we can do any rescuing we wouldnt be much use said dick i doubt if we could even get near the cove on a night like this the waves would run right up to the road that leads down to it they talked and talked about everything then george yawned wed better stop she said well never wake up tomorrow morning we cant go and explore that tower tomorrow julian the barnies will be here and weve promised mrs penruthlan to help her itll have to be next day then said julian but im determined to go yan said he wouldnt show us the way he said he was too frit i feel pretty frit myself said george settling down i should have jumped out of my skin if id seen that light tonight the boys stole back to their room soon they were in bed and asleep the wind still howled round the house but they didnt hear it they were tired out with their long walk over the hills next day was so busy that it was quite dificult to find time to remember the nights happenings they were reminded of it by one thing though mrs penruthlan was seeing to their breakfast and making bright conversation as usual she was never at a loss for words and chattered all day long either to the children or to the dogs did you sleep well with that howling gale blowing all night long she asked i slept like a top so did mr penruthlan he told me he never moved all night he was that tired the children kicked each other under the table but said nothing they knew quite a lot more about her husbands nights than she did after that they had very little time to think of anything but picking fruit podding peas rushing here and there carrying things for the barnies helping them to put up benches barrels boxes and chairs for the audience to sit on and even mending tears in some of the stage clothes anne had offered to sew on a button and at once found herself overwhelmed with requests to mend this that and the other it was an extremely busy day yan appeared as usual and was greeted uproariously by timmy of course all the dogs loved him but timmy was quite silly with him mrs penruthlan sent yan on endless errands which he ran quickly and willingly he may be a bit simple but hes quick enough when he thinks theres some good food hes going to share she said so it was fetch this yan do that yan all day long the barnies worked hard too they had a quick rehearsal in which every single thing went wrong the guvnor raved and raged and stamped making anne wonder why they didnt all run away and stay away first there was to be a kind of concert party such as pierrots give on the beaches then there was to be a play most heartrending and melodramatic with villains and heroes and a heroine who was very hardly used but everything came right for her in the end anne was relieved to find clopper the horse was to have no definite performance of his own he just wandered on and off the stage to get laughs and to please everyone or to fill awkward gaps there was no doubt he would do this to perfection julian and dick watched mr binks and sid doing a small rehearsal on their own in a corner of the farmyard how well those back legs and front legs worked together how that horse danced trotted galloped marched fell over tied itself into knots sat down got up went to sleep and in fact did every comical thing that sid and mr binks could think of they really were very very funny let me try the head on mr binks begged julian do let me just to feel what its like but it was no good sid wouldnt let him mr binks had no say in the matter at all orders are orders said sid picking up the head as soon as mr binks took it off i dont want to lose my job the guvnor says if this horses head is mislaid again ill be mislaid too so hands off clopper do you sleep with clopper asked dick curiously having to take charge of a horses head all the time must be a bore you get used to it said sid yes i sleep with old clopper him and me have our heads on the pillow together he sleeps sound does old clopper hes the best part of the show grinned julian youll bring the barn down with clopper tonight we always do said mr binks hes the most important member of the barnies and he gets paid the worst shame yes backlegs and frontlegs are badly paid said sid they only count as one player see so we get half pay still we like the life so there you are they went off together sid carrying the horses head as usual under his arm he really was a funny little man cheery and silly and gay julian suddenly remembered something at dinnertime mrs penruthlan he said i suppose that awful wind didnt cause any wrecks last night did it the farmers wife looked surprised no julian why should it ships keep right out to sea round these coasts now the lighthouse warns them you know the only way any ship could come in now would be to nose into one of the caves at full tide and then shed have to be very careful of rocks the fishermen know the rocks as well as they know the backs of their hands and they come into the coves at times but no other craft come now everyone heaved a sigh of relief the flashing light hadnt caused a wreck last night then that was a mercy they went on with their meal mr penruthlan was there eating away as usual and saying nothing at all his jaws worked vigorously up and down and it was impossible to think he had no teeth to chew with julian glanced at his hands covered with black hairs yes he had seen those hands last night no doubt about that not wielding a knife and fork but sliding into pockets the evening came at last everything was ready a big table was placed in the kitchen made of strong trestles and boards mrs penruthlan gave the two girls a most enormous white cloth to lay over it it was bigger than any cloth they had ever seen its the one i use at harvesttime said the farmers wife proudly we have a wonderful harvest supper then on that same table but we put it out in the big barn because theres not enough room here in the kitchen for all the farm workers and we clear the table away afterwards and have a dance what fun said anne i do think people are lucky to live on a farm theres always something going on town folk wouldnt say that said mrs penruthlan they think the country is a deadandalive place but my word theres more life about a farm than anywhere else in the world farm lifes the real thing i always say it is agreed anne and george nodded too they had now spread out the snowywhite cloth and it looked lovely that cloths the real thing too said mrs penruthlan it belonged to my greatgreatgreatgrandmother and its nearly two hundred years old as white as ever and not a darn in it its seen more harvest suppers than any cloth made and thats the truth the table was laid with plates and knives and forks cruets and glasses all the barnies had been invited and there were the children too of course one or two of the villagers were staying as well to help what a feast they would all have the larder was so crammed with food that it was difficult to get into it meat pies fruit pies hams a great round tongue pickles sauces jam tarts stewed and fresh fruit jellies a great trifle jugs of cream there was no end to the things mrs penruthlan had got ready she laughed when she saw the children peeping there and marvelling you wont get any high tea today she told them youll get nothing from dinner till supper so that you can get up a good appetite and really eat well nobody minded missing high tea with that wonderful supper to come the excitement grew as the time came near for the show here come the first villagers cried julian who was at the barn door to help to sell the tickets hurrah it will soon begin walk up everyone finest show in the world come along in your hundreds come along chapter eleven the barnies and clopper when the big barn was full of villagers and a few more boxes had been fetched for some of the extra children the noise was tremendous everyone was laughing and talking some of the children were clapping for the show to begin and the excited farm dogs were yapping and barking at the top of their voices timmy was excited too he welcomed everyone with a bark and a vigorous wag yan was with him and george was sure that he was pretending that timmy was his dog yan looked cleaner than usual mrs penruthlan had actually given him a bath you dont come to the show and you dont come to the supper unless you bath yourself she threatened but he wouldnt he said he was frit of the bath ill be drowned in there he said backing away from it hurriedly it was already half full of water for him frit are you said mrs penruthlan grimly lifting him up and plunging him into the water clothes and all well youll be fritter still now take your clothes off in the water and ill wash them in the bath when youre clean oh the dirty little varmint that you are yan screamed the place down as mrs penruthlan scrubbed him and soaped him and flannelled him he hit out at her but she gave him one sound spank on his small behind and he stopped very suddenly he felt very much at her mercy and decided not to annoy her in any way while he was in that dreadful bath she washed his ragged pants and shirt too and set them to dry she wrapped him in an old shawl and told him to wait till his things dried and then put them on one of these days ill make you some decent clothes she said little rapscallion that you are what a mite of a body youve got ill need to feed you up a bit yan brightened up considerably feeding up was the kind of treatment he really liked now he was down in the barn welcoming everyone with timmy and feeling quite important he yelled with delight when he saw his old greatgrandfather coming along grandad you said you was coming but i didnt believe you come you in ill find you a chair and whats come over you the way you look tonight said the old man puzzled what you done to yourself ive took a bath see said yan sounding proud iss i took a bath grandad same as you ought grandad aimed a cuff at him and then nodded to various people he knew he had his big old shepherds crook with him and he held on to it even when he sat down on a chair well grandad its nigh on twenty year since we saw you down hereabouts said a big redfaced villager what you been doing with yourself all these years minding my business and minding my sheep said grandad in his slow cornish voice ay and itll mebbe twenty years afore you sees me again joe tremayne and if you want to know summat ill tell you this it baint the show im come for its the supper everyone roared with laughter and grandad looked as pleased as punch yan looked at him proudly his old grandad was as good as anyone any day sh sh shows going to begin said somebody when they saw the curtain twitching at once the talking and shuffling stopped and all eyes turned to the stage a faded rather torn blue curtain was drawn across there came a chord from a fiddle behind the scenes and then a gay tune sounded out the curtain was drawn back slowly halting on its rings here and there and the audience gave a long sigh of delight they had seen the barnies many times but they never tired of them all the barnies were on the stage and the fiddler fiddled away as they struck up a rousing song with a chorus that all the villagers joined in most heartily old grandad beat time banging his crook on the floor everything was applauded heartily then someone called out loudly wheres old clopper where be he and old clopper the horse came shyly on looking out of the sides of his eyes at the audience and being so very bashful that old grandad almost fell off his chair with laughing the fiddle struck up again and clopper marched in time to it it grew quicker and he ran it grew quicker still and he galloped and fell right off the stage hoohoohoohoo roared someone hoohoohoohoo it was such an enormous guffaw that everyone turned round it came from mr penruthlan who was writhing and wriggling in his seat as if he was in great pain but he was only laughing at clopper clopper heard the giant of a laugh and put a hoof behind one ear to listen to it grandad promptly fell off his seat with joy clopper caught his back legs in his front legs and fell over too there was such a pandemonium of screams and guffaws and yells from the delighted audience that it was surprising the roof didnt fall in off now said a firm voice at the side of the stage julian looked to see who it was as clopper obediently turned to shuffle off waving one back leg to the admiring villagers the voice came from the guvnor who was standing where he could watch the whole show in detail his face was still unsmiling even after cloppers antics the show was a great success although it could not have been simpler the jokes were old the play acted was even older the singing was a bit flat and the dancing not as good as the third form of a girls school but it was so merry and smiling and idiotic and goodnatured that it went with a terrific swing from start to finish as for clopper it was his evening every time his head so much as looked in on the stage the audience rocked with joy they would in fact have been delighted to have had one actor only all the evening and that actor clopper of course julian and dick watched him fascinated how they both longed to try on those back and front legs and put on the head and do a little cloppering themselves sid and binks are awfully good arent they said dick gosh i wish we could get hold of legs and a head and do that act at the christmas school concert ju wed bring the house down lets ask sid if we can have a shot some time he wont lend us the head said julian still we could do without that and just try the legs i bet we could think of some funny things to do dick everybody was sad when the curtain went across the stage and the show was over the fiddle struck up god save the queen and everyone rose loyally to stand and sing every word lustily three cheers for the barnies yelled a child and the hiphurrahing rose to the rafters grandad waved his crook too vigorously and hit a very large farmer on the back of his neck now old grandad said the farmer rubbing his neck you trying to pick a fight with me no no id be afeared to take you on i would youd get me by my hind leg with that crook like you do your sheep and down id go grandad was delighted he hadnt had such an evening for forty years maybe fifty and now for that supper that was what he had really come for hed show some of these sixtyyearold youngsters how to eat the villagers went home talking and laughing two or three of the women stayed on to help the barnies didnt bother to change out of their acting clothes but came into the kitchen as they were greasepaint running down their cheeks in the heat the barn had got very hot with so many people packed in close together the children were simply delighted with everything they had laughed so much at clopper that they felt quite weak the play had amused them too with its sighings and groanings and threats and tears and stridings around now they were more than ready for their supper the barnies crowded round the loaded table cracking jokes complimenting mrs penruthlan smacking everyone on the back and generally behaving like a lot of school children out for a treat julian looked round at them all what a jolly lot he looked for the guvnor surely for once in a way he too would be smiling and cheerful but he wasnt there julian looked and looked again no he certainly wasnt there wheres the guvnor he asked sid who was sitting next to him the guvnor oh hes sitting in solitary state in the barn said sid attacking an enormous slice of meatpie laced with hardboiled eggs he never feeds with us not even after a show keeps himself to himself he does hell be having a whacking great tray of food all on his own suits me all right i never did get on with the guvnor wheres clopper the horses head i mean asked julian he couldnt see it beside sid anywhere is it under the table no the guvnors got it tonight said he wasnt going to have it rolled about under the table or have jelly or gravy dropped all over it said sid taking six large pickled onions my mrs penruthlan is a wonder why dont i marry someone like her instead of getting thinner and thinner inside cloppers backlegs julian laughed he wondered who was going to take the guvnors tray into the barn he noticed that mrs penruthlan was getting one ready and he went over to her is that for the guvnor he asked shall i take it for you oh thank you julian said the busy farmers wife gratefully here it is and ask dick to carry in a bottle and a glass for him will you theres no more room on the tray so julian and dick together went out to the barn with the food and drink the wind still blew strongly and rain was beginning to fall again theres no one here said julian looking round he set down the tray puzzled then he saw a note pinned on the curtain he went to read it back in an hour he read gone for a walk the guvnor oh well well leave the tray then said julian he and dick were just turning to go when they caught sight of something the back and front legs of clopper the horse they stopped each with the same thought in his mind everyone at supper the guvnor gone for an hour nobody would know if we tried on the legs they looked at one another and read each others mind lets have a go at being clopper come on quick said julian you be the back legs and ill be the front ones quick they got into them hurriedly and julian managed to do up most of the zip but it wasnt right without the head had the guvnor taken it with him surely not it would be quite safe in the barn there it is on that chair under the shawl said dick and they galloped over to get it julian picked it up it was rather heavier than he had imagined he looked inside it to see how far his head went in it wondering how to work the eyes and mouth he put his hand inside and scrabbled about a lid fell open in the side of the neck and out came some cigarettes scattering over the floor blow said julian i didnt know mr binks kept his cigarettes in clopper pick them up dick and ill put them back thanks he put the cigarettes back in the little space and shut the lid on them then he put the head carefully over his own it felt extremely strange there are eyeholes in the neck he said to dick thats how mr binks knew where he was going i kept wondering why he didnt bump into things more than he did now im ready the head seems to be on firmly ill count onetwo onetwo and well walk in time dont lets start any funny tricks till were used to clopper does my voice sound funny inside the neck most peculiar said dick who was now bending over so that his back made the horses back and his arms were round julians waist i say whats that someones coming its the guvnor coming back said julian in alarm quick gallop out of the door before were caught and so to the guvnors enormous surprise clopper galloped very clumsily out of the barn door just as he was coming in almost knocking him over at first he didnt realize it was clopper then he let out a loud roar and gave chase i cant see panted poor julian where am i going oh thank goodness its an empty stable quick lets unzip ourselves and youll have to take this head off for me i cant manage it myself but alas and alack the zip got stuck and wouldnt come undone the boys tugged and pulled but it wasnt a bit of good it looked as if they had got to be clopper for the rest of the evening chapter twelve a trip to the tower blow this zip said julian desperately its got absolutely stuck its so dificult for us to undo it from the inside of the beastly horse oh this head i must get it off he pushed at the head but somehow or other it had got wedged on him and julian felt that short of pulling his own head off he would certainly never get cloppers off the horse sat down exhausted looking a very peculiar shape julian leaned the head against the wall of the stable and panted im so hot he complained dick for goodness sake think of something well have to get help but i darent go back to the barn because of the guvnor and we really cant appear in the kitchen like this everyone would have a fit and sid and mr binks would be furious with us i think we were asses to try this said dick pulling viciously at the zip again ugh what use are zips id like to know i feel most uncomfortable cant you get in some other position ju i seem to be standing on my head or something lets go and scout round the kitchen said julian trying to get up dick tried to get up too but they both fell down on top of one another they tried again and this time stood up rather shakily its not as easy as it looks is it to be a twoman horse said julian i wish i could get these eye holes in the right place im absolutely blind however he managed to adjust them at last and the two boys made their way cautiously and clumsily out of the stable they went carefully over the farmyard julian counting onetwo onetwo under his breath so that they walked in time with one another they came to the kitchen door and debated whether to try and catch someones attention without going in there was a fairly large window near by open because of the warmth of the kitchen julian decided to take a look through to see if george or anne were anywhere near if so he could call them outside but he reckoned without the clumsiness of the big head it knocked against the windowframe and everyone looked up there were shrieks at once a horse farmer penruthlan one of your horses is loose cried a villager who was helping with the supper he looked in at the window the farmer went out at once julian and dick backed hurriedly away and trotted in very good style over the farmyard where now the farmer saw their moving figure in the darkness and went after them trottrottrot went the horse desperately then gallopgallopgallop but that finished them because the back and front legs didnt gallop together got entangled and down went the horse the farmer ran up in alarm thinking that his horse had fallen take your knee out of my mouth mumbled an angry voice and the farmer stopped suddenly astounded to hear a human voice coming from the horse then he realized what was happening it was the stage horse with two people in it who it sounded like julian and dick he gave the horse a gentle kick dont said dicks voice for goodness sake whoever it is unzip us were suffocating the farmer let out a terrific guffaw bent down and felt for the zip one good pull and the horses canvas skin came in half as the zip was undone the boys clambered out thankfully oh er thanks awfully mr penruthlan said julian rather embarrassed we er we were just having a canter round mr penruthlan gave another hearty roar and went off towards the kitchen to finish his meal dick and julian felt very thankful they carried the legs and head of the horse cautiously towards the barn they peeped in at a window the guvnor was there striding up and down looking extremely angry julian waited till he was at the far end of the barn and then hurriedly pushed the legs and head in at the door as quietly as he could when the guvnor turned round to stride angrily back the first thing he saw was the bundle that was clopper he raced over to it at once and looked out of the door but julian and dick had gone they could own up the next day when things were not quite so exciting they slid quietly into the kitchen feeling hot and untidy hoping that nobody would notice them george and anne saw them at once george came over what have you been doing youve been ages and ages do you want any more to eat before everything is finished up tell you everything afterwards said julian yes we do want something to eat ive hardly had a thing yet im starving mr penruthlan was back in his place eating again he pointed with his knife at the boys sliding into their seats ockockoo he said beginning to laugh and added a few more equally puzzling words oh theyve been to help you catch the horse that peeped in at the window have they said mrs penruthlan nodding which horse was it clopper said the farmer quite clearly and gave a loud guffaw again nobody understood what he meant so nothing more was said george and anne guessed though and grinned at the two boys it was a wonderful evening altogether and everyone was sorry that it had to come to an end the village women and the two girls stacked the dirty dishes and plates and the boys carried them to the sink to be washed the barnies gave a hand where they could and the big kitchen was full of chatter and laughter it was very pleasant indeed but at last the kitchen was empty again and the big lamp turned out the village women went home the barnies departed old grandad took yans hand and went back to his sheep saying dolefully that hed et a mort too much and wouldnt be able to sleep a wink so he wouldnt never mind it was worth it grandad said mrs penruthlan and shut and locked the kitchen door she looked round tired but happy there was nothing she liked better than to spend hours upon hours preparing delicious dishes for people and then see them eaten in no time at all the children thought she was truly wonderful they were soon all in bed and asleep the penruthlans were asleep too only the kitchen cat was awake watching for mice in the kitchen she didnt like a crowd she liked the kitchen to herself next day was fair and warm though a stiff breeze still blew mrs penruthlan spoke to the four children at breakfasttime ill be busy today cleaning up the mess how would you like to take a picnic lunch of some of the remains of the supper and stay out all day its a nice day and youll enjoy it nothing could be better julian had already planned to make his way to the old tower once used by the wreckers and explore it now they would have all day to do it in oh yes mrs penruthlan wed love to do that he said let the girls get the picnic stuff ready for us youve plenty to do but no mrs penruthlan wouldnt let anyone deal with food but herself she proceeded to pack up enough food for twelve people or so julian thought when he saw her preparations they set off together happily with timmy at their heels the four farm dogs accompanied them for some way tearing on in front and then tearing back trying to make timmy as mad as they were but timmy was sedate walking along as if to say im taking these children for a walk ive no time to play with you youre only farm dogs do we want yan with us if he turns up asked george do we particularly want him to know what we are doing today julian considered no i dont think we do want him with us we may find out something we dont want him to know or to spread around right said george well just you send him off then if he comes im fed up with him thank goodness hes a bit cleaner than he was yan did appear of course he came up silently on his bare feet nobody would have known he was trotting behind if it hadnt been for timmy timmy quite happily left georges heels and went to say howdoyoudo to yan jumping up at him in delight george turned round to see where timmy was and saw yan julian theres yan she said hallo yan said julian buzz off today were going somewhere alone i come too said yan strutting along behind he still looked fairly clean no you dont come too said julian you buzz off see off you go we dont want you today yans face took on a sullen look he turned to anne i come too he said pleadingly anne shook her head no not today she said another time take this sweet yan and go away yan took the sweet and turned away his face sulky he disappeared over the field and was soon lost to sight the four children and timmy went on together glad of their warm jerseys when the wind blew strongly julian gave a sudden groan i shall be jolly glad when weve had our lunch he said this bag of food is so heavy its cutting into my shoulders well lets wait till we get to the tower and we can put the bags down said dick well do a little exploring before we have our lunch i should think mrs penruthlan meant us to stay out to dinner tea and supper the amount shes packed for us they hoped they were going in the right direction they had looked at a map and found various lanes which they thought would eventually lead to the tower and had worked out which was the best direction to take julian had his compass and was going by that leading them down lanes across fields along little paths and sometimes along no paths at all he felt sure however that they were going right they were making for the coast anyway look there are two hills side by side or cliffs are they said anne pointing i believe they are the hills between which we saw that tower yes youre right said dick were nearly there i wonder how people got there when the tower and the house were lived in there appears to be no proper road at all they walked on over a rough field they soon found themselves in a very narrow overgrown lane deepset between hedges that almost met overhead a green tunnel said anne pleased look out for those enormous nettles ju at the end of the lane an overgrown path swung sharply right and there not far from them was the tower they stood and stared at it this was where the light had flashed a hundred years ago to bring ships to their doom and where the light had flashed only the other night the towers falling into ruin said dick large pieces have dropped out of it and i should think the house is in ruin too though we cant see enough of it at the moment just a bit of the roof come on this is going to be fun the tower didnt look the frightening thing it had seemed on the stormy night when the boys saw the flashing light it just looked a poor old ruin they made their way to it through high thistles nettles and willowherb doesnt look as if anyone has been here for years said julian rather puzzled i rather wish wed brought a scythe to cut down these enormous weeds we can hardly get through them im stung all over with nettles too they came to the house at last and a poor tumbledown ruin it was the doors had fallen in the windows were out of shape and had no glass the roof was full of holes an enormous climbing rose rambled everywhere throwing masses of oldfashioned white roses over walls and roof to hide the ugliness of the ruin only the tower seemed still strong except at the top where parts of the wall had crumbled away and fallen julian forced his way through the broken doorway into the house weeds grew in the floor theres a stone stairway going up the tower he called and i say look here whats this on each stair oil said george someones been carrying oil up in a can or a lamp and has spilt it julian wed better be careful that somebody may be here still chapter thirteen in the wreckers tower dick and anne came hurriedly up to the old stone stairway when they heard what julian and georgie had said oil that could only mean one thing a lamp in the tower they all stood and looked at the big splashes of oil on each step come on up said julian at last ill go first be careful how you go because the towers in a very crumbly state the tower was built at one end of the old house and its walls were thicker than the house walls the only entry to it was by a doorway inside the house in the tower was a stone stairway that went very steeply up in a spiral this must once have been the door of the tower said dick kicking at a great thick slab of wood that lay mouldering away beside the stone doorway the tower doesnt seem to hold anything but this stone stairway just a lookout i suppose or a place for signalling to ships to entice them on the rocks said george oh timmy dont push past like that you nearly made me fall these stone steps are so steep as dick said the tower seemed to hold nothing but a stairway spiralling up steeply julian came to the top first and gave a gasp the view over the sea was astonishing he could see for miles over the dark cornflowerblue waters near the coast the churning of the waves into white breakers and spray showed the hidden rocks that waited for unwary ships george came up beside him and stared in wonder too what a marvellous sight blue sky blue sea waves pounding over the rocks and white gulls soaring on the stiff breeze then dick came up and julian gave him a warning be careful dont lean on the walls at all theyre crumbling badly julian put out his hand and touched the top of the tower wall near him it crumbled and bits fell away below big pieces had fallen away here and there leaving great gaps in the wall round the top of the tower when anne came up also julian took her arm afraid that with such a crowd up there someone might stumble against a crumbling wall and fall from the tower george had hold of timmys collar and made him stand quite still dont you go putting your great paws up on the wall she warned him youll find yourself down in the nettles below in no time if you do you can quite well see what a wonderful place this is for flashing a light at night over the sea said dick it could be seen for miles in the old days when sailing ships got caught in the storms that rage round this coast at times they would be thankful to see a guiding light but what a light said julian a light that guided them straight on to those great rocks let me see now are those the rocks near those coves we went to the other day yes i think so said dick but there are rocks and rocks and caves and coves round here its difficult to tell if they are the same ones we saw the ships that sailed towards the light must have been wrecked on the rocks down there said julian pointing how did the wreckers get there there must have been a path from here somewhere the wreckers way do you think said dick julian considered well i dont know i imagine that the wreckers way must have been a way leading to the sea from inland somewhere certainly a way that was convenient for the villagers to use no ill tell you what i think happened what said everyone i think on a stormy night long ago the people who lived here in this house went up into the tower and flashed their false light to any ship that was sailing out on the waters then in great excitement they watched it sailing nearer and nearer perhaps shown up by lightning perhaps by the moon everyone imagined such a ship and george shivered poor wretched ship when the ship reached the rocks and crashed on them the signallers in the tower gave a different signal a signal to a watcher up there on the hills said julian pointing behind him a watcher who was standing on the only spot from which the flash could be seen maybe the light gleamed steadily to entice a ship in but was flashed in code to the watcher on the hills and the flashing said ship on rocks tell the others and come to the feast how simply horrible said anne i cant believe it it is difficult to think anyone could be so heartless said julian but i think thats what happened and then i think the people who lived in this house went down from here to the nearby coves and waited for their friends to come along the other way the wreckers way wherever that is it must be a secret way said dick it must have been a way known only to those villagers who were wreckers after all wrecking was against the law and so this whole business of showing lights and wrecking ships must have been kept a dead secret we heard what old grandad said that every wrecker who knew the way had to vow he would tell no one else old grandads father probably lived in this very house and climbed the stone stairway on a wild night and lighted the lamp that shone out over the stormy sea said julian thats why yan said he was frit of this tower said george he thinks his grandads dad still lights it well we know better somebody else lights it somebody who cant be up to any good either and dont lets forget somebody who may still be about somewhere said julian lowering his voice suddenly gosh yes said dick looking round the little tower as if he expected to see a stranger there listening i wonder where he keeps his lamp its not here the oil splashes are on almost every one of the stone steps said anne i noticed as i came up i bet its a big lamp it has to give a light far out to sea look it must have been stood on this bit of the wall said dick there are some oily patches here they all looked at the dark patches dick bent down and smelt them yes paraffin oil he said george was looking at the wall on the other side of the tower she called to the other three and heres a patch on this side she said i know what happened once a ship had been caught by the light and was on its way in the men with the lamp put it on the other side of the tower to signal to the watcher on the hills to tell him the ship was caught yes thats it said anne but who could it be im sure nobody lives here the place is an absolute ruin open to the wind and the rain it must be somebody who knows the way here sees to the light and does the signalling there was a pause dick looked at julian the same thought came into their minds they had seen somebody wandering out in the stormy night twice could it be mr penruthlan do you suppose said dick we couldnt imagine why he was out here in the storm the first night we came out to watch for the light no hes not the man with the light hes the watcher on the hills said julian thats it thats why he goes out on wild nights to see if theres a signal from the tower flashing to say that a ship is coming in there was an even longer pause nobody liked that idea at all we know he tells lies we know he goes through peoples pockets because we saw him went on julian after a few moments he fits in well hes the man who goes and stands in that special spot on the hills and watches for a light what does he do after that said anne didnt we hear that there were no wrecks here now because of the lighthouse higher up the coast whats the point of it all if there isnt a wreck smuggling said julian shortly thats the point probably by motorboat they choose a wild night of storm and wind when they will be neither seen nor heard wait out at sea for the signalling light to show them alls clear and then come in to one of these coves yes and i bet the wreckers secret way is used by someone who steals down to the cove and takes the smuggled goods said dick excited three or four people perhaps if the goods are heavy gosh im sure were right and its the watcher on the hill who tells his friends and down they go to the coves together its most ingenious julian said nobody sees the light on the tower except the boat waiting and nobody sees the signal inland except the one watcher on the hills absolutely foolproof we are lucky to stumble on it said dick but what puzzles me is this im pretty certain that the man who lights the lamp didnt come the way we came wed have seen troddendown weeds or something we should certainly have found some sort of a path his feet had made yes and there wasnt anything not even a broken thistle said anne there must be some other way into this old house of course there is weve already said there must be a way for the man who lights the lamp to get down to the coves from here said george well thats the way he gets here of course he comes up the passage from the cove how stupid we are this idea excited them all where was the passage nobody could imagine it certainly wasnt in the tower there was no room for anything in that small tower except for the spiral staircase leading to the top lets go down said anne and began to descend the steps a slight noise below made her stop go on said george who was just behind her anne turned a scared face to her i heard a noise down there she whispered george turned to julian immediately anne thinks theres somebody down there she said in a low voice come back anne ordered julian at once anne climbed back still looking scared would it be the man who does the lamp she whispered do be careful julian he cant be a nice man nice he must be a beast said george scornfully are you going down ju look out then julian peered down the stone steps there was really nothing for it but to go down and see who was there they couldnt possibly stay up in the tower all day long hoping that whoever it was would go away what sort of noise did you hear julian asked anne well a sort of scuffling noise said anne it might have been a rat of course or a rabbit it was just a noise thats all somethings down there or somebody lets sit down for a moment or two and wait said dick well listen hard and see if we can hear anyone so they sat down cautiously george with her hand on timmys collar they waited and they listened they heard the wind blowing round the old tower they heard the distant gulls calling eeoo eeoo eeoo they heard the thistles rustling their prickles together down below butthey heard nothing from the kitchen at the foot of the tower julian looked at anne no sound to be heard now he said it must have been a rabbit perhaps it was said anne feeling rather foolish what shall we do then go down yes ill go first though with timmy said julian if anyone is lying in wait hell be annoyed to see our timmy and timmy will be even more annoyed to see him just as julian was getting up a noise was quite distinctly heard from below it was as anne had described a kind of scuffle then silence well here goes said julian and began to descend the steps the others watched breathlessly timmy went with julian trying to press past him he hadnt seemed worried about the noise at all so perhaps it was only a rat or rabbit julian went down slowly who was he going to find an enemy or a friend careful now julian there may be somebody lying in wait chapter fourteen the secret passage julian paused on the last step of the spiral staircase and listened not a sound came from the nearby room whos there said julian sharply i know youre there i heard you still not a sound the kitchen overgrown with weeds and dark with ivy and the white rambling rose seemed to be listening to him but there was no answer julian stepped right into the room and looked round nothing was there nobody was there the place was absolutely empty and quiet julian went through a doorway into another room that was empty too the old house only had four rooms altogether two of them very tiny and every one of them was empty timmy didnt seem disturbed at all either nor did he bark as he certainly would have done if there had been any intruder there well timmy its a false alarm said julian relieved must have been a rabbit or even a bit of wall crumbling and falling what are you sniffing at there timmy was sniffing with interest at a corner near the doorway he stood and looked at julian as if he would like to tell him something julian went over to see what it was there was nothing there except for some rather flattened weeds growing through the floor julian couldnt think why timmy should be interested however timmy soon wandered away and went all round the place wondering why they had come to such a peculiar house dick bring the girls down shouted julian up the stone stairway there doesnt seem to be anyone here after all it must have been some small animal that anne heard the others clattered down in relief im sorry i gave you all a shock said anne but it did sound like somebody down there however im sure timmy would have barked if so he didnt seem at all disturbed no i think we can safely say that it was a false alarm said dick what do we do next have our lunch or hunt about to see if we can find the entrance to the passage that leads from here down to the coves julian looked at his watch its not really time for lunch yet unless youre all frightfully hungry he said well im beginning to feel jolly hungry said dick but on the other hand i feel i cant wait to find that passage where on earth is the entrance ive been in all four rooms said julian none of them seems to have anything but weeds in no old door leading out of the walls no trapdoor its a puzzle well well all have a jolly good hunt said george this is the sort of thing i like timmy you hunt too they began to explore the four rooms of the old house as weeds grew more or less all over the floor they felt that there could be no trapdoor if there had been and the man with the lamp used it the weeds would surely have shown signs of it but they grew quite undisturbed listen said julian at last ive got an idea well make timmy find the entrance how said george at once well well make him smell the oil drips on the steps and follow with his nose any others that have dripped in the weeds said julian i dont suppose the lamp dripped only on the steps it must have dripped all the way from the passage entrance wherever it is to the top of the tower couldnt timmy sniff them out they would lead us to the entrance were trying to find all right but im beginning to believe there is no entrance said george getting hold of timmys collar weve looked over every single inch of this house come on tim youve got to perform a miracle timmys nose was firmly placed over the oildrip on the bottom stair sniff it timmy and follow said george timmy knew perfectly well what she meant george had trained him well he sniffed hard at the oil and then started up the stone steps for the next oil patch but george pulled him back no tim not that way this way there must be other oil drips on the floor of the house timmy amiably turned the other way he found an oil drip at once on a patch of weeds growing on the floor he sniffed it and went on to another and another good old timmy said george delighted isnt he clever ju hes following where the man walked when he carried that lamp go on timmy wheres the next drip it was an easy strongsmelling trail for timmy to follow he followed it sniffing out of one room into another smaller one then into a third bigger one which must have been the main room for it had a very big fireplace timmy went straight to the fireplace his nose to the ground in fact he went right into the hearth and there came to a stop he looked round at george and barked he says the trail ends here said george in excitement so the entrance to the secret passage must be in this big fireplace the others crowded to the hearth julian produced his torch and shone it up the chimney it was an enormous one though part of the top of it had now fallen away nothing there said julian but hallo whats this he now shone his torch to the side of the big fireplace and saw a small dark cavity there barely big enough for a man to get into look he said excited i believe weve found it see that small hole well i bet if we crawl through that well find its the way to the secret passage good old timmy we shall get absolutely filthy said anne you would say that said george scornfully who cares this may be very important maynt it ju rather said julian if were on to what we think we are and thats smuggling with a big s it is important well what about it lunch first or exploring that hole exploring of course said dick what about letting old tim go first ill give him a legup timmy was hoisted up to the black hole and disappeared into it with delight rabbits rats what were the children after this was a fine game now ill go said julian and clambered up its a bit difficult to squeeze into dick you help anne and george up next and then you come he disappeared and one by one the others also hoisted themselves to the hole and crawled in too anne wished she had shorts on like george even a short skirt was a nuisance in performances of this kind the hole was merely an entrance to a narrow standingplace at the side of the chimney julian got down from the hole and stood still for a moment wondering if this was just an old hidingplace and not an entrance to anywhere after all but then just to the right of his feet he saw another hole that dropped sharply downwards he flashed his torch down and saw iron handgrips at one side he called back and told the others then he descended into the hole at first using the grips for his feet and then for his hands as well the hole went down as straight as a well it came to a sudden end and julian found himself standing on solid ground he turned round flashing his torch there was the passage in front of him it must be the one that led down to the coves the one that the man with the lamp must have used long ago when he went to gloat over the groaning ships on the rocks julian could hear the others coming down the shaft he suddenly thought of timmy where was he he must have fallen headlong down the hole and found himself suddenly at the bottom poor tim julian hoped he hadnt hurt himself but as he hadnt yelped perhaps he had fallen like a cat on his feet he called up to the others ive found the passage it starts at the bottom of the shaft ill go along it a little way and wait for you all to come then we can keep together in a line soon everyone was safely down the shaft george began to worry about timmy he must have hurt himself ju falling all that way oh dear where is he well soon come across him i expect said julian now keep close together everybody the path goes downwards pretty steeply as you might expect it certainly did in places the four children almost slithered along then julian discovered iron staples fixed here and there in the steepest places and after that they held on to them in the most slippery spots these iron staples would be jolly useful to anyone coming up said julian it would be almost impossible to climb up this passage without something to help the climber to pull himself up ah heres a more level stretch the level part soon became much wider and then quite suddenly it became a cave the four came out into it in surprise it was rather lowroofed and the walls were made of black rock that glistened in the light of the torch i wish i could find timmy said george uneasily i cant even hear him anywhere well go on till we come to the cove said julian this must lead us right down to the shore probably to the very cove where the ships were wrecked look theres a kind of rocky arch leading out of this cave they went through the archway and into yet another passage that wound between jutting rocks which made it rather dificult to get through at times then suddenly the passage divided into two one fork went meandering off towards the seaward side the other into the cliff better take the seaward side said julian they were just going to take the righthand passage when george stopped and clutched at julian listen she saidi can hear timmy they all stopped and listened george had the sharpest ears of the lot and she could hear him barking so could the others after a few moments barkbarkbark barkbarkbark yes it was timmy all right timmy yelled george making the others jump almost out of their skins timmy he cant hear you all this way away said dick gosh you made me jump come on well have to take the cliff passage timmys barking comes from that direction not this yes i agree said julian well go and collect him and then come back and take the other passage im sure it leads down to the sea they made their way along the lefthand passage it was not difficult because it was much wider than the one they had already come down timmys barking became louder and louder as they went down george whistled piercingly hoping that timmy would come rushing up but he didnt its funny that he doesnt come said george worried i think he must be hurt timmy the passage wound round a corner and then once more divided into two to the childrens surprise they saw a rough door set into the rocky wall of the passage on the lefthand side a door how very extraordinary look a door said dick amazed and a jolly stout one too timmys behind it said george he must have gone through it and it shut behind him timmy were here were coming she pushed at the door but it didnt open she saw that it was lightly latched and lifted the old iron latch the door opened easily and all the four went through into a curious cave beyond it was more like a lowroofed room timmy flung himself at them as soon as they came through the door he wasnt hurt he was so pleased to see them that he barked the place down woof wooooof oh timmy how did you get here said george hugging him did the door click behind you my word what a queer place this is its a storeroom look at all the boxes and crates and things they looked round the strange cave and at that moment there was a soft click then something slid smoothly into place julian leapt to the door and tried to open it its locked somebodys locked it and bolted it i heard them let us out let us out i say chapter fifteen locked in the cave dick george and anne looked at one another in dismay someone must have been lying in wait for them someone must have captured timmy and shut him up and now they were captured too timmy began to bark when julian shouted he ran to the door julian was hammering on it and even kicking it a voice came from the other side of the door a drawling voice sounding rather amused you came at an awkward time thats all and you must remain where you are till tomorrow who are you said julian fiercely how dare you lock us in like this i believe you have food and drink with you said the voice i noticed the packs on your backs which i presume contain food that is lucky for you now be sensible you must pay the penalty of being inquisitive you let us out shouted julian enraged at the cool voice with its impertinent tone he kicked the door again out of temper though he knew that it wasnt the slightest use there was no reply whoever it was outside the cave door had gone julian gave the door one last furious kick and looked round at the others that fellow must have been watching us from somewhere probably followed us all the way to the old house and saw the packs on our backs then it must have been he that you heard down in the house when we were in the tower anne timmy barked again he was still at the door george called him tim its no use the doors locked oh dear why did we let you go into that hole first if you hadnt run on ahead and somehow got yourself caught youd have been able to protect us when those men lay in wait well what do we do now said anne trying to sound brave what can we do said george nothing at all here we are locked and bolted in a cave inside the cliff with nobody near except the fellow who locked us in if anybodys got any good ideas id like to hear them you do sound cross said anne i suppose there isnt anything to do but wait till were let out i only hope that man remembers were here nobody else knows where we are horrid thought said dick still ive no doubt that mrs penruthlan would raise the alarm and a searchparty would set out to find us what a hope theyd have said george even if they did trace us to the old tower they wouldnt know the secret entrance to the passage well lets look on the cheerful side said julian undoing the pack from his back lets have some food everybody cheered up at once i feel quite hungry said anne in surprise it must be past our dinnertime now well anyway eating will be something to do they had a very good meal and felt thankful that mrs penruthlan had packed up so much food if they were not going to be let out till the next day they would need plenty to eat they examined the boxes and crates some were very old all were empty there was a big seamans chest there too with abram trelawny painted on it they lifted the lid that was empty too save for one old brass button abram trelawny said dick looking at the name he must have been a sailor on one of the ships that the wreckers enticed to the rocks this chest must have been rolled up on the beach by the waves and brought up here i dare say this cave was the place where the man who owned that old house took his share of the booty and hid it yes i think youre right said julian that is why it has a door that can be locked the wrecker probably stored quite a lot of valuable things here from different wrecks and didnt want any other wrecker to creep up from the cave and take them what a hateful lot they must have been well there doesnt seem anything of real interest here it was very very boring in the cave the children used only one torch because they were afraid that if they used the two they had brought they might exhaust both batteries and then have to be in the dark julian examined the cave from top to bottom to see if there was any possible way of escape but there wasnt that was quite clear the cave walls were made of solid rock and there wasnt a hole anywhere through which to escape big or small that fellow said wed come at an awkward time said julian throwing himself down on the ground why are they expecting some smuggled goods tonight theyve signalled out to sea twice already this week as we know hasnt the boat they expected come along yet if so they must be expecting it tonight and so weve come at an awkward time if only we werent locked in this beastly cave said george we might have spied on them and seen what they were up to and might even have been able to stop them somehow or get word to the police well we cant now said dick gloomily timmy you were an ass to get caught you really were timmy put his tail down and looked as gloomy as dick he didnt like being in this lowroofed cave why didnt they open the door and go out he went to the door and whined scraping at it with his feet no good tim it wont open said anne i think hes thirsty george there was nothing for timmy to drink except homemade lemonade and he didnt seem to like that very much dont waste it on him if he doesnt like it said julian hastily we may be jolly glad of it ourselves tomorrow dick glanced at his watch only half past two he groaned hours and hours to wait lets have a game of some sort noughts and crosses would be better than nothing they played noughts and crosses till they were sick of them they played wordgames and guessing games they had a light tea at five oclock and began to wonder what mrs penruthlan would think when they didnt turn up that evening if mr penruthlan is mixed up in this affair and its pretty certain that he is said julian hell not be best pleased to be told to fetch the police to look for us its just the one night he wont want the police about i think youre wrong said george i think hed be delighted to have the police looking for lost children and not poking their noses into his affairs tonight i hadnt thought of that said julian how slowly the time went by they yawned talked fell silent argued and played with timmy julians torch flickered out and they took dicks instead good thing we brought two torches said anne half past nine came and they all began to feel sleepy i vote we try to go to sleep said dick yawning hugely theres a sandy spot over there softer to lie on than this rock what about trying to sleep they all thought it was a good idea and went to the sandy spot it certainly was better than the hard rock they wriggled about in the sand and made dents for their bodies to lie in its still hard complained george oh timmy darling dont snuffle all round my face lie down beside me and anne and go to sleep too timmy lay down on georges legs he put his nose on his paws and heaved a huge sigh i hope timmys not going to do that all night said anne what a draught although they thought they couldnt possibly go to sleep they did timmy did too though he kept one ear open and one eye ready to open he was on guard no one could open that door or even come near it without timmy hearing at about eleven oclock timmy opened one eye and cocked both ears he listened not taking his head off georges legs he opened the other eye then he sat up and listened harder george woke up when he moved and stretched out a hand to timmy tim lie down she whispered but timmy didnt he gave a small whine george sat up fully awake why was timmy whining was there something going on outside the door men passing perhaps on their way to the cove had the light been flashing out to sea and had it brought in the boat the men were waiting for she put her hand on timmys collar what is it she whispered expecting timmy to growl when he next heard something but he didnt growl he whined again then he shook off georges hand and went to the door george switched on her torch puzzled timmy scraped at the door and whined again but still he didnt growl ju i believe someone is at the door called george suddenly in a low voice i believe timmy can hear a searchparty or something wake up everyone awoke suddenly george repeated her words again timmys not growling that means its not our enemies he hears she added hed growl like anything at the man who locked us in be quiet for a moment and listen said julian lets see if we can hear anything ourselves we havent got timmys sharp ears but we might be able to hear something they sat absolutely still listening then julian nudged dick he had heard something quiet he breathed they listened again hardly breathing they heard a little scrabbling noise at the door then it stopped george expected timmy to break out into a fusillade of barks at once but he didnt he stood there with his head on one side and his ears cocked he gave an excited little whine and suddenly scraped at the door again somebody whispered outside the door and timmy whined and ran to george and then back to the door again everyone was puzzled julian got up and went to the door himself his feet making no sound yes there was most certainly somebody outside two people perhaps whispering to one another whos there said julian suddenly i can hear you outside who is it there was dead silence for a moment and then a small familiar voice answered softly its me yan yan gosh is it really you iss there was an amazed silence in the cave yan yan at this time of night outside the door of the very cave they were locked in were they dreaming timmy went mad when he heard yan speaking to julian he flung himself at the door barking and yelping julian put his hand on his collar be quiet idiot youll spoil everything be quiet timmy stopped julian spoke to yan again yan have you got a light no no light it is dark here said yan can i come to you yes of course listen yan do you know how to unlock and unbolt a door asked julian wondering whether the halfwild boy knew even such simple things iss said yan are you locked in yes said julian but the key may be in the lock feel and see feel for the bolts too slide them back and turn the key if there is one the four in the cave held their breath as they heard yans hands wandering over the stout door in the dark tapping here and there to find the bolts and the lock then they heard the bolts being slid smoothly back how they hoped their captor had left the key in the lock here is a key said yans voice suddenly but it is so stiff my hand isnt strong enough to turn it try both hands at once said julian urgently they heard yan trying panting with his efforts but the key would not turn blow said dick so near and yet so far anne pushed dick out of the way an idea suddenly flooding into her mind yan listen to me yan take the key out of the lock and push it under the bottom of the door do you hear me iss i hear said yan and they heard him tugging at the key there was a sharp noise as it came suddenly out of the lock then lo and behold it appeared under the bottom of the door slid through carefully by yan julian snatched it up and put it into the lock his side he turned the key and unlocked the door what a wonderful bit of luck chapter sixteen wreckers way julian flung open the door timmy leapt past him and yelped with delight to find yan standing outside he fawned on the boy and licked him and yan laughed lets get out of here quick said dick that man may be along at any moment you cant tell right explanations later said julian he hustled everyone out took the key from the inside lock and shut the door he inserted the key into the outside lock and turned it he shot the bolts took out the key and put it into his pocket he grinned at dick now if that fellow comes along to see how we are he wont even know were gone he wont be able to get in to see if were there or not where shall we go now asked anne feeling as if she was in a peculiar kind of dream julian stood and considered it would be madness to go back up the passage and into the old house he said if theres any signalling going on and theres pretty certain to be we shall be caught again wed be sure to make a noise scrambling out of that hole in the fireplace well lets take that other passage we saw the righthand one said george look there it is she shone her torch on it where does it lead to yan to the beach said yan i went down it when i was looking for you all but you werent there so i came back and found that door there is nobody on the beach well lets go down there then said dick once we feel were out of dangers way we can plan whats best to do they went along the other passage their torch showing them the way it was a steep tunnel and they found it rather difficult going anne managed to give yan a squeeze you were clever to find us she said and yan gave her a smile which she couldnt see because of the dark they heard the sound of waves at last and came out into the open air it was a windy night but stars were shining in the sky and gave quite a fair light after the darkness of the passage where are we exactly said dick looking round then he saw they were on the same beach as they had been a few days before but a good way farther along can we get back to the farm from here said julian stopping to consider exactly where they were gosh i think wed better hurry the tides coming in well be cut off if we dont look out a wave ran up the sand almost to their feet julian took a quick look at the cliff behind them it was very steep they certainly couldnt climb it in the darkness would there be time to look for a cave to sit in till the tide went out again another wave ran up and julians feet felt suddenly wet blow he said this is getting serious the next big one will sweep us off our feet i wish the moon was out these stars give such a faint light yan is there a cave we can go to a cave open to the air not inside the cliff said george anxiously i take you back by the wreckers way said yan surprisingly iss you come with me of course you said you knew the wreckers way said julian remembering if it comes out near here were in lucks way lead on yan youre a marvel but do hurry our feet got wet again just then and at any moment a giant of a wave may come yan took the lead he led them into cove after cove and then came to a larger one than usual he took them to the back of the cove and led them a little way up a cliff path he came to a great rock he squeezed behind it and the others followed one by one nobody could ever have guessed that there was a way into the cliff behind that rock now we are in the wreckers way said yan proudly and led them on again but suddenly he stopped and the others all bumped into one another timmy gave a short warning bark and george put her hand on his collar somebody comes whispered yan and pushed them back sure enough they could hear voices in the distance they turned and hurried back they didnt want to walk into any more trouble yan got to the front and led them back to the big rock he was trembling they all squeezed out behind it and yan went along the cliff face to a tiny cave really only a big ledge with an overhanging roof ssssssssss he said warningly sounding like a snake they sat down and waited two men came out from behind the rock one a big man and one a small one nobody could see them clearly but julian hissed into dicks ear im sure thats mr penruthlan see how enormous he is dick nodded it was no surprise to him to think that the giant farmer should be mixed up in this the five children held their breath and watched yan nudged dick and pointed out to sea boat comes he whispered dick could see and hear nothing but in a few moments he did hear something the whirr of a fast motorboat what sharp ears yan must have the others heard the noise too through the crashing of the waves on the rocks no light whispered yan as the noise of the boat grew louder hell be on the rocks said dick but before the boat got to the rocks the engine stopped the children could just make out the boat now swaying up and down beyond the barrier of rocks evidently it was not going to try and come any farther in now the watchers could hear voices again the two men who had come down wreckers way were standing below the big rock that hid the entrance talking one leapt down to a rock farther down and disappeared the other man was left standing alone it was the big man who leapt down whispered julian wheres he gone ah there he is you can just see him moving behind that rock down there whats he got a boat whispered yan he has a boat down there pulled up high out of reach of the big waves there is a pool there he is going to row out to the other boat the children strained their eyes to watch the sky was quite clear but the only light they had was from the stars and it was dificult to see anything more than moving shadows or outlines then there came the sound of oars in rowlocks and a moving black shadow of a rowingboat and man could be seen faintly going over the waves does he know the way through that mass of rocks wondered dick he must know this coast well to risk rowing out through rocks at high tide in the dead of night why is he doing it asked anne hes getting smuggled goods from the motorboat said julian goodness knows what there ive lost him in the darkness so had everyone they could no longer hear the oars either for the crashing of the waves on the rocks drowned every other sound beyond the rocks lay the motorboat but only yans sharp eyes could see it even faintly in the starlight once in a sudden silence of the waves there came the exchange of voices over the water hes reached the motorboat said dick hell be back in a minute look the second man is going down to the cove now going to help the first one in i expect said julian what about us escaping through the wreckers way while weve got the chance good idea said george scrambling up come on timmy home they went to the great rock arid squeezed behind it once more into the entrance of the wreckers way then yan once more leading they went up the secret passage flicking on the torch very thankfully where does the wreckers way come out asked anne in a shed at tremannon farm said yan to the astonishment of everyone goodness so its very nice and handy for mr penruthlan said george i wonder how many times he has been up on the hills at night and has been warned by the tower light to go down wreckers way to the cove and collect smuggled goods from some boat or other a very good scheme it seems to me and impossible for anyone to find out except us said dick in a pleased voicewe got on to it pretty well theres not much we dont know about mr penruthlan now they went on and on the passage was fairly straight and had probably been the bed of an underground stream at some time the way was quite smooth to the feet weve walked about a mile i should think groaned dick at last how far now yan shall we soon be back iss said yan anne suddenly remembered that nobody knew how it was that yan had found them that night she turned to him yan how did you find us tonight it seemed like a miracle when we woke up to find you outside that locked door it was easy said yan you said to me go away do not come with us today so i went back a little way but i followed you i followed you to the old house though i was frit i guess you were frit said dick with a grin well go on i hid said yan you went up into the tower a long time i came out into the room below and it was you we heard scuffling there then said anne we wondered who it was iss said yan i sat down on some weeds in a corner and waited till you came down and then i hid again but i watched you through a hole from outside i saw you go through the fireplace one minute you were there the next you were gone i was frit i love that word said dick so it was you who flattened down that patch of weeds that timmy sniped at well what did you do next i was going to come too said yan but the hole was so dark and black i stood in the fireplace for a long time hoping you would come back then what happened said dick then i heard voices said yan i thought it was you all coming back but it wasnt it was men so l ran away and hid in the nettles what a place to choose said george then i was hungry said yan and i went back to grandads hut for food he cuffed me for leaving him and he made me work for him all day he was angry with me my word so youve been on the hills all day knowing we were down in that passage said julian didnt you say anything to anyone i went down to tremannon farm to see if you were back when it grew dark said yan but you werent there only the barnies were there giving another show i didnt see mr or mrs penruthlan i knew then that you must still be down in that dark hole i was afraid the men had hurt you so you came all the way again in the dark said julian astonished well youve got pluck i must say i was very frit said yan my legs shook at the knees like my old grandads i climbed in at the hole and at last i found you with no torch to light the way said dick and clapped the small boy on the back youre a real friend yan timmy knew you all right when you came to the locked door he didnt even bark he knew it was you i wanted to save timmy too said yan iss timmy is my friend george said nothing to that she was thinking rather unwillingly that yan was a remarkably brave young man and that she had been silly and unkind to resent timmys liking for him what a good thing he had liked timmy yan suddenly stopped we are there he said we are at tremannon farm look above your heads julian flashed his torch upwards and stared an open trapdoor was just above them the trapdoor is open he said someont came down here tonight and we know who said dick grimly mr penruthlan and his friend where does that trapdoor lead to yan into a corner of the machine shed said yan when the trapdoor is shut it is covered with sacks of corn or onions they have been moved to open the way down they all climbed out julian flashed his torch round the shed yes there were the machines and the tools well who would have thought that the sacks he had seen in here the other day were hiding the trapdoor that led to the wreckers way chapter seventeen long after midnight a rat suddenly shot out from a corner of the shed and tore across to the open trapdoor timmy gave a bark and leapt after it he just stopped himself from taking a header through the trapdoor by sliding along on all four feet and coming to a stop at the entrance he stood up and looked down the hole his head cocked to one side look hes listening said anne is there someone coming those men perhaps with the smuggled goods no hes only listening for the rat said julian i tell you what well do well shut the trapdoor and pile sacks and boxes and everything on top of it then when the men come up theyll find themselves trapped they wont be able to get out if we can get the police in time theyll be able to catch them easily good idea said dick super how mad those two men will be when they come to the trapdoor and find it shut they cant get out the other way because the tides up id like to see mr penruthlans face when he sees the trapdoor shut and feels a whole lot of things piled on top of it said julian hell make a few more of his peculiar noises ooh ah ock said dick solemnly come on help me with the trapdoor ju its heavy they shut the big trapdoor and then began to drag sacks boxes and even some kind of heavy farm machine on top of the trapdoor now certainly nobody could open it from underneath they were hot and very dirty by the time they had finished they were also beginning to feel very tired phew said dick im glad thats done now wed better go to the farmhouse and show ourselves to mrs penruthlan oh dear do we tell her about her husband and how hes mixed up in this horrid business said anne i do so like her i expect shes very worried about us too yes its going to be a bit difficult said julian soberly better let me do most of the talking come on well go dont make too much row or well set the dogs barking im surprised they havent yelled their heads off already it was rather surprising usually the farmdogs barked the place down if there was any unusual noise in the night the five children and timmy left the machineshed and made their way towards the farmhouse george pulled at julians arm look she said in a low voice see those lights up in the hills what are they julian looked he could see moving lights here and there up on the hills he was puzzled then he made a guess i bet mrs penruthlan has sent out searchers for us he said and theyve got lanterns theyre hunting for us on the hills gosh i hope all the barnies arent out after us too they came to the farmyard moving very quietly the big barn used by the barnies for their show was in darkness julian pictured it full of benches left from that nights show the memory of mr penruthlan turning out the pockets of the clothes left and hunting through the drawers in the chest used by the barnies came into his mind a sharp whisper made them stop very suddenly george put her hand on timmys collar to stop him growling or barking who was this now none of the little company answered or moved the whisper came again here im here still nobody moved they were all puzzled who was waiting there in the shadows and whom was he waiting for the whisper came again a little louder here over here and then as if too impatient to wait any longer the whisper moved out into the yard julian couldnt see who it was in the dark and he quickly flashed his torch on the man it was the guvnor grimfaced as ever he flinched as the light fell on his face took a few steps back and disappeared round a corner timmy growled well how many more people wander about at night here said dick that was the guvnor what was he doing i give it up said julian im getting too tired to think straight i shouldnt be in the least surprised to see clopper the horse peering round a corner at us and saying peepbo chaps everyone chuckled it was just the kind of thing clopper would do if he were really alive they came to the farmhouse it was full of light upstairs and downstairs the curtains were not drawn across the kitchen window and the children looked in as they passed mrs penruthlan was sitting there her hands clasped looking extremely worried they opened the kitchen door and trooped in yan too mrs penruthlan leapt up at once and ran to them she hugged anne she tried to hug george she said all kinds of things at top speed and to the childrens dismay they saw that she was crying oh where have you been she said tears pouring down her face the men are out looking for you and all the dogs and the barnies too theyve been looking for ages and mr penruthlans not home either i dont know where he is hes gone too oh what a terrible evening but thank goodness youre safe julian saw that she was terribly upset he took her arm gently and led her to a chair dont worry he said were all safe were sorry youve been upset but where have you been wept mrs penruthlan i pictured you drowned or lost on the hills or fallen into quarries and where is mr penruthlan he went out at seven and theres been not a sign of him since the children felt uncomfortable they thought they knew where mr penruthlan was getting smuggled goods from the motorboat and carrying them back with his friend up the wreckers way now just you tell me what youve been doing said mrs penruthlan drying her eyes and sounding unexpectedly determined upsetting everybody like this well said julian its a long story but ill try to make it short strange things have been happening mrs penruthlan he plunged into the whole story the old tower grandads tale of the flashing light their journey to explore the tower the secret passage to the wreckers cove their imprisonment and escape and then julian stopped how was he to tell poor mrs penruthlan that one of the smugglers was her husband he glanced at the others desperately anne began to cry and george felt very much like it too it was yan who suddenly spoke and broke the news we seen mr penruthlan in the cove he said glad of a chance to put in a word we seen him mrs penruthlan stared at yan and then at the embarrassed anxious faces of the other children you saw him in the cove she said you didnt what was he doing there we think we think he must be one of the smugglers said julian awkwardly we think we saw him get into a boat and row to the motorboat beyond the rocks if so he well he may get into trouble mrs penru he didnt finish because to his enormous surprise mrs penruthlan jumped up from her chair and boxed his ears soundly he hadnt even time to dodge you wicked boy panted mrs penruthlan sounding suddenly out of breath you bad wicked boy saying things like that about mr penruthlan whos the straightest honestest most godfearing man who ever lived him a smuggler him in with those wicked men ill box your ears till you eat your words and serve you right julian dodged the second time amazed at the change in the cheerful little farmers wife her face was red her eyes were blazing and somehow she seemed to be taller he had never seen anyone so angry in his life yan went promptly under the table timmy growled he liked mrs penruthlan but he felt he really couldnt allow her to set about his friends she faced julian trembling with anger now you apologize she said or ill give you such a drubbing as youve never had in your life before and you just wait and see what mr penruthlan will say when he comes back and hears the things youve said about him julian was much too big and strong for the farmers wife to give him a drubbing but he felt certain she would try if he didnt apologize what a tiger she was he put his hand on her arm dont get so upset he said im very sorry to have made you so angry mrs penruthlan shook his hand off her arm angry i should just think i am angry she said to think anyone should say those things about mr penruthlan that wasnt him down in wreckers cove i know it wasnt i only wish i knew where he was im that worried he be down wreckers way announced yan from his safe vantagepoint under the table we put trapdoor down over he iss down wreckers way cried mrs penruthlan and to the childrens great relief she sank down into a chair again she turned to julian questioningly he nodded yes we came up that way from the beach yan knew it it comes up in a corner of the machineshed through a trapdoor we er we shut the trapdoor and piled sacks and things on it im afraid well im rather afraid mr penruthlan cant get out mrs penruthlans eyes almost dropped out of her head she opened and shut her mouth several times rather like a goldfish gasping for breath all the children felt most uncomfortable and extremely sorry for her i dont believe it she said at last its a bad dream its not real mr penruthlan will come walking in here at any moment at any moment i tell you hes not down in the wreckers way hes not a bad man hell come walking in you just see there was silence after this and in the silence a sound could be heard the sound of big boots walking over the farmyard glompclompclompclomp im frit squealed yan suddenly and made everyone jump the footsteps came round the kitchen wall and up to the kitchen door i know who that is said mrs penruthlan jumping up i know who that is the door opened and somebody walked in mr penruthlan his wife ran to him and flung her arms round him youve come walking in i said you would praise be that youve come mr penruthlan looked tired and the children quite dumb with amazement at seeing him saw that he was wet through he looked round at them in great surprise what are these children up for he said and they all gaped in surprise why he was talking properly his words were quite clear except that he lisped over his ss oh mr penruthlan the tales these bad children have told about you cried his wife they said you were a smuggler they said theyd seen you in wreckers cove going out to a motorboat to get smuggled goods they said you were trapped in wreckers way theyd put the trapdoor down and mr penruthlan pushed his wife away from him and swung round on the astounded children they were most alarmed how had he escaped from wreckers way surely even his great strength could not lift up all the things they had piled on top of the trapdoor how fierce this giant of a man looked with his mane of black hair his shaggy eyebrows drawn over his deepset eyes and his dense black beard whats all this he demanded and they gaped again at his speech they were so used to his peculiar noises that it seemed amazing he could speak properly after all well sir began julian awkwardly we er weve been exploring that tower and er finding out a bit about the smugglers and we really thought we recognized you in wreckers cove and we thought wed trapped you and your friend by shutting the trapdoor and this is important said mr penruthlan and his voice sounded urgent forget all this about thinking im a smuggler youve got things wrong im working with the police it was someone else down in the cove not me ive been on the coast its true watching out and getting drenched as you can see all to no purpose what do you know whats this about the trapdoor did you really close it and trap those men all this was so completely astonishing that for a moment nobody could say a word then julian leapt up yes sir we did put the trapdoor down and if you want to catch those fellows send for the police and well do it weve only got to wait beside the trapdoor till the smugglers come right said mr penruthlan come along hurry chapter eighteen dick gets an idea in the greatest surprise and excitement the five children rushed to the kitchen door to follow mr penruthlan yan had scrambled out from beneath the table determined not to miss anything but at the door the farmer turned round not the girls he said nor you yan ill keep the girls here with me said mrs penruthlan who had forgotten her dismay and anger completely in this new excitement yan come here but yan had slipped out with the others nothing in the world would keep him from missing this new excitement timmy had gone too of course as excited as the rest what goingson in the early hours of the morning said mrs penruthlan sitting down suddenly again to think that mr penruthlan never told me he was working to find those smugglers we knew it was going on around this coast and to think he was keeping a watch and never told me julian and dick had quite forgotten that they felt tired they hurried over the farmyard with mr penruthlan yan a little way behind and timmy leaping round like a mad thing they came to the machineshed and went in we piled began julian and then suddenly stopped mr penruthlans powerful torch was shining on the corner where the trapdoor was fixed it was open unbelievably open the sacks and boxes that the children had dragged over it were now scattered to one side look at that said julian amazed whos opened it sir the smugglers have got out with their smuggled goods and theyve gone were beaten mr penruthlan made a very angry noise and flung the trapdoor shut with a resounding bang he was about to say something more when there came the sound of voices not far off it was the barnies returning from their search for the children they saw the light in the shed and peered in when they saw julian and dick they cried out in delight where were you weve searched everywhere for you julian and dick were so disappointed at finding their high hopes dashed that they could hardly respond to the barnies delighted greetings they felt suddenly very tired again and mr penruthlan seemed all at once in a very bad temper he answered the barnies gruffly said that everything was all right now and any talking could be done tomorrow as for him he was going to bed the barnies dispersed at once still talking mr penruthlan silently led the way back to the farmhouse with julian and dick trailing behind yan had gone like a shadow as he was not at the farmhouse when they walked wearily into the kitchen julian guessed that he had scampered back up the hills to old grandad five past three in the morning said mr penruthlan looking at the clock ill sleep down here for an hour or two wife then ill be up to milk the cows send these children to bed im too weary to talk goodnight and with that he put his hand to his mouth and quite solemnly took out his false teeth putting them into a glass of water on the mantelpiece oooh ock he said to his wife and stripped off his wet coat mrs penruthlan hustled julian and the rest upstairs they were almost dropping with exhaustion now the girls managed to undress but the two boys flopped on their beds and were asleep in half a second they didnt stir when the cocks crew or when the cows lowed or even when the wagons of the barnies came trundling out into the yard to be packed with their things they were going off to play in another village barn that night julian awoke at last it took him a few moments to realize why he was still fully dressed he lay and thought for a while and a feeling of dejection came over him when he remembered how all the excitement of the day before had ended in complete failure if only they knew who had opened that trapdoor who could it be and then something clicked in his mind and he knew of course why hadnt he thought of it before why hadnt he remembered to tell mr penruthlan about the guvnor standing in the shadows and his whispered message here im here he must have been waiting for the smugglers to come to him of course he probably used local fishermen to row through the rocks to the motorboat that had slunk over to the cornish coast and those fishermen used the wreckers way so that no one knew what they were doing the barnies often came to play at tremannon barn nothing could be easier than for the guvnor to arrange for the smuggling to take place then for the wreckers way actually had an entrance in the shed near the big barn if a stormy night came all the better no one would be about he could go up on the hills and wait for the signal from the tower which would tell him that at last the boat was coming yes and he would arrange with the signaller too to flash out the news that he the guvnor was at tremannon again and waiting who was the signaller probably another of the fishermen descendants of the old wreckers and glad of a bit of excitement and extra money everything fell into place all the odd bits and pieces of happenings fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle julian saw the clear picture who would ever have thought of the owner of the barnies being involved in smuggling smugglers were clever but the guvnor was cleverer than most julian heard the noise outside and got up to see what it was when he saw the barnies piling their furniture on the wagons he rushed downstairs yelling to wake dick as he went he must tell mr penruthlan about the guvnor he must get him arrested he had probably got the smuggled goods somewhere in one of the boxes on the wagons what an easy way of getting it away unseen the guvnor was cunning there was no doubt about that with dick at his heels puzzled and surprised julian went to find mr penruthlan there he was watching the barnies getting ready to go looking very dour and grim julian ran up to him sir ive remembered something something important can i speak to you they went into a nearby field and there julian poured out all he had surmised about the guvnor he was waiting in the dark last night for the smugglers said julian im sure he was he must have heard us and thought we were the men and it must have been he who opened the trapdoor sir when they didnt come he must have gone to the trapdoor and found it shut with things piled on it and he opened it and waited there till the men came and handed him the goods and now hes got them hidden somewhere in those wagons why didnt you tell me this last night said mr penruthlan we may be too late now ill have to get the police here to search those wagons but if i try to stop the barnies going now the guvnor will suspect something and go off at once julian was relieved to see that mr penruthlan had his teeth in again and could speak properly the farmer pulled at his black beard and frowned ive searched many times through the barnies properties to find the smuggled goods he said each time theyve been here ive gone through everything in the dead of night do you know what it is theyre smuggling asked julian the farmer nodded yes dangerous drugs drugs that are sold at enormously high prices in the black market the parcel wouldnt need to be very big ive suspected one or other of the barnies of being the receivers before this and ive searched and searched no good if its a small parcel it could be hidden easily said dick thoughtfully but its a dangerous thing to hide the guvnor wouldnt have it on him would he oh no he would be afraid of being searched said mr penruthlan well i reckon i must let them go this time and i must warn the police if they like to search the wagons on the road theyre welcome i cant get the police here in time to stop the wagons going off weve got no telephone at the farm mr binks came up at that moment carrying cloppers front and back legs he grinned at the boys you led us a fine dance last night he said what happened yes said sid coming up with cloppers ridiculous head under his arm as usual clopper was right worried about you gosh you didnt carry old cloppers head all over the hills last night did you said dick astonished no i left it with the guvnor said sid he took charge of his precious clopper while i went gallivanting over the hills and far away looking for a pack of tiresome kids dick stared at the horses head with its comical rolling eyes he stared at it very hard indeed and then he did a most peculiar thing he snatched the head away from the surprised sid and tore across the farmyard with it julian looked after him in amazement sid gave an angry yell now then what do you think youre doing bring that horse back at once but dick didnt he tore round a corner and disappeared sid went after him and so did somebody else the guvnor raced across the yard at top speed looking furious he shouted he yelled he shook his fist but when he and sid got to the corner dick had disappeared whats got into him said mr penruthlan amazed what does he want to rush off with cloppers head for the boy must be mad julian suddenly saw light he knew why dick had snatched cloppers head he knew mr penruthlan why does the guvnor always have someone in charge of cloppers head he said maybe he hides something precious there something he doesnt want anyone to find quick lets go and see chapter nineteen mostly about clopper at that moment dick appeared again round another corner still holding cloppers head with sid and the guvnor hard on his heels he hadnt been able to stop for a moment or even to hide anywhere he panted up to mr penruthlan and thrust the head at him take it i bet its got the goods in it then sid and the guvnor raced up too both in a furious rage the guvnor tried to snatch clopper away from the big farmer but he was a small man and mr penruthlan was well over six feet he calmly held the horses head out of reach with his strong right hand and fended off the guvnor with the other everyone ran up at once the barnies surrounded the little group in excitement and one or two farmmen came up too mrs penruthlan and the girls who were now up heard the excitement and came running out as well hens scattered away clucking and the four dogs and timmy barked madly the guvnor was beside himself with fury he began to hit the farmer but was immediately pulled away by mr binks then one of the farmmen shouldered his way through the excited crowd and put his great hand on to the guvnors shoulder he held him in a grip of iron dont let him go said the farmer he lowered cloppers head and looked round at the puzzled barnies fetch that barrel he said to julian and the boy got it at once placing it in front of the farmer the guvnor watched his face going white you leave that horse alone he said its my property what do you think youre doing you say this horse is your property said the farmer is it entirely your property inside as well as outside the guvnor said nothing he looked very worried indeed mr penruthlan turned the head upside down and looked into the neck he put his hand in and scrabbled about he found the little lid and opened it out fell about a dozen cigarettes theyre mine said mr binks i keep them there anything wrong with that sir its a little place the guvnor had made for me nothing wrong with that mr binks said the farmer and put his hand in again he pulled at the lid and ran his finger round the hole where mr binks kept his cigarettes the guvnor watched breathing quickly i can feel something guvnor said mr penruthlan watching the mans face i can feel a false bottom to this clever little space how do i get it open guvnor will you tell me or do i smash clopper up to find it dont smash him said sid and mr binks together they turned to the guvnor puzzled whats up said sid we never knew there was a secret about clopper there isnt said the guvnor stubbornly ah ive found the trick said mr penruthlan suddenly now ive got it he worked his fingers about in the space that he had suddenly hit on behind the place where mr binks had his cigarettes he pulled out a package done up in white paper a small package but worth many hundreds of pounds whats this guvnor he asked the whitefaced man is it one of the many packets of drugs youve handled round this coast was it because of this secret of yours that you told sid never to let clopper out of his sight shall i open this packet guvnor and see whats inside a murmur arose from the barnies a murmur of horror sid turned fiercely on the guvnor you made me guard your horrible drugs not clopper to think ive been helping you all this time helping a man whos only fit for prison ill never work with clopper again never almost in tears poor sid pushed his way through the amazed barnies and went off by himself after a few moments mr binks followed him mr penruthlan put the white package into his pocket lock the guvnor up in the small barn he ordered and you dan get on your bike and get the police as for you barnies i dont know rightly what to say youve lost your guvnor but its good riddance ill tell you that the barnies stared after the guvnor as he was dragged away by two farmmen over to the small barn we never liked him said one but he had money to tide us over bad times money from smuggling in those wicked drugs he used us barnies as a screen for his goingson its good riddance youre right well manage said another barnie well get along hey sid come back cheer up sid and mr binks came back looking rather solemn were not going to use clopper any more said sid hell bring us bad luck well get a donkey instead and work up another act mr binks says he couldnt wear clopper again and i feel the same right said the farmer picking up cloppers head get the back and front legs ill take charge of old clopper ive always been fond of him and he wont bring any bad luck to me there was nothing more to be done the barnies said rather a forlorn goodbye sid and mr binks shook hands solemnly with each of the children sid gave clopper one last pat and turned away well go off now said mr binks thanks for everything mr penruthlan sir so long see you again when next youre by here said mr penruthlan you can have my barn any time sid the guvnor was safely locked up waiting for the police mr penruthlan picked clopper up legs and all and looked down at the five children for yan was now with them he smiled at them all looking suddenly quite a different man well thats all finished up he said dick i thought youd gone mad when you went off with old cloppers head it was certainly a bit of a brainwave said dick modestly it came over me all of a sudden only just in time too the barnies were nearly on their way again they went over to the farmhouse mrs penruthlan had already run across the girls guessed why and they were right im getting a meal for you she cried as they came in poor children not a mite to eat have you had today no breakfast nothing come away in and help me you can turn out the whole larder if you like they very nearly did ham and tongue and pies went on the table anne picked crisp lettuces from the garden and washed them julian piled tomatoes in a dish george cooked a dozen hardboiled eggs at the stove a fruittart and a jamtart appeared as if by magic and two great jugs of creamy milk were set at each end of the table yan hovered around getting into everybodys way his eyes nearly falling out of his head at the sight of the food mrs penruthlan laughed get away from under my feet you dirty little ruffian do you want to eat with us iss said yan his eyes sparkling iss then go upstairs and wash those dirty hands said the farmers wife and marvel of marvels yan went off upstairs as good as gold and came down with hands that really were almost clean they all sat down julian solemnly put a chair beside him and arranged clopper in such a way that it looked as if he were sitting down too anne gave a giggle oh clopper you look quite real mr penruthlan what are you going to do with him im going to give him away said the farmer munching as hard with his teeth as he did without them to friends of mine lucky friends said dick helping himself to a hardboiled egg and salad do they know how to work the back and front legs sir oh yes said the farmer they know fine theyll do well with clopper theres only one thing they dont know hawhawhaw the children looked at him in surprise why the sudden guffaw mr penruthlan choked and his wife banged him on the back careful now mr penruthlan she said mr cloppers looking at you the farmer guffawed again then he looked round at the listening children i was telling you he said theres only one thing these friends of mine dont know whats that asked george well they dont know how to undo the zip said the farmer and roared again till the tears came into his eyes they dont know how to how to hawhawhawhaw undo the zip mr penruthlan now behave yourself said his amused wife why dont you say straight out that youre giving clopper to julian and dick instead of spluttering away like that gosh are you really said dick thrilled thanks most awfully well you got me what i wanted so its only right and fair i should give you what you wanted said the farmer taking another plate of ham youll do well with clopper you and your brother you can give us a show one day before you leave for home hawhaw cloppers a queer one see him looking at us now he winked said george in an astonished voice and timmy came out from under the table to stare at clopper with the others i saw him wink well it wouldnt be surprising if he did wink hes really had a most exciting time
