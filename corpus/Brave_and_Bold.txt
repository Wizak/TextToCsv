brave and bold brave and bold or the fortunes of robert rushton by horatio alger jr chapter i the young rivals the main schoolroom in the millville academy was brilliantly lighted and the various desks were occupied by boys and girls of different ages from ten to eighteen all busily writing under the general direction of professor george w granville instructor in plain and ornamental penmanship professor granville as he styled himself was a traveling teacher and generally had two or three evening schools in progress in different places at the same time he was really a very good penman and in a course of twelve lessons for which he charged the very moderate price of a dollar not of course including stationery he contrived to impart considerable instruction and such pupils as chose to learn were likely to profit by his instructions his venture in millville had been unusually successful there were a hundred pupils on his list and there had been no disturbance during the course of lessons at nine precisely professor granville struck a small bell and said in rather a nasal voice you will now stop writing there was a little confusion as the books were closed and the pens were wiped ladies and gentlemen said the professor placing one arm under his coat tails and extending the other in an oratorical attitude this evening completes the course of lessons which i have had the honor and pleasure of giving you i have endeavored to impart to you an easy and graceful penmanship such as may be a recommendation to you in after life it gives me pleasure to state that many of you have made great proficiency and equaled my highest expectations there are others perhaps who have not been fully sensible of the privileges which they enjoyed i would say to you all that perfection is not yet attained you will need practice to reap the full benefit of my instructions should my life be spared i shall hope next winter to give another course of writing lessons in this place and i hope i may then have the pleasure of meeting you again as pupils let me say in conclusion that i thank you for your patronage and for your good behavior during this course of lessons and at the same time i bid you goodby with the closing words professor granville made a low bow and placed his hand on his heart as he had done probably fifty times before on delivering the same speech which was the stereotyped form in which he closed his evening schools there was a thumping of feet mingled with a clapping of hands as the professor closed his speech and a moment later a boy of sixteen occupying one of the front seats rose and advancing with easy selfpossession drew from his pocket a gold pencil case containing a pencil and pen and spoke as follows professor granville the members of your writing class desirous of testifying their appreciation of your services as teacher have contributed to buy this gold pencil case which in their name i have great pleasure in presenting to you will you receive it with our best wishes for your continued success as a teacher of penmanship with these words he handed the pencil to the professor and returned to his seat the applause that ensued was terriffic causing the dust to rise from the floor where it had lain undisturbed till the violent attack of two hundred feet raised it in clouds through which the figure of the professor was still visible with his right arm again extended ladies and gentlemen he commenced i cannot give fitting utterance to the emotions that fill my heart at this most unexpected tribute of regard and mark of appreciation of my humble services believe me i shall always cherish it as a most valued possession and the sight of it will recall the pleasant and i hope profitable hours which we have passed together this winter to you in particular mr rushton i express my thanks for the touching and eloquent manner in which you have made the presentation and in parting with you all i echo your own good wishes and shall hope that you may be favored with an abundant measure of health and prosperity this speech was also vociferously applauded it was generally considered impromptu but was in truth as stereotyped as the other professor granville had on previous occasions been the recipient of similar testimonials and he had found it convenient to have a set form of acknowledgment he was wise in this for it is a hard thing on the spur of the moment suitably to offer thanks for an unexpected gift the professor made a bully speech said more than one after the exercises were over so did bob rushton said edward kent i didnt see anything extraordinary in what he said sneered halbert davis it seemed to me very commonplace perhaps you could do better yourself halbert said kent probably i could said halbert haughtily why didnt you volunteer then i didnt care to have anything to do with it returned halbert scornfully thats lucky remarked edward as there was no chance of your getting appointed do you mean to insult me demanded halbert angrily no i was only telling the truth halbert turned away too disgusted to make any reply he was a boy of sixteen of slender form and sallow complexion dressed with more pretension than taste probably there was no boy present whose suit was of such fine material as his but something more than fine clothes is needed to give a fine appearance and halberts mean and insignificant features were far from rendering him attractive and despite the testimony of his glass halbert considered himself a young man of distinguished appearance and was utterly blind to his personal defects what contributed to feed his vanity was his position as the son of the richest man in millville indeed his father was superintendent and part owner of the great brick factory on the banks of the river in which hundreds found employment halbert found plenty to fawn upon him and was in the habit of strutting about the village swinging a light cane neither a useful nor an ornamental member of the community after his brief altercation with edward kent he drew on a pair of kid gloves and looked about the room for hester paine the lawyers daughter the reigning belle among the girls of her age in millville the fact was that halbert was rather smitten with hester and had made up his mind to escort her home on this particular evening never doubting that his escort would be thankfully accepted but he was not quick enough robert rushton had already approached hester and said miss hester will you allow me to see you home i shall be very glad to have your company robert said hester robert was a general favorite he had a bright attractive face strong and resolute when there was occasion frank and earnest at all times his clothes were neat and clean but of a coarse mixed cloth evidently of low price suiting his circumstances for he was poor and his mother and himself depended mainly upon his earnings in the factory for the necessaries of life hester paine being the daughter of a welltodo lawyer belonged to the village aristocracy and so far as worldly wealth was concerned was far above robert rushton but such considerations never entered her mind as she frankly and with real pleasure accepted the escort of the poor factory boy scarcely had she done so when halbert davis approached smoothing his kid gloves and pulling at his necktie miss hester he said consequentially i shall have great pleasure in escorting you home thank you said hester but i am engaged engaged repeated halbert and to whom robert rushton has kindly offered to take me home robert rushton said halbert disdainfully never mind i will relieve him of his duty thank you halbert said robert who was standing by i wont trouble you i will see miss paine home your escort was accepted because you were the first to offer it said halbert miss hester said robert i will resign in favor of halbert if you desire it i dont desire it said the young girl promptly come robert i am ready if you are with a careless nod to halbert she took roberts arm and left the schoolhouse mortified and angry halbert looked after them muttering ill teach the factory boy a lesson hell be sorry for his impudence yet chapter ii punishing a coward mrs rushton and her son occupied a little cottage not far from the factory behind it were a few square rods of garden in which robert raised a few vegetables working generally before or after his labor in the factory they lived in a very plain way but mrs rushton was an excellent manager and they had never lacked the common comforts of life the husband and father had followed the sea two years before he left the port of boston as captain of the ship norman bound for calcutta not a word had reached his wife and son since then and it was generally believed that it had gone to the bottom of the sea mrs rushton regarded herself as a widow and robert entering the factory took upon himself the support of the family he was now able to earn six dollars a week and this with his mothers earnings in braiding straw for a hat manufacturer in a neighboring town supported them though they were unable to lay up anything the price of a term at the writing school was so small that robert thought he could indulge himself in it feeling that a good handwriting was a valuable acquisition and might hereafter procure him employment in some business house for the present he could not do better than to retain his place in the factory robert was up at six the next morning he spent half an hour in sawing and splitting wood enough to last his mother through the day and then entered the kitchen where breakfast was ready i am a little late this morning mother he said i must hurry down my breakfast or i shall be late at the factory and that will bring twentyfive cents fine it would be a pity to get fined but you mustnt eat too fast it is not healthful ive got a pretty good digestion mother said robert laughing nothing troubles me still you mustnt trifle with it do you remember robert added his mother soberly it is just two years today since your poor father left us for boston to take command of his ship so it is mother i had forgotten it i little thought then that i should never see him again and mrs rushton sighed it is strange we have never heard anything of the ship not so strange robert it must have gone down when no other vessel was in sight i wish we knew the particulars mother sometimes i think father may have escaped from the ship in a boat and may be still alive i used to think it possible robert but i have given up all hopes of it two years have passed and if your father were alive we should have seen him or heard from him ere this i am afraid you are right theres one thing i cant help thinking of mother said robert thoughtfully how is it that father left no property he received a good salary did he not yes he had received a good salary for several years he did not spend the whole of it did he no i am sure he did not your father was never extravagant didnt he ever speak to you on the subject he was not in the habit of speaking of his business but just before he went away i remember him telling me that he had some money invested and hoped to add more to it during the voyage which proved so fatal to him he didnt tell you how much it was nor how it was invested no that was all he said since his death i have looked everywhere in the house for some papers which would throw light upon it but i have been able to find nothing i do not care so much for myself but i should be glad if you did not have to work so hard never mind me mother im young and strong i can stand work but its hard on you i am rich in having a good son robert and i in a good mother said robert affectionately and now to change the subject i suspect i have incurred the enmity of halbert davis how is that asked mrs rushton i went home with hester paine last evening from writing school just as she had accepted my escort halbert came up and in a condescending way informed her that he would see her home what did she say she told him she was engaged to me he said coolly that he would relieve me of the duty but i declined his obliging offer he looked mad enough i can tell you hes full of selfconceit and i suppose he wondered how any one could prefer me to him i am sorry you have incurred his enmity i didnt lose any sleep by it you know his father is the superintendent of the factory halbert isnt but he may prejudice his father against you and get you discharged i dont think he would be quite so mean as that we wont borrow trouble mother but times up and i must go robert seized his hat and hurried to the mill he was in his place when the great factory bell stopped ringing on the stroke of seven and so escaped the fine which would have cut off onequarter of a days pay meanwhile halbert davis had passed an uncomfortable and restless night he had taken a fancy to hester paine and he had fully determined to escort her home on the previous evening as she was much sought after among her young companions it would have gratified his pride to have it known that she had accepted his company but he had been cut out and by robert rushton one of his fathers factory hands this made his jealousy more intolerable and humiliated his pride and set him to work devising schemes for punishing roberts presumption he felt that it was roberts duty even though he had been accepted to retire from the field as soon as his halberts desire was known this robert had expressly declined to do and halbert felt very indignant he made up his mind that he would give robert a chance to apologize and if he declined to do so he would do what he could to get him turned out of the factory at twelve oclock the factory bell pealed forth a welcome sound to the hundreds who were busily at work within the great building it was the dinner hour and a throng of men women and children poured out of the great portals and hastened to their homes or boarding houses to dine among them was robert rushton as he was walking homeward with his usual quick alert step he came upon halbert davis at the corner of the street halbert was dressed carefully and as usual was swinging his cane in his gloved hand robert would have passed him with a nod but halbert who was waiting for him called out i say you fellow stop a minute i want to speak to you are you addressing me asked robert with a pride as great as his own yes then you had better mend your manners what do you mean demanded halbert his sallow face slightly flushing my name is robert rushton call me by either of these names when you speak to me and dont say you fellow it seems to me sneered halbert that you are putting on airs for a factory boy i am a factory boy i acknowledge and am not ashamed to acknowledge it is this all you have to say to me if so i will pass on as i am in haste i have something else to say to you you were impudent to me last evening was i tell me how did you not insist on going home with hester paine when i had offered my escort what of that you forget your place my place was at hester paines side since she had accepted my escort it was very presumptuous in a factory boy like you offering your escort to a young lady like miss paine i dont see it said robert independently and i dont think it struck hester in that light we had a very agreeable walk halbert was provoked and inflamed with jealousy and the look with which he regarded our hero was by no means friendly you mustnt regard yourself as miss paines equal because she condescended to walk with you he said you had better associate with those of your own class hereafter and not push yourself in where your company is not agreeable keep your advice to yourself halbert davis said robert hotly for he felt the insult conveyed in these words if i am a factory boy i dont intend to submit to your impertinence and i advise you to be careful what you say as to miss hester paine i shall not ask your permission to walk with her but shall do so whenever she chooses to accept my escort has she authorized you to speak for her no but then wait till she does halbert was so incensed that forgetting roberts superior strength evident enough to any one who saw the two one with his wellknit vigorous figure the other slender and small of frame he raised his cane and struck our hero smartly upon the arm in a moment the cane was wrested from his grasp and applied to his own person with a sharp stinging blow which broke the fragile stick in two casting the pieces upon the ground at his feet robert said coolly two can play at that game halbert davis when you want another lesson come to me he passed his discomfited antagonist and hastened to the little cottage where his mother was wondering what made him so much behind time chapter iii the special deposit stung with mortification and more incensed against robert than ever halbert hastened home the house in which he lived was the largest and most pretentious in millville a large square house built in modern style and with modern improvements accessible from the street by a semicircular driveway terminating in two gates one at each end of the spacious lawn that lay in front the house had been built only three years and was the showplace of the village halbert entered the house and throwing his hat down on a chair in the hall entered the diningroom his face still betraying his angry feelings whats the matter halbert asked his mother looking up as he entered do you see this said halbert displaying the pieces of his cane how did you break it i didnt break it how came it broken then robert rushton broke it the widow rushtons son yes hes a low scoundrel said halbert bitterly what made him break it he struck me with it hard enough to break it and then threw the pieces on the ground i wouldnt mind it so much if he were not a low factory boy unworthy of a gentlemans attention how dared he touch you asked mrs davis angrily oh hes impudent enough for anything he walked home with hester paine last evening from the writing school i suppose she didnt know how to refuse him i met him just now and told him he ought to know his place better than to offer his escort to a young lady like hester he got mad and struck me it was very proper advice said mrs davis who resembled her son in character and disposition and usually sided with him in his quarrels i should think hester would have more sense than to encourage a boy in his position i have no doubt she was bored by his company said halbert who feared on the contrary that hester was only too well pleased with his rival and hated him accordingly only she was too goodnatured to say so the boy must be a young brute to turn upon you so violently thats just what he is he ought to be punished for it ill tell you how it can be done said halbert just you speak to father about it and get him dismissed from the factory then he is employed in the factory yes he and his mother are as poor as poverty and thats about all they have to live upon yet he goes round with his head up as if he were a prince and thinks himself good enough to walk home with hester paine i never heard of anything so ridiculous then youll speak to father about it wont you yes ill speak to him tonight hes gone away for the day thatll pay me for my broken cane said halbert adding in a tone of satisfaction i shall be glad to see him walking round the streets in rags perhaps hell be a little more respectful then meanwhile robert decided not to mention to his mother his encounter with the young aristocrat he knew that it would do no good and would only make her feel troubled he caught the malignant glance of halbert on parting and he knew him well enough to suspect that he would do what he could to have him turned out of the factory this would certainly be a serious misfortune probably the entire income upon which his mother and himself had to depend did not exceed eight dollars a week and of this he himself earned six they had not more than ten dollars laid by for contingencies and if he were deprived of work that would soon melt away the factory furnished about the only avenue of employment open in millville and if he were discharged it would be hard to find any other remunerative labor at one oclock robert went back to the factory rather thoughtful he thought it possible that he might hear something before evening of the dismission which probably awaited him but the afternoon passed and he heard nothing on leaving the factory he chanced to see halbert again on the sidewalk a little distance in front and advancing toward him this time however the young aristocrat did not desire a meeting for with a dark scowl he crossed the street in time to avoid it is he going to pass it over i wonder thought robert well i wont borrow trouble if i am discharged i think i can manage to pick up a living somehow ive got two strong arms and if i dont find something to do it wont be for the want of trying two years before captain rushton on the eve of sailing upon what proved to be his last voyage called in the evening at the house of mr davis the superintendent of the millville factory he found the superintendent alone his wife and halbert having gone out for the evening he was seated at a table with a variety of papers spread out before him these papers gave him considerable annoyance he was preparing his semiannual statement of account and found himself indebted to the corporation in a sum three thousand dollars in excess of the funds at his command he had been drawn into the whirlpool of speculation and through a new york broker had invested considerable amounts in stocks which had depreciated in value in doing this he had made use to some extent of the funds of the corporation which he was now at a loss how to replace he was considering where he could apply for a temporary loan of three thousand dollars when the captain entered under the circumstances he was sorry for the intrusion goodevening captain rushton he said with a forced smile sit down i am glad to see you thank you mr davis it will be the last call i shall make upon you for a considerable time indeed how is that i sail tomorrow for calcutta indeed that is a long voyage yes it takes considerable time i dont like to leave my wife and boy for so long but we sailors have to suffer a good many privations true i hardly think i should enjoy such a life still said the captain it has its compensations i like the free wild life of the sea the ocean even in its stormiest aspects has a charm for me it hasnt much for me said the superintendent shrugging his shoulders seasickness takes away all the romance that poets have invested it with captain rushton laughed seasickness he repeated yes that is truly a disagreeable malady i remember once having a lady of rank as passenger on board my ship a lady alice graham she was prostrated by seasickness which is no respecter of persons and a more forlorn unhappy mortal i never expect to see she would have been glad i am convinced to exchange places with her maid who seemed to thrive upon the sea air i wish you a prosperous voyage captain thank you if things go well i expect to come home with quite an addition to my little savings and that brings me to the object of my visit this evening you must know mr davis i have saved up in the last ten years a matter of five thousand dollars five thousand dollars repeated the superintendent pricking up his ears yes it has been saved by economy and selfdenial wouldnt my wife be surprised if she knew her husband were so rich your wife doesnt know of it asked the superintendent surprised not at all i have told her i have something and she may suppose i have a few hundred dollars but i have never told her how much i want to surprise her some day just so now mr davis for the object of my errand i am no financier and know nothing of investments i suppose you do i want you to take this money and take care of it while i am gone on my present voyage i meant to make inquiries myself for a suitable investment but i have been summoned by my owners to leave at a days notice and have no time for it can you oblige me by taking care of the money certainly captain said the superintendent briskly i shall have great pleasure in obliging an old friend i am much obliged to you dont mention it i have large sums of my own to invest and it is no extra trouble to look after your money am i to pay the interest to your wife no i have left a separate fund in a savings bank for her to draw upon as i told you i want to surprise her by and by so not a word if you please about this deposit your wishes shall be regarded said the superintendent have you brought the money with you yes said the captain drawing from his pocket a large wallet i have got the whole amount here in large bills count it if you please and see that it is all right the superintendent took the roll of bills from the hands of his neighbor and counted them over twice it is quite right he said here are five thousand dollars now let me write you a receipt for them he drew before him a sheet of paper and dipping his pen in the inkstand wrote a receipt in the usual form which he handed back to the captain who received it and put it back in his wallet now said the captain in a tone of satisfaction my most important business is transacted you will keep this money investing it according to your best judgment if anything should happen to me he added his voice faltering a little you will pay it over to my wife and child assuredly said the superintendent but dont let us think of such a sad contingency i fully expect to pay it back into your own hands with handsome interest let us hope so said the captain recovering his cheerfulness our destinies are in the hands of a kind providence and now goodby i leave early tomorrow morning and i must pass the rest of the evening with my own family goodnight captain said the superintendent accompanying him to the door i renew my wish that you have a prosperous and profitable voyage and be restored in good time to your family and friends amen said the captain the superintendent went back to his study his heart lightened of its anxiety could anything be more fortunate he ejaculated this help comes to me just when it is most needed thanks to my special deposit i can make my semiannual settlement and have two thousand dollars over its lucky the captain knows nothing of my wall street speculations he might not have been quite so ready to leave his money in my hands its not a bad thing to be a banker and he rubbed his hands together with hilarity chapter iv the voice of conscience when the superintendent accepted captain rushtons money he did not intend to act dishonestly he hailed it as a present relief though he supposed he should have to repay it some time his accounts being found correct he went on with his speculations in these he met with varying success but on the whole he found himself no richer while he was kept in a constant fever of anxiety after some months he met mrs rushton in the street one day have you heard from your husband mrs rushton he inquired no mr davis not yet i am beginning to feel anxious how long has he been gone between seven and eight months the voyage is a long one there are many ways of accounting for his silence he would send by some passing ship he has been to calcutta before but i have never had to wait so long for a letter the superintendent uttered some commonplace phrases of assurance but in his own heart there sprang up a wicked hope that the norman would never reach port and that he might never set eyes on captain rushton again for in that case he reflected it would be perfectly safe for him to retain possession of the money with which he had been intrusted the captain had assured him that neither his wife nor son knew aught of his savings who then could detect his crime however it was not yet certain that the norman was lost he might yet have to repay the money six months more passed and still no tidings of the ship or its commander even the most sanguine now gave her up for lost including the owners the superintendent called upon them ostensibly in behalf of mrs rushton and learned that they had but slender hopes of her safety it was a wicked thing to rejoice over such a calamity but his affairs were now so entangled that a sudden demand for the five thousand dollars would have ruined him he made up his mind to say nothing of the special deposit though he knew the loss of it would leave the captains family in the deepest poverty to soothe his conscience for he was wholly destitute of one he received robert into the factory and the boys wages as we already know constituted their main support such was the state of things at the commencement of our story when the superintendent reached home in the evening he was at once assailed by his wife and son who gave a highly colored account of the insult which halbert had received from robert rushton did he have any reason for striking you halbert asked the superintendent no answered halbert unblushingly hes an impudent young scoundrel and puts on as many airs as if he were a prince instead of a beggar he is not a beggar he is a low factory boy and that is about the same by no means he earns his living by honest industry it appears to me put in mrs davis that you are taking the part of this boy who has insulted your son in such an outrageous manner how am i doing it i am only saying he is not a beggar he is far below halbert in position and that is the principal thing it occurred to the superintendent that should he make restitution robert rushton would be quite as well off as his own son but of course he could not venture to breathe a hint of this to his wife it was the secret knowledge of the deep wrong which he had done to the rushtons that now made him unwilling to oppress him further it seems to me he said you are making too much of this matter it is only a boyish quarrel a boyish quarrel retorted mrs davis indignantly you have a singular way of standing by your son mr davis a low fellow insults and abuses him and you exert yourself to mate excuses for him you misapprehend me my dear dont my dear me said the exasperated lady i thought you would be as angry as i am but you seem to take the whole thing very coolly upon my word mrs davis had a sharp temper and a sharp tongue and her husband stood considerably in awe of both he had more than once been compelled to yield to them and he saw that he must make some concession to order to keep the peace well what do you want me to do he asked want you to do i should think that was plain enough i will send for the boy and reprimand him reprimand him repeated the lady contemptuously and what do you think he will care for that more than you think perhaps stuff and nonsense hell be insulting halbert again tomorrow i am not so sure that halbert is not in fault in some way of course you are ready to side with a stranger against your own son what do you want me to do asked the superintendent submissively discharge the boy from your employment said his wife promptly but how can he and his mother live they depend on his wages that is their affair he ought to have thought of that before he raised his hand against halbert i cannot do what you wish said the superintendent with some firmness for he felt that it would indeed be a piece of meanness to eject from the factory the boy whom he had already so deeply wronged but i will send for young rushton and require him to apologize to halbert and if he wont do it demanded halbert then i will send him away will you promise that father asked halbert eagerly yes said mr davis rather reluctantly all right thought halbert i am satisfied for i know he never will consent to apologize halbert had good reason for this opinion knowing as he did that he had struck the first blow a circumstance he had carefully concealed from his father under the circumstances he knew very well that his father would be called upon to redeem his promise the next morning at the regular hour our hero went to the factory and taking his usual place set to work an hour passed and nothing was said to him he began to think that halbert feeling that he was the aggressor had resolved to let the matter drop but he was speedily undeceived at a quarter after eight the superintendent made his appearance and after a brief inspection of the work retired to his private office ten minutes later the foreman of the room in which he was employed came up to robert and touched him on the shoulder mr davis wishes to see you in his office he said now for it thought robert as he left his work and made his way through the deafening clamor of the machinery to the superintendents room chapter v discharged the superintendent sat at an office table writing a letter he did not at first look up but kept on with his employment he had some remnants of conscience left and he shrank from the task his wife had thrust upon him mr baker tells me you wish to see me mr davis said robert who had advanced into the office by way of calling his attention yes said the superintendent laying down his pen and turning half round i hear a bad account of you rushton in what way sir asked our hero returning his look fearlessly i hear that you have been behaving like a young ruffian said mr davis who felt that he must make out a strong case to justify him in dismissing robert from the factory this is a serious charge mr davis said robert gravely and i hope you will be kind enough to let me know what i have done and the name of my accuser i mean to do so probably it will be enough to say that your accuser is my son halbert i supposed so i had a difficulty with halbert yesterday but i consider he was in fault he says you insulted and struck him i did not insult him the insult came from him did you strike him yes but not until he had struck me first he didnt mention this but even if he had you should not have struck him back why not asked robert you should have reported the affair to me and allowed him to keep on striking me you must have said something to provoke him continued the superintendent finding it a little difficult to answer this question or he would not have done it if you will allow me said robert i will give you an account of the whole affair go on said the superintendent rather unwillingly for he strongly suspected that our hero would be able to justify himself and so render dismissal more difficult halbert took offense because i accompanied hester paine home from the writing school evening before last though i did with the young ladys permission as he knew he met me yesterday at twelve oclock as i was going home to dinner and undertook to lecture me on my presumption in offering my escort to one so much above me he also taunted me with being a factory boy i told him to keep his advice to himself as i should not ask his permission when i wanted to walk with hester paine then he became enraged and struck me with his cane i took it from him and returned the blow breaking the cane in doing it ahem said the superintendent clearing his throat you must have been very violent i dont think i was sir i struck him a smart blow but the cane was very light and easily broken you were certainly very violent continued mr davis resolved to make a point of this halbert did not break the cane when he struck you he struck the first blow that does not alter the question of the amount of violence which was evidently without justification you must have been in a great passion i dont think i was in any greater passion than halbert in view of the violence you made use of i consider that you owe my son an apology an apology repeated robert whose astonishment was apparent in his tone i believe i spoke plainly said the superintendent irritably if any apology is to be made said our hero firmly it ought to come from halbert to me how do you make that out he gave me some impertinent advice and because i did not care to take it he struck me and you seized his cane in a fury and broke it in returning the blow i acknowledge that i broke the cane said robert and i suppose it is only right that i should pay for it i am willing to do that but not to apologize that will not be sufficient said the superintendent who knew that payment for the cane would fall far short of satisfying his wife or halbert the cost of the cane was a trifle and i am willing to buy him another but i cannot consent that my son should be subjected to such rude violence without an apology from the offender if i passed this over you might attack him again tomorrow i am not in the habit of attacking others without cause said robert proudly if halbert will let me alone or treat me with civility he may be sure that i shall not trouble him you are evading the main point rushton said the superintendent i have required you to apologize to my son and i ask you for the last time whether you propose to comply with my wishes no sir said robert boldly do you know to whom you are speaking boy yes sir i am not only the father of the boy you have assaulted but i am also the superintendent of this factory and your employer i am aware of that sir i can discharge you from the factory i know you can said robert of course i should be sorry to resort to such an extreme measure but if you defy my authority i may be compelled to do so so the crisis had come robert saw that he must choose between losing his place and a humiliating apology between the two he did not for a moment hesitate mr davis he said boldly and firmly it will be a serious thing for me if i lose my place here for my mother and i are poor and my wages make the greatest part of our income but i cannot make this apology you require i will sooner lose my place the bold and manly bearing of our hero and his resolute tone impressed the superintendent with an involuntary admiration he felt that robert was a boy to be proud of but none the less he meant to carry out his purpose is this your final decision he asked yes sir then you are discharged from the factory you will report your discharge to mr baker and he will pay you what you have earned this week very well sir robert left the office with a bold bearing but a heart full of trouble if only himself had been involved in the calamity he could have borne it better but he knew that his loss of place meant privation and want for his mother unless he could find something to do that would bring in an equal income and this he did not expect mr baker he said addressing the foreman of his room on his return from the superintendents office i am discharged discharged repeated the foreman in surprise there must be some mistake about this you are one of our best hands for your age i mean there is no dissatisfaction with my work that i know of but i got into a quarrel with halbert davis yesterday and his father wants me to apologize to him which you wont do i would if i felt that i were in fault i am not too proud for that but the fact is halbert ought to apologize to me halbert is a mean boy i dont blame you in the least so i am to report my discharge to you and ask you for my wages this account was soon settled and robert left the factory his own master but it is poor consolation to be ones own master under such circumstances he dreaded to break the news to his mother for he knew that it would distress her he was slowly walking along when he once more encountered halbert davis halbert was out for the express purpose of meeting and exulting over him for he rightly concluded that robert would decline to apologize to him robert saw his enemy and guessed his object but resolved to say nothing to him unless actually obliged to do so where are you going demanded halbert home i thought you worked in the factory did you asked robert looking full in his face and reading the exultation he did not attempt to conceal perhaps you have got turned out suggested halbert with a malicious smile you would be glad of that i suppose said our hero i dont think i should cry much said halbert its true then is it yes its true you wont put on so many airs when you go round begging for cold victuals itll be some time before you walk with hester paine again i shall probably walk with her sooner than you will she wont notice a beggar there is not much chance of my becoming a beggar halbert davis but i would rather be one than be as mean as you i will drop you a slight hint which you had better bear in mind it wont be any safer to insult me now than it was yesterday i cant lose my place a second time halbert instinctively moved aside while our hero passed on without taking farther notice of him i hate him he muttered to himself i hope he wont find anything to do if he wasnt so strong id give him a thrashing chapter vi halberts discomfiture great was the dismay of mrs rushton when she heard from robert that he was discharged from the factory she was a timid woman and rather apt to take desponding views of the future oh robert what is going to become of us she exclaimed nervously we have only ten dollars in the house and you know how little i can earn by braiding straw i really think you were too hasty and impetuous dont be alarmed my dear mother said robert soothingly i am sorry i have lost my place but there are other things i can do besides working in the factory we are not going to starve yet but suppose you cant find any work said his mother then ill help you braid straw said robert laughing dont you think i might learn after a while i dont know but you might said mrs rushton dubiously but the pay is very poor thats so mother i shant take to braiding straw except as a last resort wouldnt mr davis take you back into the factory if i went to him and told him how much we needed the money dont think of such a thing mother said robert hastily his brown cheek flushing i am too proud to beg to be taken back but it wouldnt be you i would sooner ask myself than have you do it mother no the superintendent sent me away for no good reason and he must come and ask me to return before ill do it i am afraid you are proud robert so i am mother but it is an honest pride have faith in me for a week mother and see if i dont earn something in that time i dont expect to make as much as i earned at the factory but ill earn something you may depend upon that now how would you like to have some fish for supper i think i should like it it is a good while since we had any then ill tell you what ill borrow will paines boat if hell let me have it and see if i cant catch something when will you be home robert it will depend on my success in fishing itll be halfpast nine very likely before i get fairly started so i think id better take my dinner with me ill be home some time in the afternoon i hope youll be careful robert you might get upset ill take care of that mother besides i can swim like a duck robert went out into the garden and dug some worms for bait meanwhile his mother made a couple of sandwiches and wrapped them in a paper for his lunch provided thus he walked quickly to the house of squire paine and rang the bell is will home he asked here i am old fellow was heard from the head of the stairs and william paine a boy of our heros size and age appeared come right up how did you happen to be at leisure he asked i supposed you were at the factory im turned off turned off hows that through the influence of halbert davis halbert is a disgusting sneak i always despised him and if hes done such a mean thing ill never speak to him again tell me all about it this robert did necessarily bringing in hesters name he neednt think my sister will walk with him said will if she does ill cut her off with a shilling shed rather walk with you any day robert blushed a little for though he was too young to be in love he thought his friends sister the most attractive girl he had even seen and knowing how she was regarded in the village he naturally felt proud of her preference for himself over a boy who was much richer what are you going to do now asked will with interest the first thing i am going to do is to catch some fish if youll lend me your boat lend you my boat of course i will ill lend it to you for the next three months but you want it yourself no havent you heard the news im going to boarding school you are its a fact im packing my trunk now come upstairs and superintend the operation i cant stay long but will are you in earnest about the boat to be sure i am i was meaning to ask you if youd take care of it for me you see i cant carry it with me and you are the only fellow i am willing to lend it to i shall be very glad of the chance will ive been wanting a boat for a long time but there wasnt much chance of my getting one now i shall feel rich but isnt this a sudden idea your going to school rather there was a college classmate of fathers here last week whos at the head of such a school and he made father promise to send me so im to start tomorrow morning if it wasnt for that and being up to my ears in getting ready id go out fishing with you i wish you could i must wait till vacation here is the boat key robert took the key with satisfaction the boat owned by his friend was a stanch roundbottomed boat of considerable size bought only two months before quite the best boat on the river it was to be at his free disposal and this was nearly the same thing as owning it he might find it very useful for it occurred to him that if he could find nothing better to do he could catch fish every day and sell at the village store such as his mother could not use in this way he would be earning something and it would be better than being idle he knew where the boat was usually kept just at the foot of a large tree whose branches drooped over the river he made his way thither and fitting the key in the padlock which confined the boat soon set it free the oars he had brought with him from his friends house throwing in the oars he jumped in and began to push off when he heard himself called and looking up saw halbert davis standing on the bank get out of that boat said halbert what do you mean demanded robert you have no business in that boat it doesnt belong to you youd better mind your own business halbert davis you have nothing to do with the boat its william paines boat thank you for the information i supposed it was yours from the interest you seem to take in it it will be hes going to let me have it while hes away at school indeed did he tell you so i havent asked ma yet but i know he will let me have it i dont think he will why not if you ever want to borrow this boat youll have to apply to me you havent bought it asked halbert in surprise youre too poor im to have charge of the boat while will paine is away did he say you might asked halbert in a tone of disappointment and mortification of course he did i dont believe it said halbert suspiciously i dont care what you believe go and ask him yourself if you are not satisfied and dont meddle with what is none of your business youre an impudent rascal have you got another cane youd like to have broken asked robert significantly halbert looked after him enviously as he rowed the boat out into the stream he had asked his father to buy him a boat but the superintendents speculations had not turned out very well of late and he had been deaf to his sons persuasions backed though they were by his mothers influence when halbert heard that william paine was going to boarding school he decided to ask him for the loan of his boat during his absence as the next best thing now it seemed that he had been forestalled and by the boy he hated he resolved to see young paine himself and offer him two dollars for the use of his boat during the coming term then he would have the double satisfaction of using the boat and disappointing robert he made his way to the house of squire paine and after a brief pause was admitted he was shown into the parlor and will paine came down to see him how are you davis he said nodding coolly but not offering his hand i hear you are going to boarding school yes i go tomorrow i suppose you wont take your boat with you no ill give you two dollars for the use of it the next three months i cant accept your offer robert bashton is to have it but he doesnt pay you anything for it ill give you three dollars if you say so you cant have it for three dollars or ten i have promised it to my friend robert rushton and i shall not take it back you may not know said halbert maliciously that your friend was discharged from the factory this morning for misconduct i know very well that he was discharged and through whose influence halbert davis said will pointedly i like him all the better for his misfortune and so i am sore will my sister halberts face betrayed the anger and jealousy he felt but he didnt dare to speak to the lawyers son as he had to the factory boy goodmorning he said rising to go goodmorning said young paine formally halbert felt as he walked homeward that his triumph over robert was by no means complete chapter vii the strange passenger robert though not a professional fisherman was not wholly inexperienced this morning he was quite lucky catching quite a fine lot of fish as much indeed as his mother and himself would require a week to dispose of however he did not intend to carry them all home it occurred to him that he could sell them at a market store in the village otherwise he would not have cared to go on destroying life for no useful end accordingly on reaching the shore he strung the fish and walked homeward by way of the market it was rather a heavy tug for the fish he had caught weighed at least fifty pounds stepping into the store he attracted the attention of the proprietor thats a fine lot of fish you have there robert what are you going to do with them im going to sell most of them to you if i can are they just out of the water yes i have just brought them in what do you want for them i dont know what is a fair price ill give you two cents a pound for as many as you want to sell all right said our hero with satisfaction ill carry this one home and you can weigh the rest the rest proved to weigh fortyfive pounds the marketman handed robert ninety cents which he pocketed with satisfaction shall you want some more tomorrow he asked yes if you can let me have them earlier but how is it you are not at the factory ive lost my place thats a pity so i have plenty of time to work for you i may be able to take considerable from you im thinking of running a cart to brampton every morning but i must have the fish by eight oclock or itll be too late ill go out early in the morning then very well bring me what you have at that hour and well strike a trade ive got something to do pretty quick thought robert with satisfaction it was a lucky thought asking will paine for his boat im sorry hes going away but it happens just right for me mrs rushton was sitting at her work in rather a disconsolate frame of mind the more she thought of roberts losing his place the more unfortunate it seemed she could not be expected to be as sanguine and hopeful as our hero who was blessed with strong hands and a fund of energy and selfreliance which he inherited from his father his mother on the other hand was delicate and nervous and apt to look on the dark side of things but notwithstanding this she was a good mother and robert loved her nothing had been heard for some time but the drowsy ticking of the clock when a noise was heard at the door and robert entered the room bringing the fish he had reserved you see mother we are not likely to starve he said thats a fine large fish said his mother yes itll be enough for two meals didnt i tell you mother i would find something to do true robert said his mother dubiously but we shall get tired of fish if we have it every day robert laughed six days in the week will do for fish mother he said i think we shall be able to afford something else sunday of course fish is better than nothing said his mother who understood him literally and i suppose we ought to be thankful to get that you dont look very much pleased at the prospect of fish six times a week said robert laughing again on the whole i think it will be better to say twice but what will we do other days robert what we have always done mother eat something else but i wont keep you longer in suspense did you think this was the only fish i caught yes i thought so i sold fortyfive pounds on the way to minturn at his market store fortyfive pounds at two cents a pound what do you think of that do you mean that you have earned ninety cents today robert yes and heres the money thats much better than i expected said mrs rushton looking several degrees more i cheerful i dont expect to do as well as that every day mother but i dont believe well starve minturn has engaged me to supply him with fish every day only some days the fishes wont feel like coming out of the water then i forgot to tell you im to have will paines boat for nothing hes going to boarding school and has asked me to take care of it for him you are fortunate robert i am hungry too mother those two sandwiches didnt go a great ways so if you can just as well as not have supper earlier it would suit me ill put on the teakettle at once robert said his mother rising would you like some of the fish for supper if it wouldnt be too much trouble surely not robert the usual supper hour was at five in this country household but a little after four the table was set and mother and son sat down to a meal which both enjoyed the fish proved to be excellent and robert enjoyed it the more first because he had caught it himself and next because he felt that his independent stand at the factory though it had lost him his place was not likely to subject his mother to the privations he had feared ill take another piece of fish mother said robert passing his plate i think on the whole i shant be obliged to learn to braid straw no you can do better at fishing only added robert with mock seriousness we might change work sometimes mother i will stay at home and braid straw and you can go out fishing i am afraid i should make a poor hand at it said mrs rushton smiling if halbert davis could look in upon us just now he would be disappointed to find us so cheerful after my losing my place at factory however ive disappointed him in another way how is that he expected will paine would lend him his boat while he was gone but instead of that he finds it promised to me i am afraid he is not a very kindhearted boy thats drawing it altogether too mild mother hes the meanest fellow i ever met however i wont talk about him any more or itll spoil my appetite on the next two mornings robert went out at five oclock in order to get home in time for the marketwagon he met with fair luck but not as good as on the first day taking the two mornings together he captured and sold seventy pounds of fish which as the price remained the same brought him in a dollar and forty cents this was not equal to his wages at the factory still he had the greater part of the day to himself only unfortunately he had no way of turning his time profitably to account or at least none had thus far occurred to him on the morning succeeding he was out of luck he caught but two fish and they were so small that he decided not to offer them for sale if i dont do better than this he reflected i shant make very good wages the fish seem to be getting afraid of me he paddled about idly a few rods from the shore having drawn up his line and hook all at once he heard a voice hailing him from the river bank boat ahoy hallo answered robert lifting his eyes and seeing who called him can you set me across the river yes sir bring in your boat then and ill jump aboard ill pay you for your trouble robert did as requested with alacrity he was very glad to earn money in this way since it seemed he was to have no fish to dispose of he quickly turned the boat to the shore and the stranger jumped on board he was a man of rather more than the average height with a slight limp in his gait in a rough suit of clothes his head being surmounted by a felt hat considerably the worse for wear there was a scar on one cheek and altogether he was not very prepossessing in his appearance robert noted all this in a rapid glance but it made no particular impression upon him at the moment he cared very little how the stranger looked as long as he had money enough to pay his fare its about a mile across the river isnt it asked the stranger about that here where do you want to go straight across theres an old man named nichols lives on the other side isnt there yes he lives by himself somebody told me so hes rich isnt he asked the stranger carelessly so people say but he doesnt show it in his dress or way of living a miser i suppose yes what does he do with his money i only know what people say and what do they say that he is afraid to trust banks and hides his money in the earth that kind of bank dont pay very good interest said the stranger laughing no but it isnt likely to break here boy give me one of the oars im used to rowing and ill help you a little robert yielded one of the oars to his companion who evidently understood rowing quite as well as he professed to our hero though strongarmed had hard work to keep up with him look out boy or ill turn you round he said you are stronger than i am and more used to rowing but ill suit myself to you a few minutes brought them to the other shore the passenger jumped ashore first handing a silver halfdollar to our hero who was well satisfied with his fee robert sat idly in his boat and watched his late fare as with rapid steps he left the river bank behind him hes going to the old mans house decided robert i wonder whether he has any business with him chapter viii the old farmhouse the stranger walked with hasty strides in the direction of an old farmhouse which could be seen a quarter of a mile away whether it had ever been painted was a question not easily solved at present it was dark and weatherbeaten and in a general state of neglect the owner paul nichols was a man advanced in years living quite alone and himself providing for his simple wants robert was right in calling him a miser but he had not always deserved the name the time was when he had been happily married to a good wife and was blessed with two young children but they were all taken from him in one week by an epidemic and his life was made solitary and cheerless this bereavement completely revolutionized his life up to this time he had been a good and respected citizen with an interest in public affairs now be became morose and misanthropic and his heart bereaved of its legitimate objects of affection henceforth was fixed upon gold which he began to love with a passionate energy he repulsed the advances of neighbors and became what robert called him a miser how much he was worth no one knew the town assessors sought in vain for stocks and bonds he did not appear to possess any probably popular opinion was correct in asserting that he secreted his money in one or many outoftheway places which from time to time he was wont to visit and gloat over his treasures there was reason also to believe that it was mostly in gold for he had a habit of asking specie payments from those indebted to him or if he could not obtain specie he used to go to a neighboring town with his bank notes and get the change effected such was the man about whom roberts unknown passenger exhibited so much curiosity and whom it seemed that he was intending to visit i wonder whether the old man is at home he said to himself as he entered the front yard through a gateway from which the gate had long since disappeared he dont keep things looking very neat and trim thats a fact he continued noticing the rank weeds and indiscriminate litter which filled the yard just give me this place and his money to keep it and id make a change in the looks of things pretty quick he stepped up to the front door and lifting the oldfashioned knocker sounded a loud summons hell hear that if he isnt very deaf he thought but the summons appeared to be without effect at all events he was left standing on the doorstone and no one came to bid him enter he cant be at home or else he wont come thought the visitor ill try him again and another knock still louder than before sounded through the farmhouse but still no one came to the door the fact was that the old farmer had gone away early with a load of hay which he had sold to a stablekeeper living some five miles distant ill reconnoiter a little said the stranger he stepped to the front window and looked in all that met his gaze was a bare dismantled room not very cheerful thats a fact commented the outsider well he dont appear to be here ill go round to the back part of the house he went round to the back door where he thought it best in the first place to knock no answer coming he peered through the window but saw no one the coast is clear he concluded so much the better if i can get in the door proved to be locked but the windows were easily raised through one of these he clambered into the kitchen which was the only room occupied by the old farmer with the exception of a room above which he used as a bedchamber here he cooked and ate his meals and here he spent his solitary evenings jumping over the window sill the visitor found himself in this room he looked around him with some curiosity it is eighteen years since i was last in this room he said time hasnt improved it nor me either very likely he added with a short laugh ive roamed pretty much all over the world in that time and ive come back as poor as i went away whats that copy i used to write a rolling stone gathers no moss well im the rolling stone in all that time my uncle paul has been moored fast to his hearthstone and been piling up gold which he dont seem to have much use for as far as i know im his nearest relation theres no reason why he shouldnt launch out a little for the benefit of the family it will be gathered from the foregoing soliloquy that the newcomer was a nephew of paul nichols after a not very creditable youth he had gone to sea and for eighteen years this was his first reappearance in his native town he sat down in a chair and stretched out his legs with an air of being at home i wonder what the old man will say when he sees me he soliloquized ten to one he wont know me when we saw each other last i was a smoothfaced youth now ive got hair enough on my face and the years have made their mark upon me i suspect where is he i wonder and how long have i got to wait for him while im waiting ill take the liberty of looking in the closet and seeing if he hasnt something to refresh the inner man i didnt make much of a breakfast and something hearty wouldnt come amiss he rose from his chair and opened the closet door a small collection of crockery was visible most of it cracked but there was nothing eatable to be seen except half a loaf of bread this was from the baker for the old man after ineffectual efforts to make his own bread had been compelled to abandon the attempt and patronize the baker nothing but a half loaf and thats dry enough muttered the stranger that isnt very tempting i cant say much for my uncles fare unless he has got something more attractive somewhere but search as carefully as he might nothing better could be found and his appetite was not sufficiently great to encourage an attack upon the stale loaf he sat down rather discontented and resumed the current of his reflections my uncle must be more of a miser than i thought if he stints himself to such fare as this its rather a bad lookout for me he wont be very apt to look with favor on my application for a small loan from his treasure whats that the boy said he dont trust any banks but keeps his money concealed in the earth by jove it would be a stroke of luck if i could stumble on one of his hiding places if i could do that while he was away i would forego the pleasure of seeing him and make off with what i could find ill look about me and see if i cant find some of his hidden hoards no sooner did the thought occur to him than he acted upon it let me see he reflected where is he most likely to hide his treasure old stockings are the favorites with old maids and widows but i dont believe uncle paul has got any without holes in them hes more likely to hide his gold under the hearth thats a good idea ill try the hearth first he kneeled down and began to examine the bricks critically with a view of ascertaining whether any bore the marks of having been removed recently for he judged correctly that a miser would wish from time to time to unearth his treasure for the pleasure of looking at it but there was no indication of disturbance the hearth bore a uniform appearance and did not seem to have been tampered with that isnt the right spot reflected the visitor perhaps theres a plank in the floor that raises or still more likely the gold is buried in the cellar ive a great mind to go down there he lit a candle and went cautiously down the rickety staircase but he had hardly reached the bottom of the stairs when he caught the sound of a wagon entering the yard that must be my uncle he said id better go up and not let him catch me down here he ascended the stairs and reentered the room just as the farmer opened the door and entered on seeing a tall bearded stranger whom he did not recognize standing before him in his own kitchen with a lighted candle in his hand paul nichols uttered a shrill cry of alarm and ejaculated thieves murder robbers in a quavering voice chapter ix the unwelcome guest the stranger was in rather an awkward predicament however he betrayed neither embarrassment nor alarm blowing out the candle he advanced to the table and set it down this movement brought him nearer paul nichols who with the timidity natural to an old man anticipated an immediate attack dont kill me spare my life he exclaimed hastily stepping back i see you dont know me uncle paul said the intruder familiarly who are you that call me uncle paul asked the old man somewhat reassured benjamin haley your sisters son do you know me now you ben haley exclaimed the old man betraying surprise why you are old enough to be his father remember uncle paul i am eighteen years older than when you saw me last time brings changes you know when i saw you last you were a man in the prime of life now you are a feeble old man are you really ben haley asked the old man doubtfully to be sure i am i suppose i look to you more like a bearded savage well im not responsible for my looks not finding you at home i took the liberty of coming in on the score of relationship what were you doing with that candle asked paul suspiciously i went down cellar with it down cellar repeated his uncle with a look of alarm which didnt escape his nephew what for in search of something to eat all i could find in the closet was a dry loaf which doesnt look very appetizing theres nothing down cellar dont go there again said the old man still uneasy his nephew looked at him shrewdly ha uncle paul ive guessed your secret so quick he said to himself some of your money is hidden away in the cellar im thinking where do you keep your provisions then he said aloud the loaf is all i have come uncle paul you dont mean that thats a scurvy welcome to give a nephew you havent seen for eighteen years im going to stay to dinner with you and you must give me something better than that havent you got any meat in the house no just then ben haley looking from the window saw some chickens in the yard his eye lighted up at the discovery ah there is a nice fat chicken he said well have a chicken dinner shall it be roast or boiled no no said the old farmer hastily i cant spare them theyll bring a good price in the market by and by cant help it uncle paul charity begins at home excuse me a minute ill be back directly he strode to the door and out into the yard then after a little maneuvering he caught a chicken and going to the block seized the ax and soon decapitated it what have you done said paul ruefully for the old man had followed his nephew and was looking on in a very uncomfortable frame of mind taken the first step toward a good dinner said the other coolly i am not sure but we shall want two no no said paul hastily i havent got much appetite then perhaps we can make it do ill just get it ready and cook it myself ive knocked about in all sorts of places and it wont be the first time ive served as cook ive traveled some since i saw you last have you said the old man who seemed more interested in the untimely death of the pullet than in his nephews adventures yes ive been everywhere i spent a year in australia at the gold diggings did you find any asked his uncle for the first time betraying interest some but i didnt bring away any ben haley meanwhile was rapidly stripping the chicken of its feathers when he finished he said now tell me where you keep your vegetables uncle paul theyre in the corn barn you cant get in its locked wheres the key lost ill get in never fear said the intruder and he led the way to the corn barn his uncle unwillingly following and protesting that it would be quite impossible to enter reaching the building he stepped back and was about to kick open the door when old paul hurriedly interposed saying no no ive found the key his nephew took it from his hand and unlocking the door brought out a liberal supply of potatoes beets and squashes well have a good dinner after all he said you dont half know how to live uncle paul you need me here youve got plenty around you but you dont know how to use it the free and easy manner in which his nephew conducted himself was peculiarly annoying and exasperating to the old man but as often as he was impelled to speak the sight of his nephews resolute face and vigorous frame which he found it difficult to connect with his recollections of young ben terrified him into silence and he contented himself with following his nephew around uneasily with looks of suspicion when the dinner was prepared both sat down to partake of it but ben quietly and as a matter of course assumed the place of host and carved the fowl notwithstanding the shock which his economical notions had received the farmer ate with appetite the best meal of which he had partaken for a long time ben had not vaunted too highly his skill as a cook wherever he had acquired it he evidently understood the preparation of such a dinner as now lay before them now uncle paul if we only had a mug of cider to wash down the dinner havent you got some somewhere not a drop dont you think i might find some stored away in the cellar for instance asked ben fixing his glance upon his uncles face no no didnt i tell you i hadnt got any returned paul nichols with petulance and alarm i mean to see what else you have in the cellar said ben to himself before i leave this place theres a reason for that pale face of yours but he only said aloud well if you havent got any we must do without it theres a little more of the chicken left as you dont want it ill appropriate it nothing like clearing up things come this is rather better than dry bread isnt it its very expensive said the miser ruefully well you can afford it uncle paul theres a comfort in that i suppose you are pretty rich eh rich repeated paul in dismay what put such a thing into your head not your style of living you may be sure of that i am poor benjamin you mustnt think otherwise i live as well as i can afford then what have you been doing with your savings all these years my savings it has taken all i had to live there isnt any money to be made in farming its hard work and poor pay you used to support your family comfortably when you had one dont dont speak of them i cant bear it said paul his countenance changing when i had them i was happy and now youre not well i dont wonder at it it must be dismal enough living alone you need somebody with you i am your nephew and nearest relation i feel that it is my duty to stay with you the expression of dismay which overspread the old mans face at this declaration was ludicrous you stay with me he repeated in a tone of alarm yes for a time at least well be company for each other wont we uncle paul no no theres no room no room you dont mean to say that you need the whole house i mean i cannot afford to have you here besides im used to being alone i prefer it thats complimentary at any rate you prefer to be alone rather than to have me with you dont be offended benjamin ive been alone so many years besides youd feel dull here you wouldnt like it ill try it and see what room are you going to give me youd better go away well uncle well talk about that tomorrow youre very considerate in fearing it will be dull for me but ive roamed about the world so much that i shall be glad of a little dullness so its all settled and now uncle paul if you dont object ill take out my pipe and have a smoke i always smoke after dinner he lit his pipe and throwing himself back in a chair began to puff away leisurely his uncle surveying him with fear and embarrassment why should his graceless nephew turn up after so many years in the form of this big broadshouldered heavybearded stranger only to annoy him and thrust his unwelcome company upon him chapter x uncle and nephew paul nichols looked forward with dismay to the prospect of having his nephew remain with him as a guest like all misers he had a distrust of every one and the present appearance of his nephew only confirmed the impressions he still retained of his earlier bad conduct he had all the will to turn him out of his house but ben was vastly his superior in size and strength and he did not dare to attempt it he wants to rob perhaps to murder me thought paul surveying his big nephew with a troubled gaze his apprehensions were such that he even meditated offering to pay the intruders board for a week at the tavern if he would leave him in peace by himself but the reluctance to part with his money finally prevented such a proposal being made in the afternoon the old man stayed around home he did not dare to leave it lest ben should take a fancy to search the house and come upon some of his secret hoards for people were right in reporting that he hid his money at last evening came with visible discomposure the old man showed ben to a room you can sleep there he said pointing to a cot bed in the corner of the room all right uncle goodnight goodnight said paul nichols he went out and closed the door behind him he not only closed it but locked it having secretly hidden the key in his pocket he chuckled softly to himself as he went downstairs his nephew was securely disposed of for the night being fastened in his chamber but if he expected ben haley quietly to submit to this incarceration he was entirely mistaken in that individual the latter heard the key turn in the lock and comprehended at once his uncles stratagem instead of being angry he was amused so my simpleminded uncle thinks he has drawn my teeth does he ill give him a scare he began to jump up and down on the chamber floor in his heavy boots which as the floor was uncarpeted made a terrible noise the old man in the room below just congratulating himself on his cunning move grew pale as he listened he supposed his nephew to be in a furious passion and apprehensions of personal violence disturbed him still he reflected that he would be unable to get out and in the morning he could go for the constable but he was interrupted by a different noise ben had drawn off his boots and was firing them one after the other at the door the noise became so intorable that paul was compelled to ascend the stairs trembling with fear whats the matter he inquired at the door in a quavering voice open the door returned ben his uncle reluctantly inserted the key in the lock and opening it presented a pale scared face in the doorway his nephew with his coat stripped off was sitting on the side of the bed whats the matter asked paul nothing only you locked the door by mistake said ben coolly what made you make such a noise demanded paul to call you up there was no bell in the room so that was the only way i had of doing it what made you lock me in i didnt think stammered the old man just what i supposed to guard against your making that mistake again let me have the key id rather keep it if its the same to you said paul in alarm but it isnt the same to me you see uncle paul you are growing old and forgetful and might lock me in again that would not be pleasant you know especially if the house should catch fire in the night what exclaimed paul terrorstricken half suspecting his nephew contemplated turning incendiary i dont think it will mind but its best to be prepared so give me the key the old man feebly protested but ended in giving up the key to his nephew there thats all right now ill turn in goodnight goodnight responded paul nichols and left the chamber feeling more alarmed than ever he was beginning to be more afraid and more distrustful of his nephew than ever what if the latter should light on some of his various hiding places for money why in that very chamber he had a hundred dollars in gold hidden behind the plastering he groaned in spirit as he thought of it and determined to tell his nephew the next morning that he must find another home as he couldnt and wouldnt consent to his remaining longer but when the morning came he found the task a difficult one to enter upon finally after breakfast which consisted of eggs and toast ben haley having ransacked the premises for eggs which the old man intended for the market paul said benjamin you must not be offended but i have lived alone for years and i cannot invite you to stay longer where shall i go uncle demanded ben taking out his pipe coolly and lighting it theres a tavern in the village is there that wont do me any good youll be better off there than here they set a very good table and you dont said ben finishing the sentence i know that but then uncle i have two reasons for preferring to stay here the first is that i may enjoy the society of my only living relation the second is that i have not money enough to pay my board at the hotel he leaned back and began to puff leisurely at his pipe as if this settled the matter if you have no money why do you come to me demanded paul angrily do you expect me to support you you wouldnt turn out your sisters son would you uncle paul you must earn your own living i cant support you in idleness you neednt ill work for you let me see ill do the cooking i dont want you here said the old man desperately why do you come to disturb me after so many years ill go away on one condition said ben haley whats that give me or lend me i dont care which a hundred dollars do you think im made of money asked paul fear and anger struggling for the mastery i think you can spare me a hundred dollars go away you are a bad man you were a wild bad boy and you are no better now now uncle paul i think youre rather too hard upon me just consider that i am your nephew what will people say if you turn me out of doors i dont care what they say i cant have you here im sorry i cant oblige you by going uncle paul but ive got a headache this morning and dont feel like stirring let me stay with you a day or two and then i may go vain were all the old mans expostulations his nephew sat obstinately smoking and refused to move come out to the barn with me while i milk said paul at length not daring to leave his nephew by himself thank you but im well off as i am ive got a headache and id rather stay here milking couldnt longer be deferred but for the strangers presence it would have been attended to two hours earlier groaning in spirit and with many forebodings paul went out to the barn and in due time returned with his foaming pails there sat his nephew in the old place apparently not having stirred possibly he didnt mean mischief after all paul reflected at any rate he must leave him again while he released the cows from their stalls and drove them to pasture he tried to obtain his nephews companionship but in vain im not interested in cows uncle he said ill be here when you come back with a sigh his uncle left the house only half reassured that he had reason for his distrust was proved by ben haleys movements he lighted a candle and going down celler first securing a pickax struck into the earthen flooring and began to work energetically i am sure some of the old mans money is here he said to himself i must work fast or hell catch me at it half an hour later paul nichols reentered the house he looked for his nephew but his seat was vacant he thought he heard a dull thud in the cellar beneath he hurried to the staircase and tottered down ben had come upon a tin quartmeasure partly filled with gold coins and was stooping over transferring them to his pocket with a hoarse cry like that of an animal deprived of its young his uncle sprang upon him and fastened his clawlike nails in the face of his burly nephew chapter xi robert comes to the rescue the attack was so sudden and the old mans desperation so reinforced his feeble strength that ben haley was thrown forward and the measure of gold coins fell from his hand but he quickly recovered himself let me alone he said sternly forcibly removing his uncles hands from his face but not before the clawlike nails had drawn blood let me alone if you know what is best for yourself youre a thief screamed paul you shall go to jail for this shall i asked ben his face darkening and his tone full of menace who is going to send me there i am answered paul ill have you arrested look here uncle paul said ben confining the old mans arms to his side its time we had a little talk together youd better not do as you say youre a thief the jail is the place for thieves it isnt the place for me and im not going there now let us come to an understanding you are rich and i am poor rich repeated paul yes at any rate you have got this farm and more money hidden away than you will ever use i am poor you can spare me this money here as well as not it is all i have i know better than that you have plenty more but i will be satisfied with this remember i am your sisters son i dont care if you are said the old man doggedly and you owe me some help youll never miss it now make up your mind to give me this money and ill go away and leave you in peace never exclaimed paul struggling hard to free himself you wont his uncle repeated the emphatic refusal then i shall have to put it out of your power to carry out your threat he took his uncle up in his strong arms and moved toward the stairs are you going to murder me asked paul in mortal fear you will find out what i am going to do said ben grimly he carried his uncle upstairs and possessing himself of a clothesline in one corner of the kitchen proceeded to tie him hand and foot despite his feeble opposition there said he when his uncle lay before him utterly helpless i think that disposes of you for a while now for the gold leaving him on the floor he again descended the cellar stairs and began to gather up the gold coins which had been scattered about the floor at the time of pauls unexpected attack the old man groaned in spirit as he found himself about to be robbed and utterly helpless to resist the outrage but help was near at hand though he knew it not robert rushton had thought more than once of his unknown passenger of the day before and the particular inquiries he made concerning paul nichols and his money ben haley had impressed him far from favorably and the more he called to mind his appearance the more he feared that he meditated some dishonest designs upon paul so the next morning in order to satisfy his mind that all was right he rowed across to the same place where he had landed ben and fastening his boat went up to the farmhouse he reached it just as ben having secured the old man had gone back into the cellar to gather up the gold robert looked into the window and to his surprise saw the old farmer lying bound hand and foot he quickly leaped in and asked what is the matter who has done this hush said the old man hell hear you who do you mean my nephew where is he down cellar hes tied me here and is stealing all my gold what shall i do can i help you cut the ropes first robert drew a jackknife from his pocket and did as he was bidden now said paul rising with a sigh of relief from his constrained position while i bolt the cellar door you go upstairs and in the closet of the room over this you will find a gun it is loaded bring it down robert hurried upstairs and quickly returned with the weapon do you know how to fire a gun asked paul yes said robert then keep it for i am nervous and my hand trembles if he breaks through the door fire ben haley would have been up before this but it occurred to him to explore other parts of the cellar that he might carry away as much booty as possible he had rendered himself amenable to the law already and he might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb so he argued he was so busily occupied that he did not hear the noise of roberts entrance into the room above or he would at once have gone upstairs in consequence of the delay his uncle and robert had time to concert measures for opposing him finally not succeeding in finding more gold he pocketed what he had found and went up the cellar stairs he attempted to open the door when to his great surprise he found that it resisted his efforts what makes the door stick so he muttered not suspecting the true state of the case but he was quickly enlightened you cant come up exclaimed the old man in triumph ive bolted the door how did he get free he must have untied the knots thought ben does the old fool think he is going to keep me down here unlock the door he shouted in a loud stern voice or it will be the worse for you have you got the gold with you yes then go down and leave it where you found it and i will let you come up youre a fool was the reply do you think i am a child open the door or i will burst it open with my foot youd better not said paul whose courage had returned with the presence of robert and the possession of the gun why not what are you going to do about it asked ben derisively ive got help you have more than one to contend with i wonder if he has any one with him thought ben i believe the old fool is only trying to deceive me at any rate help or no help it is time i were out of this hole if you dont open the door before i count three he said aloud ill burst it open what shall i do asked robert in a low voice if he comes out if he tries to get away with the gold fire said the old man robert determined only to inflict a wound the idea of taking a human life even under such circumstances was one that made him shudder he felt that gold was not to be set against life one two three counted ben deliberately the door remaining locked he drew back and kicked the door powerfully had he been on even ground it would have yielded to the blow but kicking from the stair beneath placed him at a disadvantage nevertheless the door shook and trembled beneath the force of the attack made upon it well will you unlock it now he demanded pausing no said the old man not unless you carry back the gold i wont do that i have had too much trouble to get it but if you dont unlock the door at once i may be tempted to forget that you are my uncle i should like to forget that you are my nephew said the old man the old fool has mustered up some courage thought ben ill soon have him whining for mercy he made a fresh attack upon the door this time he did not desist until he had broken through the panel then with the whole force he could command he threw himself against the upper part of the door and it came crashing into the kitchen ben haley leaped through the opening and confronted his uncle who receded in alarm the sight of the burly form of his nephew and his stern and menacing countenance once more made him quail ben haley looked around him and his eyes lighted upon robert rushton standing beside the door with the gun in his hand he burst into a derisive laugh and turning to his uncle said so this is the help you were talking about hes only a baby i could twist him around my finger just lay down that gun boy it isnt meant for children like you chapter xii escape though he had a weapon in his hand many boys in roberts situation would have been unnerved he was a mere boy though strong of his age opposed to him was a tall strong man of desperate character fully resolved to carry out his dishonest purpose and not likely to shrink from violence to which he was probably only too well accustomed from the old man he was not likely to obtain assistance for already pauls courage had begun to dwindle and he regarded his nephew with a scared look lay down that gun boy repeated ben haley i know you youre the boy that rowed me across the river you can row pretty well but youre not quite a match for me even at that this gun makes me even with you said robert returning his look unflinchingly does it then all i can say is that when you lose it youll be in a bad pickle lay it down instantly then lay down the gold you have in your pockets said our hero still pointing his gun at haley good boy brave boy said the old man approvingly look here boy said haley in quick stern tones ive had enough of this nonsense if you dont put down that gun in double quick time youll repent it one word yes or no no said robert resolutely no sooner had he uttered the monosyllable than haley sprang toward him with the design of wresting the gun from him but robert had his finger upon the trigger and fired the bullet entered the shoulder of the ruffian but in the excitement of the moment he only knew that he was hit but this incensed him in spite of the wound he seized the musket and forcibly wrested it from our hero he raised it in both hands and would probably in his blind fury have killed him on the spot but for the sudden opening of the outer door and entrance of a neighboring farmer who felt sufficiently intimate to enter without knocking this changed haleys intention feeling that the odds were against him he sprang through the window gun in hand and ran with rapid strides towards the river whats the matter demanded the new arrival surveying the scene before him in astonishment hes gone off with my gold exclaimed paul nichols recovering from his stupefaction run after him catch him who is it ben haley what your nephew i thought he was dead long ago i wish he had been said paul wringing his hands hes taken all my money i shall die in the poorhouse i cant understand how it all happened said the neighbor looking to robert for an explanation who fired the gun i did said our hero did you hit him i think so i saw blood on his shirt i must have hit him in the shoulder dont stop to talk said paul impatiently go after him and get back the gold we cant do much said the neighbor evidently not very anxious to come into conflict with such a bold ruffian he has the gun with him what made you let him have it asked paul i couldnt help it said robert but he cant fire it it is unloaded and i dont think he has any ammunition with him to be sure said paul eagerly you see theres no danger go after him both of you he cant hurt ye somewhat reassured the neighbor followed robert who at once started in pursuit of the escaped burglar he was still in sight though he had improved the time consumed in the foregoing colloquy and was already near the river bank on he sped bent on making good his escape with the money he had dishonestly acquired one doubt was in his mind should he find a boat if not the river would prove an insuperable obstacle and he would be compelled to turn and change the direction of his flight looking over his shoulder he saw robert and the farmer on his track and he clutched his gun the more firmly theyd better not touch me he said to himself if i cant fire the gun i can brain either or both with it thoughts of crossing the stream by swimming occurred to him a sailor by profession he was an expert swimmer and the river was not wide enough to daunt him but his pockets were filled with the gold he had stolen and gold is well known to be the heaviest of all the metals but nevertheless he could not leave it behind since it was for this he had incurred his present peril in this uncertainty he reached the bank of the river when to his surprise and joy his eye rested upon roberts boat the boys boat he exclaimed in exultation by all thats lucky i will take the liberty of borrowing it without leave he sprang in and seizing one of the oars pushed out into the stream first drawing up the anchor when robert and his companion reached the shore he was already floating at a safe distance hes got my boat exclaimed our hero in disappointment so he has ejaculated the other youre a little too late shouted ben haley with a sneer just carry back my compliments to the old fool yonder and tell him i left in too great a hurry to give him my note for the gold he kindly lent me ill attend to it when i get ready he had hitherto sculled the boat now he took the other oar and commenced rowing but here the wound of which he had at first been scarcely conscious began to be felt and the first vigorous stroke brought a sharp twinge besides increasing the flow of blood his natural ferocity was stimulated by his unpleasant discovery and he shook his fist menacingly at robert from whom he had received the wound theres a reckoning coming betwixt you and me young one he cried and itll be a heavy one ben haley dont forget that sort of debt the timell come when hell pay it back with interest it maynt come for years but itll come at last you may be sure of that finding that he could not row on account of his wound he rose to his feet and sculled the boat across as well as he could with one hand i wish i had another boat said robert we could soon overtake him better let him go said the neighbor he was always a bad one that ben haley i couldnt begin to tell you all the bad things he did when he was a boy he was a regular daredevil you must look out for him or hell do you a mischief some time to pay for that wound he brought it on himself said robert i gave him warning he went back to the farmhouse to tell paul of his nephews escape he was brave and bold but the malignant glance with which ben haley uttered his menace gave him a vague sense of discomfort chapter xiii revenge in spite of his wounded arm ben haley succeeded in propelling the boat to the opposite shore the blood was steadily though slowly flowing from his wound and had already stained his shirt red for a considerable space in the excitement of first receiving it he had not felt the pain now however the wound began to pain him and as might be expected his feeling of animosity toward our hero was not diminished that cursed boy he muttered between his teeth i wish i had had time to give him one blow he wouldnt have wanted another i hope the wound isnt serious if it is i may have paid dear for the gold still the thought of the gold in his pockets afforded some satisfaction he had been penniless now he was the possessor of as near as he could estimate for he had not had time to count five hundred dollars in gold that was more than he had ever possessed before at one time and would enable him to live at ease for a while on reaching the shore he was about to leave the boat to its fate when he espied a boy standing at a little distance with a hatchet in his hand this gave him an idea come here boy he said the boy came forward and examined the stranger with curiosity is that your hatchet he asked no sir it belongs to my father would you mind selling it to me if i will give you money enough to buy a new one this is an old hatchet it will suit me just as well and i havent time to buy another would your father sell it yes sir i guess so very well what will a new one cost you the boy named the price here is the money and twentyfive cents more to pay you for your trouble in going to the store tae boy pocketed the money with satisfaction he was a farmers son and seldom had any money in his possession he already had twentyfive cents saved up toward the purchase of a junior ball and the strangers gratuity would just make up the sum necessary to secure it he was in a hurry to make the purchase and accordingly no sooner had he received the money than he started at once for the village store his departure was satisfactory to ben haley who now had nothing to prevent his carrying out his plans i wanted to be revenged on the boy and now i know how he said ill make some trouble for him with this hatchet he drew the boat up and fastened it then he deliberately proceeded to cut away at the bottom with his newlyacquired hatchet he had a strong arm and his blows were made more effective by triumphant malice the boat he supposed to belong to robert and he was determined to spoil it he hacked away with such energy that soon there was a large hole in the bottom of the boat not content with inflicting this damage he cut it in various other places until it presented an appearance very different from the neat stanch boat of which will paine had been so proud at length ben stopped and contemplated the ruin he had wrought with malicious satisfaction thats the first instalment in my revenge he said i should like to see my young ferrymans face when he sees his boat again itll cost him more than hell ever get from my miserly uncle to repair it it serves him right for meddling with matters that dont concern him and now i must be getting away for my affectionate uncle will soon be raising a hue and cry after me if im not very much mistaken he would like to hare gone at once to obtain medical assistance for his wound but to go to the village doctor would be dangerous he must wait till he had got out of the town limits and the farther away the better he knew when the train would start and made his way across the fields to the station arriving just in time to catch it first however he bound a handkerchief round his shoulder to arrest the flow of blood when he reached the station and was purchasing his ticket the stationmaster noticed the blood upon his shirt are you hurt sir he asked yes a little said ben haley how did it happen inquired the other with yankee inquisitiveness i was out hunting said ben carelessly with a friend who wasnt much used to firearms in swinging his gun round it accidentally went off and i got shot through the shoulder thats bad said the stationmaster in a tone of sympathy youd better go round to the doctors and have it attended to i would said ben but i am called away by business of the greatest importance i can get along for a few hours and then ill have a doctor look at it how soon will the train be here its coming now dont you hear it thats the train i must take you see i couldnt wait long enough for the doctor added ben anxious to account satisfactorily for his inattention to the medical assistance of which he stood in need when he was fairly on board the cars and the train was under way he felt considerably relieved he was speeding fast away from the man he had robbed and who was interested in his capture and in a few days he might be at sea able to snap his fingers at his miserly uncle and the boy whom he determined some day to meet and settle scores with from one enemy of robert the transition is brief and natural to another at this very moment halbert davis was sauntering idly and discontentedly through the streets of the village he was the son of a rich man or of one whom most persons his own family included supposed to be rich but this consciousness though it made him proud by no means made him happy he had that morning at the breakfast table asked his father to give him a boat like will paines but mr davis had answered by a decided refusal you dont need any boat he said sharply it wouldnt cost very much pleaded halbert how much do you suppose will paine told me his father paid fifty dollars for his why dont you borrow it sometimes i cant borrow it will started a day or two since for boarding school better still i will hire it for you while he is away i thought of it myself said halbert but just before he went away will lent it to the factory boy sneering as he uttered the last two words do you mean robert rushton yes thats only a boys arrangement i will see mr paine and propose to pay him for the use of the boat and i presume he will be willing to accede to my terms when will you see him asked halbert hopefully i will try to see him in the course of the day it turned out however that there was no need of calling on mr paine for five minutes later having some business with mr davis he rang the bell and was ushered into the breakfastroom excuse my calling early he said but i wished to see you about and here he stated his business in which my readers will feel no interest when that was over mr davis introduced the subject of the boat and made the offer referred to i am sorry to refuse said mr paine but my son before going away passed his promise to robert rushton that he should have it during his absence do you hold yourself bound by such a promise inquired mrs davis with a disagreeable smile certainly said the lawyer gravely robert is a valued friend of my sons and i respect boyish friendship i remember very well my own boyhood and i had some strong friendships at that time i dont see what your son can find to like in robert rushton said mrs davis with something of halberts manner i think him a very disagreeable and impertinent boy mr paine did not admire mrs davis and was not likely to be influenced by her prejudices without inquiry therefore into the cause of her unfavorable opinion he said i have formed quite a different opinion of robert i am persuaded that you do him injustice he attacked halbert ferociously the other day said mrs davis determined to impart the information whether asked or not he has an ungovernable temper mr paine glanced shrewdly at halbert of whose arrogant and quarrelsome disposition he had heard from his own son and replied i make it a point not to interfere in boys quarrels william speaks very highly of robert and it affords him great satisfaction i know to leave the boat in his charge mrs davis saw that there was no use in pursuing the subject and it dropped after the lawyer had gone halbert made his petition anew but without satisfactory results the fact was mr davis had heard unfavorable reports from new york the day previous respecting a stock in which he had an interest and it was not a favorable moment to prefer a request involving the outlay of money it was this refusal which made halbert discontented and unhappy the factory boy as he sneeringly called him could have a boat while he a gentlemans son was forced to go without one of course he would not stoop to ask the loan of the boat however much he wanted it from a boy he disliked so much as robert he wondered whether robert were out this morning so unconsciously his steps led him to the shore of the river where he knew the boat was generally kept he cast his eye toward it when what was his surprise to find the object of his desire half full of water with a large hole in the bottom and defaced in other respects chapter xiv two unsatisfactory interviews halberts first emotion was surprise his second was gratification his rival could no longer enjoy the boat which he had envied him not only that but he would get into trouble with mr paine on account of the damage which it had received being under his care it was his duty to keep it in good condition i wonder how it happened thought halbert wont the young beggar be in a precious scrape when its found out most likely he wont let mr paine know in this thought he judged robert by himself straightway the plan suggested itself of going to the lawyer himself and informing him of roberts delinquency it would be a very agreeable way of taking revenge him the plan so pleased him that he at once directed his steps toward mr paines office on the way he overtook hester paine the young lady on whose account he was chiefly incensed against robert being as desirous as ever of standing in the young ladys good graces he hurriedly advanced to her side and lifting his hat with an air of ceremonious politeness he said goodmorning hester hester paine was not particularly well pleased with the meeting she had been made acquainted by her brother with the quarrel between halbert and robert and the mean revenge which the former had taken in procuring the dismissal of the latter from the factory having a partiality for robert this was not likely to recommend his enemy in her eyes goodmorning mr davis she said with cool politeness you are very ceremonious this morning miss hester said halbert who liked well enough to be called mr by others but not by hester am i asked hester indifferently how so you called me mr davis thats your name isnt it i am not called so by my intimate friends no i suppose not said hester thus disclaiming the title halbert bit his lips he was not in love not because he was too young but because he was too selfish to be in love with anybody except himself but he admired hester and the more she slighted him the more he was determined to force her to like him he did however feel a little piqued at her behavior and that influenced his next words perhaps youd rather have the factory boy walking beside you he said with not very good judgment if he wanted to recommend himself to her there are a good many factory boys in town she said i cant tell unless you tell me whom you mean i mean robert rushton perhaps i might said hester hes a low fellow said halbert bitterly no one thinks so but you retorted hester indignantly my father was obliged to dismiss him from the factory i know all about that and who was the means of having him sent away i suppose you mean me yes halbert davis i mean you and i consider it a very mean thing to do said hester her cheeks flushed with the indignation she felt he attacked me like the low ruffian that he is pleaded halbert in extenuation if he hadnt insulted me he wouldnt have got into trouble you struck him first you know you did my brother told me all about it you were angry because he walked home with me i would rather go home alone any time than have your escort youre very polite miss hester said halbert angrily i can tell you some news about your favorite if its anything bad i wont believe it youll have to believe it well what is it demanded hester who was not altogether unlike girls in general and so felt curious to learn what it was that halbert had to reveal your brother was foolish enough to leave his boat in rushtons care that is no news will was very glad to do robert a favor hell be sorry enough now why will he because the boat is completely ruined i dont believe it said hester hastily its true though i was down at the river just now and saw it with my own eyes there is a great hole in the bottom and it is hacked with a hatchet so that it wouldnt bring half price do you know who did it asked hester with the momentary thought that halbert himself might have been tempted by his hatred into the commission of the outrage no i dont it was only accidentally i saw it was robert at the boat no have you asked him about it no i have not seen him then i am sure some enemy has done it i am sure it is no fault of his if your brother had let me have the boat it wouldnt have happened i offered him a fair price for its use he wont be sorry he refused whatever has happened but i must bid you goodmorning mr davis and the young lady who was now at her own gate opened it and entered she might have been polite enough to invite me in said halbert with chagrin i dont see how she can be so taken up with that low fellow he waited till hester had entered the house and then bent his steps to mr paines office which was a small onestory building in one corner of the yard the lawyer was sitting at a table covered with papers from which he looked up as halbert entered the office sit down halbert he said any message from your father no sir no legal business of your own he inquired with a smile no sir no legal business well if you have any business you may state it at once as i am quite busy it is about the boat which your son lent to robert rushton i shall not interfere with that arrangement said the lawyer misunderstanding his object i told your father that this morning and he resumed his writing i did not come to say anything about that the boat wouldnt be of any use to me now why not asked the lawyer detecting something significant in the boys tone because said halbert in a tone which he could not divest of the satisfaction he felt at his rivals misfortune the boats completely ruined mr paine laid down his pen in genuine surprise explain yourself he said so halbert told the story once more taking good care to make the damage quite as great as it was that is very strange said the lawyer thoughtfully i cant conceive how such damage could have happened to the boat robert rushton dont know how to manage a boat you are mistaken he understands it very well i am sure the injury you speak of could not have happened when he was in charge you say there was not only a hole in the bottom but it was otherwise defaced and injured yes sir it looked as if it had been hacked by a hatchet then it is quite clear that robert could have had nothing to do with it it must have been done by some malicious person or persons knowing something of halbert mr paine looked hard at him his suspicions taking the same direction as his daughters but as we know halbert was entirely innocent and bore the gaze without confusion i dont see why robert hasnt been and let me know of this said mr paine musing he was probably afraid to tell you said halbert with a slight sneer i know him better than that you can testify added the lawyer significantly that he is not deficient in bravery i thought i would come and tell you said halbert coloring a little i thought you would like to know you are very kind to take so much trouble said mr paine but there was neither gratitude nor cordiality in his tone halbert thought it was time to be going and accordingly got up and took his leave as he opened the office door to go out he found himself face to face with robert rushton who passed him with a slight nod and with an air of trouble entered the presence of his friends father chapter xv halberts malice robert was forced by ben baleys inking possession of his boat to give up for the present his design of recrossing the river he felt bound to go back and inform paul of bens escape he has carried off my gold exclaimed paul in anguish why didnt you catch him he had too much start of us said roberts companion but even if we had come up with him i am afraid he would have proved more than a match for us he is a desperate man how much money did he take away with him more than five hundred dollars wailed the old man i am completely ruined not quite so bad as that mr nichols you have your farm left but the old man was not to be comforted he had become so wedded to his gold that to lose it was like losing his hearts blood but was these no hope of recovery why dont you go after him he exclaimed suddenly raise the neighbors it isnt too late yet hes across the river before this said robert get a boat and go after him i am willing said our hero promptly where can we find a boat mr dunham theres one about a quarter of a mile down the stream stetsons boat lets go then very well robert ive no idea we can do anything but we will try go go dont waste a moment implored the old man in feverish impatience robert and mr dunham started and were soon rowing across the river in stetsons boat whereabout would he be likely to land asked the farmer theres my boat now said robert pointing it out he has left it where i usually keep it quickly they rowed alongside then to his great sorrow robert perceived the malicious injury which his enemy had wrought oh mr dunham look at that he said struck with grief the boat is spoiled not so bad as that it can be mended what will will paine say what will his father say then it isnt your boat no that is the worst of it it was lent me by will paine and i promised to take such good care of it it isnt your fault robert no i couldnt help it but still it wouldnt have happened if it had not been in my charge you can get it repaired so that it will look almost as well as new if robert had had plenty of money this suggestion would have comforted him but it will be remembered that he was almost penniless dependent on the fish he caught for the means of supporting his mother and himself now this resource was cut off the boat couldnt be used until it was repaired he felt morally bound to get it repaired though he was guiltless of the damage but how could he even do this one thing was clear mr paine must at once be informed of the injury suffered by the boat robert shrank from informing him but he knew it to be his duty and he was too brave to put it off but first he must try to find some clew to ben haley he had now a personal interest in bringing to justice the man who had made him so much trouble he had scarcely got on shore than the boy who had sold ben haley the hatchet strolled up who was that man who came across in your boat he asked did you see him asked robert eagerly to be sure i did said tom green with satisfaction i sold him my old hatchet for money enough to buy a new one and he give me a quarter besides for my trouble i wish you hadnt done it tom said robert gravely see what hes done with it tom green opened his eyes wide with astonishment what did he do that for he asked to be revenged on me ill tell you what for another time now i want to find him can you tell me where he went no i left him here while i went to the store for a new hatchet the old hatchet was found under a clump of bushes robert took possession of it feeling that he had a right to it as part compensation for the mischief it had done wed better go to the railroad depot mr dunham he said hed be most likely to go there youre right well go they walked rapidly to the station but too late of course for the train the stationmaster was standing on the platform superintending the removal of a trunk mr cross said robert i want to find out if a particular man left by the last train ill describe him yes said the stationmaster thats the man i was wondering about he had a wound in the shoulder he got that from me said robert sho you dont say so returned the stationmaster in surprise he said he was out hunting with a friend and his friends gun went off accidentally i dont believe he feels very friendly to me said robert smiling hes stolen five or six hundred dollars in gold from old paul nichols itll about kill the old man wont it he feels pretty bad about it for what place did he buy a ticket for cranston but that aint no guide when he gets there hell buy a ticket for further on had there been a telegraph station robert would have telegraphed on to have ben haley stopped but there was none nearer than the next town he determined to give information to a justice of the peace and leave the matter in his hands but justice in a country town is slow and it may as well be stated here before anything was done ben haley was out of danger but robert was destined to fall in with him at a future day this business attended to robert bent his steps to mr paines office this brings us to his meeting with halbert davis at the door he was slightly surprised at the encounter but was far from guessing the object of halberts call mr paine looked up as he entered and had no difficulty in guessing his errand what can i do for you robert he asked kindly i bring bad news mr paine said our hero boldly plunging into the subject which had brought him to the office its about the boat isnt it said the lawyer what do you know about it asked robert in surprise yes a disinterested friend brought the news halbert davis the same he takes a strong interest in your affairs added the lawyer dryly now tell me how it happened robert gave a full explanation the lawyer occasionally asking a question it seems then he said that you incurred this mans enmity by your defense of mr nichols money yes sir it was incurred in a good cause i cant blame you nor will my son i will get mr plane the carpenter to look at the boat and see what he can do to repair it some time i will pay you the cost of the repairs mr paine i would now if i had any money but you know how i am situated i shall not call upon you to do that said the lawyer kindly it was not your fault but the damage would not have happened if will had not lent the boat to me that is true but in undertaking the defense of mr nichols you showed a pluck and courage which most boys would not have exhibited i am interested like all good citizens in the prevention of theft and in this instance i am willing to assume the cost you are very kind mr paine i was afraid you would blame me no my boy i am not so unreasonable it will save me some trouble if you will yourself see mr plane and obtain from him an estimate of the probable expense of putting the boat in order robert left the office feeling quite relieved by the manner in which his communication had been received a little way up the road he overtook halbert davis in fact halbert was waiting for him expressly to get an opportunity of enjoying his discomfiture at the ruin of the boat hallo rushton he said goodmorning halbert are you going out in your boat this afternoon asked halbert maliciously you know why i cant i wonder what will paine will say when he sees the good care you take of it i dont believe he will blame me when he knows the circumstances you aint fit to have the charge of a boat i suppose you ran it on a rock then you suppose wrong you wont be able to go out fishing any more how will you make a living without your help said robert coldly you will probably see me out again in a few days if you take the trouble to look how can you go mr paine has asked me to see mr plane about repairing the boat is he going to pay the expenses yes then hes a fool youd better not tell him so or he might give you a lesson in politeness youre a low fellow said halbert angrily you are welcome to your opinion returned robert indifferently chapter xvi on the railroad track robert saw the carpenter according to mr paines instructions but found him so busy that he would not engage to give his attention to the boat under a week the delay was regretted by our hero since it cut him off from the employment by which he hoped to provide for his mother again mrs rushton was in low spirits i am sorry you couldnt agree with halbert davis robert she said with a sigh then you could have stayed in the factory and got your wages regularly every week i know that mother but i am not willing to have halbert boss me round even for a place in the factory then robert you quarreled with the man you took across the river i think i did right mother said robert dont get out of spirits i dont expect to succeed always but i think i shall come out right in the end i am sure i hope so mrs rushton was one of those who look on the dark side she was distrustful of the future and apt to anticipate bad fortune robert was very different he inherited from his father an unusual amount of courage and selfreliance and if one avenue was closed to him he at once set out to find another it is of this class that successful men are made and we have hopes that robert will develop into a prosperous and successful man i am sure i dont see what you can do said mrs rushton and we cant live on what i make by braiding straw ill tell you what ill do said robert ill go on sligo hill and pick blueberries i was passing a day or two ago and saw the bushes quite covered just give me a couple of tin pails and ill see what i can do the pails were provided and robert started on his expedition the hill was not very high nor was its soil very good the lower part was used only to pasture a few cows but this part was thickly covered with blueberry bushes which this season were fuller than usual of largesized berries robert soon settled to work and picked steadily and rapidly at the end of three hours he had filled both pails containing as near as he could estimate eight quarts thats a pretty good afternoons work he said to himself now i suppose i must turn peddler and dispose of them he decided to ask ten cents a quart later in the season the price would be reduced but at that time the berries ought to command that price the first house at which he called was mr paines he was about to pass when he saw hester at the window pride suggested she may despise me for being a berry peddler but robert had no false shame at any rate i wont be coward enough to try to hide it from her accordingly he walked up boldly to the door and rang the bell hester had seen him from the window and she answered the bell herself i am glad to see you robert she said frankly wont you come in thank you said our hero but i called on business you will find my father in his office she said looking a little disappointed robert smiled my business is not of a legal character he said ive turned peddler and would like to sell you some blueberries oh what nice berries where did you pick them on sligo i am sure mother will buy some will you wait a minute while i go and ask her i will wait as long as you like hester soon returned with authority to buy four quarts i suspect that she was the means of influencing so large a purchase they are ten cents a quart said robert but i dont think i ought to charge your father anything why not because i shall owe him or rather will a good deal of money i know what you mean its about the boat did your father tell you yes but i knew it before halbert davis told me he takes a great interest in my affairs hes a mean boy you mustnt mind what he says against you robert laughed i dont care what he thinks or says of me unless he persuades others to think ill of me i shall never think ill of you robert said hester warmly thank you hester said robert looking up into her glowing face with more gratification than he could express i hope i shall deserve your good opinion i am sure you will robert but wont you come in no thank you i must sell the rest of my berries robert left the house with forty cents in his pocket the first fruits of his afternoons work besides he had four quarts left for which he expected to find a ready sale he had not gone far when he met halbert the latter was dressed with his usual care with carefully polished shoes neatly fitting gloves and swinging a light cane the successor of that which had been broken in his conflict with robert our hero on the other hand i am obliged to confess was by no means fashionably attired his shoes were dusty and his bare hands were stained with berry juice he wore a coarse straw hat with a broad brim to shield him from the hot sun those of my readers who judge by dress alone would certainly have preferred halbert davis who looked as if he had just stepped out of a bandbox but those who compared the two faces the one bright frank and resolute the other supercilious and insincere could hardly fail to prefer robert in spite of his coarse attire and unfashionable air halbert scanned his rival with scornful eyes he would have taken no notice of him but concluded to speak in the hope of saying something disagreeable you have found a new business i see he said with a sneer yes said robert quietly when one business gives out i try another youve made a good choice said halbert its what you are adapted for thank you for the compliment but i dont expect to stick to it all my life how do you sell your berries ten cents a quart youd better call on your friend miss hester paine and see if she wont buy some thank you for the advice but it comes too late she bought four quarts of me she did returned halbert surprised i didnt think youd go there why not she wont think much of a boy that has to pick berries for a living i dont think that will change her opinion of me why should it its a low business i dont see it excuse my delaying you i am afraid i may have interfered with your business i say he called out as robert was going on if you will call at our house perhaps my mother may patronize you very well said robert if i dont sell elsewhere ill call there it makes no difference to me who buys my berries hes the proudest beggar i ever met thought halbert looking after him hester paine must be hard up for an escort if she walks with a boy who peddles berries for a living if i were her father i would put a stop to it the same evening there was a concert in the town hall a free ticket was given to robert in return for some slight service mr paine and his daughter were present and halbert davis also to the disgust of the latter robert actually had the presumption to walk home with hester hester laughed and chatted gayly and appeared to be quite unconscious that she was lowering herself by accepting the escort of a boy who picked berries for a living the next day robert again repaired to sligo he had realized eighty cents from his sales the previous day and he felt that picking berries was much better than remaining idle halberts sneers did not for a moment discompose him he had pride but it was an honorable pride and not of a kind that would prevent his engaging in any respectable employment necessary for the support of his mother and himself returning home with wellfilled pails he walked a part of the way on the railroad as this shortened the distance he had not walked far when he discovered on the track a huge rock large enough to throw the train off the track how it got there was a mystery just in front there was a steep descent on either side the road crossing a valley so that an accident would probably cause the entire train to be thrown down the embankment robert saw the danger at a glance and it flashed upon him at the same moment that the train was nearly due he sprang to the rock and exerted his utmost strength to dislodge it he could move it slightly but it was too heavy to remove he was still exerting his strength to the utmost when the whistle of the locomotive was heard robert was filled with horror as he realized the peril of the approaching train and his powerlessness to avert it chapter xvii the young capitalist the cars swept on at the rate of twenty miles an hour the engineer wholly unconscious of the peril in front robert saw the fated train with its freight of human lives and his heart grew sick within him as he thought of the terrible tragedy which was about to be enacted was there any possibility of his averting it he threw himself against the rock and pushed with all the strength he could command but nerved as he was by desperation he found the task greater than he could compass and still the train came thundering on he must withdraw to a place of safety or he would himself be involved in the destruction which threatened the train there was one thing more he could do and he did it he took his station on the rock which was just in the path of the advancing train and waved his handkerchief frantically it was a position to test the courage of the bravest robert was fully aware that he was exposing himself to a horrible death should he not be seen by the engineer it would be doubtful whether he could get out of the way in time to escape death and that of the most frightful nature but unless he did something a hundred lives perhaps might be lost so he resolutely took his stand waving as we have said his handkerchief and shouting though the last was not likely to be of any avail at first he was not seen when the engineer at last caught sight of him it was with a feeling of anger at what he regarded as the foolhardiness of the boy he slackened his speed thinking he would leave his place but robert still maintained his position his nerves strung to their highest tension not alone at his own danger but at the peril which he began to fear he could not avert reluctantly the engineer gave the signal to stop the train he was only just in time when it came to a stop there was an interval of only thirtyfive feet between it and robert rushton who now that he had accomplished his object withdrew to one side a little paler than usual but resolute and manly in his bearing what is the meaning of this foolery the engineer demanded angrily robert pointed in silence to the huge rock which lay on the track how came that rock there asked the engineer in a startled tone as he took in the extent of the peril from which they had been saved i dont know said robert i tried to move it but i couldnt you are a brave boy said the engineer you have in all probability saved the train from destruction but you ran a narrow risk yourself i know it was the reply but it was the only thing i could do to catch your attention i will speak to you about it again the first to be done is to move the rock he left the engine and advanced toward the rock by this time many of the passengers had got out and were inquiring why the train was stopped at this point the sight of the rock made a sensation though the peril was over the thought that the train might have been precipitated down the embankment and the majority of the passengers killed or seriously injured impressed them not a little they pressed forward and several lending a hand the rock was ousted from its its position and rolled crashing over the bank among the passengers was a stout goodlooking man a new york merchant he had a large family at home waiting his return from a western journey he shuddered as he thought how near he had been to never meeting them again on earth it was providential your seeing the rock he said to the engineer we owe our lives to you you do me more than justice replied the engineer it was not i who saved the train but that boy all eyes were turned upon robert who unused to being the center of so many glances blushed and seemed disposed to withdraw how is that inquired the merchant he saw the obstruction and tried to remove it but not being able to do so took his station on the rock and at the risk of his own life drew my attention and saved the train it was a noble act my boy what is your name robert rushton it is a name that we shall all have cause to remember gentlemen continued the merchant turning to the group around him you see before you the preserver of your lives shall his act go unrewarded no no was the general exclamation i dont want any reward said robert modestly any boy would have done as much i dont know about that my young friend there are not many boys or men i think that would have had the courage to act as you did you may not ask or want any reward but we should be forever disgraced if we failed to acknowledge our great indebtedness to you i contribute one hundred dollars as my share of the testimonial to our young friend i follow with fifty said his next neighbor and shall ask for the privilege of taking him by the hand robert had won honors at school but he had never before been in a position so trying to his modesty the passengers following the example of the last speaker crowded around him and took him by the hand expressing their individual acknowledgments for the service he had rendered them our hero whom we now designate thus appropriately bore the ordeal with a selfpossession which won the favor of all while this was going on the collection was rapidly being made by the merchant who had proposed it the amounts contributed varied widely but no one refused to give in ten minutes the fund had reached over six hundred dollars master robert rushton said the merchant i have great pleasure in handing you this money freely contributed by the passengers on this train as a slight acknowledgment of the great service which you have rendered them at the risk of your own life it does not often fall to the lot of a boy to perform a deed so heroic we are all your debtors and if the time ever conies that you need a friend i for one shall be glad to show my sense of indebtedness all aboard shouted the conductor the passengers hurried into the cars leaving our hero standing by the track with one hand full of bank notes and in the other the card of the new york merchant it was only about fifteen minutes since robert had first signaled the train yet how in this brief time had his fortunes changed from the cars now rapidly receding he looked to the roll of bills and he could hardly realize that all this money was his own he sat down and counted it over six hundred and thirtyfive dollars he exclaimed i must have made a mistake but a second count turned out precisely the same how happy mother will be he thought joyfully i must go and tell her the good news he was so occupied with the thoughts of his wonderful good fortune that he nearly forgot to take the berries which he had picked i shant need to sell them now he said well use a part of them ourselves and what we cant use i will give away he carefully stored away the money in his coat pocket and for the sake of security buttoned it tight it was a new thing for him to be the custodian of so much treasure as halbert davis usually spent the latter part of the afternoon in promenading the streets sporting his kids and swinging his jaunty cane it was not surprising that robert encountered him again so youve been berrying again he said stopping short yes said robert briefly you havent got the boat repaired i suppose not yet its lucky for you this is berrying season why because youd probably have to go to the poorhouse said halbert insolently i dont know about that said robert coolly i rather think i could buy you out halbert davis watch gloves cane and all what do you mean demanded halbert haughtily you seem to forget that you are a beggar or next to it robert set down his pails and opening his coat drew out a handful of bills does that look like going to the almshouse he said theyre not yours returned halbert considerably astonished for though he did not know the denomination of the bills it was evident that there was a considerable amount of money it belongs to me every dollar of it returned robert i dont believe it where did you get it picking berries i suppose he added with a sneer it makes no difference to you where i got it said our hero returning the money to his pocket i shant go to the almshouse till this i is all gone he must have stolen it muttered halbert looking after robert with disappointment and chagrin it was certainly very vexatious that in spite of all his attempts to humble and ruin our hero he seemed more prosperous than ever chapter xviii a visit to the lawyer mrs rushton was braiding straw when robert entered with his berries couldnt you sell your berries robert she asked i havent tried yet mother the berrying season wont last much longer said his mother despondently dont borrow trouble mother i am sure we shall get along well you feel more confidence than i do i just met halbert davis in the street have you made up with him it is for him to make up with me i am afraid you are too highspirited robert did halbert speak to you oh yes said robert laughing he takes a great interest in my affairs he predicts that we shall come to the poorhouse yet he may be right now mother dont be so desponding weve got enough money to pay our expenses for more than a year even if we both stop work what can you mean robert said his mother looking up in surprise you must be crazy does that look like going to the poorhouse asked robert drawing out his money mrs rushton uttered an exclamation of surprise whose money is that robert mine you havent done anything wrong no mother i thought you knew me too well for that i see you are anxious to hear how i obtained it so ill tell you all about it he sat down and in brief words told his mother the story of the train and its peril how he had rescued it and lastly of the generous gift which he had so unexpectedly received the mothers heart was touched and she forgot all her forebodings my son i am proud of you she said her eyes moist you have done a noble deed and you deserve the reward but what a risk you ran i know it mother but we wont think of that now that it is over how much money do you think i have here two or three hundred dollars six hundred and thirtyfive so you see mother we neednt go to the poorhouse just yet now how much better off should i have been if i had kept my place in the factory it would have taken me more than two years to earn as much money as this but that isnt all i have been the means of saving a great many lives for the train was sure to be thrown down the embankment i shall remember that all my life we have reason to be grateful to heaven that you have been the means of doing so much good robert while at the same time you have benefited yourself that is true mother i shall be afraid to have so much money in the house if it were known we might be robbed i will leave it with mr paine until i get a chance to put it in a savings bank he has a safe in his office at the same time i will carry him some berries as a present it wont be much but i should like to do it on account of his kindness about the boat i will offer now to bear the expense of its repair after washing his hands and adjusting his clothes a little for robert though no fop like halbert was not regardless of appearances especially as he thought hester might see him he set out for the lawyers office excuse my bringing in my berries said robert as he entered the office but i want to ask your acceptance of them many persons under the supposition that robert was too poor to afford a gift would have declined it or offered to pay for it thinking they were acting kindly and considerately but mr paine knew that robert would be mortified by such an offer and he answered thank you robert i will accept your gift with thanks on one condition what is it mr paine inquired our hero a little puzzled that you will take tea with us tomorrow evening and help us do justice to them thank you said robert not a little pleased at the invitation but i shouldnt like to leave my mother at home alone oh we must have your mother too hester will call this evening and invite her then said robert i can answer for myself and i think for her that we should both be very happy to come the lawyers social position made such an invitation particularly gratifying to robert besides he was led to value it more on account of the persistent efforts of halbert to injure him in the general estimation then too it was pleasant to think that he was to sit down to the same table with hester as her fathers guest and to receive a call from her at his own house nothing that mr paine could have done would have afforded him an equal amount of gratification there is one other matter i wanted to speak to you about mr paine he said will you take care of some money for me until i get a chance to deposit it in the savings bank certainly robert was the reply but the lawyers manner showed some surprise he knew the circumstances of the rushtons and he had not supposed they had any money on hand how much is it six hundred and thirtyfive dollars answered robert producing it will you count it and see if it is all right is this your money asked the lawyer laying down his pen and gazing at robert in astonishment yes sir said robert enjoying his surprise i will tell you how i got it so the story was told with a modest reserve as to his own courage but still showing without his intending it how nobly he had behaved give me your hand robert said mr paine cordially you have shown yourself a hero we shall be proud of your company to tea tomorrow evening robert flushed with gratification at the high compliment conveyed in these words what did he care then for halbert davis and his petty malice he had the approval of his own conscience the good opinion of those whom he most respected and a provision against want sufficient to avert all present anxiety there is one thing more mr paine he added its about the boat will was kind enough to lend me have you seen the carpenter about repairing it yes sir and he will attend to it as soon as he can spare the time but that was not what i wanted to say i think i ought to bear the expense of repairing it i would have spoken about it at first but then i had no money and didnt know when i should have any will you be kind enough to take as much of my money as will be needed to pay mr planes bill when it comes in certainly not robert it was not your fault that the boat was injured it wouldnt have happened if i had not borrowed it it isnt right that the expense should fall on you dont trouble yourself about that robert i am able and willing to pay it it is very honorable in you to make the offer and i like you the better for having made it wont you need any of this money for present expenses perhaps i had better take the thirtyfive dollars mother may be in want of something robert received back the sum named and returned home much pleased with his interview about seven oclock sitting at the window of the little cottage he saw hester paine opening the front gate he sprang to his feet and opened the door goodevening robert she said is your mother at home yes hester wont you come in thank you robert father has been telling me what a hero you were and it made me feel proud that you were a friend of mine roberts face lighted with pleasure you compliment me more than i deserve he answered modestly but it gives me great pleasure to know that you think well of me i am sure that there is no boy in millville that would have dared to do such a thing goodevening mrs rushton are you not proud of your son he is a good son to me said mrs rushton with a glance of affection it is such a splendid thing he did he will be quite a hero indeed he is one already ive got a new york paper giving an account of the whole thing i brought it over thinking you might like to read it she displayed a copy of a great city daily in which full justice was done to roberts bravery our hero listened with modest pleasure while it was being read i dont deserve all that he said you must let us judge of that said hester but i have come this evening mrs rushton to ask you to take tea with us tomorrow evening you and robert you will come wont you mrs rushton was pleased with this mark of attention and after a slight demur accepted i do not intend to give an account of the next evening and how robert in particular enjoyed it that can be imagined as well as halberts chagrin when he heard of the attention his rival was receiving in a quarter where he himself so earnestly desired to stand well i must pass on to a communication received by mrs rushton a communication of a very unexpected character which had an important effect upon the fortunes of our hero chapter xix the message from the sea it was not often that mrs rushton received a letter neither she nor her husband had possessed many relatives and such as either had were occupied with their own families and little communication passed between them and captain rushtons family robert therefore seldom called at the post office one day however as he stepped in by a neighbors request to inquire for letters for the latter the postmaster said theres a letter for your mother robert is there said our hero surprised when did it come yesterday i was going to ask some one to carry it round to her as you dont often call here he handed the letter to robert who surveyed it with curiosity it was postmarked boston and addressed in a bold business hand to mrs captain rushton millville who can be writing to mother from boston thought robert the size of the letter also excited his curiosity there were two stamps upon it and it appeared bulky robert hurried home and rushed into the kitchen where his mother was at work heres a letter for you mother he said a letter for me repeated mrs rushton from boston i dont know who would be likely to write me from there open it for me robert he tore open the envelope it contained two inclosures one a letter in the same handwriting as the address the other a large sheet of foolscap rumpled up and appearing once to have been rolled up was written in pencil mrs rushton had no sooner looked at the latter than she exclaimed in agitation robert it is your fathers handwriting read it to me i am too agitated to make it out robert was equally excited was his father still alive or was this letter a communication from the dead first let me read the other he said it will explain about this his mother sank back into a chair too weak with agitation to stand while her son rapidly read the following letter boston august mrs rushton dear madam the fate of our ship norman which left this port now more than two years since under the command of your husband has until now been veiled in uncertainty we had given up all hopes of obtaining any light upon the circumstances of its loss when by a singular chance information was brought us yesterday the ship argo while in the south pacific picked up a bottle floating upon the surface of the water on opening it it was found to contain two communications one addressed to us the other to you the latter to be forwarded to you by us ours contains the particulars of the loss of the norman and doubtless your own letter also contains the same particulars there is a bare possibility that your husband is still alive but as so long a period has passed since the letters were written it would not be well to place too much confidence in such a hope but even if captain rushton is dead it will be a sad satisfaction to you to receive from him this last communication and learn the particulars of his loss we lose no time in forwarding to you the letter referred to and remain with much sympathy yours respectfully winslow co mrs rushton listened to this letter with eager and painful interest her hands clasped and her eyes fixed upon robert now read your fathers letter she said in a low tone robert unfolded the sheet and his eyes filled with tears as he gazed upon the wellknown handwriting of the father whose loss he had so long lamented this letter too we transcribe november my dear wife and son whether these lines will ever meet your eyes i know not whether i will be permitted again to look upon your dear faces i also am ignorant the good ship norman in which i sailed from boston not quite three months ago is burned to the waters edge and i find myself with five of the sailors afloat on the vast sea at the mercy of the elements and with a limited supply of food the chances are against our ever seeing land hundreds of miles away from any known shores our only hope of safety is in attracting the attention of some vessel in the broad pathways of the ocean such a chance is doubtful fortunately i have a few sheets of paper and a pencil with me and i write these lines knowing well how improbable it is that you will ever read them yet it is a satisfaction to do what i can to let you know the position in which i stand but for the revengeful and malignant disposition of one man i should still be walking the deck of the norman as its captain but to my story my first mate was a man named haley benjamin haley whose name you will perhaps remember he was born in our neighborhood or at all events once lived there being the nephew of old paul nichols he was a wild young man and bore a bad reputation finally he disappeared and as it seems embraced the profession of a sailor i was not prepossessed in his favor and was not very well pleased to find him my second in command however he was regularly engaged and it was of no use for me to say anything against him i think however that he suspected the state of my feelings as while studiously polite i did not make an effort to be cordial at any rate he must have taken a dislike to me early in the voyage though whether at that time he meditated evil i cannot say after a time i found that he was disposed to encroach upon my prerogatives as captain of the vessel and issue commands which he knew to be in defiance of my wishes you can imagine that i would not pass over such conduct unnoticed i summoned him to an interview and informed him in decided terms that i must be master in my own ship he said little but i saw from his expression that there could thereafter be no amicable relations between us i pass over the days that succeeded days in which haley went to the furthest verge of insolence that he felt would be safe at length carried away by impatience i reprimanded him publicly he grew pale with passion turned on his heel and strode away that night i was roused from my sleep by the cry of fire i sprang to my feet and took immediate measures to extinguish the flames but the incendiary had taken care to do his work so well that it was already impossible i did not at first miss haley until inquiring for him i learned that he was missing and one of the ships boats it was evident that he had deliberately fired the ship in order to revenge himself upon me his hatred must have been extreme or he would not have been willing to incur so great a risk though he escaped from the ship his position in an open boat must be extremely perilous when all hope of saving the ship was abandoned we manned the remaining boats hastily putting in each such a stock of provisions as we could carry without overloading the boats twentyfour hours have now passed and we are still tossing about on the ocean a storm would be our destruction at this solemn time my dear wife my thoughts turn to you and my dear son whom i am likely never to see again there is one thing most of all which i wish you to know but can hardly hope that these few lines will reach you just before i left home on my present voyage i deposited five thousand dollars with mr davis the superintendent of the factory in trust for you in case i should not return you will be surprised to learn that i have so much money it has been the accumulation of years and was intended as a provision for you and robert i have no reason to doubt the integrity of mr davis yet i wish i had acquainted you with the fact of this deposit and placed his written acknowledgment in your hands my reason for concealment was that i might surprise you at the end of this voyage when this letter comes to hand if it ever should come to hand in case the superintendent has not accounted to you for the money placed in his hands let robert go to him and claim the money in my name but i can hardly believe this to be necessary should i never return i am persuaded that mr davis will be true to the trust i have reposed in him and come forward like an honest man to your relief and now my dear wife and son farewell my hope is weak that i shall ever again see you yet it is possible may heaven bless you and permit us to meet again in another world if not in this i shall inclose this letter and one to my owners in a bottle which i have by me and commit it to the sea trusting that the merciful waves may waft it to the shore here captain rushton signed his name the feelings with which robert read and his mother listened to this letter were varied love and pity for the husband and father now doubtless long dead were blended with surprise at the revelation of the deposit made in the hands of the superintendent of the mill mother said robert did you know anything of this money father speaks of no said mrs rushton he never told me it is strange that mr davis has never informed us of it two years have passed and we have long given him up as lost mother said robert it is my opinion that he never intends to let us know i cannot believe he would be so dishonorable but why should he keep back the knowledge he knows that we are poor and need the money but he has the reputation of an honorable man many have had that reputation who do not deserve it said robert the temptation must have proved too strong for him what shall we do i know what i am going to do said robert resolutely i am going to his house and shall claim restitution of the money which father intrusted to him he has had it two years and with the interest it will amount to nearer six than five thousand dollars it will be a fortune mother dont be hasty or impetuous robert said his mother speak to him respectfully i shall be civil if he is said robert he took his cap and putting it on left the cottage and walked with a quick pace to the house of the superintendent chapter xx a disageeeable surprise mr davis was seated in his office but it was his own personal affairs rather than the business of the factory that engaged his attention he was just in receipt of a letter from his broker in new york stating that there were but slender chances of a rise in the price of some securities in which he had invested heavily he was advised to sell out at once in order to guard against a probable further depreciation this was far from satisfactory since an immediate sale would involve a loss of nearly a thousand dollars mr davis felt despondent and in consequence irritable it was at this moment that one of the factory hands came in and told him that robert rushton wished to see him the superintendent would have refused an interview but for one consideration he thought that our hero was about to beg to be taken back into his employ this request he intended to refuse and enjoyed in advance the humiliation of young rushton goodmorning sir said robert removing his hat on entering i suppose you want to be taken back said the superintendent abruptly no sir said robert i have come on quite a different errand mr davis was disappointed he was cheated of his expected triumph moreover looking into our young heros face he saw that he was entirely selfpossessed and had by no means the air of one about to ask a favor then state your business at once he said roughly my time is too valuable to be taken up by trifles my business is important to both of us said robert we have just received a letter from my father the superintendent started and turned pale this was the most unwelcome intelligence he could have received he supposed of course that captain rushton was alive and likely to reclaim the sum which he was in no position to surrender your father he stammered where is he i thought he was dead i am afraid he is said robert soberly then how can you just have received a letter from him demanded mr davis recovering from his momentary dismay the letter was inclosed in a bottle which was picked up in the south pacific and brought to the owners of the vessel my fathers ship was burned to the waters edge and at the time of writing the letter he was afloat on the ocean with five of his sailors in a small boat how long ago was this i mean when was the letter dated nearly two years ago in the november after he sailed then of course he must have perished said the superintendent with a feeling of satisfaction however i suppose your mother is glad to have heard from him is that all you have to tell me no sir said robert looking boldly in the face of his former employer my father added in his letter that just before sailing he deposited with you the sum of five thousand dollars to be given to my mother in case he never returned so the worst had come the dead had revealed the secret which the superintendent hoped would never be known he was threatened with ruin he had no means of paying the deposit unless by sacrificing all his property and it was doubtful whether even then he would be able wholly to make it up if robert possessed his acknowledgment he would have no defense to make this he must ascertain before committing himself supposing this story to be true he said in a halfsneering tone you are of course prepared to show me my receipt for the money that my father carried away with him he did not send it with the letter all the superintendents confidence returned he no longer felt afraid since all evidence of the deposit was doubtless at the bottom of the sea with the illfated captain he resolved to deny the trust altogether rushton he said i have listened patiently to what you had to say and in return i answer that in the whole course of my life i have never known of a more barefaced attempt at fraud in this case you have selected the wrong customer what exclaimed robert hardly crediting the testimony of his ears do you mean to deny that my father deposited five thousand dollars with you just before sailing on his last voyage i certainly do and in the most unqualified terms had such been the case do you think i would have kept the knowledge of it from your mother so long after your fathers supposed death there might be reasons for that said robert significantly none of your impertinent insinuations you young rascal said mr davis hotly the best advice i can give you is to say nothing to any one about this extraordinary claim it will only injure you and i shall be compelled to resort to legal measures to punish you for circulating stories calculated to injure my reputation if the superintendent expected to intimidate robert by this menace he was entirely mistaken in the character of our young hero he bore the angry words and threatening glances of his enemy without quailing as resolute and determined as ever mr davis he said if there is no truth in this story do you think my father with death before his eyes would have written it to my mother i have no evidence except your word that any such letter has been received i can show it to you if you desire it in my fathers handwriting we will suppose then for a moment that such a letter has been received and was written by your father i can understand how being about to die and feeling that his family were without provision he should have written such a letter with the intention of giving you a claim upon me whom he no doubt selected supposing me to be a rich man it was not justifiable but something can be excused to a man finding himself in such a position robert was filled with indignation as he listened to this aspersion upon his fathers memory he would not have cared half so much for any insult to himself mr davis he said boldly it is enough for you to cheat my mother out of the money which my father left her but when you accuse my father of fraud you go too far you know better than any one that everything which he wrote is true the superintendent flushed under the boys honest scorn and unable to defend himself truthfully he worked himself into a rage what do you dare insult me in my own office he exclaimed half rising from his desk and glaring at our hero out of my sight at once or i may be tempted to strike you before i leave you mr davis said robert undauntedly i wish you to tell me finally whether you deny the deposit referred to in my fathers letter and i tell you once for all exclaimed the superintendent angrily if you dont get out of my office i will kick you out i will leave you now said our hero not intimidated but you have not heard the last of me i will not rest until i see justice done to my mother so saying he walked deliberately from the office leaving mr davis in a state of mind no means comfortable true the receipt had doubtless gone to the bottom of the sea with the illfated captain and as no one was cognizant of the transaction probably no claim could be enforced against his denial but if the letter should be shown as robert would doubtless be inclined to do he was aware that however the law might decide popular opinion would be against him and his reputation would be ruined this was an unpleasant prospect as the superintendent valued his character besides the five thousand dollars were gone and not likely to be recovered had they still been in his possession that would have been some compensation chapter xxi a denial robert left the superintendents office in deep thought he understood very well that it would be impossible to enforce his claim without more satisfactory testimony than his fathers letter if any one had been cognizant of the transaction between mr davis and his father it would have helped matters but no one so far as he knew was even aware that his father had possessed so large a sum as five thousand dollars had captain rushton inclosed the receipt that would have been sufficient but it had probably gone to the bottom with him but after all was it certain that his father was dead it was not certain but our hero was forced to admit that the chances of his fathers being alive were extremely slender finding himself utterly at a loss he resolved to call upon his firm friend squire paine the lawyer going to his office he was fortunate enough to find him in and unengaged goodmorning robert said the lawyer pleasantly goodmorning sir you find me a frequent visitor always welcome was the pleasant reply you know i am your banker and it is only natural for you to call upon me yes sir said robert smiling but it is on different business that i have come to consult you this morning go on i will give you the best advice in my power the lawyer listened with surprise to the story robert had to tell this is certainly a strange tale he said after a pause but a true one said robert hastily i do not question that it affords another illustration of the old saying that truth is stranger than fiction that a letter committed to the deep so many thousand miles away should have finally reached its destination is very remarkable i may say providential do you think there is any chance of my father being yet alive there is a bare chance but i cannot encourage you to place much reliance upon it if he had been picked up by any vessel i suppose he would have written you would doubtless have seen him at home before this time in that case still there might be circumstances added the lawyer slowly that would prevent his communicating with friends at home for instance his boat might have drifted to some uninhabited island out of the course of ordinary navigation i dont say it is at all probable but there is such a probability is there any chance of making mr davis return the money my father deposited with him there again there are difficulties he may demand the return of his receipt or he may continue to deny the trust altogether wont the letter prove anything it may produce a general conviction that such a deposit was made since admitting the letter to be genuine no one considering especially the character of your father can readily believe that in the immediate presence of death he would make any such statement unless thoroughly reliable but moral conviction and legal proof are quite different things unless that receipt is produced i dont see that anything can be done perhaps my father might have put that in a bottle also at a later date he might have done so when he became satisfied that there was no chance of a rescue but even supposing him to have done it the chances are ten to one that it will never find its way to your mother the reception of the first letter was almost a miracle i have no doubt you are right mr paine said robert but it seems very hard that my poor fathers hard earnings should go to such an unprincipled man and my mother be left destitute that is true robert but i am obliged to say that your only hope is in awakening mr davis to a sense of justice there isnt much chance of that said robert shaking his head if you will leave the matter in my hands i will call upon him tonight and see what i can do i shall feel very glad if you will do so squire paine i dont want to leave anything undone then i will do so i dont imagine it will do any good but we can but try robert left the office making up his mind to await the report of the lawyers visit before moving further that evening the lawyer called at the house of the superintendent mrs davis and halbert were in the room after a little unimportant conversation he said mr davis may i ask the favor of a few minutes conversation with you in private certainly said the superintendent quite in the dark as to the business which had called his guest to the house he led the way into another room and both took seats i may as well say to begin with commenced the lawyer that i call in behalf of the family of the late captain rushton the superintendent started nervously that boy has lost no time he muttered to himself i suppose you understand what i have to say i presume i can guess said the superintendent coldly the boy came into my office this morning and made a most extraordinary claim which i treated with contempt finding him persistent i ordered him out of my office i need not say that no sane man would for a moment put confidence in such an incredible story or claim i cant quite agree with you there said the lawyer quietly there is nothing incredible about the story it is remarkable i grant but such things have happened before and will again i suppose you refer to the picking up of the bottle at sea yes i fail to see what there is incredible about it if the handwriting can be identified as that of the late captain rushton and robert says both his mother and himself recognized it the story becomes credible and will meet with general belief i thought you were too sensible and practical a man said the superintendent sneering to be taken in by so palpable a humbug why it reads like a romance in spite of all that it may be true enough returned the lawyer composedly you may believe it if you please it seems to me quite unworthy of belief waiving that point robert doubtless acquainted you with the statement made in the letter that captain rushton just before sailing on his last voyage deposited with you five thousand dollars what have you to say to that what have i to say returned the superintendent that captain rushton never possessed five thousand dollars in his life i dont believe he possessed one quarter of the sum what authority have you for saying that did he make you his confidant asked the lawyer keenly yes said the superintendent promptly when last at home he called at my house one day and in the course of conversation remarked that sailors seldom saved any money for instance said he i have followed the sea for many years and have many times resolved to accumulate a provision for my wife and child but as yet i have scarcely done more than to begin he then told me that he had little more than a thousand dollars but meant to increase that if possible during his coming voyage to this statement squire paine listened attentively fully believing it to be an impromptu fabrication as it really was did he say anything about what he had done with this thousand dollars or more he asked a part he left for his wife to draw from time to time for expenses the rest i suppose he took with him mr paine sat silent for a moment things looked unpromising he couldnt but acknowledge for his young client in the absence of legal proof and with an adroit and unscrupulous antagonist whose interests were so strongly enlisted in defeating justice it was difficult to see what was to be done i understand then mr davis he said finally that you deny the justice of this claim certainly i do said the superintendent it is a palpable fraud this boy is a precocious young swindler and will come to a bad end i have a different opinion of him you are deceived in him then i have no doubt he got up the letter himself i dont agree with you i have seen the letter it is in captain rushtons handwriting moreover i have seen the letter of the owners which accompanied it the superintendent was in a tight place and he knew it but there was nothing to do but to persist in his denial then i can only say that captain rushton was a party to the fraud he said you must be aware mr davis that when the public learns the facts in the case the general belief will be the other way i cant help that said the other doggedly whatever the public chooses to think i wont admit the justice of this outrageous claim then i have only to bid you goodevening said the lawyer coldly affecting not to see the hand which the superintendent extended the latter felt the slight and foresaw that from others he must expect similar coldness but there was no help for it to restore the money would be ruin he had entered into the path of dishonesty and he was forced to keep on in it chapter xxii roberts new project mr paine called at mrs rushtons cottage and communicated the particulars of his interview with the superintendent it is evident he said that mr davis is swayed by his interests and feeling legally secure prefers to defraud you rather than to surrender the five thousand dollars i wouldnt have believed it of mr davis said mrs rushton he is considered such a respectable man i have heard rumors that he is dabbling in speculations and i suspect he may find it inconvenient to pay away so large a sum of money he had no right to speculate with my mothers money said robert indignantly you are right there he should have invested it securely mr paine said robert after a pause i have an idea that father is still living and that some day i shall find him the lawyer shook his head there is not one chance in ten that he is living he said it is only a fancy of yours it may be but i cant get it out of my head i hope you will prove correct but i need not tell you of the many arguments against such a theory i know them all but still i believe he is living mr paine continued robert earnestly i feel so strongly on the subject that with my mothers permission i mean to go out into the world in search of him i must say robert said mr paine i did not expect such a visionary scheme from a boy of your good sense you must see yourself how wild it is i know it said our hero but i want to take a year at any rate to see the world if at the end of that time i discover no trace of my father i will come home content but what will become of your mother during that time i will leave four hundred dollars in your hands for her the rest i will draw for my own uses but you dont expect to travel round the world on two hundred dollars surely said the lawyer i shall work my way as far as i can said robert i cant afford to travel as a gentleman suppose you find yourself without money in a foreign land i am not afraid i am willing to work and i can make my way surely mrs rushton you do not approve roberts scheme said mr paine but to his surprise he found that mrs rushton was inclined to regard it favorably she seemed to share roberts belief that her husband was still living and that robert could find him she was not a woman in the habit of reasoning and had no conception of the difficulties in his way the money left behind in the hands of mr paine supplemented by her own earnings would be enough to maintain her for two years and this thought made her easy for she had a great dread of poverty and destitution when the lawyer found how mrs rushton felt on the subject he ceased his objections to the plan for though he had no confidence in our young heros success in the object he had in view he thought that a years tour might benefit him by extending his knowledge of the world and increasing his selfreliance how soon do you wish to start robert he asked it will take me a week to get your clothes ready said mrs rushton then by a week from monday i will start said robert have you formed any definite plans about the manner of going i will go to new york first and call on the gentleman who got up the subscription for me i will tell him my story and ask his advice the most sensible thing you could do as to the money i will have that ready for you of course you will call on me before you go the superintendent had made up his mind that robert would spread the report of the deposit and nervously awaited the result but to his relief he observed no change in the demeanor of his fellowtownsmen he could only conclude that for reasons of his own the boy he had wronged had concluded to defer the exposure next he heard with a feeling of satisfaction that robert had decided to go abroad in quest of his father he had no doubt that captain rushton was dead and regarded the plan as utterly quixotic and foolish but still he felt glad that it had been undertaken if the boy never comes back i shant mourn much he said to himself his mother is a weak woman who will never give me any trouble but this young rascal has a strong and resolute will and i shall feel more comfortable to have him out of the way when robert got ready to leave he made a farewell call on the lawyer and drew two hundred dollars of his money i dont know but one hundred will do he said perhaps i ought to leave five hundred for my mother you carry little enough robert dont have any anxiety about your mother i will not see her suffer robert grasped his hand in earnest gratitude how can i thank you he said you need not thank me i had a warm regard for your father and shall be glad to help your mother if there is any occasion not only this but if in your wanderings you find yourself in a tight place and in want of help write to me and i will help you you are a true friend said robert gratefully i wish my father had intrusted his money to you instead of to the superintendent i wish he had as matters have turned out i should have taken care that your interests did not suffer oh exclaimed robert fervently if i could only find my father and bring him home to confront this false friend and convict him of his base fraud i believe i would willingly give ten years of my life that question can only be solved by time i too should earnestly rejoice if such an event could be brought about and now robert goodby and heaven bless you dont forget that you can count always on my friendship and assistance on the way home robert fell in with halbert davis halbert of course knew nothing of the claim made upon his father but he had heard that robert proposed to leave home he was both sorry and glad on account of this sorry because he had hoped to see our hero fall into poverty and destitution and enjoy the spectacle of his humiliation now he was afraid robert would succeed and deprive him of the enjoyment he had counted upon on the other hand roberts departure would leave the field free so far as concerned hester paine and he hoped to win the favor of that young lady in the absence of any competitor of this there was not the slightest chance but halbert was blinded by his own vanity to the obvious dislike which hester entertained for him now when he saw robert approaching he couldnt forego the pleasure of a final taunt so youre going to leave town rushton he commenced yes davis answered robert in the same tone shall you miss me much i guess i shall live through it said halbert i suppose you are going because you cant make a living here not exactly however i hope to do better elsewhere if youre going to try for a place youd better not mention that you got turned out of the factory you neednt apply to my father for a recommendation i shant need any recommendation from your father said robert he is about the last man that i would apply to thats where you are right said halbert what sort of a place are you going to try for he knew nothing of roberts intention to seek his father but supposed he meant to obtain a situation in hew york you seem particularly interested in my movements davis call me mr davis if you please said halbert haughtily when you call me mr rushton i will return the compliment you are impertinent not more so than you are you dont seem to realize the difference in our positions no i dont except that i prefer my own disgusted with roberts evident determination to withhold the respect which he considered his due halbert tried him on another tack have you bidden farewell to hester paine he asked with a sneer yes said robert i suppose she was very much affected continued halbert she said she was very sorry to part with me i admire her taste you would admire it more if she had a higher appreciation of you i shall be good friends with her when you are no longer here to slander me to her i am not quite so mean as that said robert if she chooses to like you i shant try to prevent it i ought to be very much obliged to you i am sure you neednt trouble yourself to be grateful returned robert coolly but i must bid you goodby as i have considerable to do dont let me detain you said halbert with an elaborate share of politeness i wonder why halbert hates me so much he thought i dont like him but i dont wish him any harm he looked with satisfaction upon a little cornelian ring which he wore upon one of his fingers it was of very trifling value but it was a parting gift from hester and as such he valued it far above its cost chapter xxiii a dishonest baggagesmasher on the next monday morning robert started for the city at the moment of parting he began to realize that he had undertaken a difficult task his life hitherto had been quiet and free from excitement now he was about to go out into the great world and fight his own way with only two hundred dollars in his pocket he was going in search of a father who when last heard from was floating in an open boat on the south pacific the probabilities were all against that fathers being still alive if he were he had no clew to his present whereabouts all this robert thought over as he was riding in the cars to the city he acknowledged that the chances were all against his success but in spite of all he had a feeling for which he could not account that his father was still living and that he should find him some day at any rate there was something attractive in the idea of going out to unknown lands to meet unknown adventures and so his momentary depression was succeeded by a return of his old confidence arrived in the city he took his carpetbag in his hand and crossing the street walked at random not being familiar with the streets as he had not been in new york but twice before and that some time since i dont know where to go thought robert i wish i knew where to find some cheap hotel just then a boy in wellventilated garments and a rimless straw hat with a blacking box over his shoulder approached shine your boots mister he asked robert glanced at his shoes which were rather deficient in polish and finding that the expense would be only five cents told him to go ahead ill give you the bulliest shine you ever had said the ragamuffin thats right go ahead said robert when the boy got through he cast a speculative glance at the carpetbag smash yer baggage le asked whats that carry yer bag do you know of any good cheap hotel where i can put up asked robert european hotel said the urchin accenting the second syllable what kind of a hotel is that you take a room and get your grub where you like yes that will suit me ill show you one and take yer bag along for two shillings all right said our hero go ahead the boy shouldered the carpetbag and started in advance robert following he found a considerable difference between the crowded streets of new york and the quiet roads of millville his spirits rose and he felt that life was just beginning for him brave and bold by temperament he did not shrink from trying his luck on a broader arena than was afforded by the little village whence he came such confidence is felt by many who eventually fail but robert was one who combined ability and willingness to work with confidence and the chances were in favor of his succeeding unused to the city streets robert was a little more cautious about crossing than the young arab who carried his bag so at one broad thoroughfare the latter got safely across while robert was still on the other side waiting for a good opportunity to cross in turn the bootblack seeing that communication was for the present cut off by a long line of vehicles was assailed by a sudden temptation for his services as porter he would receive but twentyfive cents while here was an opportunity to appropriate the entire bag which must be far more valuable he was not naturally a bad boy but his street education had given him rather loose ideas on the subject of property obeying his impulse then he started rapidly bag in hand up a side street hold on there where are you going called out robert he received no answer but saw the baggagesmasher quickening his pace and dodging round the corner he attempted to dash across the street but was compelled to turn back after being nearly run over i wish i could get hold of the young rascal he exclaimed indignantly who do you mane johnny asked a boy at his side a boy has run off with my carpetbag said robert i know him its jim malone do you know where i can find him asked robert eagerly if youll help me get back my bag ill give you a dollar ill do it then come along of me heres a chance to cross following his new guide robert dashed across the street at some risk and found himself safe on the other side now where do you think hes gone demanded robert its likely hell go home do you know where he lives no mulberry street has he got any father and mother hes got a mother but the ould womans drunk most all the time then she wont care about his stealing no shell think hes smart then well go there is it far not more than twenty minutes the boy was right jim steered for home not being able to open the bag in the street without suspicion his intention was to appropriate a part of the clothing to his own use and dispose of the rest to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer who as long as he got a good bargain would not be too particular about inquiring into the customers right to the property he did not however wholly escape suspicion he was stopped by a policeman who demanded whose bag is that johnny it belongs to a gentleman that wants it carried to the st nicholas answered jim promptly where is the gentleman hes took a car to wall street on business how came he to trust you with the bag wasnt he afraid youd steal it oh he knows me ive smashed baggage for him moren once this might be true at any rate it was plausible and the policeman having no ground of detention suffered him to go on congratulating himself on getting off so well jim sped on his way and arrived in quick time at the miserable room in mulberry street which he called home his mother lay on a wretched bed in the corner half stupefied with drink she lifted up her head as her son entered what have you there jimmy she asked its a bag mother whose is it its mine now and where did ye get it a boy gave it to me to carry to a chape hotel so i brought it home this is a chape hotel isnt it youre a smart boy an i always said it jimmy let me open it and the old woman with considerable alacrity rose to her feet and came to jims side ill open it myself mother that is i if i had a kay havent you got one i have that same i picked up a bunch of kays in the strate last week she fumbled in her pocket and drew out half a dozen keys of different sizes attached to a steel ring bully for you old woman said jim give em here let me open the bag said mrs malone persuasively no you dont said her dutiful son taint none of yours its mine the kays is mine said his mother and ill kape em give em here said jim finding a compromise necessary and ill give you fifty cents out of what i get thats the way to talk darlint said his mother approvingly you wouldnt have the heart to chate your ould mother out of her share its better i did said jim youll only get drunk on the money shure a little drink will do me no harm said mrs malone meanwhile the young arab had tried key after key until he found one that fitted the bag flew open and roberts humble stock of clothing lay exposed to view there was a woolen suit four shirts half a dozen collars some stockings and handkerchiefs besides these there was the little bible which robert had had given him by his father just before he went on his last voyage it was the only book our hero had room for but in the adventurous career upon which he had entered exposed to perils of the sea and land he felt that he would need this as his constant guide them shirtsll fit me said jim i guess ill kape em and the close besides then wherell you git the money for me asked his mother ill sell the handkerchiefs and stockings i dont nade them said jim whose ideas of full dress fell considerably short of the ordinary standard i wont nade the collars either you dont nade all the shirts said his mother ill kape two said jim itll make me look respectable maybe ill kape two collars so i can sit up for a gentleman of fashion youll be too proud to walk with your ould mother said mrs malone maybe i will said jim surveying his mother critically you aint much of a beauty ould woman i was a purty gal once said mrs malone but hard work and bad luck has wore on me the whiskys had something to do with it said jim hard work didnt make your face so red is it my own boy talks to me like that said the old woman wiping her eyes on her dress but her sorrow was quickly succeeded by a different emotion as the door opened suddenly and robert rushton entered the room chapter xxiv a good beginning jim started to his feet at the sight of the equally unwelcome and unexpected visitor his mother ignorant that she saw before her the owner of the bag supposed it might be a customer wanting some washing done goodmorning sir said she and have yez business with me no said robert i have business with your son if thats he shure hes my son and a smart bye he is too hes a little too smart sometimes returned our hero i gave him my carpetbag to carry this morning and he ran away with it mrs malones face fell at this unexpected intelligence shur an it was a mistake of his she said hes too honest entirely to stale the value of a pin let alone a carpetbag meanwhile jim was rapidly reviewing the situation he was not naturally bad but he had fallen a victim to sudden temptation he was ashamed and determined to make amends by a frank confession my mother is wrong he said i meant to kape it and im sorry heres the bag wid nothing taken out of it thats right to own up said robert favorably impressed with his frank confession give me the bag and itll be all right i suppose you were poor and that tempted you i am poor too and couldnt afford to lose it but id rather starve than steal and i hope you will not be dishonest again i wont said jim stoutly ill go with you now to a chape hotel and wont charge you nothin ive got a boy downstairs who will take it dont forget what you said just now no i wont said jim shure if id known what a bully young gentleman you was i wouldnt have took it on no account so robert descended the stairs having by his forbearance probably effected a moral reformation in jim and confirmed in him the good principles which in spite of his mothers bad example had already taken root in his heart if the community while keeping vigilant watch over the young outcasts that throng our streets plying their petty avocations would not always condemn but encourage them sometimes to a better life the results would soon appear in the diminution of the offenses for which they are most frequently arrested his new guide shouldered roberts carpetbag and conducted him to a hotel of good standing managed on the european system dismissing the boy with the promised reward robert went up to his room on the fifth floor and after attending to his toilet sallied out into the street and made his way to the warehouse of the merchant who had been instrumental in raising the fund for him mr morgan is engaged said a clerk to whom he spoke i will wait for him if you please said robert is it any business that i can attend to asked the clerk no i wish to see mr morgan himself mr morgan was engaged with two gentlemen and our hero was obliged to wait nearly half an hour at the end of that time the merchant consented to see him he did not at first recognize him but said inquiringly well my young friend from whom do you come i come from no one sir have you business with me you do not remember me mr morgan do you remember when the cars came so near running off the track a short time since at millville certainly i do said mr morgan heartily and i now remember you as the brave boy who saved all our lives you gave me your card and told me i might call on you to be sure i did and i am very glad to see you you must go home and dine with me today thank you sir for your kind invitation this is my address said the merchant writing it in pencil and handing it to robert we dine at halfpast six you had better be at the door at six we will then talk over your plans for i suppose you have some and i will do what i can to promote them at present i am busy and am afraid i must ask you to excuse me thank you sir said robert gratefully he left the office not a little elated at his favorable reception mr morgan judging from his place of business must be a man of great wealth and could no doubt be of essential service to him what was quite as important he seemed disposed to help him thats a good beginning thought robert i wish mother knew how well i have succeeded so far ill just write and let her know that i have arrived safe tomorrow perhaps i shall have better news to tell he went back to his hotel and feeling hungry made a substantial meal he found the restaurants moderate in price and within his means six oclock found him ringing the bell of a handsome brownstone house on fifth avenue though not disposed to be shy he felt a little embarrassed as the door opened and a servant in livery stood before him is mr morgan at home inquired robert yes sir said the servant glancing speculatively at the neat but coarse garments of our hero he invited me to dine with him said robert wont you walk in sir said the servant with another glance of wild surprise at the dress of the dinner guest if youll walk in here opening the door of a sumptuously furnished parlor i will announce you what name shall i say robert rushton robert entered the parlor and sat down on a sofa he looked around him with a little pardonable curiosity for he had never before been in an elegant city mansion i wonder whether i shall ever be rich enough to live like this he thought the room though elegant was dark and to our hero who was used to bright sunny rooms it seemed a little gloomy he mentally decided that he would prefer a plain country house not so plain indeed as the little cottage where his mother lived but as nice perhaps as the superintendents house which was the finest in the village and the most magnificent he had until this time known its glories were wholly eclipsed by the house he was in but robert thought he would prefer it while he was looking about him mr morgan entered and his warm and cordial manner made his boy guest feel quite at his ease i must make you acquainted with my wife and children he said they have heard of you and are anxious to see you mrs morgan gave robert a reception as warm as her husband had done so this is the young hero of whom i have heard she said i am afraid you give me too much credit said robert modestly this modest disclaimer produced a still more favorable impression upon both mr and mrs morgan i do not propose to speak in detail of the dinner that followed the merchant and his wife succeeded in making robert feel entirely at home and he displayed an ease and selfpossession wholly free from boldness that won their good opinion when the dinner was over mr morgan commenced now robert dinner being over let us come to business tell me your plans and i will consider how i can promote them in reply robert communicated the particulars already known to the reader of his fathers letter his own conviction of his still living and his desire to go in search of him i am afraid you will be disappointed said the merchant in the object of your expedition it may however be pleasant for you to see something of the world and luckily it is in my power to help you i have a vessel which sails for calcutta early next week you shall go as a passenger couldnt i go as cabinboy asked robert i am afraid the price of a ticket will be beyond my means i think not said the merchant smiling since you will go free as you do not propose to follow the sea it will not be worth while to go as cabinboy besides it interfere with your liberty to leave the vessel whenever you deemed it desirable in order to carry on your search for your father you are very kind mr morgan said robert gratefully so i ought to be and mean to be said the merchant you know i am in your debt we pass over the few and simple preparations which robert made for his long voyage in these he was aided by mrs morgan who sent on board without his knowledge a trunk containing a complete outfit considerably better than the contents of the humble carpetbag he had brought from home he didnt go on board till the morning on which the ship was to sail he went down into the cabin and did not come up until the ship had actually started coming on deck he saw a figure which seemed familiar to him from his dress and the commands he appeared to be issuing robert judged that it was the mate he tried to think where he could have met him when the mate turned full around and alike to his surprise and dismay he recognized ben haley whom he had wounded in his successful attempt to rob his uncle chapter xxv a declaration of war if robert was surprised ben haley had even more reason for astonishment he had supposed his young enemy as he chose to consider him quietly living at home in the small village of millville he was far from expecting to meet him on shipboard bound to india there was one difference however between the surprise felt by the two robert was disagreeably surprised but a flash of satisfaction lit up the face of the mate as he realized that the boy who had wounded him was on the same ship and consequently as he supposed in his power how came you here he exclaimed hastily advancing toward robert resenting the tone of authority in which these words were spoken robert answered composedly i walked on board youd better not be impudent young one said ben roughly when you tell me what right you have to question me in that style said robert coolly i will apologize i am the mate of this vessel as you will soon find out so i supposed said robert and you i suppose are the cabinboy change your clothes at once and report for duty robert felt sincerely thankful at that moment that he was not the cabinboy for he foresaw that in that case he would be subjected to brutal treatment from the mate treatment which his subordinate position would make him powerless to resent now as a passenger he felt independent and though it was disagreeable to have the mate for an enemy he did not feel afraid youve made a mistake mr haley said our hero i am not the cabinboy what are you then i am a passenger you are telling a lie we dont take passengers said ben haley determined not to believe that the boy was out of his power if you will consult the captain you may learn your mistake said robert ben haley couldnt help crediting this statement since it would have done robert no good to misrepresent the facts of the case he resolved however to ask the captain about it and inquire how it happened that he had been received as a passenger contrary to the usual custom you will hear from me again he said in a tone of menace robert turned away indifferently so far as appearance went but he couldnt help feeling a degree of apprehension as he thought of the long voyage he was to take in company with his enemy who doubtless would have it in his power to annoy him even if he abstained from positive injury he is a bad man and will injure me if he can he reflected but i think i can take care of myself if i cant i will appeal to the captain meanwhile the mate went up to the captain captain evans said he is that boy a passenger yes mr haley it is something unusual to take passengers is it not yes but this lad is a friend of the owner and mr morgan has given me directions to treat him with particular consideration ben haley was puzzled how did it happen that mr morgan one of the merchant princes of new york had become interested in an obscure country boy i dont understand it he said perplexed i suppose the boy is a relation of mr morgan nothing of the kind he is of poor family from a small country town then you know him i know something of him and his family he is one of the most impudent young rascals i ever met indeed returned the captain surprised from what i have seen of him i have come to quite a different conclusion he has been very gentlemanly and polite to me he can appear so but you will find out sooner or later he has not the slightest regard for truth and will tell the most unblushing falsehoods with the coolest and most matteroffact air i shouldnt have supposed it said captain evans looking over at our hero at the other extremity of the deck appearances are deceitful certainly they are in this case this terminated the colloquy for the time the mate had done what he could to prejudice the captain against the boy he hated not however with entire success captain evans had a mind of his own and did not choose to adopt any mans judgment or prejudices blindly he resolved to watch robert a little more closely than he had done in order to see whether his own observation confirmed the opinion expressed by the mate of the latter he did not know much since this was the first voyage on which they had sailed together but captain evans was obliged to confess that he did not wholly like his first officer he appeared to be a capable seaman and doubtless understood his duties but there was a bold and reckless expression which impressed him unfavorably ben haley on his part had learned something but not much he had ascertained that robert was a protйgй of the owner and was recommended to the special care of the captain but what could be his object in undertaking the present voyage he did not understand he was a little afraid that robert would divulge the not very creditable part he had played at millville and that he might not be believed in that case he had represented him to the captain as an habitual liar after some consideration he decided to change his tactics and induce our hero to believe he was his friend or at least not hostile to him to this he was impelled by two motives first to secure his silence respecting the robbery and next to so far get into his confidence as to draw out of him the object of his present expedition thus he would lull his suspicions to sleep and might thereafter gratify his malice the more securely he accordingly approached our hero and tapped him on the shoulder robert drew away slightly haley saw the movement and hated the boy the more for it well my lad he said i find your story is correct those who know me dont generally doubt my word said robert coldly well i dont know you or at least not intimately said haley and you must confess that i havent the best reasons to like you did you suffer much inconvenience from your wound asked robert not much it proved to be slight you were a bold boy to wing me i could have crushed you easily i suppose you could but you know how i was situated i couldnt run away and desert your uncle i dont know about that you dont understand that little affair i suppose you think i had no right to the gold i took i certainly do think so then you are mistaken my uncle got his money from my grandfather a part should have gone to my mother and consequently to me but he didnt choose to act honestly my object in calling upon him was to induce him to do me justice at last but you know the old man has become a miser and makes money his idol the long and short of it was that as he wouldnt listen to reason i determined to take the law into my own hands and carry off what i thought ought to come to me robert listened to this explanation without putting much faith in it it was not at all according to the story given by mr nichols and he knew moreover that the man before him had passed a wild and dissolute youth i suppose what i did was not strictly legal continued ben haley lightly but we sailors are not much versed in the quips of the law to my thinking law defeats justice about as often as it aids it i dont know very much about law said robert perceiving that some reply was expected thats just my case said ben and the less i have to do with it the better it will suit me i suppose my uncle made a great fuss about the money i carried off yes said robert it was quite a blow to him and he has been nervous ever since for fear you would come back again ben haley shrugged his shoulders and laughed he neednt be afraid i dont want to trouble him but i was bound he shouldnt keep from me what was rightly my due i havent got all i ought to have but i am not a lover of money and i shall let it go i hope you wont go near him again for he got a severe shock the last time when you get back if you get a chance to see him privately you may tell him there is no danger of that i shall be glad to do so said robert i thought i would explain the matter to you continued the mate in an offhand manner for i didnt want you to remain under a false impression so you are going to see a little of the world yes sir i suppose that is your only object no i have another object in view the mate waited to learn what this object was but robert stopped and did not seem inclined to go on well said haley after a slight pause as we are to be together on a long voyage we may as well be friends heres my hand to his surprise robert made no motion to take it mr haley said he i dont like to refuse your hand but when i tell you that i am the son of captain rushton of the ship norman you will understand why i cannot accept your hand ben haley started back in dismay how could robert have learned anything of his treachery to his father had the dead come back from the bottom of the sea to expose him was captain rushton still alive he did not venture to ask but he felt his hatred for robert growing more intense boy he said in a tone of concentrated passion you have done a bold thing in rejecting my hand i might have been your friend think of me henceforth as your relentless enemy he walked away his face dark with the evil passions which roberts slight had aroused in his breast chapter xxvi out on the ocean we must now go back nearly two years five men were floating about in a boat in the southern ocean they looked gaunt and famished for a week they had lived on short allowance and now for two days they had been entirely without food there was in their faces that look wellnigh hopeless which their wretched situation naturally produced for one day also they had been without water and the torments of thirst were worse than the cravings of hunger these men were captain rushton and four sailors of the ship norman whose burning has already been described one of the sailors bunsby was better educated and more intelligent than the rest and the captain spoke to him as a friend and an equal for all the distinctions of rank were broken down by the immediate prospect of a terrible death how is all this going to end bunsby said the captain in a low voice turning from a vain search for some sail in sight and addressing his subordinate i am afraid there is only one way answered bunsby there is not much prospect of our meeting a ship and if we do it is doubtful if we can attract their attention i should like the chance to try i never knew before how much worse thirst is than hunger do you know captain if this lasts much longer i shall be tempted to swallow some of this sea water it will only make matters worse i know it but at least it will moisten my throat the other sailors sat stupid and silent apparently incapable of motion i wish i had a plug of tobacco said one at last if there were any use in wishing id wish myself on shore said the second well never see land again said the third gloomily were bound for davy jones locker id like to see my old mother before i go down said the first ive got a mother too said the third if i could only have a drop of the warm tea such as she used to make shes sitting down to dinner now most likely little thinking that her jack is dying of hunger out here there was a pause and the captain spoke again i wish i knew whether that bottle will ever reach shore when was it we launched it four days since ive got something here i wish i could get to my wife he drew from his pocketbook a small folded paper what is that captain asked bunsby it is my wifes fortune how is that captain that paper is good for five thousand dollars five thousand dollars wouldnt do us much good here it wouldnt buy a pound of bread or a pint of water no but it would i hope it will save my wife and son from suffering just before i sailed on this voyage i took five thousand dollars nearly all my savings to a man in our village to keep till i returned or if i did not return to keep in trust for my wife and child this is the paper he gave me in acknowledgment is he a man you can trust captain i think so it is the superintendent of the factory in our village a man rich or at any rate welltodo he has a good reputation for integrity your wife knew you had left the money in his hands no i meant it as a surprise to her it is a pity you did not leave that paper in her hands what do you mean bunsby asked the captain nervously you dont think this man will betray his trust i cant say captain for i dont know the man but i dont like to trust any man too far captain rushton was silent for a moment there was a look of trouble on his face you make me feel anxious bunsby it is hard enough to feel that i shall probably never again see my wife and child on earth i mean but to think that they may possibly suffer want makes it more bitter the man may be honest captain dont trouble yourself too much i see that i made a mistake i should have left this paper with my wife davis can keep this money and no one will be the wiser it is a terrible temptation particularly if the man is pressed for money i dont think that he is considered a rich man he ought to be one and my money would be only a trifle to him let us hope it is so captain said bunsby who felt that further discussion would do no good and only embitter the last moments of his commander but anxiety did not so readily leave the captain added to the pangs of hunger and the cravings of thirst was the haunting fear that by his imprudence his wife and child would suffer do you think it would do any good bunsby he said after a pause to put this receipt in a bottle as i did the letter no captain it is too great a risk there is not more than one chance in a hundred of its reaching its destination besides suppose you should be picked up and go home without the receipt he might refuse to pay you he would do so at the peril of his life then said the captain fiercely do you think if i were alive i would let any man rob me of the savings of my life other men have done so it would not be safe to try it on me bunsby well captain it is possible that i may perish but you may be saved not much chance of it yet it is possible now if that happens i have a favor to ask of you name it captain i want you if i die first to take this paper and guard it carefully and if you live to get back to take it to millville and see that justice is done to my wife and child i promise that captain but i think we shall die together twentyfour hours passed the little boat still rocked hither and thither on the ocean billows the five faces looked more haggard and there was a wild eager look upon them as they scanned the horizon hoping to see a ship their lips and throats were dry and parched i cant stand it no longer said one it was the sailor i have called jack i shall drink some of the sea water dont do it jack said bunsby youll suffer more than ever i cant said jack desperately and scooping up some water in the hollow of his hand he drank it eagerly again and again he drank with feverish eagerness how is it said the second sailor i feel better said jack my throat so dry then ill take some too the other two sailors unheeding the remonstrances of bunsby and the captain followed the example of jack they felt relief for the moment but soon their torments became unendurable with parched throats gasping for breath they lay back in agony suffering themselves captain rushton and bunsby regarded with pity the greater sufferings of their wretched companions this is horrible said the captain yes said bunsby sadly it cant last much longer now his words were truer than he thought unable to endure his suffering the sailor named jack suddenly staggered to his feet i cant stand it any longer he said wildly goodby boys and before his companions well knew what he intended to do he had leaped over the side of the boat and sunk in the ocean waves there was a thrilling silence as the waters closed over his body then the second sailor also rose to his feet im going after jack he said and he too plunged into the waves the captain rose as if to hinder him but bunsby placed his hand upon his arm its just as well captain we must all come to that and the sooner the more suffering is saved thats so said the other sailor tormented like the other two by thirst aggravated by his draughts of seawater goodby bunsby goodby captain im going he too plunged into the sea and bunsby and the captain were left alone you wont desert me bunsby said the captain no captain i havent swallowed seawater like those poor fellows i can stand it better there is no hope of life said the captain quietly but i dont like to go unbidden into my makers presence nor i ill stand by you captain this is a fearful thing bunsby if it would only rain that would be some relief as if in answer to his wish the drops began to fall slowly at first then more copiously till at last their clothing was saturated and the boat partly filled with water eagerly they squeezed out the welcome dregs from their clothing and felt a blessed relief they filled two bottles they had remaining with the precious fluid if those poor fellows had only waited said the captain they are out of suffering now said bunsby the relief was only temporary and they felt it to be so they were without food and the two bottles of water would not last them long still there was a slight return of hope which survives under the most discouraging circumstances chapter xxvii frank price the ship argonaut bound for calcutta was speeding along with a fair wind when the man at the lookout called boat in sight where away the sailor pointed out a small boat a mile distant nearly in the ships track rising and falling with the billows is there any one in it i see two men lying in the bottom they are motionless they may be dead the boat was soon overtaken it was the boat from the illfated norman captain rushton and bunsby were lying stretched out in the bottom both motionless and apparently without life bunsby was really dead but there was still some life left in the captain which under the care of the surgeon of the ship was carefully husbanded until he was out of immediate danger but his system from the long privation of food had received such a shock that his mind sympathizing with it he fell into a kind of stupor mental and physical and though strength and vigor came slowly back captain rushton was in mind a child oblivion of the past seemed to have come over him he did not remember who he was or that he had a wife and child poor man said the surgeon i greatly fear his mind has completely given way it is a pity some of his friends were not here said the captain of the ship that had rescued him the sight of a familiar face might restore him it is possible but i am not sure of even that is there any clew to his identity i have found none it will at once occur to the reader that the receipt would have supplied the necessary information since it was dated millville and contained the captains name but this was concealed in an inner pocket in captain rushtons vest and escaped the attention of the surgeon so nameless and unknown he was carried to calcutta which he reached without any perceptible improvement in his mental condition arrived at calcutta the question arose what shall we do with him it was a perplexing question since if carried back to new york it might be difficult to identify him there or send him back to his friends besides the care of a man in his condition would be a greater responsibility than most shipmasters would care to undertake it was at this crisis that a largehearted and princely american merchant resident in calcutta who had learned the particulars of the captains condition came forward saying leave him here i will find him a home in some suitable boardinghouse and defray such expenses as may be required god has blessed me with abundant means it is only right that i should employ a portion in his service i hope under good treatment he may recover wholly and be able to tell me who he is and where is his home when that is ascertained if his health is sufficiently good i will send him home at my own expense the offer was thankfully accepted and the generous merchant was as good as his word a home was found for captain rushton in the boardinghouse of mrs start a widow who thrown upon her own exertions for support had by the help of the merchant already referred to opened a boardinghouse which was now quite remunerative he will require considerable care mrs start said mr perkins the merchant but i am ready and willing to compensate you for all the trouble to which you are put will you take him certainly i will said the warmhearted widow if only because you ask it but for you i should not be earning a comfortable living with a little money laid up in the bank besides thank you mrs start said the merchant i know the poor man could be in no better hands but you mustnt let any considerations of gratitude interfere with your charging a fair price for your trouble i am able and willing to pay whatever is suitable i dont believe we shall quarrel on that point said the widow smiling i will do all i can for your friend what is his name that i dont know we shall have to call him something call him smith then that will answer till we find out his real name as we may some day when his mind comes back as i hope it may from that time therefore captain rushton was known as mr smith he recovered in a considerable degree his bodily health but mentally he remained in the same condition sometimes he fixed his eyes upon mrs start and seemed struggling to remember something of the past but after a few moments his face would assume a baffled look and he would give up the attempt as fruitless one day when mrs start addressed him as mr smith he asked why do you call me by that name is not that your name she asked no what then is it he put his hand to his brow and seemed to be thinking at length he turned to the widow and said abruptly do you not know my name no nor do i he answered and left the room hastily she continued therefore to address him as mr smith and he gradually became accustomed to it and answered to it leaving captain rushton at calcutta with the assurance that though separated from home and family he will receive all the care that his condition requires we will return to our hero shut up on shipboard with his worst enemy i say this advisedly for though halbert davis disliked him it was only the feeling of a boy and was free from the intensity of ben haleys hatred no doubt it was imprudent tor him to reject the mates hand but robert felt that he could not grasp in friendship the hand which had deprived him of a father he was bold enough to brave the consequences of this act which he foresaw clearly ben haley however was in no hurry to take the vengeance which he was fully resolved sooner or later to wreak upon our young hero he was content to bide his time had robert been less watchful indeed he might have supposed that the mates feelings toward him had changed when they met as in the narrow limits of the ship they must do every day the forms of courtesy passed between them robert always saluted the mate and haley responded by a nod or a cool goodmorning but did not indulge in any conversation sometimes however turning suddenly robert would catch a malignant glance from the mate but haleys expression immediately changed when thus surprised and he assumed an air of indifference with captain evans on the other hand robert was on excellent terms the captain liked the bold manly boy and talked much with him of the different countries he had visited and seemed glad to answer the questions which our hero asked robert said the captain one day how is it that you and mr haley seem to have nothing to say to each other i dont think he likes me captain evans said robert is there any reason for it or is it merely a prejudice there is a reason for it but i dont care to mention it not that it is anything i have reason to regret or to be ashamed of he added hastily it is on mr haleys account that i prefer to keep it secret is there no chance of your being on better terms asked the captain goodnaturedly desirous of effecting a reconciliation robert shook his head i dont wish to be reconciled captain he said i will tell you this much that mr haley has done me and my family an injury which perhaps can never be repaired i cannot forget it and though i am willing to be civil to him since we are thrown together i do not want his friendship even if he desired mine as i am sure he does not captain evans was puzzled by this explanation which threw very little light upon the subject and made no further efforts to bring the two together time passed and whatever might be ben haleys feelings he abstained from any attempt to injure him roberts suspicions were lulled to sleep and he ceased to be as vigilant and watchful as he had been his frank familiar manner made him a favorite on shipboard he had a friendly word for all the sailors which was appreciated for it was known that he was the protйgй of the owner he was supposed by some to be a relation or at any rate a near connection and so was treated with unusual respect all the sailors had a kind word for him and many were the praises which he received in the forecastle among those most devoted to him was a boy of fourteen frank price who had sailed in the capacity of cabinboy the poor boy was very seasick at first and captain evans had been indulgent and excused him from duty until he got better he was not sturdy enough for the life upon which he had entered and would gladly have found himself again in the comfortable home which a mistaken impulse had led him to exchange for the sea with this boy robert who was of about the same age struck up a friendship which was returned twofold by frank whose heart naturally warm was easily won by kindness chapter xxviii the new captain the voyage was more than half completed and nothing of importance had occurred to mark it but at this time captain evans fell sick his sickness proved to be a fever and was very severe the surgeon was in constant attendance but the malady baffled all his skill at the end of seven days it terminated fatally to the great grief of all on board with whom the goodnatured captain was very popular there was one exception however to the general grief it is an ill wind that blows good to no one and ben haley did not lament much for an event which promoted him to the command of the vessel of course he did not show this feeling publicly but in secret his heart bounded with exultation at the thought that he was for the time master of the ship and all on board he was not slow in asserting his new position five minutes after the captain breathed his last one of the sailors approached him and asked for orders addressing him as mr haley captain haley roared the new commander if you dont know my position on board this ship its time you found it out ay ay sir stammered the sailor taken aback at his unexpected violence robert mourned sincerely at the death of captain evans by whom he had always been treated with the utmost kindness even had he not been influenced by such a feeling he would have regarded with apprehension the elevation to the command of one whom he well knew to be actuated by a feeling of enmity to himself he resolved to be as prudent as possible and avoid as far as he could any altercation with haley but the latter was determined now that he had reached the command to pick a quarrel with our hero and began to cast about for a fitting occasion now that captain evans was dead robert spent as much time as the latters duties would permit with frank price the boys held long and confidential conversations together imparting to each other their respective hopes and wishes haley observed their intimacy and mutual attachment and unable to assert his authority over robert who was a passenger determined to strike at him through his friend his determination was strengthened by a conversation which he overheard between the boys when they supposed him beyond earshot i wish captain evans were alive said frank i liked him and i dont like captain haley captain evans was an excellent man said robert he knew how to treat a fellow said frank as long as he saw us doing our best he was easy with us captain haley is a tyrant be careful what you say frank said robert it isnt safe to say much about the officers i wouldnt say anything except to you you are my friend i am your true friend frank and i dont want you to get into any trouble i am sure you dont like the captain any better than i do i dont like the captain for more reasons than i can tell you but i shall keep quiet as long as i am on board this ship are you going back with us i dont know it will depend upon circumstances i dont think i shall though i might have done so had captain evans remained in command i wish i could leave it and stay with you i wish you could frank perhaps you can i will try haley overheard the last part of this conversation he took particular notice of roberts remark that he would keep quiet as long as he remained on board the ship and inferred that on arrival at the destined port our hero would expose all he knew about him this made him uneasy for it would injure if not destroy his prospect of remaining in command of the argonaut he resented also the dislike which robert had cautiously expressed and the similar feeling cherished by the cabinboy he had half a mind to break in upon their conversation on the spot but after a moments thought walked away his neighborhood unsuspected by the two boys they shall both rue their impudence he muttered they shall find out that they cannot insult me with impunity the next day when both boys were on deck captain haley harshly ordered frank to attend to a certain duty which he had already performed i have done so sir said frank in a respectful tone none of your impudence you young rascal roared the captain lashing himself into a rage frank looked up into his face in astonishment unable to account for so violent an outbreak what do you mean by looking me in the face in that impudent manner demanded captain haley furiously i didnt mean to be impudent captain haley said frank what have i done what have you done you a cabinboy have dared to insult your captain and by heavens you shall rue it strip off your jacket frank turned pale he knew what this order meant public floggings were sometimes administered on shipboard but under the command of captain evans nothing of the kind had taken place robert who had heard the whole listened with unmeasured indignation to this wanton abuse on the part of captain haley his eyes flashed and his youthful form dilated with righteous indignation robert was not the only one who witnessed with indignation the captains brutality such of the sailors as happened to be on deck shared his feelings haley looking about him caught the look with which robert regarded him and triumphed inwardly that he had found a way to chafe him what have you got to say about it he demanded addressing our hero with a sneer since you have asked my opinion said robert boldly i will express it frank price has not been guilty of any impudence and deserves no punishment this was a bold speech to be made by a boy to a captain on his own deck and the sailors who heard it inwardly applauded the pluck of the boy who uttered it what do you mean by that sir exclaimed haley his eyes lighting up fiercely as he strode to the spot where robert stood and frowned upon him menacingly you asked my opinion and i gave it said robert not flinching i have a great mind to have you flogged too said haley i am not one of your crew captain haley said robert coolly and you have no right to lay a hand on me what is to prevent me i should like to know i am here as a passenger and a friend of the owner of this vessel if i receive any illtreatment it shall be reported to him if the sailors had dared they would have applauded the stripling who undaunted by the menacing attitude of the captain faced him boldly and fearlessly haley would gladly have knocked him down but there was something in the resolute mien of his young passenger that made him pause he knew that he would keep his word and that with such representations as he might make he would stand no further chance of being employed by mr morgan i have an account to settle with you boy he said and the settlement will not long be delayed when a passenger tries to incite mutiny he forfeits his privileges as a passenger who has done this captain haley you have done it i deny it said robert your denial is worth nothing i have a right to throw you into irons and may yet do it at present i have other business in hand he left robert and walked back to frank price who not having roberts courage had been a terrified listener to the colloquy between him and the captain now boy he said harshly i will give you a lesson that you shall remember to the latest day of your life bring me the cat the barbarous cat as it was called once in use on our ships was brought and captain haley signaled to one of the sailors to approach bates he said in a tone of authority give that boy a dozen lashes bates was a stout sailor rough in appearance but with a warm and kindly heart he had a boy of his own at home about the age of frank price and his heart had warmed to the boy whose position he felt to be far from an enviable one the task now imposed upon him was a most distasteful and unwelcome one he was a good sailor and aimed on all occasions to show proper obedience to the commands of his officers but now he could not captain haley he said not stirring from his position i hope you will excuse me is this mutiny roared the captain no captain haley i always mean to do my duty on board ship i have told you to flog this boy i cant do it captain haley i have a boy of my own about the size of that lad there and if i struck him id think it was my own boy that stood in his place this unexpected opposition excited the fierce resentment of the captain he felt that a crisis had come and he was determined to be obeyed unless you do as i bid you i will keep you in irons for the rest of the voyage you are the captain of this ship and can throw me in irons if you like said bates with an air of dignity despite his tarred hands and sailor jacket i have refused to do no duty that belongs to me when i signed my name to the ships papers i did not agree to flog boys put him in irons roared the captain incensed we will see who is captain of this ship the mandate was obeyed and bates was lodged in the forecastle securely ironed the captain himself seized the cat and was about to apply it to the luckless cabinboy when a terrible blast springing up in an instant as it were struck the ship almost throwing it upon its side there was no time for punishment now the safety of the ship required instant action and frank price was permitted to replace his jacket without having received a blow chapter xxix the captains revenge the storm which commenced so suddenly was one of great violence it required all the captains seamanship and the efforts of all the crew to withstand it however reluctant to do it captain haley was forced to release bates from his irons and order him to duty the latter worked energetically and showed that he did not intend to shirk any part of his duties as seaman but the result of the storm was that the vessel was driven out of her course and her rigging suffered considerable injury the wind blew all night toward morning it abated and as the morning light broke the lookout described a small island distant about a league the captain looked at it through his glass and then examined the chart i cant make out what island that is he said it is not large enough suggested the mate to find a place on the map perhaps it is as you say said captain haley thoughtfully i have a mind to go on shore and explore it there may be some fresh fruits that will vary our diet this plan was carried out a boat was got ready and the captain got in with four sailors to row just as he was about to descend into the boat he turned to robert who was looking curiously toward land and said rushton would you like to go with us it was precisely what robert wanted he had a boys love of adventure and the thought of exploring an island perhaps hitherto unknown struck his fancy and he eagerly accepted the invitation jump in then said haley striving to appear indifferent but there was a gleam of exultation in his eye which he took care to conceal from the unsuspecting boy swiftly the boat sped through the waters pulled by the strong arms of four stout sailors and reaching the island was drawn into a little cove which seemed made for it now for an exploring expedition said the captain boys addressing the sailors remain near the boat i will soon be back rushton he said turning to our hero go where you like but be back in an hour yes sir answered robert had it been captain evans instead of captain haley he would have proposed to join him but knowing what he did of the latter he preferred his own company the island was about five miles in circumference near the shore it was bare of vegetation but further inland there were numerous trees some producing fruit after some weeks of the monotonous life on shipboard robert enjoyed pressing the solid earth once more besides this was the first foreign shore his foot had ever trodden the thought that he was thousands of miles away from home and that possibly the land upon which he now walked had never before been trodden by a civilized foot filled him with a sense of excitement and exhilaration what would mother say if she should see me now he thought what a wonderful chance it would be if my father had been wafted in his boat to this island and i should come upon him unexpectedly it was very improbable but robert thought enough of it to look about him carefully but everywhere the land seemed to be virgin without other inhabitants than the birds of strange plumage and note which sang in the branches of the trees i dont believe any one ever lived here thought robert it struck him that he should like to live upon the island a week if he could be sure of being taken off at the end of that time the cool breezes from the ocean swept over the little island and made it delightfully cool at morning and evening though hot in the middle of the day robert sauntered along till he came to a little valley he descended the slope and sat down in the shade of a broadleaved tree the grass beneath him made a soft couch and he felt that he should enjoy lying there the rest of the day but his time was limited the captain had told him to be back in an hour and he felt that it was time for him to be stirring i shall not have time to go any further he reflected i must be getting back to the boat as this occurred to him he rose to his feet and looking up he started a little at seeing the captain himself descending the slope well robert said captain haley how do you like the island very much indeed said our hero it seems pleasant to be on land after being on shipboard so many weeks quite true this is a beautiful place you have found i was resting under this tree listening to the birds but i felt afraid i should not be back to the boat in time and was just starting to return i think we can overstay our time a little said haley they wont go back without me i reckon he added with a laugh robert was nothing loth to stay and resumed his place on the grass the captain threw himself on the grass beside him i suppose you have read robinson crusoe he said oh yes more than once i wonder how it would seem to live on such an island as this i should like it very well said robert that is if i could go off at any time i was just thinking of it when you come up were you asked the captain showing his teeth in an unpleasant smile which however robert did not see you think you would like it yes sir i am glad of that why asked robert turning round and looking his companion in the face because said haley changing his tone i am going to give you a chance to try it robert sprang to his feet in instant alarm but too late haley had grasped him by the shoulder and in his grasp the boys strength was nothing what are you going to do asked robert with fearful foreboding wait a minute and you will see the captain had drawn a stout cord brought for the purpose from his pocket and dragging robert to a tree tied him securely to the trunk the terrible fate destined for him was presented vividly to the imagination of our hero and brave as he was it almost unmanned him finding his struggles useless he resorted to expostulation i am sure you cannot mean this captain haley he said you wont leave me to perish miserably on this island wont i returned the captain with an evil light in his eyes why wont i surely you will not be so inhuman look here boy said the captain you neednt try to come any of your highflown notions about humanity over me i owe you a debt and by heaven im going to pay it you didnt think much of humanity when you wounded me i couldnt help it said robert i didnt want to hurt you i only wanted to protect your uncle thats all very well but when you interfered in a family quarrel you meddled with what did not concern you besides you have been inciting my crew to mutiny i have not done so said robert i overheard you the other night giving some of your precious advice to my cabinboy besides you had the impudence to interfere with me in a matter of discipline frank price deserved no punishment that is for me to decide when you dared to be impudent to me on my own deck i swore to be revenged and the time has come sooner than i anticipated captain haley said robert in all that i have done i have tried to do right if i have done wrong it was because i erred in judgment if you will let me go i will promise to say nothing of the attempt you make to keep me here you are very kind sneered the captain but i mean to take care of that myself you may make all the complaints you like after i have left you here there is one who will hear me said robert i shall not be wholly without friends who do you mean god said robert solemnly rubbish retorted haley contemptuously i shall not despair while i have him to appeal to just as you like said the captain shrugging his shoulders you are welcome to all the comfort you can find in your present situation by this time robert was bound to the trunk of the tree by a cord which passed around his waist in addition to this haley tied his wrists together fearing that otherwise he might be able to unfasten the knot he now rose to his feet and looked down upon the young captive with an air of triumph have you any messages to send by me rushton he said with a sneer are you quite determined to leave me here asked robert in anguish quite so what will the sailors say when i do not return dont trouble yourself about them i will take care of that if you have got anything to say say it quick for i must be going captain haley said robert his courage rising and looking the captain firmly in the face i may die here and so gratify your enmity but the time will come when you will repent what you are doing ill risk that said haley coolly goodby he walked up the slope and disappeared from view leaving robert bound to the tree a helpless prisoner chapter xxx a friend in need captain haley kept on his way to the shore the four sailors were all within hail and on the captains approach got the boat in readiness to return where is the boy asked haley hasnt he got back no sir that is strange i told him to be back in an hour and it is already past that time perhaps he hasnt a watch suggested one of the sailors i will wait ten minutes for him said haley taking out his watch if he is not back in that time i must go without him the sailors did not reply but looked anxiously inland hoping to catch sight of robert returning but bound as he was we can understand why they looked in vain shall i go and look for him asked one no said haley decidedly i cannot spare you the ten minutes were soon up into the boat with you commanded the captain i shall wait no longer slowly and reluctantly the sailors took their places for robert was a favorite with them now men give way said haley if the boy is lost it is his own fault they reached the vessel in due time there was a murmur among the crew when it was found that robert had been left behind but knowing the captains disposition no one except bates dared to expostulate captain haley said he approaching and touching his hat will you give me leave to go on shore for the young gentleman that was left no said the captain he had fair warning to be back in time and chose to disregard it my duty to the owners will not permit me to delay the ship on his account he was a relation of the owner suggested bates no he was not and if he said so he lied go about your duty and take care i have no more fault to find with you or you go back in irons bates ventured upon no further expostulation he saw through the captains subterfuge and felt persuaded that it had been his deliberate intention from the first to abandon robert to his fate he began to think busily and finally resolved to go to the island and search for him for this purpose a boat would be needful since the distance nearly a league was too far to swim now to appropriate one of the ships boats when the captain was on deck would be impossible but haley within five minutes went below bates now proceeded to carry out his plan what are you going to do demanded one of the sailors im going after the boy youll be left along with him ill take the risk he shant say he didnt have one friend by the connivance of his fellowsailors bates got safely off with the boat and began to pull toward shore he was already a mile distant from the vessel when captain haley came on deck who is that in the boat he demanded abruptly i dont know sir he pointed the glass toward the boat and though he could not fairly distinguish the stout sailor who was pulling the boat through the water he suspected that it was bates where is bates he asked no one had seen him the fool has gone to destruction said captain haley i shall not go after him he is welcome to live on the island if he chooses his reason for not pursuing the fugitive may be readily understood he feared that robert would be found bound to the tree and the story the boy would tell would go heavily against him he hurried preparation for the vessels departure and in a short time it was speeding away from the island with two less on board i must now go back to robert whom we left bound to a tree after the captain left him he struggled hard to unloose the cords which bound him the love of life was strong within him and the thought of dying under such circumstances was appalling he struggled manfully but though he was strong for a boy the cord was strong also and the captain knew how to tie a knot robert ceased at last tired with his efforts a feeling of despair came over him and the tears started unbidden to his eyes as he thought how his mother would watch and wait for him in vain how lonely she would feel with husband and son both taken from her could it be that he was to die when life had only just commenced thousands of miles away from home in utter solitude had he come so far for this then again he feared that his mother would suffer want and privation when the money which he had left behind was exhausted in his pocket there were nearly two hundred dollars not likely to be of any service to him he wished that they were in her possession if only he had left me free and unbound thought robert i might pick up a living on the island and perhaps some day attract the attention of some vessel with this thought and the hope it brought he made renewed efforts to release himself striving to untie the cord which fastened his wrists with his teeth he made some progress and felt encouraged but it was hard work and he was compelled to stop from time to time to rest it was in one of these intervals that he heard his name called feeling sure that there was no one on the island but himself he thought he was deceived but the sound came nearer and he distinctly heard robert here i am he shouted in return his heart filled with sudden thanksgiving captain haley only meant to frighten me he thought he has sent some men back for me in his gratitude he thanked heaven fervently for so changing the heart of his enemy and once more life looked bright robert he heard again here he shouted with all the strength of his lungs this time the sound reached bates who running up his boat on shore and securing it was exploring the island in search of our hero looking around him he at length from the edge of the valley descried robert is that you lad he asked yes bates come and untie me bates saw his situation with surprise and indignation thats some of the captains work he at once decided he must be a cursed scoundrel to leave that poor lad there to die he quickened his steps and was soon at the side of our hero who tied you to the tree lad he asked did captain haley send you for me asked robert first for he had made up his mind in that case not to expose him no i stole one of the ships boats and came for you without leave the captain didnt know of your coming no i asked his leave and he wouldnt give it it was captain haley that tied me here said robert his scruples removed what did he do that for lad its a long story bates its because he hates me and wishes me harm untie these cords and ill tell you all about it that ill do in a jiffy my lad im an old sailor and i can untie knots as well as tie them in five minutes robert was free he stretched his limbs with a feeling of great relief and then turned to bates whose hand he grasped i owe my life to you bates he said maybe not lad were in a tight place yet has the ship gone most likely the captain wont send back for either of us in a hurry and you have made yourself a prisoner here for my sake asked robert moved by the noble conduct of the rough sailor i couldnt abide to leave you alone theres more chance for two than for one heaven bless you bates i wont soon forget what you have done for me do you think there is any chance for us of course there is lad weve got a boat and we can live here till some vessel comes within sight let us go down to the shore and see if we can see anything of the ship the two bent their steps to the shore and looked out to sea they could still see the ship but it was already becoming a speck in the distant waters they have left us said robert turning to his companion ay lad the falsehearted villain has done his worst i didnt think any man would be so inhuman youre young lad and you dont know what a sight of villainy there is in the world weve got to live here a while likely have you seen anything in the line of grub hereabouts there is fruit on some of the trees thats something maybe we shall find some roots besides well draw the boat farther upon shore and go on an exploring expedition the boat was drawn completely up and placed bottom upward at a safe distance from the sea then robert and his companion started to explore the island which had so unexpectedly become their home chapter xxxi the island realm but for the knowledge that he was a prisoner robert would have enjoyed his present situation the island though small was covered with a luxuriant vegetation and was swept by cooling breezes which tempered the ardor of the suns rays and of this island realm he and his companion were the undisputed sovereigns there was no one to dispute their sway all that it yielded was at their absolute disposal i wonder what is the name of this island said robert perhaps it has no name mayhap we are the first that ever visited it i have a great mind to declare myself the king said our young hero smiling unless you want the office you shall be captain and i will be mate said bates to whom the distinctions of sea life were more familiar than those of courts how long do you think we shall have to stay here asked robert anxiously theres no telling lad well have to stick up a pole on the seashore and run up a flag when any vessel comes near we have no flag have you a handkerchief only one said robert thats one more than i have well rig that up when its wanted where shall we sleep thats what i have been thinking we must build a house a brownstone front said robert the governor ought to live in a good house so he shall said bates he shall have the first on the island i wonder if it rains often not much at this season in the winter a good deal of rain falls but i hope we wont be here then where shall we build our house it would be pleasanter inland but we must be near the shore so as to be in sight of ships thats true bates that is the most important consideration they set to work at once and built a hut something like an indians wigwam about a hundred yards from the shore it was composed for the most part of branches of trees and inclosed an inner space of about fifteen feet in diameter they gathered large quantities of leaves which were spread upon the ground for beds thats softer than our bunks aboard ship said bates yes said robert i wouldnt wish any better bed it is easy to build and furnish a house of your own here the next thing is dinner said his companion shall we go to market asked robert with a smile well find a market just outside you mean the trees yes well find our dinner already cooked on them the fruit of which they partook freely was quite sweet and palatable still one kind of food cloys after a time and so our new settlers found it besides it was not very substantial and failed to keep up their wonted strength this set them to looking up some other article which might impart variety to their fare at last they succeeded in finding an esculent root which they partook of at first with some caution fearing that it might be unwholesome finding however that eating it produced no unpleasant effects they continued the use of it even this however failed to afford them as much variety as they wished i feel as if i should like some fish for breakfast said robert one morning on waking up so should i lad returned bates why shouldnt we have some you mean that we shall go fishing yes weve got a boat and i have some cord well rig up fishing lines and go out on a fishing cruise robert adopted the idea with alacrity it promised variety and excitement i wonder we hadnt thought of it before i used to be a fisherman bates did you yes i supplied the market at home for a short time till captain haley smashed my boat the mean lubber i wish we had him here i dont i prefer his room to his company id try how hed like being tied to a tree i dont think youd untie him again in a hurry you may bet high on that lad they rigged their fishing lines cutting poles from the trees and armed them with hooks of which by good luck bates happened to have a supply with him then they launched the ships boat in which bates had come to the island and put out to sea robert enjoyed the row in the early morning and wondered they had not thought of taking out the boat before at last they came to the business which brought them out and in about half an hour had succeeded in catching four fishes weighing perhaps fifteen pounds altogether thatll be enough for us unless you are very hungry said robert now suppose we land and cook them ay ay lad of course their cooking arrangements were very primitive in the first place they were compelled to make a fire by the method in use among the savages of rubbing two sticks smartly together and catching the flame in a little prepared tinder the fish were baked over the fire thus kindled though the outside was smoked the inside was sweet and palatable and neither was disposed to be fastidious the preparation of the meal took considerable time but they had abundance of that and occupation prevented their brooding over their solitary situation i wish i had robinson crusoe here said robert we might get some hints from his adventures i didnt imagine when i used to read them that i should ever be in a similar position ive heard about him said bates but i never was much of a reader and i never read his yarn you might maybe tell me something of it i will tell you all i can remember but that isnt very much said robert he rehearsed to the attentive sailor such portions as he could call to mind of the wonderful story which for centuries to come is destined to enchain the attention of adventurous boys thats a pretty good yarn said bates approvingly did he ever get off the island yes he got off and became quite rich before he died maybe itll be so with us lad i hope so i dont know what i should do if i were alone as he was its selfish in me bates to be glad that you are shut up here with me but i cannot help it you neednt try lad it would be mighty dull being alone here specially if you was tied to a tree but suppose we should never get off we wont suppose that lad we are sure to get off some time this confident assurance always cheered up robert and for the time inspired him with equal confidence but when day after day passed away and the promised ship did not come in sight he used to ponder thoughtfully over his situation and the possibility that he might have to spend years at least on this lonely island what in the meantime would become of his mother she might die and if he ever returned it would be to realize the loss he had sustained the island pleasant as it was began to lose its charm if his sailor companion ever shared his feelings he never manifested them unwilling to let the boy see that he was becoming discouraged at length about six weeks after their arrival upon the island they were returning from an excursion to the other side of the island when on arriving in sight of the shore an unexpected sight greeted their eyes a pole had been planted in the sand and from it waved the familiar flag dear to the heart of every american the starspangled banner they no sooner caught sight of it than in joyful excitement they ran to the shore with all the speed they could muster chapter xxxii a successful mission there was no one in sight but it was evident that a party from an american ship had visited the island had they departed that was a momentous question instinctively the eyes of both sought the sea they saw an american ship riding at anchor a mile or more from shore give me your handkerchief robert said bates ill signal them it isnt very clean said our hero itll do see they are looking at us your eyes must be good im used to looking out to sea lad he waved the handkerchief aloft and felt sure that he had attracted the attention of those on board but there was no motion to put off a boat do they see it asked robert eagerly i think so do you think they will come for us if not we can put off in our boat i think the party that planted that flagstaff hasnt got back it is exploring the island and will be back soon of course it is said robert suddenly dont you see their boat ay ay lad its all right all weve got to do is to stay here till they come they had not long to wait a party of sailors headed by an officer came out of the woods and headed for the shore they stopped short in surprise at the sight of robert and bates who are you asked the leader approaching bates touched his hat for he judged this was the captain of the vessel he had seen i am a sailor from the ship argonaut bound from new york to calcutta and this young gentleman is robert rushton passenger aboard the same ship where is your ship i dont know captain how came you here we were left here the vessel went without us how long have you been here six weeks there is something about this which i do not understand are you here of your own accord we are anxious to get away captain said robert will you take us to be sure i will theres room enough on my ship for both of you but i cant understand how you were left here its a long yarn captain said bates if you havent time to hear it now i will tell you aboard ship you look like a good seaman said the captain addressing bates im shorthanded just now if you will engage with me i will enroll you among my crew that ill do said bates with satisfaction i wasnt made for a passenger my ship is the superior bound from boston to calcutta so your destination will be the same my name is smith do you know the name of this island i never heard of it before i have taken possession of it in the name of the united states supposing myself the first discoverer thats all right to my mind the starspangled banner is the best that can wave over it we might offer the captain our boat suggested robert the offer was made and accepted and while the captain and his party returned in one boat robert and bates rowed to the ship in their own and were soon on the deck of the superior to their unbounded satisfaction this is something like said bates the island is well enough but theres nothing like the deck of a good ship i dont think i wholly agree with you said robert smiling but just at present i do i am glad enough to be here we may meet captain haley at calcutta he added after a pause likely hell have got away before we get there i hope not i should like to meet him face to face and charge him with his treachery i dont think hell be over glad to see me thats so lad he dont expect ever to set eyes on you again robert soon felt at home on the new vessel captain smith he found to be a very different man from captain haley when he heard the story told him by our hero he said i like your pluck robert youve had contrary winds so far but youve borne up against them the winds changed now and you are likely to have a prosperous voyage this captain haley is a disgrace to the service hell be overhauled some time when i get back to new york i shall tell mr morgan how he treated me that will put a spoke in his wheel theres one thing i want to speak to you about captain smith how much will my passage be nothing at all but i have some money with me i am willing to pay keep your money my lad you will need it all before you get through i was once a poor boy myself obliged to struggle for my living i havent forgotten that time and it makes me willing to lend a helping hand to others in the same position you are very kind captain smith said robert gratefully i ought to be how long do you want to stay in calcutta only long enough to look about for my father then you can return to new york in my ship it shall cost you nothing this offer was gratefully accepted the more so that our hero had begun to realize that two hundred dollars was a small sum to carry on a journey of such length at last they reached calcutta robert surveyed with much interest the great city of india so different in its external appearance from new york the only great city besides that he knew anything about well robert said captain smith on their arrival what are your plans will you make your home on board the ship or board in the city during our stay in port i think said robert i should prefer to live in the city if you would recommend me to a good boarding place that i can do i am in the habit of boarding at a quiet house kept by a widow her terms are reasonable and you can do no better than go there with me thank you captain smith i shall be glad to follow your advice so it happened that captain smith and robert engaged board at the house of mrs start where it will be remembered that captain rushton was also a boarder passing still under the name of smith physically he had considerably improved but mentally he was not yet recovered his mind had received a shock which as it proved a shock equally great was needed to bring it back to its proper balance by the way said mrs start to captain smith we have another gentleman of your name here indeed you will see him at dinner poor gentleman his mind is affected and we only gave him this name because we didnt know his real name robert little dreamed who it was of whom mrs start was speaking nor did he look forward with any particular curiosity to seeing the other mr smith when dinner was announced robert and the captain were early in their seats and were introduced to the other boarders as they came in finally captain rushton entered and moved forward to a seat beside the landlady robert chanced to look up as he entered and his heart made a mighty bound when in the new mr smith he recognized his father father he exclaimed eagerly springing from his seat and overturning his chair in his haste captain rushton looked at him for a moment in bewilderment then all at once the mists that had obscured his faculties were dispelled and he cried robert my dear son how came you here i came in search of you father thank heaven i have found you alive and well i think i have been in a dream robert they call me smith that surely is not my name rushton father you have not forgotten yes that is it often it has been on the tip of my tongue and then it slipped away from me but tell me how came you here i am indebted to the kindness of this gentleman captain smith father who rescued me from great peril this scene of course excited great astonishment among the boarders and the worthy landlady who had been uniformly kind to captain rushton was rejoiced at his sudden recovery feeling that mutual explanations in public would be unpleasant she proposed to send dinner for both to captain rushtons room and this offer was gladly accepted and how did you leave your mother robert asked the captain she was well father but mourning for your loss i wish i could fly to her you shall go back with me in captain smiths vessel i am sure he will take us as passengers so we will you are sure your mother is well provided for but mr davis has no doubt supplied her with money not a cent father not a cent i deposited five thousand dollars with him for her benefit just before sailing so you wrote in the letter which you sent in the bottle was that letter received yes it was that which led me to come in search of you and did you go to mr davis he denied the deposit and demanded to see the receipt the villain he thought i was at the bottom of the sea and the receipt with me he shall find his mistake then you have the receipt still father to be sure i have and captain rushton drew it from the pocket where it had laid concealed for two years and more robert regarded it with satisfaction he wont dare to deny it after this i wish we were going back at once now robert tell me all that has happened in my absence and how you raised money enough to come out here so father and son exchanged narrations captain rushton was astonished to find that the same man ben haley who had been the cause of his misfortunes had also come so near compassing the destruction of his son thanks to a kind providence he said his wicked machinations have failed and we are alive to defeat his evil schemes chapter xxxiii defeated in due time the superior cleared for new york and among the passengers were robert and his father since the meeting with his son captain rushtons mental malady had completely disappeared and his mental recovery affected his physical health favorably his step became firm and elastic his eye was bright and robert thought he had never looked better leaving the two to pursue their voyage home we return to captain haley after leaving robert to his fate he kept on his way rejoicing with a wicked satisfaction that he had got rid of an enemy who had it in his power to do him harm for what robert might suffer in his island prison he cared little he took it for granted that he would never get away but would pass his life be it longer or shorter in dreary exile though the crew did not know all they knew that the captain had heartlessly left robert to his fate and all were animated by a common feeling of dislike to their commander who never under any circumstances would hare been popular but there was no one among them bold enough to come forward and charge haley with his crime even when they reached calcutta the captain moved among them and his orders were obeyed but not with alacrity this satisfied him for he cared nothing for the attachment of those under his command one day in calcutta he had a surprise he met captain rushton one day when out walking it seemed like one risen from the dead for he supposed him lying at the bottom of the sea could his eyes deceive him or was this really the man whom he had so grossly injured captain rushton did not see haley for he was partly turned away from him and was busily conversing with a gentleman of his acquaintance haley drew near and heard captain rushton addressed as mr smith he at once decided that in spite of the wonderful resemblance it was not the man he supposed and breathed more freely in consequence but he could not help looking back to wonder at the surprising likeness they are as near alike as if they were brothers he said to himself he did not again catch sight of captain rushton while in calcutta before robert arrived captain haley had sailed for home but he met with storms and his vessel received injuries that delayed her so that his ship only reached new york on the same day with the superior bearing as passengers robert and his father our hero lost no time in calling upon his friend mr morgan and actually reached the office an hour before haley the superior having reached her pier a little in advance of the other vessel when robert walked into the office mr morgan who was at his desk looked up and recognized him at once welcome back my young friend he said cordially rising to meet him i am glad to see you but i didnt expect you quite so soon how did you happen to come in advance of the captain then you have not heard what happened at sea said robert yes said the merchant i heard much to my regret of captain evans death he was a worthy man and i am truly sorry to lose him what do you think of his successor captain haley he has never before sailed for me after i have told my story you can judge of him for yourself i did not return on your vessel mr morgan but on the superior captain smith how is that asked the merchant surprised because captain haley left me on an island in the southern ocean bound to a tree and probably supposes that i am dead your story seems incredible robert give me a full account of all that led to this action on the part of the captain my readers shall not be wearied with a repetition of details with which they are already familiar robert related what had happened to him in a straightforward manner and mr morgan never thought of doubting his statements this haley must be a villain he said you are indeed fortunate in having escaped from the snare he laid for you i have been fortunate in another way also said robert i have succeeded in the object of my voyage you have not found your father i found him in calcutta and i have brought him home with me you must have been born under a lucky star robert said the merchant were your fathers adventures as remarkable as yours it was the same man who nearly succeeded in accomplishing the ruin of both captain haley was my fathers mate and was he who in revenge for some fancied slight set fire to the vessel in midocean and then escaped scarcely had this revelation been made when a clerk entered and approaching mr morgan said captain haley would like to see you mr morgan glanced at robert significantly i wish to know what explanation mr haley has to give of your disappearance there is a closet go in and close the door partially so that you may hear what passes without yourself being seen robert was hardly established in his place of concealment when haley entered the office goodmorning mr morgan he said deferentially for he wished to keep in his employers good graces goodmorning sir said the merchant formally captain haley i believe yes sir i succeeded to the command of the argonaut upon the lamented death of my friend captain evans his death happened on our passage out i proceeded at once to calcutta and after disposing of the cargo sailed for home your voyage has been a long one yes we have had stress of weather which has delayed us materially i regret this but did the best i could under the circumstances i hope to have discharged my duties in a manner satisfactory to you i cannot of course blame you for delay since the weather was quite beyond your control said the merchant but his tone was marked by coldness for which haley found it difficult to account he was anxious to remain in command of the argonaut but the want of cordiality evinced by his employer made him doubtful of his success he was not timid however and resolved to broach the subject i hope mr morgan he said that you have sufficient confidence in me to intrust me i with the command of the argonaut on her next voyage he certainly is not lacking in audacity thought mr morgan we will speak of that matter hereafter he said did my young friend robert rushton return with you now was the critical moment in spite of his audacity haley felt embarrassed no sir he replied indeed i expected that you would bring him back may i ask if the boy is a relative of yours no he is not so much the better why do you say that i am particularly interested in him then sir my task becomes more painful and embarrassing you speak in enigmas captain haley i hesitate to speak plainly i know you will be pained by what i have to tell you dont consider my feelings captain haley but say what you have to say then i regret to say that the boy robert rushton is unworthy of your friendship this is a grievous charge of course i expect you to substantiate it i will do so shortly after the death of captain evans and my accession to the command i found that this boy was trying to undermine my influence with the men from what motives i cannot guess i remonstrated with him mildly but firmly but only received insolence in return nevertheless i continued to treat him well on account of the interest you felt in him so things went on till we reached calcutta he left me at that time and to my surprise did not return to the ship i was able to account for his disappearance however when i missed one hundred and fifty dollars of which i have not the slightest doubt that he robbed me i should have taken measures to have him arrested but since you felt an interest in him i preferred to suffer the loss in silence i fear mr morgan that you have been greatly deceived in him i suspect that i have been deceived said mr morgan gravely it is only fair however captain haley to hear both sides and i will therefore summon the boy himself to answer your charge robert at the summons to captain haleys equal surprise and dismay robert stepped from the closet in which he had been concealed what have you to say robert asked the merchant captain haley knows very well the falsehood of what he says said our hero calmly it was not at calcutta i left the argonaut nor was it of my own accord captain haley with his own hands tied me to a tree on a small island in the southern ocean and there left me as he supposed to a solitary death but heaven did not forsake me and sent first a brave sailor and afterward a ship to my assistance the charge that i stole money from him i shall not answer for i know mr morgan will not believe it captain haley was not a fool and he knew that it would be useless to press the charge further he rose from his seat his face was dark with anger and smarting under a sense of defeat you have not done with me yet he said to robert and without another word left the office chapter xxxiv the cup and the lip affairs in millville had gone on much as usual mrs rushton had not yet exhausted the supply of money left by robert in the hands of his friend the lawyer her expenses were small and were eked out by her earnings for she continued to braid straw and was able in this way to earn two dollars a week indeed she made it a point to be as economical as possible for she thought it likely robert would spend all his money and return penniless she had received no letter from him since the one announcing his being about to sail for calcutta and this made her naturally anxious but mr paine assured her that letters were likely to be irregular and there was no ground for alarm so she waited with what patience she could till robert should return hoping that by some strange chance he might succeed in his quest and bring his father back with him meanwhile fortune had improved with mr davis the superintendent of the factory he had lost largely by speculation but had blundered at last into the purchase of a stock in which some interested parties had effected a corner it went up rapidly and on the morning when we introduce him again to the reader he was in high good spirits having just received intelligence from his broker that he had cleared seven thousand dollars by selling at the top of the market another cup of coffee mrs davis he said passing his cup across the table seeing that his father appeared in good humor halbert ventured to prefer a request which however he had little hope of having granted have you seen will paines pony he said paving the way for the request yes said his father i saw him on it yesterday its a regular beauty i wish i had one how much did it cost two hundred dollars that is rather a high price but it will increase in value every year i wish you would buy me one father i think i will said the superintendent helping himself to a fresh slice of toast do you mean it asked halbert in the utmost astonishment certainly i do i can afford you a pony as well as mr paine can afford to buy william one thank you said halbert his selfish nature more nearly affected by gratitude than ever before you are very kind when will you see about it i am busy you may go yourself and ask mr paine where he got williams pony and if he knows of any other equally good that i will said halbert leaving the table in haste halbert you have eaten scarcely anything said his mother i am not hungry said the excited boy seizing his hat and dashing off in the direction of mr paines office by the way mrs davis said the husband i think you mentioned last week that the parlor needed a new carpet so it does the old one is looking very shabby how much will a new one cost i can get a nice brussels for a hundred dollars well you may order one it was the wifes turn to be astonished for on broaching the subject the week previous her husband had given her a lecture on extravagance and absolutely refused to consider her request this was before the tidings of his good fortune she was not slow to accept the present concession and assumed an unusually affectionate manner in the excess of her delight meanwhile halbert in opening the front door came in collision with a boy taller and stouter than himself brown and sunburned but changed as he was he was not slow in recognizing his old enemy robert rushton what are you back again he said ungraciously so it appears is your father at home yes but he is at breakfast i dont think you can see him ill make the attempt at any rate said robert where have you been all this time asked halbert more from curiosity than interest i went to calcutta common sailor i suppose said halbert contemptuously no i was a passenger where did you get your money to pay the passage im sorry that i cant stop to gratify your curiosity just at present but i have important business with your father youre getting mighty important sneered halbert am i i wouldnt advise you to put on so many airs just because youve been to calcutta i never thought of putting on any i see you havent changed much since i went away you have the same agreeable gentlemanly manners do you mean to say that i am not a gentleman blustered halbert not at all you may be one but you dont show it i have a great mind to put you out of the yard robert glanced at halberts figure slight compared with his own and laughed i think you would find it a difficult undertaking he said halbert privately came to the same conclusion and decided to war only with words i have got something better to do than to stand here listening to your impudence i wont soil my fingers by touching you thats a sensible conclusion goodmorning halbert did not deign to respond but walked off holding his nose very high in the air then as he thought of the pony he quickened his pace and bent his steps to mr paines office a young man to see you mr davis said bridget entering the breakfastroom who is it i think its young robert rushton but hes much grown entirely that boy home again exclaimed the superintendent in displeased surprise well you may ask him into the next room goodmorning mr davis said robert as the superintendent entered goodmorning when did you get home was the cold reply last evening where have you been to calcutta on a fools errand i felt it my duty to search for my father i could have told you beforehand you would not succeed did you go as a sailor no where did you raise money to pay your expenses i found friends who helped me it is a poor policy for a boy to live on charity i never intend to do it said robert firmly but i would rather do it than live on money that did not belong to me what do you mean by that sir said the superintendent suspiciously it was a general remark said robert may i ask what is your motive in calling upon me asked mr davis i suppose you have some object i have and i think you can guess it i am not good at guessing said davis haughtily then i will not put you to that trouble you remember before i sailed for calcutta i called here and asked you to restore the sum of five thousand dollars deposited with you by my father i remember it and at the time i stigmatized the claim as a fraudulent one no such sum was ever deposited with me by your father how can you say that when my father expressly stated it in the letter written by him from the boat in which he was drifting about on the ocean i have no proof that the letter was genuine and even if it were i deny the claim i am not responsible for money i never received i understand you then refuse to pay the money you would have understood it long ago if you had not been uncommonly thickheaded sneered the superintendent let this be the end of it when you present my note of acknowledgment for the amount i will pay it and not before that is all i ask said robert what demanded the superintendent i mean that this assurance is all i want the note shall be presented to you in the course of the day what do you mean asked davis startled i mean this mr davis that i found my father in calcutta he came home with me and far from having perished at sea is now alive and well he has with him your note for five thousand dollars and will present it in person you are deceiving me exclaimed davis in consternation you will soon learn whether i am deceiving you or not said robert i will now bid you goodmorning my father will call upon you in the course of the day he rose to go leaving the superintendent thunderstruck at the intelligence of captain rushtons return the five thousand dollars with arrears of interest would take the greater part of the money whose sudden acquisition had so elated him while he was considering the situation his wife entered i think mr davis she said i will go to new york today to buy carpeting if you can spare the money neither now nor at any other time he roared savagely the old carpet must do why then did you tell me fifteen minutes since that i might buy one what do you mean by such trifling mr davis said his wife her eyes flashing i mean what i say ive changed my mind i cant afford to buy a new carpet there was a stormy scene between man and wife which may be passed over in silence it ended with a fit of hysterics on the part of mrs davis while her husband put on his hat and walked gloomily over to the factory here he soon received a call from halbert who informed him with great elation that mr paine knew of a desirable pony which could be had on the same terms as his sons ive changed my mind said his father a pony will cost too much money all halberts entreaties were unavailing and he finally left his fathers presence in a very unfilial frame of mind chapter xxxv conclusion the arrival of captain rushton confidently supposed to be dead produced a great sensation in millville and many were the congratulatory visits received at the little cottage mrs rushton was doubly happy at the unexpected return of her husband and son and felt for the first time in her life perfectly happy she cared little for poverty or riches as long as she had regained her chief treasures when captain rushton called upon the superintendent the latter received him with embarrassment knowing that the captain was aware of his intended dishonesty he tried to evade immediate payment but on this point his creditor was peremptory he had no further confidence in mr davis and felt that the sooner he got his money back into his hands the better it was fortunate for him that the superintendent had been at last successful in speculation or restitution would have been impossible as is was he received his money in full nearly six thousand dollars which he at once invested in bank stock of reliable city banks yielding a good annual income only the day after the payment of this sum a committee of investigation appointed by the directors whose suspicions had been excited visited the factory and subjected the superintendents books to a thorough scrutiny the result showed that mr davis in whom hitherto perfect confidence had been felt had for years pursued a system of embezzlement which he had covered up by false entries in his books and had appropriated to his own use from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars belonging to the corporation while this investigation was pending the superintendent disappeared leaving his wife and son unprovided for his estate was seized in part satisfaction of the amounts he had appropriated and halberts pride was brought low the wealth and position upon which he had based his aristocratic pretensions vanished and in bitter mortification he found himself reduced to poverty he could no longer flaunt his cane and promenade the streets in kid gloves but was glad to accept a position in the factory store where he was compelled to dress according to his work in fact he had exchanged positions with robert who was now owing to a circumstance which will at once be mentioned possessed of a considerable inheritance the old farmer paul nichols whom robert tried to defend from his unprincipled nephew ben haley died suddenly of heart disease speculation was rife as to who would inherit the estate which he left behind him he had no near relation except ben haley and so great was the dislike he entertained toward him that no one anticipated that the estate would go to him unless through pauls dying intestate but shortly after haleys visit his uncle made a will which he deposited in the hands of lawyer paine on the day after the funeral the latter met captain rushton and robert and said will you come to my office this afternoon at three oclock certainly said the captain i suppose you dont want me mr paine said robert i do want you particularly said the lawyer our hero wondered a little why his presence was required but dismissed the matter from his mind until three oclock found him in the lawyers office gentlemen said the lawyer i am about to read the last will and testament of our neighbor paul nichols recently deceased this preamble created surprise for this was the first intimation that such a will was in existence the document was brief and the substance of it was contained in the following paragraph having no near relatives except benjamin haley for whom i have neither regard nor affection and who moreover has recently stolen a considerable sum of money from me i leave all of which i may die possessed whether in land or money to my brave young friend robert rushton who courageously defended me from my said nephew at his own bodily risk and i hope he may live long to enjoy the property i bequeath him no one was more surprised than robert at the unexpected inheritance he could hardly realize that he was now possessed of a considerable property in his own right it may be said here that including the value of the farm and the gold concealed his inheritance amounted to quite ten thousand dollars paul had considerately supplied the lawyer with a list of the hiding places where he had secreted his money on the strictest injunctions of secrecy and this made the task of finding it quite easy congratulations poured in upon our hero who received them with modest satisfaction it is a good thing to have a rich son said captain rushton humorously robert i hope you wont look down upon me on account of my comparative poverty father said robert i wish you would take this money i dont want it i shall do nothing of the kind robert it is fairly and deservedly yours though i confess you may attribute it partly to good luck for virtue is not always so well rewarded in this world i will take care of it for you and if you choose to pay your own expenses out of your income i shall allow you to do so since you are now rich and prosperous you must take all the income father then it will not be necessary for you to go to sea again i have already made up my mind to stay on land hereafter said captain rushton my cruise in an open boat without provisions has cured me of my love for the sea with the little money i have saved and the help of a rich son i think i can afford to stay on shore the cottage was enlarged by the erection of another story as well as by the addition of a wing and the throwing out of two bay windows and was otherwise refitted and so metamorphosed by fresh paint and new furniture that it became one of the most attractive houses in millville captain rushton who knew something of agriculture decided to carry on roberts farm himself and found the employment both pleasant and profitable my only trouble he used to say jocosely is that i have a very exacting landlord unless the rent were punctually paid he would be sure to resort to legal means to recover it when ben haley heard that his uncles estate had been bequeathed to the boy whom he had persecuted and whom for that reason he hated his rage and disappointment were unbounded if he had not been within two hours of sailing in command of a ship bound to south america he would at once have gone down to millville and in his fury he might have done serious injury to the boy who had superseded him but he could not delay the day of sailing and so much against his will he was forced to forego his vengeance until his return but this was destined to be his last voyage while at rio janeiro he became engaged in a fracas with the keeper of a low grogshop when the latter who was a desperate ruffian snatched a knife from his girdle and drove it into the heart of the unhappy captain who fell back on the floor and expired without a groan thus terminated a misguided and illspent life i should have been glad to report ben haleys reformation instead of his death but for the sake of robert whom he hated so intensely i am relieved that thin source of peril is closed robert being now in easy circumstances decided to pursue his studies for two years longer and accordingly placed himself in a school of high reputation where he made rapid improvement he then entered upon a business life under the auspices of his friend mr morgan and promises in time to become a prominent and wealthy merchant he passes every sunday at home in the little cottage occupied by his father who however has ceased to be a farmer having been promoted to the post of superintendent of the factory formerly occupied by mr davis for the first twelve months the post was filled by a new man who proved to be incompetent and then was offered to captain rushton whose excellent executive talents were well known he soon made himself familiar with his duties and the post is likely to be his as long as he cares to hold it hester paine as a young lady fulfills the promise of her girlhood the mutual attachment which existed between her and robert when boy and girl still continues and there is some ground for the report which comes from millville that they are engaged the alliance will be in the highest degree pleasing to both families for if hester is fair and attractive robert is energetic and of excellent principles and possessed of precisely those qualities which with fair good fortune will under the favor of providence insure his success in life the end
