the man frank merriwells son chapter i a new life lizette the french nurse came softly and lightly down the stairs and found frank merriwell pacing the library floor while bart hodge and elsie bellwood talked to him soothingly madame will see you now saire said the nurse with a little curtsy ze doctaire he is gone now some time madame she is comforterbill she say she see you alone frank was all eagerness to go he bounded up the stairs two at a time scarcely heeding the whitecapped nurse who hurried after him softly calling not on ze rush saire you make ze rush you gif madame ze start thats so muttered merry checking himself at the head of the stairs and waiting for the cautious nurse lizette lead the way the girl stepping softly as a cat gently opened a door for him thus revealing a chamber where the light was softened by drawn window shades within that chamber mrs merriwell reclined amid the snowy pillows of a broad bed ze mastaire is here madame said the nurse as frank entered in a moment merry was bending over his wife something small and pink in a soft white garment nestled on her arm it uttered a weak little cry the cry of a new life in the great seething world which was sweet music to the pale woman on the bed and the anxious man who bent over her oh frank murmured inza hes calling to you he knows his father has come merriwell kissed her lightly softly tenderly then with that indescribable light in his eyes he gazed long and fondly at the babe its a boy inza he murmured just as you wished just as i wished for your sake frank she said i knew you wanted a son this is the happiest moment of my life for i have given him to you a son exclaimed frank softly as he straightened up and threw his splendid shoulders back why think of it inza im a father and you are the dearest sweetest handsomest noblest little mother in all the world the nurse ventured to speak madame is so well madame is so strong it is wonderful it is grand youve been very good lizette said inza well not forget it the nurse retired to the far end of the room where she stood with her back toward the bed pretending to inspect and admire a donatello upon the wall frank took the chair beside the bed and found inzas hand which he clasped in a firm but gentle grasp what shall we name him he asked why havent you decided on a name dear without consulting you do you think i would do such a thing inza the name that pleases you will please me she declared what shall it be my husband why not the name of my most faithful friend why not call him bartley hodge merriwell if that satisfies you he shall be called by that name somehow frank fancied he detected a touch of disappointment in her voice but you sweetheart havent you a suggestion to make if you would like me to make one you know i would inza then let hodge be his middle name lets call him frank hodge merriwell the initials are the same as your own bart will be pleased and to me the baby will be little frank fine laughed merry in great satisfaction that is settled that shall be his name hello there frank merriwell the younger ill make an athlete of you you rascal ill give you such advantages to start with as i never had myself no matter what you give him no matter what you do for him murmured the happy mother he can never become a better or nobler man than his father frank kissed her again chapter ii the birthmark where are bart and elsie frank asked inza theyre in the library i want them to come up tell lizette to call them the softfooted nurse flitted from the room and a few moments later elsie bellwood and bart hodge appeared hodge followed elsie with an air of reluctance and confusion which caused inza to smile in a moment the goldenhaired girl was bending over the bed caressing her bosom friend and murmuring soft words of affection youre such a brave brave woman inza she exclaimed oh you make me feel like a coward come here hodge urged frank drawing his friend round to the other side of the bed heres the boy here he is frank hodge merriwell frank hodge merriwell echoed bart fumbling for merrys hand and grasping it with an almost savage grip youve given him my name we did it both of us together old man merry i i dont know what to say stammered bartley youve completely upset me its the greatest honor there there smiled frank dont splutter and mumble like that old fellow you dont have to say a word just make a bow to the newborn king elsie was not one to gush but with clasped hands and flushed face she expressed her admiration for the child you ought to feel proud bart she said you ought to feel almost as proud as frank proud laughed hodge why i i my chest has expanded three inches in the last thirty seconds proud ill bet my hat wont fit me hes a star the little rascal he has ze star on his left shouldaire said lizette shall i show it madame shall i show zem ze beautiful mark please do said inza the nurse loosened the childs clothes and exposed the small shapely shoulder there at the very base of the arm was a small perfectly formed pink fivecornered star i was right cried hodge theres been a wonderful addition to the universe a new star has risen its a birthmark said frank oh isnt it very strange breathed elsie it gives me a superstitious feeling of awe it seems to me that he is marked by fate to be something grand and wonderful it was so good of you elsie to come to me when i wanted you breathed inza and hodge he traveled so far oh everything is coming as smoothly as possible at the mines declared bart theres a firstclass foreman at both the queen mystery and the san pablo i could leave as well as not and the old trains couldnt run fast enough to bring me here after i received the wire from frank saying that elsie would be here you bet i was glad to shake the alkali dust out of my clothes youve done great things for me at the mines bart said merry everything now seems to be going right for me everywhere in the world the central sonora railroad is practically completed and the san pablo is paying enormously but these are not things to speak of on an occasion like this after a few minutes bart and elsie retired the nurse took the baby and frank lingered a while longer at the side of his wife on returning to the library elsie stood at one of the large windows and looked out upon the grounds and across the broad road toward the handsome buildings of farnham hall there was a strange expression of mingled happiness and regret on her fair face something like a mist filled her eyes hodge came up behind her and put his arms round her a penny for your thoughts elsie he said i dont think i could express them in words she confessed do you think me a jealous person bart jealous he exclaimed far from it but i am im jealous im dying of envy you you jealous of whom inza look how all the best things of life have come to her she has a grand husband who is doing a magnificent and noble work look at those splendid buildings every one acknowledges now that frank has done and is doing more for the upbuilding and the uplifting of american boys than any person has ever before done in all history inza is his wife and they have a son barts arms dropped at his sides and he turned away in surprise elsie turned and saw him move from her in a moment she had him by the arm what is it bart she exclaimed in dismay he shook his head seeming unable to speak tell me what it is tell me what i did to hurt you she commanded he faced her again looking deep into her blue eyes you called up the past elsie he said in a low tone i cant forget that once i thought frank loved you and you loved him youve confessed a feeling of jealousy toward inza oh no no no she said quickly you didnt understand me bart truly you didnt it was not the sort of jealousy you mean im not jealous of her because she is franks wife never never he seemed puzzled then what did you mean what did you mean he asked why cant you understand cant you see how it is fortune or fate or whatever you may call it has been against me against us bart have you forgotten how we planned on a double wedding have you forgotten forgotten cried hodge i should say not it was the bitterest disappointment of my life you know i urged you elsie i used every persuasion in my power but i could not consent i was an invalid and i feared my health would never return it has returned little sweetheart youre well again youre stronger and handsomer than ever before in all your life you put me off then but you cant do it now i wont let you you mean that i mean that when i left mexico i made a resolve i swore an oath if i go back there if frank wants me to go you will go with me bart you must go with me he repeated must i have said it look here elsie i know youre not jealous of inza because merry is rich oh no no as a rule i have told you everything my girl but i now confess that there is one thing that i have not told you i have a secret a secret from me yes a secret from you you heard frank state how well the san pablo is paying you heard him say that i had been faithful in my work for him perhaps you do not know that ere we entered into an agreement by which i took charge of his two mines and acted as overseer for both of them perhaps you do not know that we nearly quarreled elsie looked astounded nearly quarreled she exclaimed yes why how could you because he insisted on a certain condition in our agreement because he insisted that after a lapse of time and at the completion of the mexican railroad i should accept a third interest in the san pablo mine i fought against it i told him it was not right i even threatened to quit and have nothing to do with the work he wished me to perform he was inexorable unyielding i pointed out that my service was not worth what he offered i showed him that he could get experienced and expert men to do the work for an infinitesimal part of what he proposed to give me he asserted that he was not giving me this merely for my labor but on account of past favors and things i had done for him which could not be paid for in money even though i did not permit him to force me into consenting to take this share of his mine i finally remained and did my best i arrived in bloomfield three days ago the day i reached here he placed a paper in my hands that paper makes me onethird owner of the san pablo im rich elsie the future is assured for me and for you that very day i went to the town clerk and had another paper made out here it is he took a document from his pocket opened it and placed it in her hands why why what faltered elsie its a marriage license said bart ive made all arrangements and tomorrow god willing you and i will be made man and wife it was even as hodge had said on the morrow at her request they were married in inzas chamber chapter iii on the veranda it was a beautiful sunny morning some three weeks later inza and elsie sat on the broad veranda of merry home while lizette the nurse trundled the baby up and down beneath the shady trees on the broad lawn over at the east of farnham hall a group of laborers among whom were fully twenty of the farnham boys were completing the foundations for merriwells new manualtraining school building a glimpse of the distant athletic ground showed a number of boys hard at work on the track and the baseball field there was a look of serene happiness on inzas face while elsie was positively rosy after chatting a while they sat some moments in silence busy with their own thoughts finally their eyes met and inza laughed no one would ever dream now that you were at one time determined to be an invalid elsie she said determined to be exclaimed elsie why do you use that word inza why you remember that i laughed at you you remember i told you a hundred times that you would be well and strong again yes you were most encouraging inza and ill never forget how faithfully you stuck by me still there were reasons why i feared for my future health silly reasons oh no inza not silly you cant call them that you know my mother was never strong and she finally became a chronic invalid but your father oh he was a rugged man you know its said that girls generally take after their fathers and boys after their mothers but in my case it was different a thousand times my father told me how much i looked like my mother i had a picture of her and i could see i was becoming more and more like her every day youre a person who worries elsie when things are not going just right you give yourself over to fears for the future i have absolute courage and faith oh i know my failing admitted the goldenhaired bride you and frank were made for each other youre both courageous and trustful frank has done marvels for bart in the way of giving him unwavering confidence and courage you know bart used to be quicktempered resentful and inclined to brood he has learned through franks example to overcome such failings and hes now almost as confident and optimistic as frank himself i think bart will help me in that respect were both extremely fortunate said inza gravely if other girls could have such good fortune this world would be a happy place you are going to stay with us this summer oh i dont know bart thinks it his duty to return to the mines if he goes i shall go with him but frank says bart will not be needed there for three months at least youre not going to settle down to live in arizona or mexico elsie oh i dont expect well live there all our lives was the smiling answer but while duty keeps my husband out there i shall remain with him thats fine thats splendid but frank says there is no reason why bart should spend more than five or six months of the year at the mines frank wants you to have a home in the east here in bloomfield oh i hope we may cried elsie im sure bart would like that then youd better make your plans for it theres a fine building lot down the road and frank owns it you know you were married so suddenly we had no opportunity to make you a wedding present if you can induce bart to build frank and i have decided to give you that lot as a wedding present elsie sprang up her eyes dancing flung her arms round inzas neck and kissed her repeatedly its too much too much she cried for a few moments their words and laughter were mingled in such confusion that the record would produce a senseless jumble finally elsie sat down appearing utterly overcome oh what a glorious world she murmured what a grand inexpressible thing real true friendship is still such a gift is now dont feel that this is a case of charity laughed inza i want you here we want you here bart doesnt need charity his interest in the san pablo makes him independent he could buy a building lot anywhere he chose in bloomfield but it happens frank owns the best lot near us and our selfish desire to have you close by is one motive for the present selfish inza there never was a selfish bone in you or in your husband i understand and appreciate the spirit of the gift and im sure bart will oh wont it be the finest thing to plan our new house to watch while it is being built to furnish it and finally to move into it and start with a real home of our own again they were silent amid the trees birds were calling mate to mate a proud redbreast danced across the lawn pausing to capture a fated insect then flew up into one of the trees to feed its mate upon a nest elsie was watching the maid now bending over the carriage and crooning softly to the baby did you ever notice how queerly lizette does her hair inza yes ive noticed was the answer there are several queer things about her her skin is strangely dark almost as if stained and i know she makes up her eyebrows sometimes ive noted that her french when she speaks in her own language is anything but correct yet she seems a girl of some education her intonation is occasionally a trifle different from that of most french people ive met but shes very faithful yes she is very faithful and very kind with the baby but i believe lizette has a secret a secret yes why do you think that occasionally she looks at me in the most peculiar manner ive caught her looking that way several times once i discovered her glaring at franks back in a way that was almost savage how singular what do you suppose it means oh i dont know unless it may be that she envies frank and me it may be that some time she was disappointed by an unfaithful lover poor girl breathed elsie if such is the case i think i realize how she feels but look inza here come the boys now theyre coming over from the hall the boys were frank and bart who were approaching side by side two splendid specimens of american manhood chapter iv a maid of mystery frank and bart waved their hands and lifted their hats hodge dashed up the veranda steps to join his wife while merry paused to bend over the baby carriage why hes wide awake laughed merry as he surveyed the baby hes chipper and bright as a newminted dollar but he isnt raising much of a racket oh he has ze most splendid tempaire for ze baby zat i evaire see said lizette he no make ze cry ze squawk ze squeal all ze time like some babeez when he is hungaire he hollaire some zat is naturaile quite laughed merry when im hungry im inclined to put up a holler myself hey hey toddlekins youre getting a dimple he touched the babys cheeks and the tiny hands found and grasped his finger a moment later that finger was in the babys mouth hold on you cannibal protested frank in great delight youre trying to eat your own father havent you any heart or conscience havent you any feeling for your dad i believe hes hungry now lizette i believe hes perishing lizette youre starving him oh oh monsieur cried the nurse i nevaire starve heem he have all he need you gif heem too much he git ze colic he git ze cramp you make heem sick you know how to feed ze big boys to make zem strong and well but you know not how to feed ze baby you leave it to lizette she takes ze perfect care of heem i fancy thats right lizette said merry straightening up and looking at her youve proved that you know your business ill remember you well my girl but say lizette what makes you do your hair so queerly what makes you hide your ears with it the nurse seemed confused and bowed her head until he could not see her face fairly oh maybe i have ze very ugly ear monsieur eef not zat mebbe i like ze way i do ze hair you know one time ze many girl do ze hair zis way like cleo de merode well you dont need to advertise yourself and that was one of cleos advertising dodges have you a brother a brothaire yes why you ask it because theres something wonderfully familiar in your appearance because ive either seen you before or some one very much like you have you a brother i have not ze brothaire then it must be a coincidence but somehow i seem to remember dimly a boy who looked like you i may be mistaken i have neither the brothaire nor the sistaire i am all alone in ze world monsieur i have ze hard time to geet ze living once it gif me ze great work well dont worry about that any more my girl we need you right here at merry home inza was calling to him and frank hastened up the steps i didnt expect youd be able to come so soon frank said his wife as he drew his chair close to hers oh i arranged it to get off early this forenoon hodge has been helping me diamond and browning are still hard at work keeping the boys pegging away everything is going well at the school things couldnt go better i dont know a boy who hasnt made great improvement although some have done far better than others each day it seems that they take hold of the work with fresh enthusiasm and energy youve got a great baseball bunch there merry said hodge i dont wonder they trimmed everything in their class hereabouts as a pitcher that fellow sparkfair is the real article frank nodded youre right sparkfair is a wonder but i cant quite fathom him confessed hodge if ever i saw a deceptive young scoundrel its that chap at times hes so meek and modest that he dazes me at other times hes so flippant and forward that i want to collar him and shake him out of his clothes i wouldnt know how to deal with him frank in some respects it was a problem with me confessed merry but fortunately i struck on the proper course once i found out how to manage it was not hard to handle sparkfair he raised a lot of dust when he first landed at farnham hall it didnt take him long to get arrested as a highwayman and right on top of that i had to kill a fine horse in order to keep the horse from killing sparkfair hes as full of queer quirks and unexpected moves as an egg is full of meat if theres a practical joke perpetrated i generally look for sparkfair at the bottom of it about nine times out of ten i find him there still hes not malicious and in a case of emergency i believe i can depend upon him to be on the right side for instance when the boys started a rebellion against manual labor sparkfair refused to join them and it was his scheme that put a prompt and ludicrous end to the rebellion i think hes a splendid boy said inza i took a liking to him the first time i saw him hes done a great deal in the way of helping young joe crowfoot along said frank theres another marvel exclaimed bart if any one except you were to tell me that your indian boy has made such astonishing progress from savagery to civilization in such a brief time id disbelieve the yarn ive been giving him points on his work behind the bat he grasps everything almost instantly hes remarkably apt nodded merriwell with his whole soul hes determined to learn everything the white man can teach him old joe swore the boy to this obedience and young joe has never faltered or hesitated still i know he is sometimes consumed with a longing for the wild life thats natural to one of his race at times he wanders alone in the fields and woods he takes pleasure in following the trail of any wild animal if he happens to find such a track as a trailer i believe hes almost as wonderful as a bloodhound the conversation wandered on to other topics and finally inza spoke of the wedding gift to bart and elsie hodge seemed quite overcome and unable to express himself not a word old fellow cried frank glancing at his watch and rising quickly come on if youre going into town with me are you going into town asked inza oh we wont be gone long smiled merry its a little matter that requires attention perhaps well bring back a surprise oh now youve aroused my curiosity i intended to arent you going to tell me what it is then it wouldnt be a surprise but i cant wait just like a woman chuckled merry give them a hint of a surprise in store for them and theyll badger you to death until they spoil the surprise lets take flight bart lets get away before the girls coax it out of us he snatched a kiss and sprang down the steps followed by hodge i think youre real mean cried inza you just wait and see if i dont play it back on you ill have a secret some time and keep it from you impossible said merry no woman ever kept a secret especially from her husband put in hodge oh youll see youll see threatened inza but the two laughing young men disappeared round the corner now id just give anything in the world to know what theyre up to said inza arent you dying to know elsie i am but still i think ill survive was the answer proceeding to the stable merry called toots who promptly appeared jerking off his cap and bowing as he showed his teeth in a grin howd do marsa frank good mawnin sah he said howd do mist hodge what ken ah do fo yo dis lubly mawnin hitch the span into the surrey said merry i want you to drive us to the station while the colored man was hitching up frank and bart talked i heard some of the things you were saying to that french nurse girl merry said hodge you seem to have an idea that youve seen her before i cant get over the feeling confessed frank still it doesnt seem so much as if id seen her as it does seem that ive seen some one like her you asked her if she had a brother yes she said no yes do you think that she told you the truth i had no reason to think otherwise you trust her she seems perfectly trustworthy to me well you may be right in old times i was forever suspecting some one you trusted in most cases i was wrong and i suppose i am wrong this time then you suspect lizette i have a queer feeling about that girl i cant give my reasons for it merry still after you were through talking with her a little while ago and you started up the veranda steps i saw her give you a queer look behind your back what sort of a look i cant describe it she just flashed you one daggerlike glance with those black eyes oh well that meant nothing are you ready toots yes sah all ready sah git right in gemmans whoa dar flossie dont yo git so nimpatient stop yo dancin old girl youre gittin dick all fretted up frank and bart sprang in and took the rear seat in a moment toots was on the front seat and the horses clattered out of the stable chapter v the surprise the eastbound express drew up at bloomfield station among the passengers who got off was a slender gravefaced young fellow who carried a satchel and whose hand was grasped almost as soon as his foot reached the depot platform it was frank merriwells old friend berlin carson how are you berlin old boy cried frank shaking that hand warmly heres hodge bart hodge followed frank in giving the traveler a handshake by george im glad to see you carson he said the young mans grave face brightened and a look of seeming sadness vanished from his eyes as he surveyed merry and hodge glad doesnt express it with me he said i cant find words fellows by jove youre both looking fine and happy as lords hodge ought to look happy chuckled merriwell just married you know elsie bellwood youve named her nodded frank shes the bride congratulations bart old boy said carson again wringing the hand of hodge but hasnt frank put you onto the other event asked bart theres a new merriwell in bloomfield a new merriwell three weeks old and you never sent me word frank said berlin with a slightly injured air how could i didnt know your address last i knew you were not on the ranch no i havent stayed on the ranch much since fathers death and since carson broke off abruptly as if his lips had nearly uttered something he did not care to speak about you were en route when i received your wire berlin explained merry you couldnt expect me to answer it you know of course not its all right merry merriwell led carson toward the waiting surrey toots was standing on the platform holding the horses i believe youve met toots berlin said frank howd do mist carson howd do sah bowed toots his cap promptly coming off his kinky head long time since ahve seen yo sah an ah don beliebe ahd known yo yos monstrous changed monstrous changed i suppose i have changed toots said berlin it was true and both frank and bart had taken note of it carson was much thinner and there was a certain wan and weary look about him merriwell had arranged that his assistants browning and diamond who were also old schoolfellows of carsons should be at merry home when berlin reached there and there was a great handshaking and much exclaiming over his appearance i salute the little mother said the westerner as he bent over inzas hand and kissed it and the bride too he exclaimed as he greeted elsie merriwell hodge let me shake hands with you again my grip must say the things my lips cannot wheres the baby questioned frank lizette has taken him in answered inza hes asleep now oh this was a surprise frank im still angry at you and yet im glad you didnt tell me and thats like a woman too smiled merry come carson ill show you your room you look pegged out but a washup and something to eat will brace you later on well have a royal chat over old times then ill show you through farnham hall and around the grounds berlin was left in his room off which there was a bath instead of hastening to wash up when merry was gone carson sat down on a chair and the expression of weariness crept back into his sad eyes and i might have been as happy myself he murmured i suppose it was not to be i know im a fool but i cant forget i cant forget after a few moments he arose and made preparations to descend at the head of the stairs he came face to face with lizette who was coming up he gave her a glance then stopped as if turned to stone like a flash he seized her arm bessie he exclaimed bessie you here lizette fell back against the wall her face gone white and her lips parted her free hand fluttered up to her heart and for a few moments she was speechless finally she forced a little laugh oh how you frighten me monsieur she exclaimed you catch me so queek by ze arm and your feengaires hurt carson released his hold but blocked her path bessie he repeated but this time there was a note of inquiry in his voice the girl seemed bewildered but she shook her head zat is not my name monsieur it is lizette i am ze nurse that face those eyes breathed the agitated young man that voice also bessie you cannot deceive me you gif me ze fear said the nurse shrinking away you look so very strange why you glare at me wiz ze eye why you keep calling me bessee are you not bessie my bessie you haf ze very strange idea in your mind saire i nevaire saw you before berlin carson was like one dazed and utterly bewildered to all appearances he had badly alarmed the girl as he faltered in seeking further words she suddenly brushed past him and fled her softfalling feet making no sound for fully three minutes carson stood there without speaking finally with his hand on the banister he started to descend the stairs am i deceived he whispered huskily no by heaven it is she chapter vi the face in the watch at lunch carson was strangely silent and abstracted the raillery of his friends failed to awaken him into anything like liveliness he smiled a bit at their jokes and chaffing but any one could see those smiles were forced i should say it was high time you got away from the wild and woolly west cried jack diamond ive heard that loneliness on the ocean or the plains makes a man gloomy and by jove i believe its true cowboys and cattlemen are not gloomy returned carson as a rule theyre a jovial goodnatured set who thoroughly enjoy a joke or a bit of humor its not loneliness on the plains that affects me if theres anything the matter with me anything the matter with you rumbled browning why in the old days you were always lighthearted this is the first time ive ever seen a depressed mug on you let me alone and i presume ill come out of it said the young westerner im sorry if im casting a shadow on an otherwise happy gathering i didnt mean to oh youre all right carson i should say your liver might be out of kilter you need something to stir it up if theres anything that will stir up a mans liver more than a hundredmile jaunt on horseback id like to know what it is ive been taking plenty such jaunts this spring although i havent been at the ranch for a month i was there when the snow came off and rode the range with the rest of the boys to find out how our cows had come through the winter dont suppose youve been troubled any more by cattle thieves since the demise of that fake laramie dave questioned merriwell no we put an end to the business in our parts we had you to thank for it you were the one who discovered how our brand of the b s was being turned into the flying dollars brand you stopped cattle stealing in the big sandy region things were hot around there for a while werent they berlin laughed frank i havent heard about this said diamond whats the story carson looked disturbed i dont like to tell it he confessed still i dont suppose frank would give himself proper credit if he should tell you did you ever hear of laramie dave the rustler my dear fellow ive been living on the other side of the pond so long that i havent heard of anything taking place out in your part of this country who was this laramie dave the worst rustler known in recent years he carried on most of his operations on the big ranches to the north of us he operated extensively in wyoming and in montana at last the cattlemen became exasperated and made things hot for him up there next we knew laramie dave was said to be getting in his work in colorado we lost cattle right along on the big sandy and the bar s people had the same trouble the flying dollars people also made a similar complaint the flying dollars ranch was owned by colonel king there was an old feud between my foreman and the foreman of the flying dollars i was with merry in denver when i received word that the rustlers were hitting us hard and i struck out for the big sandy frank accompanying me we found our fences were being cut everywhere which permitted our cattle to stray or to be driven off we rode over our ranch took a look at the bar s cattle and visited the flying dollars the night following our visit to the flying dollars merry sat up scrawling on a piece of paper in an aimless way while i went to bed he woke me from a sound sleep by uttering an exclamation of triumph i think i growled at him but he made me get up and there on the paper he had drawn the different brands of the three ranches the bar s the big sandy and the flying dollars he had combined all three brands into one he showed how either the bar s or the b s could be turned into the flying dollars by having the latter brand burned over them but every one in those parts respected colonel king no one had ever dreamed that he was concerned in the rustling nevertheless merrys detective work put us on the right track and in the end we learned beyond question that king was stealing and rebranding our cattle his assertions that he was losing cows were lies the climax came when a posse of officers and detectives cornered laramie dave and some lead was pumped into him colonel king was a grayhaired respectablelooking man while laramie dave wore long black hair and a drooping mustache but laramie daves mustache was false and his long black hair was a wig which covered the white hair of colonel king king was the real cattle thief he was not however the real laramie dave who was still up in wyoming somewhere he had simply made himself up to look like laramie dave in order that the genuine rustler might get credit for the cattle stealing thats the whole story sounds like a romance or a bit of fiction observed diamond dont suppose such business could be carried on in the west at the present time we put an end to it as far as colorado is concerned nodded carson merry deserves the credit for rounding up the last of our big cow thieves let me see murmured merriwell colonel king had a daughter didnt he what became of her berlin carson shook his head no one knows he replied she disappeared after her fathers death after lunch they again sat on the veranda and chatted a while finally frank bruce and jack went over to farnham hall to attend to their duties there show berlin over the grounds hodge said merry as he was leaving ill take him through the buildings myself later on hodge and carson strolled about that afternoon first visiting the picnic grove and from thence turning toward the lake and the boathouse at the boathouse they rested a while for the spot was cool and inviting id like a camera said carson jingoes bart a fellow could get some great views here the scenery is soothing thats the word for it soothing it gives me a feeling of rest then take your time and rest as much as you like said bart since coming here ive had my first opportunity in months to rest i never fancied there was a lazy streak in me but im getting lazier and lazier every day im afraid it would spoil me to hang around here long i wouldnt have any relish for arizona alkali or mexican dust and sunshine they sat in one of the boats that drifted beside the boathouse float carson dabbling his fingers in the water it is a lazy spot he murmured i should think merriwells boys would get the tired feeling oh some of them do smiled hodge but frank wont let them loll around long enough for it to become chronic he keeps them up and doing after they had been there nearly an hour bart felt for his watch and found he had left it at the boathouse what time is it carson he asked the young westerner drew forth a huntingcase watch and opened it nearly three he said then he sat staring at the watch but bart observed it was not the face of the watch at which his companion was gazing with a dreamy faraway look in his eyes leaning forward a bit hodge discovered that on the reverse side of the open front case there was a pictured face that of a girl finally with a faint sigh carson closed the watch and slipped it into his pocket you and frank are very fortunate very happy bart he said and again began dabbling in the water with his fingers i know your secret now thought bart theres a girl behind it by jove berlin old man youre hard hit chapter vii a black samson the sound of boyish voices at a distance finally aroused them it must be the baseball squad over on the field said bart dont you wish to go over carson eh did you speak to me asked berlin glancing up from the pellucid water hear those chaps over on the field yes we havent looked that field over you know its very interesting you havent begun to inspect things yet my boy you want to see how merry has fitted up for all sorts of sports here you ought to see the bathhouse and the little clubhouse the stand the track the diamond and the field in general i suppose so carson displayed very little desire to move well come on urged hodge without protest berlin stepped from the boat to the float and followed bart in a short time they were on the athletic field what do you think of it asked hodge with a sweep of his hand just take a good look its a splendid field i should say but i dont see where the people are coming from to fill that stand over yonder bart laughed that does look like a problem doesnt it the stand is almost large enough for a city race track all the same it has been crowded more than once this season it doesnt seem possible certainly it doesnt why it looks as if the stand could accommodate the whole of bloomfield and have room to spare merry doesnt draw on bloomfield alone there are lots of towns around here and theyre already hot on athletics wellsburg isnt so far away and more than once wellsburg has sent trainloads of people down here pittston is larger than bloomfield and pittston has the fever i understand the citizens of this little town thought merry crazy when he built that stand theyve changed their minds since no one besides frank merriwell could build a stand like that and bring out people to fill it in a little country village his oldtime magnetism is as strong as ever he draws people to him whatever he does he arouses them and they come out like magic thats right this was a sleepy village if i ever saw one in fact this was the sleepiest burg i ever did see i was here you know before farnham hall was built i was here before the old merriwell house was remodeled and turned into merry home this field was an uneven rocky strip of land and the lake down yonder was half drained the dam having fallen into disuse the metamorphosis seems almost as surprising as the magic changes worked by aladdins lamp frank is the modern aladdin he has the lamp hidden somewhere im sure of it at the bathhouse they found the big colored man jumbo who bowed most respectfully to hodge hello jumbo said bart how are your muscles today well sah grinned the darky dey am not painin me so much as dey uster was no sah marsa frank he sorter finds plenty ob work fo to reduce de pain in mah muscles berlin said bart jumbo is so strong that his muscles actually ache unless he can have some strenuous occupation by which to employ himself the big negro grinned and winked at carson that was what ah tol marsa frank when ah

yah at last to the satisfaction of hodge carson was genuinely amused and he joined heartily in the infectious laughter of the big colored man chapter viii the substitutes after looking through the baths and the cozy little clubhouse bart and berlin mounted the stairs to the observation cupola of the latter from this point they could look down on the field or back toward farnham hall and merry home truly a most fascinating spot thats a grand old house of franks makes me think of the fine old colonial mansions of the south that was merrys idea in remodeling it nodded hodge although born in the north frank is a man of the whole country hes cosmopolitan he has absorbed the spirit of the south the east and the west hes in every way what you may call a representative american theres no question about the home atmosphere of those old colonial houses they make one feel sorry for the dinky finicky filigree houses built by most people in these days there was a shout from the baseball field below and looking down there they saw several boys scampering round the diamond somebody made a great hit then observed berlin it was a homer and evidently the bases were full thats the regular team at bat exclaimed hodge its playing the second team how many teams are there four in all although beyond the second team the other two are not particularly strong the second team fancies its as good as the regulars and it has beaten the regulars once lets go down a few minutes later they walked onto the field where a hot dispute seemed to be taking place guy featherstone the pitcher of the second team was furiously arguing with the umpire who threatened to put him out of the game put me out put me out dared feather youre robbing us anyhow youre giving sparkfairs bunch everything you passed bemis when i had him fairly struck out and that gave sparkfair a chance to make that hit before that we had three to one and were trimming them in great shape now theyre two runs ahead of us i suppose youve fixed it up with spark hes bound to win if he has to make a deal with the umpire to do it dale sparkfair a handsome lad with blue eyes broke into a merry laugh featherstone your head is as light as the front part of your name and as thick as the rear end of it he declared you know im not given to making deals with umpires all i ever ask for is a square show and ill have that or take to the warpath well what do i get what do i get snarled feather showing his teeth you cant bully everybody dale sparkfair i demand a square show myself i can tell when i strike a man out i put the third strike over fairly and bemis never wiggled at it kilgore called it a ball and filled the bases the umpire was a boy with a queer crooked mouth one corner of which twisted up while the other drooped you seem to think everybodys crooked featherstone he said angrily im not umpiring this game for fun but because you you asked me to i didnt suppose you were another of sparkfairs sycophants flung back featherstone youre as crooked as your mouth an instant later had not sparkfair and others held them apart kilgore would have struck featherstone stop where you are both of you commanded dale sternly well have no fighting here on this field hell have to swallow his words or ill punch him for them ill play no further with that fellow umpiring declared featherstone i am going to stop right here and i think some of the rest feel the same come on boys lets quit the quitters will quit came from sparkfair but i dont believe there are many quitters here feather guy walked out and called for his men to follow him off the field im with you said one of them i think youre right feather and im done yes take booby along with you feather said dale i thought likely he might hoist the white flag well stop the game sneered featherstone the team cant play without us kilgore can forfeit to you and you may feel as proud as you like over your victory perhaps well be able to pick up a pitcher and a second baseman to fill the vacancies said sparkfair looking around wholl volunteer any one will do we want to finish out this practice game come carson urged hodge lets you and i go into that game ill pitch and you play second im all out of practice said berlin and im not a pitcher you know reminded hodge we can limber up and have some amusement anyhow he offered their services and his offer was promptly accepted by the second team not a little to the dissatisfaction and dismay of featherstone im the captain of that team cried guy and i order it off the field bart walked up to the angry boy placed a hand on his shoulder and looked straight into his eyes im afraid youre just what sparkfair has called you my son a quitter said hodge in a low tone the rest of the boys are going to play you and your friend had better run over to the hall trot along now muttering and growling featherstone turned away hodge and carson removed their coats vests collars and neckties and prepared for business how does the game stand asked bart as he walked out to the pitchers position score is five to three against you and this is the sixth inning answered sparkfair you have your last turn at bat how many men out two come here catcher invited bart ill have to know your signals walter shackleton hurried to meet hodge and explained his system of signals bart listened and nodded give me a few minutes to get the kinks out of my arm sparkfair he asked as he again resumed the position at the pitching plate sure sure smiled dale go ahead and unbend your wing hodge threw a dozen balls to brooks at first then with lander the next batter standing back he sent two or three over the plate to shackleton all right he finally nodded play called kilgore jake lander stepped into the batters box and smashed the first ball pitched by bart he drove it whizzing past hodge who did not have time to touch it carson trapped it cleanly scooped it up and threw it to higgins at first out shouted kilgore great support berlin old boy laughed bart as the second team trotted in and sparkfairs nine took the field now we want to take a little fire out of this bright spark boys said bart we need a couple of runs right off the reel whos the first hitter i am answered sam higgins whats your position on the list third all right play your own game higgins stepped out and swiped rather wildly at the first two balls missing them both make him get it over my boy urged bart with sam anxious to hit sparkfair did his best to pull him on wide ones but higgins let them pass and three balls were called now you have him where you want him came from hodge if he doesnt cut the pan you will saunter sparkfair attempted to cut the pan with a swift one but higgins hit it it was a hot grounder to netterby who fumbled it long enough for hungry sam to arrive at first in safety tommy chuckleson and sam scrogg were on the coaching lines were off again shouted scrogg off again on again gone again piped chuckleson its up to you balloon dont take an ascension abe bunderson nicknamed balloon was the next man to strike ere he left the bench hodge whispered in his ear bunt my boy you know what joe crowfoot can do throwing higgins cant steal sacrifice him to second balloon nodded he obeyed instructions bunting rather awkwardly yet skillfully and sacrificing himself at first while higgins took second hodge next called the scorer youre up against it now sparkfair came from lawrence graves as bart stood forth to the plate im scared to death laughed dale see me tremble see me vibrate the infielders crept in for a bunt while sparkfair pitched a swift high ball hodge attempted to drop the ball just inside the firstbase line but made a foul tip and the sphere plunked into young joe crowfoots mitt dont pick em right off the bat joseph remonstrated bart if you get so close youll catch the ball before i have time to hit it the indian boy smiled grimly mebbe that keep you from tying score he said sparkfair worked cautiously with hodge and as a result two balls were called after this first strike walking is easier than running spark reminded bart then i think ill let you chase said dale i hope you chase the ball instead of chasing round the bases hodge was watching dales every movement he saw sparkfair hold the ball covered by his hands close to his mouth evidently the pitcher intended to use the spit ball nevertheless something warned bart that dale had turned the ball over and grasped the dry side his pretense of trying a spit ball was all a bluff whiz the ball came whistling from sparks fingers crack hodge met it fairly on the trademark away away away sailed the sphere passing far over the head of thad barking the center fielder who had turned and was running as fast as his legs would carry him guy featherstone and booby walker had paused at a distance to watch the game a few moments featherstone uttered a furious exclamation of anger im glad he hit that ball and yet it makes me mad he grated i might have done the same myself just look at that just look at it its a home run it ties the score he was right chapter ix sparkfairs hit sparkfair sat down on the pitchers plate and watched hodge circling the bases hereafter he observed with a doleful grin ill put my fielders over in the next county when you come to bat barts hit reminded dale of dick merriwells first appearance at fardale he recalled the fact that dick had come to bat in the ninth inning with two men out the bases full and three runs needed to tie the score merriwell managed to connect with the ball after two strikes had been called he drove it far over barkings head clearing the sacks and coming home himself thus winning the game by a single run that recollection was decidedly unpleasant to spark if i get to ruminating on such things ill spring a leak and weep real tears he muttered as he rose to his feet from the distance guy featherstone shouted yah yah youre not so much sparkfair youre pie for a real batter with this parting taunt feather took booby walkers arm and led him away both disappearing into the bathhouse tommy chuckleson was the next hitter to face dale why cant i do something like that exclaimed chuck if i could ever hit the ball hard enough youd see me making a record round the bases just set a few mice after you and youd make a record all right laughed dale in return then he proceeded to strike tommy out in short order lawrence graves his face as expressionless as a doormat came up and batted a weak one into the diamond being thrown out with ease the sixth inning ended with the score tied hedge returned to the pitchers slab were going to trim you today spark asserted walter shackleton as he crouched froglike behind the bat there are no quitters on the team now dont alarm me please dont implored dale its most unkind shack fred hollis was the first one up he batted a grounder through bubbs and reached second then came brooks who romped to first on an error by netterby although hollis was held at second joseph said hodge as young joe crowfoot stepped out i know your noble grandsire and for his sake im not going to work you very hard today ill let you go right back to the bench in a moment mebbe so muttered young joe we see then he picked out a good one and lifted a long fly into the field hold your bases hold your bases shouted the coachers at hollis and brooks bunderson really looking something like a balloon with his round body made a hot run for the ball and pulled it down close to the foul flag a moment before the ball struck in the fielders hands both coachers shrieked run even as the ball landed in bundersons grasp hollis and brooks were off abe lost a little time in turning to throw toward second this lost time enabled brooks to reach the sack safely while hollis landed on third crowfoot skipped down to first hoping his fly might not be caught but he turned back in disappointment i told you id let you rest joseph my boy said bart you near make bad mistake retorted the young redskin you near guess wrong that time i confess it nodded hodge you gave me a heart throb when you smashed the sphere we need these runs barking called sparkfair as the next batter walked out its a deuced poor game dont you know said barking im really getting sore on it by jove i wish they would take up cricket mr merriwell ought to introduce some good english game into this school hello said hodge heres a pickle from piccadilly heres a blooming britisher in his mind what are you going to do to me johnny bull barking was actually flattered he enjoyed being mistaken for an englishman aw he drawled its such a blooming bother to run bases i rawther think ill walk dont you know he did in spite of barts best efforts thad waited undisturbed and was finally passed to first on four balls if i had my hat with me id take it off to you johnny bull said hodge youre clever altogether too clever for us poor unsophisticated yanks how long have you been over how long has he been over sneered sim scrogg from third why he never saw the atlantic ocean he was born inland and he has never yet been two hundred miles away from home play ball fellows play ball cried sparkfair the sacks are charged the pillows are peopled only one out nows our time to settle this game the new pitcher is a mark bump him bubbs little bob bubbs was a clever hitter and he connected with the ball all right this time he smashed it out on a line and the crack of ball and bat was followed almost instantly by the smack of ball and mitt as hodge pulled the sphere down with his left hand without losing a moment to transfer the ball from the left hand to his right bart snapped it over to scrogg at third catching hollis off the sack and completing a breathless double play for an instant the regulars seemed dazed for once in his life sparkfair could not find appropriate words and silently shaking his head he started for the pitchers position ho ho ho rumbled sam higgins as he lumbered in from first just fooling with you thats all just getting your courage up to take some of the swelling out of your heads at bat slick now faced sparkfair oliver pulled his cap down hard on his welloiled hair smiled a greasy smile and then struck out carson was the next man i dont believe i can hit a balloon he muttered to bart ere leaving the bench im all out of practice you know you didnt appear very rusty at the start off said bart berlin walked out fouled the ball twice and then lined it into left for two bags oh yes youre all out of practice laughed bart you cant hit a bit carson he was glad to see berlin laughing on second the old games making him forget his troubles thought hodge thats the main reason why i wanted him to play these back numbers seem to be onto your curves dale cried bob bubbs dont rub it in please dont implored sparkfair the way they slam me is simply awful i did think i could pitch a little but im afraid i was deceived he knew scroggs weakness however and forced sim to put up an easy infield fly which hollis handled shackleton batted one into right field and carson attempted to reach home on it sleepy jake lander was very wide awake and he made a line throw to the plate regardless of the fact that he was not in playing uniform carson slid crowfoot was there however and he promptly tagged berlin kilgore declared it a putout hodge laughed at carson and slapped him on the shoulder these kids know how to play the game old boy he said we mustnt forget that frank merriwell is their instructor and coach carson joined in the laugh i thought i had that score recorded on the score sheet he confessed in the eighth with one out and the bases full brooks drove in a run two men attempted to score however and the second runner was put out at the plate a moment later another man was caught off his sack making the third out but the regulars had the lead as a pitcher i dont seem to be a howling success laughed hodge i thought they were going to make half a dozen that trip weve got to get some now said carson if we dont i see our finish theres another inning we come to bat last but we cant depend on winning out in the last of the ninth thats right we do need runs once more sam higgins was up to lead off and bart spoke a few words of instruction in sams ear higgins picked out an opening in the infield and drove a ball through it bunderson bunted once more and was safe on bubbs bad throw to first look out spark look out cried the boys here comes hodge again sparkfair used all his skill to deceive bart and the boys shoots and curves were indeed enigmas hodge could not solve them and a great shout went up from the boys as dale finally struck him out chuckleson lifted a foul that dropped into shackletons mitt two gone spark two gone barked bubbs now you can hold em hodge whispered instructions to graves graves walked out held his bat on his shoulder and stood like a post while dale pitched somehow the very fact that lawrence seemed so utterly unconcerned appeared to rattle dale who finally passed him to first filling the bases too bad slick is next muttered scrogg as oliver took his turn at bat slick drove a sharp grounder at netterby who booted it into the diamond and a run came in before the ball could be recovered oliver was safe on first and the sacks were still full the score was tied once more carson walked out and laced out a handsome single which brought in two runs how featherstone would rejoice had he lingered muttered sparkfair theyre getting away with this game i must stop it i will in spite of this determination another error let in still another run and sim scrogg reached first at last sparkfair found a victim and shackleton fanned still to most of the boys the game seemed lost for the second team had a lead of three runs its our last chance fellows said dale gravely no fooling now no sacrificing weve got to hit the ball barely had he uttered these words when an inspiration came to him he called his players about him fellows he said neither scrogg nor higgins are swift in handling bunts we wont try sacrificing but well try bunting with the idea of bothering them dont bunt the ball where hodge can handle it drop it toward first or third lead off crowfoot young joe stepped out and bunted handsomely dropping his bat and scooting down the base line like a flash scrogg was seconds too late in securing the ball and sending it to higgins crowfoot was safe thad barking followed with an equally successful bunt hodge called higgins and scrogg in a bit look out for those tricks he warned bubbs glanced toward sparkfair inquiringly dale nodded bubbs followed with the third bunt while crowfoot and barking moved up nevertheless scrogg managed to secure the ball and throw towser out netterby attempted to bunt but popped up a little fly to hodge and followed bubbs to the bench i rather guess its all over said higgins the bunting game didnt work bemis looked doubtful but sparkfair still held to his instructions hiram obeyed and laid down a bunt on the line toward first unseen by any one scrogg hooked his fingers into crowfoots belt and held him at third the indian boy was angry and came near hitting sim hodge secured the ball too late to throw bemis out and the sacks were full once more crowfoot appealed to kilgore but the umpire had not seen scroggs trick and refused to penalize the second team on that account sparkfair was given a hand as he walked out to the plate once more dale thought of dick merriwells feat on his first appearance at fardale the situation was nearly the same two men were out the bases were full three runs were needed to tie the score and four to win youll have to check them bart said carson hodge did his best with sparkfair and it began to look as if he would succeed in striking dale out for spark missed two benders but dale did not strike out he finally found a ball that suited him and found it good it was a duplicate of hodges drive over center field the regulars whooped with joy as runner after runner came galloping over the plate they yelled like indians as sparkfair tore round the bases and came in from third four runs were secured and once more the first team had a lead of one tally thats where you got even with me sparkfair called hodge i had to do it laughed dale you struck me out before with the sacks cleared hodge seemed invincible for he quickly settled landers hash the game was not over for the second team had another chance nevertheless sparkfair was at his best and the three batters who faced him went down one after another hodge was the first to congratulate spark youre a good man in an emergency and such men win games he said thanks smiled dale dont mind my blushes i simply love to blush chapter x a moonlight meeting in truth the game had livened carson up and taken his thoughts from unpleasant things the remainder of the afternoon was fully occupied for merry showed berlin through the buildings and explained the methods of the school at dinner carson seemed much brighter and joined in the talk and laughter after dinner he accompanied frank and inza to see the baby little frank was sound asleep and one of the maids was watching over him wheres lizette maggie asked inza th poor crather do have a headache answered maggie she axed me would oi look afther th choild whoile she rested a bit a headache thats strange lizette has told me she never had an ache or a pain in all her life did yez notice maam if she touched wood whin she said it asked maggie i didnt notice thots it thots it declared the maid with conviction oim not superstitious but oi nivver brag about mesilf thot oi dont touch wood mark me worruds whin a person boasts and fergits to touch wood something happens to thot person i nivver knew it to fail a fine baby frank said berlin as he stood looking at the child you ought to be proud of him no peacock was ever prouder laughed merry we hope to make a star of him eh inza oh the star the birthmark exclaimed inza cant you show it to mr carson without waking the baby maggie oi kin try maam the maid gently slipped the clothes from the babys left shoulder and revealed the tiny perfectly formed pink star wonderful wonderful declared berlin why one would think it stamped there i never saw anything so perfect in all my life frank inza that child is marked for something great let us hope youre right said merry that night after retiring to his room carson sat a long time at the open window gazing out through the whispering trees toward the fall moon that was rising in the east the old feeling of sadness and disappointment stole over him and gave him a sensation of uncontrollable loneliness in the world i suppose i was mistaken about lizette he finally muttered i shall be able to tell when i see her again i hoped to see her when they took me to look at the baby rather strange she wasnt there still i presume its true that she had a headache finally he undressed donned his pajamas and got into bed sleep did not come readily at his command his brain was busy with many thoughts he recalled the old days at college when he first met frank merriwell in those happy days ere meeting bessie he was heartfree and carefree it seemed so long ago so long ago it was something like a dream dimly he recalled the classroom the campus and the field he saw his youthful comrades gathering about him at the old fence in the dusk of a soft spring evening he heard their light talk and careless laughter he heard them singing beneath the windows of the dormitories he heard them cheering on the field as old eli battled for baseball honors or struggled to win new gridiron glory ah those were happy days carson my boy they were the happiest you have ever known you did not appreciate those glorious days as they were passing but you appreciate them now and the memory is a precious one can such happy days as those ever again be yours then he recalled old times on the ranch he thrilled as he remembered his first meeting with darkeyed bessie how she had bewitched him how she had puzzled and fascinated him at the very first he had felt her fascination dangerous yet it was so delightful that he did not mind the danger thinking of bessie he finally fell asleep and dreamed of her on the bed he tossed restlessly murmuring her name he seemed to see her near at hand yet gliding away before him as he vainly sought to overtake her she turned her bewitching face and smiled at him alluringly desperately he strove to reach her but always she kept just beyond his grasp yet she beckoned him on with her smile and with her hypnotic eyes finally in mad desperation he made one last great leap and seized her he had her now she was his she could not get away in that moment of triumph a marvelous metamorphosis took place and as his arm bound her to his side he beheld her transformed into a boy she was no longer bessie but young tom king reckless taunting derisive and mocking in that mysterious way of dreams he now beheld himself gazing down upon a dying man who lay stretched upon the ground a bullet having passed through his body he knew the man it was colonel king the cattle rustler who had carried on his criminal work disguised as laramie dave there were other men standing about armed men the sheriff was there with his posse at last through the revelation and information furnished by frank merriwell this cattle stealer had been captured and shot and now he was gasping his life away and soon his stainspotted soul would stand naked before the judgment bar above through his dream if dream it was a voice sounded cutting him to the heart that voice cried you have killed him you devils then young tom king threw himself on his fathers prostrate body weeping bitterly carson attempted to lift the boy but once more before his eyes a change took place and tom king became lizette the french nurse he awoke shaking in every limb with cold perspiration on his face did i dream he hoarsely muttered or did i live the past over again there was no more sleep for him he rose and went to the window the cool night beckoned to him the soft moon smiled at him the whispering leaves said come out come out carson dressed softly descended the stairs and left the house he filled his lungs and stretched his arms the moon had mounted into the eastern sky and there were deep shadows beneath the trees the restless young man walked amid those shadows suddenly he paused startled by the sound of voices near at hand two persons were talking one voice hoarse harsh suppressed was that of a man the other was a womans voice what does it mean thought carson who is here at this hour i must know ill investigate cautiously he stole forward keeping deep within the shadows he had not proceeded far before these words spoken by the woman came distinctly to his ears i cannot i will not do it an instant later a shadowy figure came rustling toward him it was the woman and she was right upon him ere she discovered the silent man who stood there beneath the trees with a little gasp she turned and fled on a patch of moonlight shimmering through the branches had shown him her face the face of lizette chapter xi the truth his first impulse was to follow her then he stopped and stood waiting for the man the man did not come where is he who is he speculated berlin after a time carson turned toward the house shes in her room long ere this he thought but close by the wall a shadow lingered and as he approached this shadow suddenly moved forward and confronted him what is it you do here demanded the voice of lizette i know you see me i know you hear sometheeng why you watch me mon dieu would you hurt a poor girl carson took a firm grip on himself and was deliberate in speaking why should i wish to hurt you he asked you have done no harm have you oh no no no i haf done notheeng then why do you fear you watch me you follaire me if you have done nothing wrong you need not fear to be watched but it is not honerable to play ze spy on a girl i did not do so intentionally i could not sleep and i came out here to get the air it was wholly by chance that i ran across you who was with you no one monsieur tell me the truth commanded berlin still in that calm deliberate tone it is ze truth think again you place me in the awkward position of contradicting a lady you were talking with a man no but i heard him what deed you hear she fiercely demanded as she clutched his arm tell me what deed you hear heem say then you acknowledge there was a man oh what is ze use to deny oui oui zere was ze man who is he perhap maybe he is my lovaire perhap he has promised me to marry for one instant berlin seemed on the point of losing all his assumed selfcontrol his hands shook and he made a move as if he would seize her roughly he checked this movement just in time your lover eh he said well what sort of a lover is he who meets you in this sort of a manner at night why doesnt he see you like a man instead of sneaking around this way your lover girl what right have you to have a lover other than myself you call yourself lizette and you speak with an accent but i know you are bessie king i did think i might be mistaken but now im positive there is no mistake i am right you are bessie she threw back her head and laughed softly i hear ze madame say you are not well monsieur she said i theenk ze madame is right it must be een your head i am vary vary sorree for you you should not become so much excited i knew you were a wonderful actress bessie but you astonish me still when you lived on the flying dollars ranch you took delight in acting a part what is ze flying dollairs ranch he paid no heed to the question yes you were a great actress even then he went on colonel king had a beautiful daughter and he was supposed to have a son a harumscarum reckless lad who went galloping over the ranges with the cowboys roped cattle took part in roundups and did all sorts of things like that this boy was known as tom king colonel kings foreman injun jack had a grudge against frank merriwell and swore to kill him he found his opportunity and attempted to shoot merriwell in order to save merriwells life young tom king shot injun jack it was thought that jack had been instantly killed but while colonel king lay dying a few hours later and tom king was weeping over his father injun jack appeared and made a revelation that astounded every one the boy who had been known by that name was bessie king the colonels daughter you are that girl again lizette tried to force a laugh it is so strange a crazee notion she said why keep it up demanded berlin you must realize you cannot fool me even though by the change in your appearance by doing your hair in a peculiar manner penciling your eyebrows and staining your skin you have deceived merriwell himself he did not know you as i knew you look at me bessie have your eyes shown you no change in me have you not seen how altered i have become since your disappearance i never knew how much i loved you until you had vanished and i could not find you i have searched everywhere and every hour since your vanishing has been an hour of restless torture for me it seems to me that i loved you bessie as no man ever loved a girl before you gave me no opportunity to declare my love but i declare it now its as strong as it was then and stronger i swore i would find you some time i vowed you should be mine i have found you and i intend to keep that vow whats this little girl youre weeping you wont deny me longer you are bessie bessie my own yes she answered chokingly i am bessie chapter xii a heart laid bare it was the truth at last his heart leaped madly but when he reached for her she started back dont touch me came huskily from her lips you must not mustnt no why bessie i still you cant forget that i am the child of a cattle thief a criminal thats not your fault little girl i can forget it i have forgotten it its impossible she declared shaking her head such talk is folly bessie your fathers misdeeds should not blight your life i will not have it so you were innocent she turned her face toward him and those wonderful dark eyes looked sadly into his there were tears trembling on the long lashes you know im not foolish berlin carson she said in a strangely hardened tone in the old days on the ranch i was no softhearted lightheaded girl you were the most bewitching and fascinating creature the colorado sun ever shone upon there was always a mystery about you and it bound me with a magic spell the years since i saw you last have made that spell more potent and powerful still im the daughter of a man who rustled cattle he did not rustle them in the good oldfashioned way instead of that he stole them after the manner that a sneak thief picks a pocket he did his work by altering the brands he posed as another man he sought to lay all the blame on the shoulders of laramie dave a known rustler why talk of that bessie i lived on the flying dollars ranch dressed as a boy i rode the range with my fathers cattlemen who helped him rustle do you think i knew nothing of what was taking place do you think i was silly enough and soft enough to be deceived you must understand that i knew my father was a criminal carson shivered a little but it was not because of the cool night air in all the weeks and months since her vanishing in all his thoughts of her this thing had never occurred to him he had regarded her as the innocent unfortunate daughter of a bad man now however he sought an excuse for her he was your father and you had to protect him you could not betray your own father you must have suffered youre too kind too generous she hoarsely explained it was no effort on my part to keep his secret i knew what business he followed long years before i ever saw you i knew it long before he purchased the flying dollars down in texas he was a rustler but unlike other rustlers he did not squander his money he saved it and sent me to school in a boarding school i was regarded as the daughter of a wealthy ranchman i was popular with my girl schoolmates no one of them ever suspected that my father was a cattle thief and that i knew it for heavens sake stop commanded carson dont seek to degrade yourself in my eyes dont try to turn me against you in this manner im simply telling you the truth berlin carson do you wonder why i vanished after my fathers death do you wonder why i never faced you again you knew a part of the miserable truth had i been compelled to see you again i knew i would tell you all and i likewise knew what that meant what it meant yes you thought i knew it would shock you beyond words i knew the effect it must have upon you i could not bring myself to meet you well knowing that you would shudder and shrink from me he lifted his hand no no never he declared you were wrong bessie you were frightfully mistaken the trouble was that you did not understand me you did not know me it cannot be that you i should have pitied you and i should have loved you all the more even as i do now he asserted why not it was not your fault that your father was a criminal of course you had to keep his secret it was a cruel fate that placed you in such a position wait a little longer she urged you must know the truth every bit of it i admired my father i loved the danger and the thrill of that wild life not only did i know what he did but more than once in the darkness of night i aided him and his men in their work i was dressed as a boy and only injun jack and my father knew i was not a boy now you know what sort of girl you have fancied you loved i mingled with those men those desperadoes who were profane as pirates who were in a sense the pirates of the great plains a fine life for an innocent girl have you forgotten that my hands are stained with human blood have you forgotten it was my bullet that killed injun jack that was one of the bravest deeds of your life only for that frank merriwell would be dead only for your nerve and bravery in shooting that ruffian one of gods grandest men would have been murdered in cold blood since my college days i have loved and admired him above all other men when you saved his life by taking another worthless life you did a noble deed had you not fled i would have married you at the earliest possible moment i am ready now bessie chapter xiii the pledge of faith still it seemed impossible for her to believe she put out her hand toward the nearby wall of the house as if seeking support when he offered to give her that support she continued to hold him at bay youre a noble boy berlin she whispered you will make a noble husband for some girl for you no not for me then you do not love me you never loved me he panted you were toying with me you were deceiving me it was a part of your amusement you knew you had fascinated me and bewitched me and it gave you pleasure to toy with me ah this hurts more than everything else i did care for you she asserted faintly you did care in a way perhaps you never told me that you loved me because you would not give me a chance i never told you in words but my eyes told you so a hundred times ive seen others who talked with their eyes and kept silent with their lips and you thought me like them well no you were different i acknowledge that but you thought me fit only to flirt with that was it you took delight in arousing the fire in my heart that you might see it glowing from my eyes youre like them all they love to play with fire they love to lead a man on and then throw him down but i didnt think you just like every other girl i thought you different you have learned that i was different but in a way you did not suspect then you confess you were toying with me deceiving me he bitterly exclaimed a little while before she had sought to turn him against her by telling all the truth when that effort failed and he suddenly accused her in this manner she had fancied she saw the way to accomplish her purpose with a falsehood but now that she was face to face with it she faltered and could not lie i tell you i did care for you i cared for you more than words may express my fear in those days and it was the only fear i had ever known was that you would learn the truth about me and despise me do you remember the day that you brought frank merriwell to the flying dollars do you remember that you were left alone in the little library and in a book you found some verse i had written i used to write poetry in those days those verses were entitled my secret i was angry when i found you had read them and i tore them up i can quote the first stanza in a low musical voice she repeated the following lines when he comes riding up the valley i watch from my window nook my cheeks burn hot my heart is throbbing for a single word or look to tell me that he loves me truly but fear his lips will not be unsealed to whisper low the story that means so much to me its poor poetry berlin poor poetry but it expressed the longing of my heart and your lips remained sealed now he would have seized her and crushed her to his heart but with astonishing strength she clutched his wrists and held him back my lips are unsealed now he panted its too late she cried in a weak heartbroken tone too late why is it too late how can that be one thing you have forgotten you found me here playing a part do you think im pretending to be a french nurse merely as a whim merely as an amusement i cant understand that he confessed why is it she forced a laugh that was wholly without merriment perhaps this is only one of many parts i have played you called me an actress i am an actress on the stage of life i intended that no one should ever again recognize me as the daughter of colonel king i found it necessary to work to make my living somehow had i appeared here as bessie king do you think frank merriwell would have trusted me do you think i would be an inmate of his home oh no berlin i had to disguise myself to deceive him and it was necessary to play my part well even when i did my best i realized he knew he had seen me before some time somewhere once he questioned me once he asked me if i had a brother he was very very near discovering the truth then do you think i can have any feeling of friendliness for this man merriwell do you think i can forget that it was through him my father met his fate only for frank merriwell the real truth might have remained a secret in time the cattle stealing would have ceased my father would have sold the flying dollars and we would have gone elsewhere but merriwell came and his discovery brought the sheriff and his posse sometimes when i have thought of this ive longed to kill frank merriwell more than once i have said to myself his life is yours for you saved it once you should put aside such thoughts and feelings bessie you cannot blame frank he was my friend i brought him to the big sandy our cattle were being stolen as my friend he did his best to aid me oh i suppose its wrong but a person brought up as i have been finds it hard to distinguish right from wrong many of the things people recognize as right seem wholly wrong to me would you have a wife with such a distorted conscience berlin carson let me be your guide he pleaded let me teach you the right i tell you it is too late words seemed useless and he stood there gazing at her helplessly almost hopelessly a sudden thought struck him like a blow and he almost reeled there is another he hoarsely whispered ah ha thats it ive struck the truth at last its that man the man you met tonight speak up bessie tell me who he is by heaven you shall tell me i will in time she promised wait berlin please wait ive waited too long already have i waited simply to find another man in my place wait a little longer she urged i have promised to tell you all and i will cant you trust me a little longer berlin please please trust me a little longer she held out her hands in pleading and a moment later ere she could check him he had seized her and was holding her to his heart yes yes he panted i will trust you bessie ill trust you with my very life their lips met and then the heavens fell chapter xiv the signal for silence lizette was hammering at frank merriwells door wake up monsieur she cried mon dieu it is such a terrible theeng queek queek do come monsieur her knock and her cries brought frank forth in pajamas what is it whats the matter he demanded the voice of hodge was heard questioning the cause of the disturbance and bart came forth from another room lizette seized merrys arm oh come queek she implored i see it from my window i have ze bad headache so long i cannot sleep zen i geet up and sit by ze window i look out and see some one walking beneath the trees when he walk in ze moonlight i see it is ze monsieur carson zen all at once oh ze terrible theeng go on commanded frank all at once what i

on ze grass zen ze ozzer man he run away it did not take frank long to go leaping down the stairs and hodge followed him closely they tore open the door and rushed out within the shadow at the corner of the house they stumbled over a prostrate figure frank dropped on his knees its berlin he hoarsely exclaimed heavens is he dead hardly that merry came a faint whisper as carson stirred in franks arms what was it that fell on me it seemed as if the moon came down and burst upon my head i saw a flash of fire and heard a frightful explosion what happened to me some one struck you down from behind lizette saw it from her window she was sitting at the window and saw you walking here on the lawn she saw the man rush upon you and knock you senseless lizette muttered carson and then again in a queer tone he said lizette yes she saw it from her window questioned berlin from her window repeated frank have you been robbed carson the ruffian must have been a robber i presume he went through your pockets i dont know muttered the young westerner thickly let me see said frank he didnt take your watch and heres your purse why this is singular i wonder if he saw lizette i wonder if she uttered a cry and frightened him away lets find the whelp snarled hodge first lets find out how badly carson is hurt lets get him into the house together they lifted berlin and assisted him to the house between them inza was calling from the head of the stairs to know what was the matter lie to her merry said hodge dont let her get excited wait ill do the lying ill quiet her and elsie he hastened up the stairs carson sat on a chair and felt of his head with both hands frank struck a light and he examined to see how badly his friend was injured heres a bad bump he said but i dont believe your scalp is broken looks as if youd been struck by a sandbag whatever it was it put me out of commission mighty quick mumbled berlin goodness my head aches a whole lot im weak aplenty they heard bart telling inza and elsie that a man had been seen prowling around outside hodge was concealing the fact that anything had happened to carson he urged them to go back to their rooms no need of frightening them over me merry muttered berlin im all right my head is too thick to be easily cracked tell me just how it happened urged merry didnt lizette tell you yes but i thought she might be mistaken in her excitement did you see any one did you see who struck you no i didnt see him nor hear him nor hear him frank i heard nothing its doubtful if id heard a clap of thunder just then eh why not oh well you see i was id been id been thinking faltered carson how did you happen to be out there couldnt sleep went out to get the air well let me doctor that bump sit right still ill take care of you merry hurried away soon returning with a bowl of cool water and a sponge he also had some sort of soothing liniment hodge returned while frank was at work over berlin managed to calm the girls down and sent them back to bed he said then he took something from his pocket clicked it and looked it over whats that asked merry my pistol answered bart grimly im going out to look for the gent who did this little job dont go alone wait till i get carson fixed and ill be with you and that will give him plenty of time to get away weve given him too much time already frank dont worry about me ill take care of myself and ill take care of him if i find him bart went out are you feeling better carson questioned merry oh i tell you im all right was the answer as berlin tried to force a laugh who could be prowling round here speculated frank i wonder if a burglar was trying to break in that must be it said carson quickly did lizette describe the man no she said she barely saw him as he rushed out behind your back and struck you its strange that bessie should carson checked himself bessie questioned frank i mean lizette berlin hastened to say my thoughts are all in a jumble dont mind me if i get mixed up im all right now merry if you need a doctor i dont youve done everything a doctor could do then if youre all right i think ill go out and look around for hodge carson rose to his feet a trifle unsteadily im going with you he declared youd better not merry advised i must i want to youre still weak oh no im strong enough just see frank i can walk all right come on then said merriwell all around the grounds they searched finally finding hodge who stated that he had seen no trace of any one the rascal made good his escape said frank ill notify the sheriff first thing in the morning a while ago there were some burglaries in surrounding towns perhaps the crooks have decided to operate in bloomfield and it was natural they should pick out your house first merry said carson they turned toward the house and paused again beneath the very tree where berlin had stood when he heard the mingled voices of lizette and the unknown man as frank and hodge were talking carson turned away and walked a short distance toward the house stepping out from beneath the trees he looked up in an open upper window a face appeared distinctly shown by the moonlight it was lizette he gazed up at her and she looked down at him then she leaned forth from the window lifted one hand and pressed a finger to her lips he understood the signal and nodded she vanished and he saw her no more that night chapter xv kidnaped the following day lizette seemed strangely overcome almost prostrated by what she claimed she had beheld from her window the previous night professing that she was quite ill she kept to her room a great deal permitting maggie to care for the baby carson was restless and nervous and in his face his friends observed a strange look of eagerness which at times gave place to an expression of triumph or of doubt his injury proved to be comparatively slight frank reported the presence of the prowler and the attack on carson to the local authorities somehow an atmosphere of unrest and uncertainty a sensation of expectation in the face of some unforeseen calamity seemed to hover over merry home it was nearly midafternoon and inza was on the veranda with elsie near when maggie appeared looking puzzled and frightened shure maam she said oi wish yed come up and take a peep at the choild is anything the matter with little frank exclaimed inza hastily rising is he ill maggie nivver a bit answered the girl hes slaping loike a top but what is it you look so queer its quare oi feel maam oi left him in his little bed a whoile ago to take a bit av a breath which oi naded whin oi came back he was there all roight all roight but its moighty odd he looks to me inza followed maggie to the chamber where the child lay asleep lift the window shade and let in the light she said it happened that frank came over to the house a few moments later to get a book he needed and he was startled when his wife pale and shaking came flying down the stairs seized him by the arm and panted come frank this minute come quick the baby believing the child seriously ill merry lost no time in following his wife they found elsie beside the crib the baby lay there wide awake looking at them in a wondering way as they stooped above him why he doesnt seem to be ill inza said merry you frightened me i thought he was dying she clutched his arm with a grip that was almost frantic in its astonishing strength look at him she hoarsely cried look close what is it inza what do you see his hair cant you see the change the change yes yes his hair is lighter lighter yes lighter than little franks and his eyes his eyes are blue franks were brown great heavens its true burst from merriwell what does it mean inza what sort of juggling in this frank merriwell thats not our child he staggered as if struck a terrible blow not our child then who what child is it where did it come from you must be mistaken inza im not i know my own baby boy the star look for the star shouted merriwell almost fiercely he seized the babys garments and with one movement tore them from the tiny shoulder the mark of the star was not there merriwell straightened up and stood for a moment like a man turned to stone in that moment however while he outwardly seemed so inactive and dumfounded his brain was working swiftly wheres lizette he demanded and his voice was calm and cold wheres lizette maggie panted inza turning on the now thoroughly frightened servant in her room maam oi suppose was the answer find her said frank bring her here instantly maggie rushed away and soon returned with the announcement that lizette was not in her room by this time inza was so frightened that she was threatened with hysterics she almost fought elsie who was seeking to calm her let me talk to her elsie said frank he grasped his wife firmly yet gently holding her and looking straight into her eyes look at me inza look at me he commanded look me in the eyes even in her frantic condition she could not disobey him tremblingly elsie looked on seeing merry gaze intently into his wifes dark eyes inza said frank in that same calm masterful tone you must be quiet you must trust me ive never failed you yet ill not fail you now that is not our child but i will find little frank and bring him back to you sit here he lifted her bodily and placed her in a big easychair again he gazed intently into her eyes and beneath that gaze she rapidly grew calmer you know ill do what i have said i would inza you know it yes she huskily whispered i know it frank but im almost distracted im almost crazy dont lose a moment wait calmly and confidently when im gone ill have to leave you when i return ill place little frank in your arms he kissed her a moment later he was gone chapter xvi for the sake of old days a man and a woman were making their way through a strip of timber where the shadows were thick they were almost running the man being in advance he carried a bundle from which at intervals came a strange smothered cry like the wailing of an infant oh selwin selwin gasped the woman i cant keep this up im ready to drop now cant you go a little slower and have those human hounds overtake us snarled the man curse them theyre like bloodhounds on the scent ive tried every trick to turn them off our track ive doubled and turned ive crossed ledges and waded streams but i fear to hear them behind us any moment you were mad selwin mad gasped the weary woman whose garments were tattered and torn and whose hands and face were scratched and bleeding i told you how it would be i told you we could not carry this mad scheme through i will carry it through he grated if we can keep away from them until darkness falls theyll be unable to follow us farther but the whole country will be aroused we cant escape i say it was madness how in the devil did they find it out so soon i knew they would i knew it the other child looked enough like this one to pass muster for a few hours at least he interrupted satan take the brat hear it squall again a smothered cry came from the bundle dont hurt it pleaded the woman dont handle it so roughly hurt it furies id like to strangle it heres a path well follow that the path soon brought them into an old wood road and they mounted a wooded hill the woman desperately stumbling along at the heels of the man on the hillside they came upon a deserted hut through the trees they could see the sun sinking redly in the west oh stop selwin stop a little while entreated the fatigued woman lets rest here he halted and scowled as he stood in thought they should be somewhere over to the northeast he said i wonder if i could see them from the top of the hill ill try it here take the brat bessie ill be back in a few minutes he tossed the bundle into her arms whirled and rushed away up the hill the woman sat down on the trunk of a felled tree she opened the bundle and gazed sadly almost lovingly on the face of an infant the little eyes looked up at her seemed to recognize her and something like a smile came to the childs face poor little frank poor little frank she breathed its a shame a brutal shame oh why did i ever consent even though i have hated your father i love you its drink thats turned the brain of selwin harris the baby began to fret and cry youre hungry darling muttered the woman oh what brutes we are what a wretched thing i am ive always been bad and i always will be still a noble man loves me oh berlin berlin you will despise me now even though you loved me through all the past and for all of the past youll scorn and despise me now well what does it matter you found me at last and you forced the truth from my lips but it was too late too late bitter tears of mingled sorrow and shame welled into her eyes and blinded her they fell from her cheeks upon the cheeks of the fretting child oh frank oh little honey boy she sobbed i hope you may never live to know such wretchedness as i have known better that you should die now better you had never been born why was i born why was i set adrift in this wretched wicked old world not one thing in life has ever gone right with me a crashing sound gave her a start and she saw the man returning on a run as he passed a corner of the old hut one foot seemed to break through the ground and he went down with some difficulty he drew forth his leg from a hole into which he had plunged pausing he looked down into that hole and far beneath he caught a faint mercurylike glitter an old well he muttered the brush and deadwood had fallen over the mouth of it and hidden it i came near dropping in there myself are you hurt selwin called the woman no he answered but i came mighty near falling into a trap as he approached her she observed a look on his face that gave her a shuddery chill let me take the child he said no ill carry him a little while did you see anything of the pursuers see them he snarled curse them yes theyre still on our track following it like hounds like hounds there are four of them i know merriwell and hodge the other two are boys one of the boys is leading and he runs stooped forward with his eyes on the ground no indian ever followed a trail more accurately than he has followed ours no indian cried the woman you say he is a boy then it must be young joe crowfoot ive seen him hes one of the boys at merriwells school he is a fullblooded indian that accounts for it rasped the man that explains my failure to deceive them the rest of the pursuers are far away on the main road i saw them theyre in a carriage give me that child bessie he sought to take the baby from her what are you going to do she asked her hand shaking as she put it up to hold him off theres only one thing to be done if were captured with the child in our possession we go to the jug if the child is not in our possession and cannot be found we can swear we know nothing about it the other one youre still mad selwin harris would you murder this helpless infant murder yes theres murder in your heart in your face i see it look here bessie theres only one show for us to escape that kid has encumbered me frightfully i couldnt help you that child out of the way i can help you well dodge them until it gets dark ill drop the brat into that old well and pull the brush over the opening i can do it so that the well will not be found well go back a short distance on our tracks and then turn off theyll turn at the same point and follow us theres no time to waste let me have the brat she fought him with all her strength never never never she panted youll have to kill me first in a moment or two he realized that unless he beat or choked her into unconsciousness he could not take the infant from her youre a fool you always were he raged yes im a fool she flung back i was a fool to ever have anything to do with you back yonder somewhere in the carriage that is following us is a man who loves me a noble manly honest man i knew him first and he would have married me had i not run away from him id be his wife today and id be an honest woman you you an honest woman flung back the ruffian with a sneering laugh you an honest woman the daughter of a cattle thief laugh sneer taunt me fling my disgrace in my face and youre the man i once thought i loved i thought i did ha ha ha youve called me a fool its true i thought i loved you but now i hate you i hate you oh rats youre playing to the gallery now bessie well well have to move well have to hike lively the sun is almost down the shadows are growing thicker will darkness never come its come for me she groaned its in my heart its in my soul for me it is the eternal neverending night of sin disgrace and shame he clutched her arm and dragged her on again they stumbled and lunged and tore their way through the shadowy woods to their right the sun had dropped beyond the faraway hills flinging a last reddish glow up into the highest sky and this glow seemed temporarily to lighten the whole forest through a boggy spot they floundered through a jungle they thrust themselves and at last as the reddish sky was fading and turning to lead they came upon a rutty winding country road darkness shut down quickly a light gleamed ahead of them it came from the window of a house hitched to a fence corner in front of the house was a horse attached to an old wagon the man paused beside the wagon get in he commanded what are you going to do get in im going to take this team somebody who is calling at that house left it standing here it was left for us he lifted her into the wagon sprang to the head of the horse unhitched the animal and a moment later was by the womans side the horse was reined around into the road the man seized the whip and a moment later the sound of the animals hoofs mingled with the rattle of the wagon wheels night at last cried the desperate kidnaper now well dodge them somehow you cannot dodge them selwin said the woman i feel that were hurrying straight into their clutches why you fool theyre behind us i tell you well dodge them now why in blazes did i ever bother to take that other brat from the poorhouse where its mother died it was your plan to substitute one child for the other bessie i wanted to steal merriwells kid in the first place furies take him i swore years ago to strike at his heart when the time came he was responsible for the death of my brother they were at yale together this merriwell and poor old sport merriwell disgraced sport by exposing him as a card sharp sport sought to get even he followed merriwell to england and in england he died in his last letter to me he wrote that he had a premonition of his fate he said he felt sure that merriwell would do him up at last did frank merriwell kill him oh just the same as that i believe sport was killed in some sort of an accident while he was running away from merriwell ive waited a long time but ive struck at last satan take this hill he lashed the horse and the animal went galloping up the road that wound over the hill suddenly at a turn of the road two fiery eyes burst into view and through the night came the wild shriek of an automobile horn with an oath the man sought to rein to one side of the narrow road the fiery eyes were right upon them there was a crash the wagon was struck and smashed man woman and child were hurled into the ditch chester arlington a lad who despite his fathers wealth had been dismissed from school stopped his machine ten rods farther on are you hurt june he asked addressing his sister who numbered dick merriwell and dale sparkfair among her admirers no im not hurt answered the girl who was sitting beside him but i believe youve killed some one chester i told you that you would oh its terrible lets go back and see arlington removed one of the oil lamps from his car and they started back toward the scene of the collision another wagon came over the brow of the hill and stopped from a distance in the opposite direction came a sharp signal whistle that was answered by one of the three persons in the wagon thats merry exclaimed berlin carson as he leaped out i wonder whats happened here somebodys smashed up two minutes later young joe crowfoot frank merriwell bart hodge and dale sparkfair arrived they found a horse with the shafts of a smashed wagon attached calmly grazing by the roadside the wrecked wagon was in the ditch near by lay the body of a man a few yards away sat a woman holding an unharmed child in her arms weve got them frank said berlin carson as he took the lamp from arlingtons hand and turned the light on the face of the prostrate man heres the wretch who did it do you know him merry looked down hes dead said frank i think his neck was broken exclaimed carson i dont believe he realized what happened after the automobile struck the wagon do you know him frank ive seen that face before yes i think i know him his name his name is harris thats it why his brother was at yale you remember sport harris carson sure breathed berlin merriwell seized the child and the woman surrendered it to him im wicked she said put me in prison but i saved your childs life when selwin harris would have taken it lizette why did you do this thing asked merry what was that man to you he was my husband she replied im not lizette thats not my name i deceived you because he commanded me to put me in prison i hope they keep me there till i die carsons hand found that of merriwell merry he said huskily pleadingly this poor girl is bessie king i loved her once its dead now all the love i knew she has been more weak than sinful you have your boy safe in your arms youll take him back to inza youll keep your promise to her we were old comrades at college i would have done anything for you then and i would do anything in my power for you now for my sake let this poor woman go for my sake frank there was a hush frank stood there in silence for such a long time that every person seemed to hear the beating of his own heart at last merriwell spoke for your sake i will berlin he said chapter xvii a call to the flock protected from arrest by the pity of berlin carson whose love for her was as dead as was the man she had acknowledged as her husband bessie left behind her the home which for several hours she had plunged in grief and anxiety an examination of the infant which had been kidnaped showed that it had sustained no injury and filled with a spirit of thankfulness frank and inza merriwell resolved that the little foundling which had been substituted for their baby son should be placed in a more worthy home than was afforded by the asylum from which it had been taken in a few days such a home was found and the infant which had inspired frank and inza with such feelings of consternation when they had discovered that it was not their own was committed to the kindly care of a prosperous and honest young farmer and his wife who were childless and who lived only a few miles from the merriwell home but it did not take long for the sympathetic eyes of frank and inza to see that the ardent love of berlin carson for the young woman who had proved herself to be unworthy of him though now extinguished had left him moody and disinterested in the future and so one evening inza laying a hand on one of the arms of her husband said gently we must do something for berlin frank it is wrong for a man to brood so over a misfortune as he is doing is it not possible for us to do more to enliven him and cause him to think less of his disappointment and the shock he has received frank shook his head thoughtfully i scarcely see what more we can do inza he replied men are unlike women the grief of a woman may yield to the sympathetic words and actions and cheerful influence of friends but when a man has some great trouble especially if he be a strong man it is best that he should have an opportunity to make his fight against depressing influences alone he must have time to think it out all references to his sorrow are likely to irritate him and evidence of the pity of others galls his pride no no inza there is little that you and i can do i fear let us do our best to surround him with a cheerful atmosphere and that is precisely what i mean frank now i have a plan several weeks ago i heard you say that one day you might find it possible to have around you here many of the members of what you are so often wont to call your old flock your old school and college mates and some of your old friends from the southwest why do you not make an effort now to get them here frank gave a little start and then smiled thoughtfully i will think it over inza he said early the next morning frank sent out a number of telegrams to his old friends to these telegrams he received replies in the course of the next twentyfour hours and thus it came to pass that the pilgrimage to merry home began several days later in a parlor car of the eastbound express were four young people who had traveled far they were ephraim gallup his wife teresa barney mulloy and a charming and vivacious spanish girl juanita garcia teresas bosom friend the men were old friends of frank merriwell all wore sensible traveling suits and in spite of the long journey they appeared to be little fatigued there was an expression of eagerness and impatience on the face of gallup and mulloy seemed in a similar mood by gum were gittin back into gods country agin exclaimed the lanky vermonter arter bein buried down there in mexico so long it seems jest like heaven do they be afther callin this a fast expriss burst from mulloy faith but it crawls loike a shnail so it does will we iver reach bloomfield its itchin oi am to put me hands on frankie merriwell eet ees so glad

satisfied its a clane little pile av money we made in thot railroad business ephraim you bate chuckled the vermonter take us together barney and we make a hull team with a little dog under the wagon as a business partner said the irishman oill take a downeast yankee ivery toime begobs ephie ye know how to do business all roight all roight and as a railroad construction boss grinned gallup yeoure right up to date barney yeou handled your end of the business slick as a whistle while i was lookin arter my end i wonder what theyre stoppin here for the train was pulling up at a junction on questioning the porter they learned that there would be a stop of nearly twenty minutes while other cars were taken on from another route gallup proposed that they should step out on the platform and get some air neither teresa nor juanita seemed anxious to do this so ephraim and barney left them in the car the junction was a bustling little town and there was a great deal going on in the vicinity of the station mulloy and gallup lighted cigars and promenaded the platform at the far end they observed a group of men and boys surrounding a person who stood on a small square box making a speech this person was bareheaded and his hair was unusually long and disheveled he was dressed in a loose suit of lightcolored clothes wore a negligee shirt with a soft turndown collar and had no vest his back was toward barney and ephraim as they approached begorra its natural he looks muttered the irishman goldinged if that aint right agreed gallup somehow his voice sounds kinder nateral too they paused at the edge of the group to listen friends and brothers cried the speaker in a clear sad voice i presume many of you heard me speak on your public square last evening still it is possible that some of you were not there to listen to my words to hear my warning of the great coming clash of the classes it is as inevitable as the sinking of yonder sun tonight and its rise again tomorrow with a prophetic eye i look into the future and behold the day when labor shall have its rights that day is coming as surely as the sun continues to rise in the east the iron hand of capital would hold it back but that cruel iron hand cannot joshualike stay the course of the sun nor stem the tide of human progress every intelligent person within the sound of my voice knows it is true that the rich are growing richer and the poor are becoming poorer the accumulation of stupendous fortunes in the hands of individuals threatens the very foundations of our government time was when a man worth a million was supposed to be immensely rich today the possessor of a single million is looked on with scorn and contempt by our multimillionaires ten millions twenty millions fifty millions aye even a hundred millions are now accumulated by individuals this money belongs to the masses the laborers who have earned it by the sweat of their brows hear hear thats right hooray cried the crowd mulloy had gripped ephraims arm ivery word av thot has a familiar sound to me muttered the irishman oive heard thot talk before and from the same lips my friends continued the speaker we are all brothers justice to one and all of this great human family should be our motto unfortunately for me i was not born of the masses as the royal knights of labor are now called by the american aristocrats of boodle by birth i was supposed to be exalted above the lower strata of humanity my parents were wealthy my father gave me an education to be a slave driver over the common people his blood runs in my veins but my heart is not of his heart in his eyes i have become disgraced because i dared boldly claim the street laborer the man with the hoe the man with the pick and shovel the man with the sweat of honest toil on his brow i have dared to claim him as a fellow man and brother i have traveled from coast to coast and i have lived in the poorest quarters of new york chicago and other great cities my heart has bled at the sufferings of the poor people who are wearing their wretched lives away in toil for a most wretched sustenance the friends i once knew have turned from me and called me a socialist an anarchist they call us anarchists because we sympathize with the downtrodden masses because we prophesy the coming of the great struggle that shall emancipate these masses we are not anarchists but we are proud to be called socialists anarchy is disorder and ruin socialism is order and equal rights for all let them point the finger of scorn at us what care we but let them beware for the great earthquake is coming mulloy and gallup had forced their way through the crowd and even as the speaker uttered these words barney gave him a terrible slap on the back while ephraim kicked the box from beneath his feet the earthquake do be come begorra shouted mulloy greg carker ye bloody old socialist raskil oi have yez in me hands and oim going to hug yez till ye holler chapter xviii a man of the people carker was almost smothered in the powerful arms of the delighted irish youth to the crowd however it seemed that a violent assault had been made on the orator in that crowd were many who sympathized with the socialistic speaker or were pronounced socialists themselves these persons grew excited immediately and a dozen of them sought to push forward to carkers assistance they reached for mulloy and gallup with savage hands or sought to smite the two young men with clenched fists great hemlock exclaimed ephraim as he thrust aside the outstretched hands or warded off blows what in thutterations the matter with this bunch of lunatics down with them down with the aristocrats snarled the angry crowd whoop hooroo shouted barney mulloy releasing carker is it a schrap thot do be on our hands oi dunno begorra its so long since oive been consarned in a real fight that me blood tingles with pleasure at the thought av it by this time carker recognized the suntanned young man who had interrupted his speech as quickly as possible he flung himself in front of the excited crowd threw up his hands and shouted stand back stand back theyre my friends gott in himmel gurgled a german did not they you attackt dit ve not see them py our eyes as they didid it i tell you theyre my friends persisted carker they hita you they graba you shouted an italian they stopa you from making the speech its all right persisted the young socialist i had finished my speech i tell you to keep back stand off the man who touches them is not friendly toward me hes not friendly toward socialism vale said the german uf you put it to us up dot vay it vill a settlement make then he turned and faced the crowd pushing many of them back with his pudgy hands as he shouted stood avay nearer off dont push up so far close dit you not hear our prother say they vas his friendts alretty the excitement of the crowd rapidly subsided carker spoke to them calmly explaining that the two young men who had brought his speech to such a sudden termination were his bosom comrades of old times even thought they might not be thoroughbred socialists where the dickens did you two boys come from he finally demanded as he once more turned toward ephraim and barney grasping their hands oh its good to see you again fellows begorra to see yez is a soight for sore eyes and to hear yez is music to deaf ears chuckled barney mulloy youre the same old rabid champeen av the downtrodden masses youre still pratin away about the coming of the great earthquake thats right by gum grinned gallup but say why didnt yeou warn the people of frisco before they gut shook up when i speak of the great coming earthquake said carker you know im talking figuratively but you havent answered my question where did you chaps come from right up from old mexico replied ephraim weve been down there me and barney ahelpin put through the new central sonora railroad the old roads finished and were takin a vacation now with a big bank account to our credit and plenty of the long green in our pants pockets tainted money tainted money exclaimed greg dramatically youve been laboring for a heartless corporation these great railroad companies have made their wealth by robbing the downtrodden masses ye dont say grinned barney the money we have made may be tainted but the only taint ive discovered about it is taint enough oh youre still frivolous and thoughtless both of you asserted greg with a shake of his bushy head you cant seem to realize the fact that in these degenerate days there are no longer opportunities for men to rise from the lower ranks to positions of competence independence and power the great corporations and trusts are killing competition and holding the masses down a boy born in the lower walks no longer has a chance to get out of that strata of existence its rot ye still talk me frind declared barney oi think th chances are as good as they iver were and a lot betther av anything if yeoure right put in ephraim taint the great corporations and trusts alone that are to blame its the labor organizations that say every workingman no matter whether hes capable of great things or is just an ordinary dub shall take a sartain scale of wages that kills ambition and keeps young fellers of ability and genius from risin yes siree it sartinly does oh your mind is too narrow to grasp all the phases of this great question asserted the young socialist with a sweep of his hand i wish youd prove to me that young men still have a chance to rise in these days show me an example me bhoy ye moight take a look at barney mulloy suggested the smiling irishman its something loike tin thousand clane dollars hes made in th last year thot hes done in mexico and when yeou git through lookin at him suggested gallup yeou might cast an eye round in my direction me and barney have been partners and by jinks ive cleaned up ten thousand too for a moment carker seemed a bit staggered but he quickly recovered whats ten thousand in these days whats that but a drop in the bucket when your big magnates accumulate millions upon millions well me bhoy laughed barney with a comical twist of his mug tin thousand will do for a nist egg wid thot for a nist egg we ought to hatch out enough to kape us from becomin objects of charity in our ould age a man is foolish to waste his time in argument with such chaps as you said greg with a shrug of his shoulders are you on this train when they replied that they were he explained that he was there to take the same train within the station he secured his battered old suit case which he had left there have yeou a seat asked gallup why i expect to get a seat on the regular passenger coach answered carker you kin git a seat in our car i guess said ephraim not moren half the seats was taken at the steps of the parlor car greg halted are you riding in this car he asked shure nodded barney then im sorry said the young socialist i cant ride with you in a breath both mulloy and gallup demanded to know why parlor coaches are made for aristocrats explained greg im one of the masses im democratic i ride with common people in the common coaches begorra yell roide in this car av we have to kidnap yez shouted mulloy av youre too closefisted to buy a sate yersilf oill pay for it this touched carkers pride you hurt me by such words barney he protested closefisted my boy do you know ive given away nearly all my ready money in the last six months to the needy and suffering ive seen big fatstomached overfed men lolling in their parlorcar seats while weak invalids wretched and faint from the strain of trouble have sat in the common cars do you think i could be selfish enough to spend my money for my own comfort and luxury knowing that such poor people might be suffering on this train yer hearts all roight greg ould bhoy explained barney but yell foind thot yer pocketbook isnt big enough to alleviate all th suffering thot yell discover in the world come on ephraim well put him on this car or lave him dead on the platform they seized carker and forced him up the steps in a moment he ceased to resist and permitted them to push him into the car all right boys he muttered regretfully as its you and we havent seen each other for so long ill put aside my scruples and travel in a parlor car today they found teresa and juanita chatting in spanish quite unaware of what had taken place on the station platform carker was introduced to mrs gallup and her young friend he removed his hat flung back his mane of hair and bowed before them with the grace of a true gentleman mrs gallup he murmured its the pleasure of my life to meet the wife of my old friend and comrade and to meet mrs gallups friend seсorita garcia is scarcely a smaller pleasure how beauteeful he do talk murmured juanita there was a strange flash in her dark eyes as she surveyed the young socialist with his long hair his pale classical face his sad poetic eyes he was indeed a handsome fellow of a type seldom seen the fact that his clothes were unconventional in their cut and that he wore a negligee shirt with a soft wide collar detracted not a whit from his striking appearance the train soon pulled out and when the conductor came through a seat was secured for carker who restrained mulloy with an air of dignity when barney attempted to pay the bill im not quite busted myself asserted greg with a faint smile at the same time producing a roll of bills the conductor was paid and passed on then they settled down for a sociable chat chapter xix an intruder turned from his socialistic theories and arguments into a different channel carker proved to be a most delightful conversationalist and companion he was educated cultured and witty although evidently lacking in humor possibly this came from the fact that he had so long and so earnestly regarded and meditated on the somber side of life he seemed to fascinate juanita who listened intently whenever he spoke what you do seсor when you travel so much inquired teresa you leave seсora carkaire at home carker smiled sadly there is no seсora carker he answered oo cried teresa you are not marreed no replied greg im not married that ees so singulaire veree veree murmured juanita it may seem singular admitted carker but a man like me who has pledged his life to humanity has little right to get married i do not see why you say that said juanita perhaps i cannot make my reason plain to you but there is an excellent reason a man who marries should have a home and a man who has a home should live in it if i had such a home and was bound to it i could not travel and carry on my lifework i could not drag my wife around over the country and it is not right for a married man to leave his wife alone a great deal gol rap it greg exclaimed ephraim i dont believe thats your real reason for not gittin married ill bet some gal throwed you down well perhaps youre right admitted the young socialist you cant blame her if she did why not can we blame her questioned juanita deed she have the other lovaire oh ha ha seсor carkaire maybe eet ees not nice to laugh to joke to speak of eet i beg the pardon seсor she had seen a shadow flit across his face and vanish he forced a laugh if there was another man he said im conceited enough to think i might have captured the prize in spite of him had i been willing to sacrifice my principles and renounce my socialistic beliefs oh the girl she not have you because of that breathed juanita eet ees veree strange not so very strange he asserted well say that she was a lady now it is a fact that nearly all ladies are extremely conventional in everything they have a horror for the bizarre and the unconventional they are shocked by the man who declines to be hampered with the fashion in clothes and in similar things i could not fall in love with a girl who was not a lady begorra youre an aristocrat at heart cried mulloy ye cant git away from it me bhoy no mather how much ye prate about socialism and th brotherhood av mon still i protest you do not understand me by gum muttered gallup it dont seem to me that yeou are right bout the gals yeou kinder stick for the sort thats been born in the higher strata of life as yeou call it aint thar a hull lot of mighty smart ones that come out of the lower strata somewhere oh i admit that most of the brainy women and most of the brainy men come from the lower strata nevertheless such women are not ladies begobs ye make me tired cried mulloy what you nade greg is a dhoctor to look afther your liver mebbe the best doctor grinned gallup would be a girl hed fall in love with and whod fall in love with him i guess she could cure him if he happened to run across the right one and she axed him to give up his career and stop rampin round over the country ill bet a good big punkin hed cave in right on the spot youre wrong denied carker no matter how much i cared for a girl i could not give up my career there was one once who asked me to give it up she married another man he smiled as he made the confession but in his eyes there was a look which told of the great sacrifice he had made mebbe you think youre doing a great work for humanity observed ephraim but by ginger i kinder think that frank merriwell is doing a greater work what is he doing havent you heard bout it no i havent heard from merriwell in the last year or more the last i knew of him he was accumulating a fortune in mining like other men in these degenerate times he had turned his great abilities to the mercenary task of amassing wealth i was sorry when i heard this for i had expected other things of him sorry was ye snapped ephraim sorry and disappointed said greg shaking his head waal now you want to come right along with us to bloomfield well show you what frank merriwells doing with that money hes accumulated aint you ever heard bout his school of athletic development no waal i guess thatll interest ye some by jinks tell me about it as clearly as he could ephraim explained the plan of merrys new school carker listened with a show of interest until the vermonter had finished well im glad hes doing some good said greg still this is of minor importance compared with the great work in which im engaged you go to grass almost snarled ephraim great fiddlesticks why frank is making real men of growing boys hes making good strong healthy men that kin go out and successfully fight their way through life life should not be a battle asserted the socialist every mans hand should be outstretched to help a needy fellow man this oldfashioned theory that human life is bound to be a battle is all wrong we are one great body of brothers bound together by a universal tie choke off roight where ye are commanded barney oim yer frind greg carker but oill hit ye av ye sling any of that socialist talk at us yeve riled me now oi must have a shmoke to soothe me narves me too grinned ephraim as they both rose youll scuse us for a little while wont ye girls well jest step into the smokin compartment you may have the excuse if you weel leave seсor carkaire to entertain us murmured juanita ill remain here nodded greg i dont smoke gol ding him growled ephraim as he followed barney into the smoking compartment hes a bigger crank than ever hes gittin wuss and wuss what he nades is a girrul to marry him and straighten him out declared the irish youth five minutes after the departure of eph and barney a slender blackeyed man with a small dark mustache came sauntering through the car as he reached the spot where carker was talking to teresa and juanita he stopped short uttered an exclamation of satisfaction and lifted his hat bowing with a triumphant smile ah seсorita garcia he jubilantly said you take the flight from me but i have found you jose murillo exclaimed juanita and there was dismay and fear in her voice chapter xx old friends en route si seсorita laughed the stranger jose murillo where deed you come from the train on wheech i travel from the west eet join this train back at the junction teresas eyes were flashing she rose and confronted the young mexican seсor murillo she said in spanish you have annoyed juanita enough you have no right to follow her you have threatened her you have frightened her if you are the gentleman you profess to be you will leave her alone he showed his white teeth in a smile i am a man with a purpose he retorted in the same language i love seсorita garcia her father promised that she should be my wife her father is dead said teresa and that promise no longer binds her in mexico you sought to force her into a marriage we are not in mexico now we are in the united states its different here my husband is close at hand if you do not leave us ill call him he will protect us from you pardon seсorita said carker also speaking in spanish permit me to offer my protection i will see that this man gives neither you nor seсorita garcia further annoyance he rose and placed himself squarely before murillo the mexican glared fiercely at greg gringo dog he sneered who are you that offers your protection to these ladies i am their friend seсor and the friend of mrs gallups husband itll be a good thing for you if you move along and move at once murillo laughed you miserable gringo he exclaimed do you think you can frighten me do you think you can drive me away with words i have followed that girl a very long distance she belongs to me by the promise of her father she cannot run away from me i will have her look here seсor murillo retorted greg quietly if you dont move along ill throw you out of that window the mexican fell back and his hand was thrust into his bosom touch me and youll regret it he hissed keeping his black eyes fastened on carker is it a knife or a pistol you have in your hand questioned greg quietly i know youve reached for one or the other all the same ill make good by throwing you out of the window if you dont pass on teresa grasped carkers arm and whispered in his ear wait here come the boyees ephraim and barney were returning from the smoking compartment the moment they saw murillo they hurried forward realizing that something unpleasant was taking place gallup uttered a cry of exasperation as he recognized the mexican look here barney he exclaimed heres old wan consarn his pate hes followed juanita begorra well have to soak the persistint gint in the neck burst from the young irishman murillo backed away a bit and his hand came forth from his bosom it grasped a small shining revolver touch me you gringo curs and ill keel you he threatened a stalky broadshouldered young man wearing a broadbrimmed stetson hat came down the aisle behind the mexican there was a certain breezy western air about this broadhatted stranger he gave one sharp look at murillo and a moment later he had the threatening mexican in a grip of iron one of the strangers hands shot over murillos shoulder and grasped the revolver turning the muzzle toward the roof of the car a popgun like that is a whole lot dangerous for fools to play with observed this person who had interrupted you ought to be turned over some ones knee and spanked aplenty thats whatever great juniper squawked ephraim gallup flourishing his arms with a wild gesture of delight its buck its old buck by gum hooroo badger me bhoy laughed barney wherever did yez come from so suddint oi dunno in truth it is my old college mate from kansas breathed carker badger had twisted the pistol out of murillos fingers with one hand while he easily held the mexican helpless with the other hand badger was a big man he stood six feet tall and every inch of him was put up for strength and endurance he was a finelooking man too bronzed and weatherbeaten as if he had seen much outdoor life yet having a certain atmosphere of ease and refinement about him which proclaimed him no ordinary cowpuncher or laborer there was command and selfconfidence in every glance of his eyes in every movement of his person in spite of his youth a critical discerning stranger would have pronounced him a man of much experience who feared nothing made of flesh and blood murillo snarled at the kansan in spanish santissima caramba caraj like a flash badger snapped the revolver out through the open window and his hand closed on the throat of the furious mexican cutting the vile word short here you lowmouthed spawn of sin grated the big westerner there are ladies present if you use that word before them ill shut off your wind aplenty and let it stay shut you hear me murmur murillo made one last furious struggle but it was quite ineffectual and he finally subsided lying limp in the grasp of the big man who is this greaser coyote asked badger as he relaxed his hold on the mans throat allowing him to catch a painful breath whatever was he doing apulling a popgun that fashion oh he ees the veree bad man seсor exclaimed teresa he annoy my dear friend juanita he follow her all the way from mexico he threaten her eef she do not marry heem badger took a look at juanita and something like a gleam of admiration came into his big brown eyes juanita you sure have my sympathy aplenty he observed you dont want to marry him oh no no seсor replied the frightened girl well then i opine ill drop him out of the window that may jar him some a second later murillo kicking and gasping clawing at the air had been lifted like an infant by badger who seemed on the point of hurling him headlong through the open window santa maria mercee begged the frightened wretch spare me seсor spare me good seсor eef you throw me through the window eet will keel me and that wouldnt be any great loss to the world i judge said the man from kansas but now juanita interfered oh please do not throw heem from the train seсor she implored even eef i do despise heem i should not weesh to see heem keeled badger chuckled well on condition that the gent will promise a whole lot that hell quit bothering you ill let him off and wont throw him out of the window speak up you whining chattering gopher make the promise instanter or out you go oh i promeese seсor i swear came from the frightened mexican swear by all your saints commanded badger by all the saints i swear gasped murillo if i let you go now youll keep away from the seсorita in future youll never trouble her again murillo choked but his fear caused him to take the oath badger dropped the wretch in an upright position turned him down the aisle gave him a start and said dont look back keep on going just as far as you can go on this train get into the rear car and if you show your cowardly mug around here again ill kick you clean up through the top of your hat you hear my promise i opine murillo heard it and he kept on going until he had vanished from the car barney mulloy fairly quivered with laughter be heavins badger he chuckled ye know how to handle a shnake its a relation to st pathrick ye are and he drove all the shnakes out av oireland hereafther youre st buck begobs st buck is a heap good laughed the westerner as he shook hands with his old friends removed his broadbrimmed stetson and made a sweeping bow to the girls mrs badger has a right jolly way of calling me angel sometimes but on my word i cant discover even a pimple of a wing anywhere about me but say people however is it i find you all here together wherever are you bound for bloomfield answered barney and ephraim in chorus were taking carker along with us explained gallup were all going to see old frank at bloomfield by jinks well thats right fine nodded buck im bound for bloomfield myself mrs badger and a friend are in the next car say winnie will be a heap surprised to see you boys ill lead her in no i have a better idea than that well all hit the trail for the other car and descend on her in a bunch there are plenty of empty seats in there and we can have a right jolly old time in his breezy commanding way he gathered them all up and led them into the next car which had been attached to the train at the junction recently left mrs badger the winnie lee of the old days at yale was dozing in her chair when buck came down upon her and awoke her by grasping her shoulder and giving her a shake waugh cried he part the curtains of your peepers winnie and observe this bunch of injuns mrs badgers companion was a slender young woman in a brown traveling suit she was rather pretty in a supercilious way but she showed questionable taste in a display of jewels while traveling oh buck how you startled me you great bear exclaimed winnie what is it who is it take a survey directed the kansan with a sweep of his hand here is our friend gallup from vermont and that frenchman mulloy who was born somewhere in the north of ireland oh ephraim gallup oh barney mulloy cried winnie in delight as she sprang to her feet and grasped the hand of each and you dont want to overlook professor gregory carker whose earthquake predictions must have been unheeded by the people of frisco here he is winnie greg carker burst from winnie as she shook hands with the young socialist why greg youre as handsome as a poet you remind me of pictures of lord byron begobs ephie whispered mulloy well have to hold him and cut his hair its his hair that the ladies are shtuck on no mon who predicts earthquakes has a roight to wear such ravishing hair at the mention of carkers name winnie badgers companion had started and was now sitting bolt upright staring at greg and smiling ephraim proudly introduced his wife and juanita to winnie while this was taking place carker observed winnies friend in a moment his face turned paler than usual his eyelids started wide apart and he lifted one hand with a movement of surprise and consternation she looked straight into his eyes and continued to smile the others noted this there was a hush and all eyes were turned on the two finally carkers lips parted madge he breathed and then after a moment during which his bosom heaved he repeated madge why how do you do greg she laughed extending her hand this is perfectly delightful this is a most unexpected pleasure i never dreamed of seeing you greg why this is queer exclaimed winnie lee so you know my friend mrs morton do you gregory i know her came huskily from carkers lips i know her very well oh yes gushed the young woman we are old friends dear old friends juanita had fallen back behind the others her hands quivered a bit and her white teeth were sunk into her lower lip in a whisper she breathed to herself this is the woman chapter xxi at merry home on arriving in bloomfield they found frank merriwell at the station with carriages to accommodate them all imagine their feelings as they once more greeted their old comrade and leader even buck badger the big breezy man of command seemed to take a second place in the presence of frank many of the bloomfield citizens had somehow learned that several of merrys friends were coming on that train and as a result there was a gathering at the station the curious ones stared at merriwells old flock and it was generally remarked that these friends of frank were all right eli given uncle ed small and deacon elnathan hewett were there in a triangular group and they nodded and chuckled and shook hands with each other as frank shook hands with the members of his old flock purty tarnal goodlooking people eben said eli look at that big feller with the wide hat that has the leather band round it theres a real man for ye yep nodded eben leaning on his crooked cane and looking the party over hes a man the hull of him but even at that i dont callate he

lead him up to the keg and pour it into him if we have to there wont nobody see us deacon well be in the back room and well have rufus shet the door i guess you kin trust us cant ye i guess you aint afraid well go round tellin folks bout it are ye you know were your friends dont ye course i know it retorted the deacon but its some agin my principles boys it aint jest right oh fudge laughed uncle eb on a grand occasion like this youd better set them air principles aside a little while frank is gittin them into the carriages now well see them off and then well stroll over to applesnacks and have jest one little taste of that cider lets start a cheer for frank merriwell and his friends as they go suggested the deacon the others caught at this eagerly and as a result when the carriages started away from the station the villagers on the platform led by the three old boys gave an irregular but hearty cheer for frank merriwell and his friends frank turned a laughing face toward them and waved his hand the people around here seem aplenty stuck on you merry observed badger who was in the carriage with him oh i have lots of friends in bloomfield answered frank i had enemies enough at the start but my worst enemies the most of them have turned into friends same old story said the kansan it was that way at college you always made your strongest friends out of your bitterest enemies browning for instance was an enemy at the start and i certain didnt cotton to you any at all we had some hot old times in those days merry thats whatever hot old times grand old times came from franks lips i often think of them youll find browning diamond hodge and carson at the house and away back in the days at fardale long before i met you buck bart hodge was a bitter enemy browning and diamond are two of my instructors in the a s of a d hodge is my overseer at the mines bruce and jack have had their hands full this afternoon rushing the boys through the regular work in order that they might get off for the afternoon hodge and carson have been helping ive kept carson at work during the last week or so it was necessary certain unpleasant affairs of his put him in a bad way and the only thing was to take up his mind by work i havent given him much time to think and brood i opine weve got a brooder with us in the carriage behind said badger in a low tone carker shows it in his face and eyes oh hes still suffering mentally over the troubles of the masses i suppose said frank theres something beyond that something that has affected him still worse explained buck you noticed winnies chum mrs morton of course i noticed her smiled frank didnt you introduce me shes rather pretty well to the surprise of both winnie and myself we discovered on the train when madge and greg met that there had been some sort of an old love affair between them i reckon thats twothirds the trouble with carker over the bridge rumbled the carriages as they rolled past applesnacks store the grocer and several of his friends stood on the steps and waved a salute at them all these villagers were smiling as if the reunion gave them almost as much enjoyment as it gave frank and his old flock after leaving the village they soon came in sight of the buildings of farnham hall these structures located on a splendid site brought exclamations of astonishment and pleasure from all who had not seen them before then they saw merry home setting back amid the tall trees which surrounded it the old colonial house seemed to open its arms to them in welcome and on the veranda were inza elsie jack diamond bruce browning bart hodge and berlin carson its impossible to describe adequately the meeting as the newcomers left the carriages and were greeted by those waiting for them the chatter and laughter of the girls made merry music but for the most part the young men shook hands in silence looking deep into one anothers eyes and letting the grasp of their fingers express the emotions their lips could not speak the two colored men toots and jumbo together with the young irish man of all work who had also acted as a driver took the turnouts round to the stables where the three of them joined hands and did a crazy dance bah golly jumbo you big stiff cried toots as he struck the huge darky a resounding blow on the back ahze the happiest nigger in dis hull unumverse wasnt dat de

muttered jumbo warmly as he went about his work an hour after the arrival at merry home the visitors were ushered into the large light airy dining room where they found seats at a long table there were servants enough for the occasion and everything was served promptly mrs morton sought to secure a seat at greg carkers side but in a clever manner carker had avoided such proximity to her without seeming to do so intentionally instead of having her at his elbow it was juanita who sat there well seсorita said carker smiling on her what do you think of frank merriwells home and his friends oh eet ees the most splendeed theeng i evaire see she murmured eet makes me feel so happy for you all happy said carker regarding her closely why i fancied you were looking rather unhappy to me you seemed downcast has anything occurred to make you sad oh eet ees that i am so far from home perhaps she answered why deed you not seet by the beauteeful lady you meet again one time more on the train whom do you mean the friend of seсorita badgaire i theenk she ees so veree pretty she ees marreed eh he shrugged his shoulders yes shes married muttered carker you are sorree sorry si seсor eef she was not marreed perhaps you would beside her seet i dont think so at least knowing her as i do now still i dont blame her im the cause of it all you feel veree veree bad ill be honest with you seсorita i cant tell whether i feel very bad or not i have felt rather upset i confess but my dear girl human nature is peculiar its a strange thing but i believe most men and most women take melancholy delight in feeling themselves to be martyrs we all delight to moan over lost loves that is the poetry in our natures occasionally we spend our time grieving over some lost love that reason and good judgment tells us would have come to naught under any circumstances i hope mrs morton is happy and satisfied perhaps youll think me fickle seсorita but let me confess to you the fact that im not feeling as much like grieving as i was before i met you for a few moments juanita did not seem to grasp his meaning but when she did the soft warm color mounted to her cheeks and her confusion was plainly evident on the opposite side of the table gallup nudged teresa who had been placed at his left hey teresa he whispered get onto carker gol rap him hes making hay in a hurry what ees eet you mean to make the hay questioned teresa puzzled to me it seem that he make the love he talk so verree low that nobody except juanita hear what he say and juanita she blush thats right chuckled ephraim and by jim mrs morton is looking daggers and hoss pistols then he lifted his voice and addressed carker hold on there greg he called you cant eat your soup with your fork why dont you use a spoon it was carkers turn to be confused but he forced a laugh i have a lamentable habit of becoming abstracted in pleasant company he said evidently you find your company extremely pleasant mr carker observed mrs morton with a little toss of her head extremely is not quite the word madam he replied with a bow absorbingly pleasant is far better chapter xxii another pilgrim at intervals during the meal the sound of plaintive doleful music floated in through the open windows sounds like a baby squawking observed ephraim gallup begobs oi thought it was some wan playing on bagpoipes observed barney mulloy oi wonder whativer it can be oi dunno frank listened to me it sounds like a cross between a clarinet a flute and a piccolo he smiled some one is trying to furnish music for this festive occasion he called one of the servants and asked her to find out the origin of the peculiar doleful music in a few moments the girl returned and quietly explained that a wandering musician had halted on the lawn and was performing on some sort of a wind instrument hes a bery funnylookin maan mr merriwell grinned the girl he suttinly am wearin de oddest cloes ah eber seen an hes round an corperlous wid de biggest fat cheeks when he blows an a yeller mustache dat keeps wigwaggin all de time frank thrust his hand into his pocket brought out a silver half dollar and put it in the colored girls palm give him this liza and tell him to jog along he said quietly but after liza had performed the commission and returned to the dining room the doleful notes of the wind instrument continued to float in through the open windows the wandering minstrel is bound to give you your moneys worth merry laughed jack diamond although they lingered at the table fully an hour after that the musician continued to play outside during all that time with brief intervals of rest finally when dessert was over and they had chatted and gossiped a while frank proposed that they should move to the veranda as the jolly party came out upon the veranda they discovered the musician he was a portly young german and he stood on the lawn with a battered old carpetbag between his feet while he blew at a wheezy flute with such vigor and vim that his eyes threatened to pop out of his head he certainly is working overtime observed diamond id like to know the name of his tailor chuckled browning his clothes certainly fit him handsomely in spots anyhow they touch the high places came from badger frank merriwell paused on the veranda steps and scrutinized the musician intently fellows he said that chap looks familiar to me ive seen him before i know him bart hodges hand dropped on merrys shoulder youre right frank he said we both know him we all know him an instant later merry sprang down the steps rushed forward and seized the flute player if you need any assistance called gallup as he descended to the lawn ill help you kill him merry hans dunnerwurst cried frank as he grasped the hand of the german and shook it delightedly i thought i knew you the stranger seemed nearly pumped out of breath as soon as he could speak he retorted uhha i pelieft you vould knew me uf you recognitioned me how you vos alretty

more visitors merry called diamond i think we know them with their arms linked together three old men were approaching rather unsteadily merry instantly recognized eli given uncle eb small and deacon hewett as the trio turned in from the road their feet somehow became tangled and all three went down sprawlingly uncle eb sat up and made a whack at eli with his crooked cane crying shrilly thats the second time youve tripped me dont blame it on me you doddering old fossil flung back given peace boys peace remonstrated the deacon waving his hands in the air raise not your voices in harsh words and brawling i dont think any one tripped you eben ive noticed myself that the ground is rather unsteady i think were feeling a few leftover tremors from the frisco earthquake mebbe youre right deacon said uncle eb seeming pacified kin you tell me jest how them earthquakes work do they make things go round in a circle ive been noticin durin the last few minutes that the trees and fences were all floatin round us if we brace ourselves and walk carefully said elnathan as he rose and swayed a bit i think well have no further difficulty in getting along permit me to assist you eben but when he tried to lift uncle eb up he lost his balance fell heavily on small and flattened him out this is really astonishing muttered frank repressing his laughter with difficulty as he started down the steps oh whats the matter with them merry asked inza now dont get worried dear he answered over his shoulder the sun is very warm today and im afraid theyre suffering from it we must get them into the shade before they have sunstroke come on fellows assisted by the boys the three old men were lifted to their feet and escorted into the shade beneath the spreading trees in front of the house uncle eb poked elnathan in the ribs with his cane come on now with that speech deacon he urged youre the speechmaker of the party elnathan cleared his throat ladies and gentlemen he began this is a grand and glorious day this is the day when that grand and glorious bird the american eagle should plume itself with pride and utter a scream that could be heard from the pacific to the atlantic from the gulf to the canadian border hooray hooray piped eli given thats the talk deacon spatter it on thick we are sons of free men continued elnathan making a gesture that nearly caused him to lose his balance the declaration of independence and the emancipation proclamation made us all free and equal if there be one among you who is not stirred by this glorious thought let him hide his head in shame this is the day on which the whole country rejoices at the birth of liberty let the cannons boom let the rockets siz let the pinwheels whiz and let the popcorn pop hold on deacon hold on interrupted uncle eb thats your last years fourth of july speech that dont seem zactly propriate to this occasion now you back up eben commanded given you let him spout it sounds purty good to me whether theres any sense to it or not what was i sayin asked the deacon where did i leave off you kinder interrupted my train of discourse eben mebbe id better stop theres a lady coming to join our party said bart hodge i think its your wife eli my what gasped eli given actually turning pale where is she great scissors if she ever gits her hands on me now i see my finish a woman with a sunbonnet dangling by the strings tied beneath her chin was coming down the road in a hurried manner with some difficulty eli finally discovered her thats mrs given as sure as adam ett the apple he exclaimed i dont believe shes seen me boys ive gut to go and ive gut to go in a hurry too well dont you think im goin to hang around for her to git holt of me said uncle eb as he started toward the corner of the house hobbling along as fast as his legs and his cane could carry him i think perhaps id better go too muttered the deacon as he followed ebens example in spite of the start of his companions given passed them on a run and turned the corner making straight for the stable the three old chaps legged it into that building and disappeared from view nevertheless mrs given had seen them and she was not far behind when they vanished through the wideopen door she found uncle eb propped up with his cane standing in a dark corner of a box stall eben small she said as she shook her fingers in his face youre a disgrace to the community now not a word dont speak i know what youve been doing you and my husband and elnathan hewett youve been drinking hard cider at rufus applesnacks store im going to take eli home and ill give him a dressing down he wont soon forgit i tell ye not to speak you aint gut nuthin to say she then lifted her voice and called for her husband to come forth as there was no response she looked into the crib and there she found elnathan curled up pretending to be fast asleep deacon hewett she said youve posed as an example to the community now dont snore i know youre awake you cant fool me so you will continue to snore will ye there was a squawk from the deacon for she had seized him by the nose and given it a twist that brought him upright in the crib wheres my husband she demanded dont speak dont say a word i want to know where my husband is well how kin i tell you if i dont speak snarled the deacon i dunno where he is anyhow go way and lemme alone this hot weather is giving me an awful headache oh youve got a headache have ye well thats retribution mr hewett you ought to have a headache youve led my husband astray hes a temperance man me lead him astray groaned hewett why twas him and eben that coaxed me over to applesnacks store now dont you tell me that you sinful old hypocrite eli never touches hard cider unless somebody induces him to do so and i know eben dont drink it on account of the effect on his rheumatiz thats right mother piped a weak small voice from beneath the crib as eli poked his head out the deacon is all to blame oh there you be she snapped as she pounced on him and pulled him forth now you git up here and march home having pulled him to his feet she took a firm grip on his ear and led him from the stall and out of the stable chapter xxiii in the nook that afternoon was to be long remembered by all the visitors at merry home it passed pleasantly in spite of the fact that hans insisted on rending a selection on the flute and seemed rather disappointed and downcast when they begged him not to play any more der musig haf no heart for you he complained maype you vould like a popular song to sing to me i vill gif you efrybody vorks poor vather yes no dont yez do it hans entreated barney we have suffered enough already und id vos such a peautiful song moaned dunnerwurst i understandt der author uf dot song got only fife hundret dollars for writin id waal drawled gallup maybe it was his first offense did he pay the fine fife hundret dollars vos a small amoundt said hans still i vould like to add it py my lefen dollars and seventeen cents vot i haf my pocket in how much would that make in all questioned gallup you always was a rippin good mathematicker hans though seems to me you did git a little balled up in substraction if youve gut eleven dollars and sixteen cents in your pocket and i should take five dollars away from you whaot would be the result you vould be carried avay an ambulance in said the dutchman promptly carker had bestowed a great deal of attention on juanita although she pretended not to notice this mrs morton was waiting her opportunity and it came when greg strolled away alone beneath the trees in a few moments she made an excuse and followed him finding him seated on a rustic bench in a little nook she uttered an exclamation of pretended surprise over discovering him there why greg she fluttered are you here he rose at once yes im here he answered i beg your pardon mrs morton if i alarmed you ill not bother you if you wish to sit here oh you foolish boy she laughed placing her hands on his breast and pushing him back on the seat sit down isnt this a delightful place were all alone here by ourselves and nobody can see or hear us she placed herself at his side it might be somewhat embarrassing for you if any one should discover us here said greg embarrassing for me what a foolish idea you always were a foolish fellow greg carker youve told me so before and told you the truth i presume you still think so you thought me foolish because of my socialistic beliefs you used to make sport of me i havent forgotten that the trouble with you greg is that you take things too seriously you never can see a joke if any one plays a joke on you youre offended and you try to get even youve been getting even with me today in what manner by the way you made eyes at that insipid creature juanita i wouldnt call her insipid if i were in your place he remonstrated it doesnt seem nice of you madge i mean mrs morton oh call me madge there is no reason why you should be so extremely formal i knew you before i met george morton he shrugged his shoulders i thought i knew you he retorted but i discovered i was mistaken why do you say that because it is true i dont believe you ever cared for me greg and i know you never really cared for me if you had youd not have cast me over as you did for morton but i couldnt do anything with you gregory you persisted in throwing your life away in what manner in becoming a socialist in lecturing on socialism in defiance of your fathers wishes and my entreaties your father threatened to cut you off without a dollar i believe hes made a will in which i am given the liberal sum of one dollar said carker so you see he has not quite cut me off without a dollar the money made all the difference with you madge morton was wealthy i had nothing in the world and no particular prospects you married morton well a girl has to look out for herself in these days but you pretended that you loved me i did she declared earnestly i loved you then greg and ive loved you ever since again he shrugged his shoulders and a low laugh came from his lips you dont believe me she exclaimed if you only knew how much it hurt me to see you smiling into the eyes of that spanish girl oh i longed to choke her how do you think i felt when you dropped me and became george mortons wife id never done that had you been sensible had you promised your father that youd give up socialism id have clung to you through everything gregory you know socialism is so ridiculous and socialists are the skuff and rabble of humanity all the cranks and crackbrains are socialists every great thinker since the world began has been called a crank i admit that there are many undesirable persons allied with the socialists but because of that the great principles of the party cannot be condemned the theory of socialism is founded on the rock of justice and oh ive heard all that before gregory dont talk it any more how can you blame me if i did not wish to marry a penniless man absolutely without prospects i dont blame you he said at the same time madge i hate to think that you married george morton simply for his money i hate to think you deceived him in such a manner oh george was a good fellow and money is an absolute necessity gregory had i possessed a fortune it would have been different the mere fact that your father had cut you off would have made no difference to me then it makes no difference to me now but its too late now madge oh no it isnt too late he drew back from her and the look she saw in his eyes brought a sudden flush to her cheeks you think me bold you think me forward she hastily said long ago you made me confess that i loved you do you think i forgot you oh no theres been never a day since we parted that ive not longed to see you again in spite of her hand on his arm he rose to his feet this wont do madge he said calmly youre a married woman what if your husband should hear you speaking such words to me she was on her feet also my husband why gregory dont you know havent you heard i have no husband you have no husband no im a widow ive just come out of mourning george has been dead more than a year carker seemed turned to stone she was standing squarely in front of him and she placed both her hands on his arms looking up into his eyes i supposed you knew she murmured he left me in comfortable circumstances and there is now no reason why i should worry about the future if your father is unrelenting it can make but little difference to us even though we may not agree about socialism ill let you have your way everything has come out right at last greg isnt it splendid before he realized her intention one of her arms slipped round his neck at that moment juanita garcia passed the entrance to that little nook and saw them she did not pause but palefaced and wideeyed hurried silently on chapter xxiv on the cliff during the remainder of the day juanita avoided greg carker evening came within the house the boys were singing the old college songs to the accompaniment of a piano as juanita stole away alone and listened a long time from a corner of the veranda tears dimmed her eyes and she whispered soft words to herself i know im a veree fooleesh girl she said i cannot help eet eet ees not to be that he should care for me her heart throbbed with bitter disappointment she left the house behind and wandered away through the dusky june night crossing the road and the fields she came at last to ripple lake on the edge of which she lingered while the moon crept up in the east i ought to return she murmured if they mees me they will become alarmed but i cannot go back there yet i cannot go back her restless spirit led her round the shore of the lake until she finally found herself on a bluff that rose from the waters edge the moon was now behind her back at the brink of the bluff she peered over into the shadow below a footstep startled her with a smothered cry she turned and found herself face to face with jose murillo it is you juanita he exclaimed in spanish all day i have waited and watched for the opportunity to speak with you seсor murillo why did you come here you promised what is a mans promise to a gringo he retorted did you think they could frighten jose away from you no no juanita but i do not want to see you youre a foolish girl why are you so determined against me your father gave me his promise it will do you no good to speak of that seсor i tell you now for the last time that i do not care for you i never can if you are a gentleman you will bother me no more im going back now he placed himself before her not yet he exclaimed you cannot stop me seсor oh yes i can seсorita dont fancy ive followed you all the way from mexico to be baffled so easily the murillos are determined men i have resolved that you shall be mine never that word is easy to speak what have i done that you should despise me you say the murillos are determined men they are likewise bloody men i know not why my father favored you i do know that my mother feared all murillos even as i fear you it is good for a woman to have a husband whom she fears and respects in this case fear and respect do not go together seсor i have no respect for you then i will teach you respect when you are mine that opportunity will never be given you look seсor we stand at the edge of this cliff the water is very close at hand i wish you to understand me rather than become your wife id leap into that water i cannot swim leap he exclaimed i will leap after you and i cannot swim are you mad it is madness perhaps seсorita but it is the madness of love you must understand me now you must understand how useless it is to fly from me once i thought you cared for another man once i was jealous of emmanuel escalvo he never knew how close he walked with death when i learned you did not care for him i put away my knife there can be no others unless you have met him within a few hours i am satisfied that there is no other with sudden indiscretion and defiance she exclaimed youre wrong seсor murillo there is another he uttered a sudden curse who is the man tell me his name and he shall have what emmanuel escalvo escaped she was frightened by her folly who is the man he snarled suddenly seizing her speak quick speak at once you hurt me seсor she panted striving to break from his grasp let me go i will not i have you now and ill keep you ill never let you go i beg your pardon said a quiet voice but i think youre mistaken jose murillo found himself sprawling on the ground he looked up and in the moonlight he saw gregory carker offering juanita support oh why deed you come panted the girl now he weel know he weel keel you snarling like an angry dog murillo leaped to his feet the moonlight shimmered on a blade he had whipped from his bosom this ees the man he panted triumphantly as he sprang at greg carker flung up his arm and murillos knife slashed his sleeve from shoulder to elbow in a twinkling greg had closed with the mexican grasping the mans wrist and holding him in an effort to keep him from using the knife juanita sought to interfere but the cool determined young american warned her back leave this man to me he said he has the knife but i dont think hell use it said carker as he backheeled murillo in a moment they were down twisting and squirming and writhing on the ground with her hands clasped and her lips parted juanita looked on standing ready to do her best should she see murillo free his knife hand carker had once been an athlete he was not now in the best condition but nevertheless he was stronger than his foe and he finally pinned murillo to the ground drop that knife commanded greg seeking to force the weapon from the mexicans fingers in this attempt he had almost succeeded when of a sudden murillo squirmed away rolled over and over and scrambled up carker rose on the brink of the cliff and again faced the man murillo came at him with a leap making a savage slash with the knife carker dodged just in time and thrust out his foot over that outthrust foot the mexican tripped straight forward he plunged with a cry and a splash into the water below perhaps a cold bath will do him good observed carker breathing a trifle heavily juanita seemed ready to faint oh seсor you are the brave man she breathed oh my heart eet beat so for you i have such a terrible fear that he would keel you carker felt a strange thrill that ran over him from head to feet would you have cared so much he asked hoarsely eet would have keeled me too seсor she answered the lake i should have leaped into eet like murillo i cannot swim like murillo eh exclaimed greg then the fellow cant swim well i think its up to me to pull him out he stripped off his coat ran some distance away to a point where he could descend to the waters edge and made his way along the foot of the little bluff peering into the shadows he called in vain to the mexican out beyond the point where the cliff shadow lay on the water there were tiny shimmering waves but in that shadow he could see nothing im afraid this is rather a serious matter for jose murillo he muttered had i realized the scoundrel couldnt swim id followed him into the lake and pulled him out i take it hes gone juanita called to him from above cant you see him seсor carkaire dont be alarmed juanita he answered im coming back there ill be with you in a moment he took one last look in search of the mexican i had to defend myself he thought im sorry i was concerned in it but i think jose murillo will trouble juanita no more she was waiting in a trembling anxiety as he reappeared he picked up his coat and put it on deed you find heem not a trace answered carker he must have sunk like a stone its an unfortunate affair juanita but you have no further cause to fear that man come little girl ill take you back to the house give me your arm timidly

use franks boats in the search for the body of the mexican after breakfast merriwell and a number of his friends went over to the lake and found the searchers at work hunker reported that they had discovered no trace of the missing man carker hodge and merriwell launched a boat from the boathouse and joined in the work it was on this cliff here that we had the encounter explained greg as they rowed back and forth beneath the bluff the mans body should be here somewhere there seems to be no particular current at this spot to carry it away i think well find jose murillo within thirty yards of this locality there was a harsh unpleasant laugh and a voice cried seсor carkaire ees right jose murillo ees witheen thirtee yards of heem thees minute looking up in astonishment the trio in the boat beheld the mexican standing on the brink of the cliff his clothes were somewhat wrinkled and soiled seeming to need cleansing and pressing but the man was there in the flesh grinning at them in a malicious triumphant manner greg carker smothered an exclamation of amazement evidently you were mistaken in thinking the man drowned said frank quietly weve had all this trouble for nothing oh eet ees not so easee to keel jose murillo sneered the rascal where he fall in the lake the water ees not so deep he stand up with hees head out he walk to the shore he see carkaire look for heem and he keep steel now he look for carkaire better have a care gringo for jose murillo weel find the time to strike you yet adios he weel see you lataire the man turned and hurried away chapter xxvi a lively game when the farnham hall baseball team came out for practice that afternoon they found another team on the field this team was dressed in blue suits and on the breast of each shirt was a large white letter m frank merriwell had found these old suits stored away and brought them forth at sight of them his friends were seized with the oldtime enthusiasm for the great american game and it did not take them long to get into the suits and onto the field whats this cried dale sparkfair as he surveyed merrys team we seem to have intruders here well have to put them off the field boys well have to do them up hans dunnerwurst paused with his hands on his hips and stared at dale half a dozen persons shouted at the dutchman but he failed to heed their warning and a ball thrown at him struck him on

curf uf der ball warned hans uf i use too much speed for you chust let me tell you so he presented a comical spectacle as he flourished his arm with a windmill motion and delivered the ball to bart it was high and wide but hodge cuffed it down ho ho shouted the dutchman did dot rise see you vosnt it a peauty part that was a great rise said hodge better try a drop next time get em lower on receiving the ball hans made another flourishing motion shut his eyes and threw the sphere with great force straight at the ground in front of him mine cootness he gasped i vill haf to look oudt for dot drop it vos a corker better start off with a straight ball advised hodge give these youngsters a show they cant hit your curves hans i pelief me nodded dunnerwurst soberly your advice vill took me a few

envious said sparkfair dont listen to him i know youll strike me out you cant help it the first ball pitched to spark happened to be just where he wanted it he met it squarely and drove it over carsons head in right field it was a clean threebagger and three runs came in well i think that will about do for you hans said frank come in here gallup if you want to show what you can do ephraim promptly accepted the invitation and came galloping in from the field you vill be a peach sneered hans as he passed gallup i vos ashamed for you alretty soon i cant do any worse than you done if i tried a month retorted ephraim after warming up a bit gallup pitched to hollis fred dropped a texas leaguer over the infield and sparkfair scored dunnerwurst whooped derisively then came young joe crowfoot who also connected with the ball lacing it out cleanly for two bases hollis scored from first they seem to be hitting you ephraim observed frank jest wait a minute observed gallup i aint settled down yet jack lander wearily dragged his feet out to the plate stood there with his eyes shut and permitted kilgore to call two strikes on him ive gut him thought ephraim hes in a trance gallup attempted to put another one straight over but to his consternation lander woke up hit the ball a crack and drove it skimming along the ground out of the diamond you vos a dandy you vas a dandy squawked dunnerwurst perspiration started out on ephraims face and he looked decidedly annoyed his annoyance reached a climax when brooks landed on the ball for two bases scoring crowfoot and lander i guess thats enough for me frank said ephraim as he walked out of the box i kinder judge youll have to go in yourself them fellers has made seven runs and there aint a tarnal man out yes its about time for you to go in merry nodded hodge frank thought so himself gallup retired to his regular position in center field dunnerwurst took right field and carson came in to play short merry entered the box and thad barking astonished every one by lacing out a clean single following this bob bubbs put up a foul which was captured by hodge brooks was caught off his base and the agony ended when netterby struck out merriwells team came to bat facing the handicap of seven runs chapter xxvii murillos farewell in the meantime at least twenty boys from the academy had gathered to watch the game gregory carker appeared escorting inza elsie winnie badger teresa gallup mrs morton and juanita garcia now weve got to play real baseball fellows laughed frank as carker escorted the ladies into the stand where they took the most convenient seats the girls will be ashamed of us if we continue this monkeying start it up hodge youre the first batter bart hodge stepped out picked out one of sparkfairs curves and smashed a hot grounder at bubbs who gathered the ball up cleanly and whipped it across to brooks out at first announced kilgore oh bart bart cried elsie laughingly cant you do better than that he shook his head as he walked back to the bench your turn next mulloy said frank sparkfair seemed to be in good trim for he whipped over a couple of benders which fooled barney who missed them both vait till der pat gets holdt uf me muttered dunnerwurst der ball nefer coot hit dot irishman barney struck out dond some more fun make uf me advised hans there was a hush as frank merriwell picked up a bat and stepped into the box now something vill see you observed dunnerwurst in a low tone der ball vill hit him a mile sparkfair did his best to deceive merry but finally put one over and frank drove it far into the field hiram bemis covered ground rapidly as he raced for the ball but no one fancied he could catch it making a final desperate spurt hi leaped into the air and pulled the globule down it was the third out and merrys team had not scored im sorry for you mr merriwell laughed sparkfair but we cant afford to let you have this game now it would be simply awful after getting seven runs in the first inning the game is young reminded frank having escorted the ladies to seats gregory carker deliberately placed himself at the side of juanita garcia oh greg called madge morton come here i have something to show you excuse me just now he answered ill come directly the seсorita is telling me something then he whispered to juanita tell me something quick why do you not go seсor she asked i prefer to remain here but you weel have to go he shrugged his shoulders oh ill have to be polite but i shall return she weel not let you at this moment mrs morton rose and changed her seat placing herself at carkers side as she laughingly observed dont let me interrupt you when the seсorita has finished i will take a little of your time just a little juanita flashed her a look i am sure seсor carkaire weel geeve you the time now she said eet ees not important what i have to say madge had a delicate gold chain about her neck and to the end of this chain was attached a small locket this locket she now displayed asking carker if he remembered it i think i do he answered i should think you would she laughed you gave it to me dont you think it a pretty little locket seсorita veree answered juanita yes said madge with a sigh gregory gave me this little trinket he gave me something else lets see if i can open it she succeeded in opening the locket and again held it up before carker see she went on its your picture greg your picture and mine ive worn this locket every day since you gave it to me oo murmured juanita with just the least touch of malice deed you show eet to your husband seсora mrs morton shrugged her shoulders and lowered the corners of her mouth he saw it she replied we had more than one little disagreement over it he threatened to take it away from me carker was decidedly uncomfortable glancing toward juanita he observed that her cheeks were flushed and she seemed decidedly disturbed it was rather a piece of folly on my part he said you know a man gets foolish at times mrs morton oh mrs morton exclaimed madge how formal you are gregory you were not nearly so formal yesterday you were not nearly so formal when i met you alone her eyes were on juanita as she uttered these words she saw the girl bite her lip eet ees a veree strange game thees baseball said juanita turning to teresa do you understand eet never mind her said madge morton pulling at carkers sleeve why do you pay her so much attention do you wish to know he asked in a low tone then ill tell you im in love with her the woman looked at him with incredulous eyes then threw back her head and laughed more of your folly greg she said you always were a silly chap in love with that girl dont be foolish my boy shes nothing but a kid i dont like that word kid oh i suppose you think it very unladylike to use such slang children like this girl are amusing but only unsophisticated boys and doddering old men fall in love with them youre neither greg carker no im neither im old enough to know my own mind i dont think you do youre bewitched by her eyes and her way of talking her dialect sounds rather cute to you dont be foolish greg mrs morton i tried to make you understand yesterday there was a time when i believed i cared a great deal for you thats all over now you chose your own course and you have no one save yourself to blame because there is now in my heart not the least spark of anything like love for you you may think theres no spark but i believe the embers are still smoldering and i propose to fan them into a flame evidently you dont understand men mrs morton i dont think a woman ever yet caught a man by telling him what she proposed to do its a mans nature to pursue he loves the chase lets watch this baseball game with the greatest difficulty she repressed her annoyance and anger the game was progressing and with frank merriwell in the box it became decidedly interesting the second inning passed with neither side securing a score at the opening of the third inning jose murillo appeared on the field attired in a fresh suit and looking cool and dapper he carried a light cane and wore a straw hat glancing around he discovered the ladies in the stand lifted his hat made a graceful bow and showed his teeth in a smile to the astonishment of every one the mexican entered the stand and approached the party juanita garcia was agitated and frightened seizing carkers arm she whispered dont let heem come near me ill look out for him promised greg murillo bowed low before them i beg pardon for thees eentrusion he murmured eet happens that i know seсora gallup and seсorita garcia i am a man of impulse i do manee theengs i afterward regret i presume seсorita garcia has been annoyed by me and now i weesh to ask her pardon i have taken the time to considaire i have thought eet all ovaire eet ees no use when a girl een thees country decides that she weel not have anytheeng whatevaire to do with a man he may as well gif eet up eet ees my decision to geeve eet up i am going back to mexico i shall leave tomorrow i have come to bid seсorita garcia adios i dont beleef heem i dont beleef heem whispered juanita cowering close to carkers side he ees lying i think you have decided wisely murillo said greg if i were in your place id git in fact unless you do git ive decided to swear out a warrant for your arrest ive decided to make complaint against you for attacking me with a deadly weapon jose made a gentle gesture with his hand some day in the future perhaps we weel settell that seсor carkaire he said save yourself the trouble to swear out the warrant i shall go with another sweeping bow he turned and left the stand oh i dont like this game at all exclaimed mrs morton i never did like baseball i think ill go to the house she likewise left the stand chapter xxviii a compact madge morton overtook jose murillo a word with you she said we are far enough from the field so that well not be seen if we step aside beneath the trees eet ees a pleasure he bowed although his face wore a puzzled expression beneath the trees the woman turned and faced him squarely theres a girl back yonder that youre smashed on she said he shook his head what ees eet to be smashed oh i mean youre struck on her youre in love with her its that little softspoken blackeyed chit you mean seсorita garcia yes thats the girl youve followed her here all the way from mexico eet ees right i have follaired her now what do you propose to do are you going to quit are you going to throw up your hand are you going to lay down again he shook his head eet ees not plain to me what you mean seсorita im married at least i have been call me seсora if you dont choose to call me mrs morton are you going to give that girl up are you going to let her baffle you youre a man of determination i understand you had trouble with gregory carker last night si si seсora eet ees lucky for heem i deed not reach heem with my knife i weel reach heem yet she clutched his arm no she cried you must not i love him im going to marry him ees eet true gasped murillo in surprise i thought he was oh he has a silly notion that he cares for your blackeyed juanita hes mistaken thats all keep her away from him a week and hell forget her give me a week and ill win him back again instead of trying to harm him why dont you carry off the girl how can eet be done shes afraid of you if you can get her away from here i think she will cow down and do anything you say i dont believe she has real courage ill help you how let me think you must take her away tonight bring a carriage stop near merry home but far enough away not to be discovered come to the house at an hour past midnight you know the back way if you dont you can find it ill be waiting for you ill let you in and ill help you take that girl out of the house he looked at her with an expression of mingled doubt and admiration you are a woman he said how you dare to do such a theeng dare she hoarsely cried i dare anything in a case like this but how can we take her out she raise the disturbance oh no she wont i know her room she sleeps alone a little chloroform will quiet her leave the matter to me will you come do you dare if you havent the courage to play this game say so i haf the courage cried murillo suddenly i weel be there eef eet ees a trap look out for me i am not the man who forgets save your breath said the woman dont bother to threaten me ill see you again tonight then she turned and walked back to the athletic field rejoined the party in the grand stand announced that she had changed her mind about watching the game chatted laughed and appeared wholly carefree and at ease not until the fifth inning could merriwells team score against the farnham hall lads it was mainly sparkfairs wonderful pitching that kept frank and his friends from circling the bases dale had splendid speed dazzling shoots and masterly control in the fifth the merries tried the bunting game and filled the bases with only one out badger then came up and smashed out a fine twobagger driving in three runs sparkfair then struck out carson and dunnerwurst although the head of franks batting order came up in the sixth and hodge reached third no scores were secured in the seventh gallup crossed the pan with a run neither side could secure a tally in the eighth and the ninth inning opened with merriwells team three runs behind the youngsters oh weve got you laughed sparkfair we havent been able to make a run since the first inning but those seven scores were enough yah said dunnerwurst dot ephraim gallup he didid der pizness der game threw him avay gol dinged if yeouve gut anything to say rasped the vermonter yeou started all the trouble uf frankie had let der pitchers plate stay py me a vhile longer it vould haf peen different der ball was chust gittin control uf me ven he tookt me oudt farnham hall did not score in the first half of the ninth diamond was the first batter up for the merries and he laced out a clean single thats the stuff cried frank only three scores well get em right here browning lifted a fly to left field and bemis scooped it diamond reached second gallup dropped a texas leaguer over the infield and buck badger walked out with a bat on his shoulder it peen up to you padger cried dunnerwurst see vot you coot dood py der ball at this juncture sparkfair issued his first pass and badger walked filling the bases berlin carson tried to drive in some runs but popped up an infield fly and was out then hans dunnerwurst started forth oh crackey groaned ephraim gallup its all over naow yah it vos all ofer nodded hans a home run vill knock me der game vos seddled it is probable that almost every one expected to see hans strike out after making two strikes the dutchman secured a clean single on which diamond and gallup scored dot vos a mishdake declared the dutchman der ball meant to strike me twice as far as dot there was great anxiety on both sides as bart hodge walked out you can dood it hotch shouted hans bart smashed the second ball pitched him driving it out on a line little bob bubbs thrust out his left mitt and the ball spanked into it it stuck there the game was over and sparkfairs team had defeated the merries by a single run chapter xxix the proof gregory carker never knew exactly why he rose in the night and stole out of his room with catlike steps he had a vague idea that he would move silently in order not to disturb or awaken any one sleeping in the house near the head of the stairs he paused and backed into a shadowy corner two persons came up the stairs one of them bore a candle which flickered and flared the fitful light showing her features plainly it was madge morton she was deathly pale and the hand that held the candle shook like that of a person with the palsy behind her was a man as she reached the head of the flight she paused turned to this man and whispered follow me closely the girls room is two doors to the left carker saw the mans face and he recognized jose murillo forth from his nook leaped greg seizing murillo as the mexican placed his foot on the last stair mrs morton gave a gasping cry of dismay dropped the candle and fled the candle did not go out although it fell on its side it continued to burn fitfully at the head of those stairs a sharp savage struggle took place the mexican uttered a smothered oath and sought to produce his knife thees time i fix you carkaire he panted the dim light of the candle gleamed on the blade greg carker tore himself free and struck a swinging blow which landed on murillos jaw the mexican crashed to the foot of the stairs where he lay groaning while the aroused household flocked to the spot what is it carker what the dickens is the matter demanded frank as he seized gregs shoulder carker had picked up the candle and was holding it in his hand i think well find a man at the foot of these stairs he said his voice not quite steady in spite of his effort to command himself they did find a man down there jose murillo had struck on his own knife and was seriously wounded doctor schnitzle was promptly brought over from farnham hall but after taking a look at murillos wound he turned and whispered to frank maype he vill last vun halluf hour but it iss not to be expectioned it vos der end uf him the doctor was right to the end murillo protected his accomplice claiming he had broken into the house by himself with the intention of carrying juanita off and gregory carker said nothing the following day however carker found an opportunity to speak privately as he supposed with mrs morton he followed her from the house and stopped her at a point where there was little likelihood that they would be seen youll take the next train out of bloomfield he said i thought you might have good sense enough to take the first one but you dont seem inclined to go without being invited oh greg he put up his hand stop where you are he said not a word from you you let that sneak into the house last night youre responsible for the whole miserable tragedy but you will not expose me you will not tell them no ill say nothing about it in case you take the next train you despise me i see it in your face youre right i do i despise you most thoroughly and i pray it may never be my misfortune to see your face again oh that girl that wretched blackeyed and you may stop there interrupted carker you refer to juanita im going to marry her i suppose you are id like to strangle her youll not be given an opportunity im going to ask mr merriwell to have a rig hitched up right away it will take you to the station make any excuses you choose or no excuses whatever but youre going better hurry back to the house now and pack up go on she saw words were useless and therefore she turned and hurried away toward the house carker stood there his right elbow in his left palm his chin resting on his hand he heard no sound and was unaware of any ones presence until a hand touched his arm with a start he found himself face to face with juanita there was a strange rapturous light in the girls eyes i asked for the proof she whispered you gif eet to me when you deed not know i was there behind the shrubberee i hear you tell her she must go i hear you tell her that you that you that you that im going to marry you said carker taking both her hands in his i mean it juanita ive decided on my course in the future if ill quit lecturing on socialism and suppress my thoughts and theories in that line carker senior will give me a lift in the world hell change his will if he becomes satisfied that ive reformed im a socialist juanita and i shall always remain a socialist but perhaps ive been a little too rabid perhaps ive been a little too rank socialism is all right but home is a great deal better im going to have a home of my own and im going to have you for the chief director of that home i think ill be satisfied to settle down with you there to anchor me im going to kiss you now juanita oh gregoree she murmured his lips smothered the remainder of the protest chapter xxx the educated horse honk honk honk frank glanced over his shoulder automobile coming bart he said shes raising a cloud of dust better give her plenty of room frank and bart were out for a morning horseback ride through the country after a dash of an hour or more they had turned back and were now in sight of farnham hall and merry home barts mount began to dance and lunge whoa pansy whoa lady he said soothingly she doesnt fancy buzz wagons a great deal merry she never did replied frank but shell get used to them theyre growing thicker every day ive ordered one myself honk honk honk sounded the automobile horn close behind them with a purring of the valves a soft panting from the exhaust and a whir of wheels a huge red machine flew past them in a cloud of dust forty miles an hour said hodge blinking his eyes and turning his cap brim down to the cloud of dust thats some speed for these roads merry and ill guarantee theyll go through town like that returned frank whew some of these machines ought to have a sprinkler attachment theyre stopping said bart by george theyre turning into your place did you know any one in the car got only a glimpse of them and they seemed to be strangers to me thats a flyer they have what make is it do you know its a french machine i believe it looks to me like a mercedes are you going to have an imported machine frank oh no im satisfied with the best american makes a good american machine is better adapted for our roads than any of the crack foreigners how do you make that out its simple enough in france they have grand roads everywhere their machines are made for such roads and on such roads they can fairly fly in this country we have a few fairly good roads but the majority of our highways are wretchedly bad the american makers have built machines adapted for such roads and on these roads our bettermade motor cars are superior to anything we can bring across the water but i understand that most of the american machines are fakes ive been told they are far from perfect frank laughed the perfect automobile has not been made and i doubt if it ever will be he answered the honest american manufacturers who know their business are making honest machines its true that there are a host of fakers in the business its true that nearly seventyfive per cent of the machines turned out at the present time are built for the sole purpose of making money for the manufacturers the american public has not yet been educated to the point of discerning between the fake and the honest article nevertheless theyre learning mighty fast and within a very few years the fakers are bound to reach the end of their ropes and go to the wall unless they change their methods five years from now onethird of the concerns now doing business will no longer be in the field ten years from now a half of the present manufacturers will be out of it that sounds a little pessimistical for you oh no bart its optimistical im confident that the sharks and sharpers will fail and the honest concerns will endure and prosper the automobile has come to stay there is no question about that the majority of the presentday buyers are going to be defrauded and many of them will become disgusted in purchasing a machine ive not relied on my own judgment but ive sought the advice of friends who were competent to advise i hope and i believe that ive got my moneys worth here we are and there are the gentlemen of the red bubble talking with some of the fellows the machine stood on the driveway in front of the house with the chauffeur still in his seat two of the four men had stepped out of the car and were talking with buck badger ephraim gallup and barney mulloy mrs merriwell was with a group of her friends on the veranda badger waved his hand as frank and bart turned in at the wide gate here are some gents what are looking for you merry called the kansan frank clattered up and drew rein but barts horse was frightened and shied at the machine hodge gave the little mare a touch of the spur and reined her toward the automobile after a time he succeeded in bringing her close to it and guiding her round it although she snorted and fretted and betrayed great alarm and excitement you countrymen will have to kill off a few of your skittish horses observed a stout sandymustached man one of the two who had left the car if you dont theyre liable to kill you i dont think theres any great danger of that as long as a man knows how to handle them properly said frank as he patted the neck of his own horse dick was afraid of automobiles but ive succeeded in eliminating that fear and you can see how he behaves now you never can be sure what a horse will do returned the stout man there never was one yet that had an ounce of brains theyre all fools do you think so smiled merriwell of course you have a right to your opinion but i dont believe many people will agree with you ive seen horses which were more intelligent than many men bah bah retorted the stranger they cant reason they cant think all they know is enough to eat and work the best horse in the country is none too good to pull a plow a queer twinkle flashed in franks eyes perhaps i can convince you of your mistake sir he said i dont happen to know your name but my name is basil bearover this young man here with a jerk of his thumb toward badger informs me that you are frank merriwell yes im frank merriwell mr bearover we were speaking of horses now ill admit that pansy yonder hasnt been properly educated in time i hope to improve her greatly in time i hope to teach her to perform a few simple mathematical problems although i doubt if shell ever be able to talk huh blurted bearover mathematical fudge able to talk what sort of rot are you trying to give me young man have you never seen a horse that could add subtract multiply and divide asked merry with pretended surprise no sir i never have nor has any one else wait a moment before you make such a confident statement now this horse of mine can do all those little things and still other things a great deal more surprising ill prove the truth of my statement to you hey dick dick my boy give me your attention now sir i wish you to do a little sum for me are you ready are you listening are you attentive the horse nodded its head as if in answer to these questions very good dick said frank ill give you a small sum in addition how many are two and two the horse lifted its forward right foot and struck the ground four times thats right dick thats right laughed merry patting the creatures neck now well take a little example in subtraction if we subtract five from ten how many have we left the horse struck the ground five times with its foot thats right again dick lets see what you can do in multiplication three times two make how many six times the horse struck the ground youre right up to the mark this morning dick said the animals master well finish up with a little subtraction if we take seven from fourteen how many will be left seven times dick pawed the ground there you are mr bearover nodded merriwell are you satisfied that even horses have brains im satisfied that youve trained that critter to do a few tricks was the answer you must think im purty dull witted why you begun with an example that made the horse paw the ground four times your next question required five strokes of the critters foot then came six and you followed it up with seven come come mr merriwell youre not dealing with chumps ive seen horses that could do them little things but its no sign of brains youre on the critters back by training it you could git it so it would paw the ground every time you pressed your knee against its shoulder git off the horse and stand away then lets see what it will do then lets see you make it do sums in addition subtraction and so forth very well said merry as he dismounted dropping the bridle rein on dicks neck well see what hell do in that manner he stroked the horses muzzle and the animal placed its head on his shoulder dick said frank this doubting thomas thinks its all trickery he cant believe that youre a finished mathematician we must convince him dick now be careful and give your answers correctly stand where you are sir frank retreated fully ten feet with his hands on his hips and a smile on his face he said well take a simpler sum in addition dick you understand this is addition old boy two and one make how many the horse lifted his foot and struck the ground three times let me give him a question grinned bearover lets see if hell answer me oh very well said frank dick do you see this gentleman here take a look at him hes going to give you a problem and you must answer it i trust hell make it a simple one you havent been brushing up in mathematics lately and a difficult problem might bother you a little will you kindly make it a simple question mr bearover oh yes oh yes chuckled the stout man ill make it simple enough lets see if your wonderful horse can tell us how many ten and five added together be the horse stood quite still for a moment and did not lift its foot instead of that the creature seemed to be eying basil bearover with a look of disdain finally a most astounding thing happened for dicks lip curled back exposing his teeth and from his mouth there seemed to issue these words any blamed fool would know that ten and five make fifteen chapter xxxi a challenge basil bearovers usually florid face turned pale and the man actually staggered the horse tossed its head wrinkled its upper lip and seemed to grin that gave the big bear a jolt he apparently observed bearovers companion was a huskylooking young irishman and he now seemed on the point of taking flight he was even paler than bearover and his teeth actually chattered together holy saints he gasped the divvil is in the beast it spakes dont get excited smiled merry i told you dick was an educated horse i think ive proved my statement now dick my boy youll follow bart and pansy round to the stable and permit toots to look after you ill see you at the usual hour this afternoon and give you your lessons in algebra and latin be a good boy dick trot along ta ta ta ta answered the horse as it turned away look out for the big bear he thinks hes a sharper but hes only a common lobster with a whisk of his tail and a flirt of his heels dick followed pansy and disappeared round the corner toward the stable basil bearover pulled himself together and took a deep breath say he huskily remarked have you a little something bracing round this place id like a small nip of whisky after that im sorry answered frank but i dont keep it in the house i havent a drop of liquor of any kind round the place be heaven exclaimed the irishman i nade a drink meself bearover placed a hand on his companions shoulder tell me mccann he said did you hear that horse speak i must have dreamed it i must be getting in a bad way it was no dream mr bearover was the answer i heard it meself the baste talked as plain as any man could spake jerusalem exploded the stout stranger as if struck by an idea that animal ought to make a fortune for its owner whatll you take for that horse mr merriwell you cant buy him sir was the quiet answer do you think id be heartless enough to sell dick after spending all this time in educating him and getting him trained to such a high point of perfection why it would break the poor creatures heart ill give you a thousand dollars for him offered the man thrusting a hand into his breast pocket and producing a pocketbook put up your money said frank i tell you that you cant buy him why if i should sell that horse to you just as likely as not hed be so disgusted and angry that hed never speak again you know its no small matter for a horse to talk it isnt natural for them it could only be produced by a mighty effort and the most natural thing in the world would be for the creature to relapse into dumbness if transferred to another owner bearover looked disappointed as he slipped the pocketbook back into its resting place glancing around he observed that the young man near at hand and the young ladies on the veranda were all smiling and laughing as if highly amused their suppressed merriment gave him a resentful feeling and suddenly his face flushed while an expression of anger came into his small eyes youre purty smart young man purty smart he said you think you fooled me dont ye well you didnt i happen to know how you done the trick youre a ventriloquist the horse didnt talk i was jest testing you to see if you would try to soak me by selling the critter to me bearover fibbed for although he had finally hit upon the truth it was an afterthought conjured up by the laughter of the spectators do yer mean to say the horse didnt spake demanded the irishman i heard it meself i tell ye i heard it meself thats all right mccann rasped the big man perhaps youve never seen a good ventriloquist do a turn but i have that horse cant talk any more than a cow or a dog or any other dumb creature can vale observed hans dunnerwurst who stood bear with his hands thrust deep into his trousers pocket it took it a long time to found you oudt dot hoss peen a good rithmeticker uf he coot talk or not yah youve had your fun with me mr merriwell said bearover ignoring the dutchman but i hope to have a little sport with you later ive driven over from wellsburg this morning for the express purpose of seeing you what can i do for you sir asked merry i understand you have a baseball team here do you mean my farnham hall team i dont know what you call it well i have a ball team made up of youngsters they are able to put up quite a game what sort of youngsters boys my pupils at the hall but i aint referring to that kind of a team i mean your regular team i mean the one you play on oh thats different youve got such a team here aint ye as you see a lot of my friends are visiting here just now i cant say that we have a regular organized team they told us in wellsburg you had and thats why i took the trouble to come here im manager of the rovers the strongest independent team of this country were making a tour by automobile and playing the best teams we can get up against i have a big sevenseated car at wellsburg and that machine together with this one carries my men from place to place we made arrangements to play wellsburg today and tomorrow we were to have a guarantee of three hundred dollars and sixty per cent of the gate receipts when we gut into wellsburg last night we found that the team had disbanded and the manager skipped out that leaves us without a game today and tomorrow were looking for a game this is mike mccann captain of my team the young irishman nodded and touched his cap brim go on invited merriwell ive always had a desire to meet you continued bearover you have a big reputation as a baseball man id like to play you in wellsburg for a purse evidently youre out for the dust said frank it takes money to run a team your team is composed of professionals isnt it theyre all salaried players just a bit out of our class were straight amateurs besides the chauffeur a rather sadfaced somberlooking man was sitting in the car this man now arose with a languid air and stepped out i told you how it would be bearover he said with a slight drawl merriwell has made his reputation by defeating secondclass amateur teams i didnt think hed have the sand to play a nine like the rovers who is this gentleman asked frank this is casper silence the backer of the rovers explained bearover mr silence mr merriwell how do nodded silence as he adjusted his nose glasses and surveyed frank from head to foot i presume the report that youre a back number may have some truth in it a great many pitchers use themselves up in their prime you look all right but i take it your arm is gone well now retorted frank you place me in a rather embarrassing position mr silence i dont feel like cracking up myself you know waugh snorted buck badger unable to keep still longer i certain opine youre still in the ring merry i judge it wouldnt take you long to show this gent that youre no back number youre a prosperous young man said silence still addressing frank such being the case if you have a team here why not play us in wellsburg for a small purse if youre the wizard weve heard you are you can make a little money while youre having the enjoyment of a game a purse of five hundred dollars would be all right it would suit us well play you tomorrow what do you say i say no sir answered frank if we were to play you for such a purse we would immediately become professionals like yourselves we have no desire to be classed as professionals and therefore i decline your proposition just as i thought nodded silence ive seen amateurs before who took refuge behind such an excuse well if youll not play us for a purse will you play us with the agreement that the winning team takes the entire gate proceeds not in wellsburg eh why not in wellsburg because i have a better baseball ground yonder within sight of this house because at the present time i have a house party here and were not looking for baseball games if your team of rovers will come here and meet us on my field well give you a game tomorrow i think what do you say boys you pet my life ve vill shouted dunnerwurst by gum thatll suit me came from gallup im with you merry said carson you know you can depend on me rumbled browning begorra it will suit me clane down to the ground came from mulloy waugh exploded badger you can bank on the whole bunch of us frank thats whatever but what inducement have we to come here demanded bearover this is a little driedup country town and we couldnt turn out a hundred and fifty people to see that game weve gut to make expenses somehow if you decide to play us here and the weathers favorable ill guarantee a thousand paid spectators its a safe guarantee and in all probability therell be two or three thousand persons here ill have the game announced by the wellsburg herald ill see that it is advertised in the neighboring towns we do not depend on bloomfield alone for our spectators they come in from all the surrounding towns well play with the understanding that the winning team takes the entire gate receipts if we win well donate the money to some charitable purpose if you win you may do whatever you please with it will you make a written guarantee that therell be at least a thousand paid admissions asked bearover with the weather favorable assented frank the manager of the rovers turned to silence what do you say casper he asked we havent any game for tomorrow and we cant arrange one unless we accept this mans terms silence shrugged his shoulders lighted a cigarette and stepped back into the car go ahead bearover he drawled make any arrangements you please all right merriwell said the manager well play you draw up that agreement in regard to the gate receipts and well sign it chapter xxxii a hard proposition directly after lunch frank had toots harness a span of fast steppers attach them to the doubleseated surrey and bring the team round to the front door merriwell mulloy and gallup sprang into the surrey waving adieus to the jolly party that had gathered on the veranda to see them off which way marsa frank asked toots as they reached the gate to wellsburg answered merriwell and get us there in a hurry show us what these ponies can do over twenty miles of good country road yes sah grinned the colored man ahll let de hosses out a notch or two sah jes as soon as we git frough de village it was a beautiful drive to wellsburg over an unusually level and wellmade strip of road the distance was covered in good time and the team finally stopped in front of the wellsburg bank take the team round to the franklin square hotel toots directed merry see that the horses are properly cared for well drive back in time for dinner mulloy and gallup followed frank into the bank merry called for the cashier when the gentleman appeared and greeted him cordially frank said mr casin i wish to introduce two of my friends mr barney mulloy and mr ephraim gallup glad to know you gentlemen bowed the cashier as he shook hands with both these young men wish to become depositors in your bank explained merriwell they both have an account with the phoenix national bank but it is their intention to close out that account and transfer the money to this bank well be very pleased to have mr mulloy and mr gallup as depositors bowed the cashier they will each give you a check on the phoenix bank said frank ill indorse those checks if that will make it satisfactory to you sir wholly satisfactory mr merriwell asserted casin mulloy and gallup produced check books and proceeded to draw checks at a standing desk used for that purpose by depositors these checks were made payable to the wellsburg first national bank and merriwell indorsed both of them casin himself received the checks and frank observed a slight expression of surprise on his face as he noted the sums for which they were drawn ten thousand dollars each he said is that right yes sor answered barney thots right sor its within two hundrid av all oi have in the phoenix bank oill use up the remainin two hundrid av oi see fit by drawin on it but for the prisint oi think oill let it remain there as a nist egg oive noticed nist eggs are moighty foine things to hav av ye kept thim warm they sometoimes hatch out all roight all roight no one had noticed the quiet entrance of a man who stood unobtrusively near listening to the talk with a yawn this man now advanced saying i beg your pardon gentlemen i presume its very rude but i need some change right away in order to pay a sum to a man who wishes to catch a train ive been unable to get this hundreddollar bill changed would you mind if the cashier stopped long enough to change it for me the speaker was casper silence backer of the rovers baseball team niver a bit do we moind answered barney its all roight sor go ahead yes go ahead nodded gallup weve gut loads of time silence pushed the hundreddollar bill through to the cashier who glanced at it critically asked what sort of change he desired and then gave at his request five tens and ten fives im very much obliged gentlemen very much obliged said silence bowing to mulloy and gallup i hope i havent interfered with you mr merriwell not in the least answered frank do you think well have good weather for the game tomorrow the indications are that the weather will be all right and are you still confident that we will be able to bring out a thousand people or more quite confident laughed frank one of my errands in wellsburg is to get a notice of the game into a newspaper here i thought of looking mr bearover up for the purpose of obtaining some facts concerning the rovers which might interest the newspaper readers i can give you any information you desire said silence in fact i have it here on this printed slip heres a whole history of the team and the players who make up the team youll see weve lost no games this season if youll read this slip through youll learn beyond question that our players form the most remarkable independent baseball organization ever assembled in this country while talking he had produced a leather pocketbook from which he took a printed slip at least six inches long this he handed to frank as silence opened the pocketbook both mulloy and gallup observed that it was well stuffed with bank notes and the one on top proved to be another hundreddollar bill i dont wish to take up your time mr merriwell said silence in his languid drawling manner but ill just run over the players so that youll understand who they are and get an idea of the records they have made you met mike mccann our shortstop hes from charleston of the south atlantic league and he knows the game from a to z toby mertez our right fielder is a new england leaguer having played on the nashua n h team last year jack grifford our center fielder is from youngstown the champions of the ohiopennsylvania league hoke holmes comes from birmingham in the southern league peep oday is the old national leaguer who was supposed to be down and out but he astonished every one by his work with jersey city in the eastern league last year hes our third baseman bill clover who covers the second sack comes from portland of the pacific coast league sim roach who gambols in our left garden is from los angeles of the same league bang bancroft was the second catcher of the champion pueblo team in the western league bancroft obtained the nickname of bang through his slugging year before last its possible youve never heard of mitt bender our crack pitcher hes been playing independent baseball but the boston americans were hot after him this year i had to open up handsomely in order to hold him our second pitcher is mike davis whos had much more experience than bender but who cant pitch more than one game a week and do his best when we go up against a light team we use toby mertez in the box and save both bender and davis now i think you understand the sort of team we have well said frank unless your men are hasbeens they ought to make a hot combination we havent a hasbeen in the bunch asserted silence quietly i think youll find the combination hot enough to suit you mr merriwell i understand youve never been batted hard i understand that no team has ever obtained more than eight or ten hits off you in a game we have an aggregation of hitters and the chances are youll get a proper good drubbing tomorrow you alarm me said frank like any other pitcher i have been bumped in my time in that case the experience may not seem so unpleasant tomorrow drawled silence fifteen or twenty hits are nothing for the rovers weve averaged ten hits through the whole season oill bet a hundrid dollars ye dont git tin hits tomorrow exploded mulloy unable to keep silent longer ill have to take that bet said the backer of the rovers oh no interposed frank i object i dont think therell be any betting as far as my players are concerned keep your money in your pocket mulloy silence smothered a slight yawn behind his hand im sorry youre so frightened merriwell he said im sorry you havent any more nerve that hundred dollars would help me along in defraying expenses waal gol derned if he dont figure it aout that hed have the hundred cinched if he made the bet spluttered gallup i should consider it as good as mine the moment the money was posted nodded silence as long as we cant make a little wager ill move along and pay off the gentleman who is waiting for me see you tomorrow good day he bowed himself out and leisurely walked away dod rap him snapped gallup id like to take some of the conceit aout of him weve gut to beat them rovers tomorrer merry if we dont ill be the sorest feller you can find in seventeen states and seven territories i dont know where youd discover so many territories laughed frank well do our best to beat them boys but were not in good practice you know begorra weve been practicin ivery day for a week came from mulloy that sort of practice isnt like regular games reminded merry we need to play a few games in order to get into firstclass form the cashier now passed out a little bank book to each of the depositors and followed it up with check books for their use well gentlemen he said i hope this is the beginning of a long and pleasant acquaintance between us mr merriwell is one of our most valued depositors hes doing a great work for the little town of bloomfield we regret very much hes not a citizen of wellsburg bloomfield should be proud of him i know it is proud of him wellsburg is proud of him too the whole county the whole state is proud of him by gum i kinder think yeouve narrered it daown too narrer mr carson said ephraim i kinder guess the whole blamed country is proud of him i stand corrected laughed the cashier i realize his fame extends much farther than the borders of our state yes i believe youre right mr gallup i believe the whole country is proud of mr merriwell as a representative young man of today after leaving the bank frank said i have some business of my own to look after now and i need a witness one of you might come along with me they both volunteered but he explained that both were not needed although they might come if they chose mulloy insisted on accompanying him waal then by hemlock said gallup ill kinder ramble raound over taown and see the sights arter being buried daown in mexico for the biggest part of a year it seems allfired good to git where theres people movin street cars runnin and plenty doin wherell i meet yeou boys meet us at the franklin square hotel at four oclock answered merry well be ready to start within ten minutes after four not more than five or ten minutes after parting from frank and barney gallup came face to face with a man who stepped squarely in front of him and held out a pudgy hand how do you do said this man im glad to see you young fellow saw you drive through with merriwell did he bring that wonderful educated horse with him it was basil bearover the manager of the rovers chapter xxxiii the voice of the tempter gallup grinned that was a hoss on yeou wasnt it mister he said would have been if id bought the beast confessed bearover with seeming good nature your mr merriwell must be a very clever chap i guess hes all right by gum nodded ephraim they dont git ahead of him much hes been very successful hasnt he you bet too much success is liable to swell the head of so young a man it does him good to be taken down a notch now and then i aint never seen nobody that could take him daown well well have to let him down a little tomorrow dont yeou believe it yeou fellers are caountin on carryin off that game aint ye waal by jing yell have to go some if ye do our boys can go some in order to give you a show i think well put in our second pitcher against you yeou take my advice and put in the best pitcher yeouve gut he wont be none too good you have a lot of confidence in your team ive gut confidence in frank merriwell i know what he can do on the slab and with bart hodge behind the bat hell show yeou some twists and shoots thatll make ye blink bearover laughed gurglingly his fat sides shaking why he said they tell me in this town that merriwell has some kind of a curve which twists like a snake they say it curves in and out whoever heard such rot didnt yeou ever hear before this abaout frank merriwells double shoot ho ho ho laughed bearover double shoot ho ho ho is that what he calls it come now young man dont try any more talkinghorse tricks there isnt no such thing as a double shoot the spit ball is the nastiest thing to hit that ever was invented its the only new thing except mathewsons fadeaway i dont take any stock in the stories about mathewsons fadeaway according to the yarns told he has something that might be called a double shoot or a double curve but i notice the batters are hitting him this year the same as usual i think well make mr merriwell very weary with his double shoot tomorrow afternoon you kin think as much as yeou like there aint nothing to prevent yeou from thinking weve heard all abaout your players happened to meet old stillness a while ago at the bank old stillness yep aint that his name stillness stillness i mean silence hes sort of a betting gentleman aint he oh hes always looking for good things hes ready to risk his money backing his team he come mighty near losing a hundred today how was that gallup explained then frank merriwell doesnt countenance betting questioned bearover hes plumb sot agin it answered ephraim he dont believe in any sort of gambling but evidently some of his friends are inclined to take a chance oh yeou git some of the fellers stirred up and they kinder fergit franks prejudice rub em agin the fur and theyll chuck up their last dollar thats good sporting blood nodded bearover i dont suppose you ever bet oh i dont go raound lookin for bets i low it aint jest good sense for anybody to resk money on onsartinties speckerlation and gamblin has ruined lots of folks but a little wager on a baseball game or any game of chance or skill adds spice to it suggested the manager of the rovers it makes it all the more interesting theres interest enough in any good clean baseball game without betting declared ephraim i suppose your team is made up of clean players they play the game on its merits dont they oh yes nodded the manager they play the game on its merits at the same time theyre good scrapping players and theyre out for every point that belongs to them thats the only way to win none of the boys like to be robbed waal they aint to blame for that bearover produced a cigar case have a smoke he invited dont keer if i do thank you said ephraim as he accepted a cigar youre a pleasant sort of chap said the manager of the rovers as he bit off the end of a cigar and slipped the case back into his pocket wait a minute i have a match here you are he held the light for gallup purty good weed that observed ephraim as he puffed at it spect that aint no fivecenter must be ten straight or three for a quarter anyhow these are silences special cigars he buys them by the box they cost him twenty dollars a hundred whew breathed gallup taking the cigar out of his mouth and looking at it admiringly thats twenty cents apiece ive paid that price out west now and then but i never heard of any one paying it in this part of the country where cigars ought to be reasonable guess this is just abaout as good a piece of tobacker as i ever stuck in my face im glad you appreciate it were pretty near the hotel lets drop in and have a drink much obleeged said ephraim but i dont drink thats one of the bad habits i aint never picked up well you can come along and take something cooling its pretty hot today therell be some of the boys in the billiard room at prileys you can meet them and look them over if you dont care to drink thats your business and ill guarantee you wont be urged waal thats pretty decent of you mr bearover said ephraim permitting the stout man to take his arm and lead him away in a few minutes they arrived at prileys hotel known in wellsburg to be the hang out of the sporting class were stopping here explained the baseball manager the franklin square is said to be the best place in town but its a little too stiff for the boys they can enjoy themselves here without feeling it necessary to put on style in the dining room you know some of the fellows are inclined to eat with their knives such manners might shock the aristocratic patrons of the franklin square in the billiard room they found a number of young men playing pool or looking on several of these proved to be members of the rovers baseball nine and bearover introduced them to gallup the bar opened off the billiard room and ephraim was finally led to it but he persisted in his resolution to drink nothing intoxicating a seltzer lemonade satisfied him while his companion took whisky when they returned to the billiard room they found casper silence there the backer of the rovers was telling with a great deal of disdain how he had nearly induced barney mulloy to make a wager but had been baffled by merriwells interference ive heard a great deal about the nerve of this youngster merriwell said silence but its my notion hes got a yellow streak in him his courage is mythical instantly gallup bridled yeou aint gut no right to say that mister he cried hotly yeou dont know what yeoure talking abaout ive had dealings with all sorts of human critters in my career ive handled niggers dagos scandinavians turks chinamen swedes frenchcanadians and heavenknowswhat ive seen western bad men and gun fighters galore i happen to know that frank merriwell has gut more nerve than any hundred men ive ever run acrost if they was all rolled into one there aint no squealer abaout him you bet he didnt bet and he didnt low barney mulloy to bet because it is aginst his principles it wasnt because he was afraid barney would lose that hundred silence smiled wisely i wouldnt be impolite enough to contradict you my friend he said at the same time you must permit me to have my own opinion of the matter it strikes me that mulloy was mighty willing to hide behind the fine principles of mr merriwell he was a little hot when he so rashly proposed to bet and he gladly took water as soon as merriwell spoke up it saved him a hundred were going to trounce your team tomorrow in handsome style we wont leave you in shape to do any boasting for some time to come yeou git aout shouted gallup you couldnt beat us in a year with frank merriwell in the box you aint built right at this the ball players present joined silence in a burst of laughter well rub it into ye mr gallup said mike mccann well wipe up the earth with ye id like to find some one who had nerve enough to make a little bet on your team said silence of course i dont expect any of you fellows will dare risk a dollar dad rap ye snapped gallup ill make a bet yeou neednt go tell frank nuthin abaout it but ill bet yeou something ill bet anything yeou want to bet and i dont keer a hang haow much it is yeou jest name the amount and ill kivver it he smashed his fist down on a billiard table as he made this announcement why youre a real sport chuckled silence youre a reckless chap arent you if i should say a hundred dollars youd wilt in your boots ephraims blood was boiling now you kin say one hundred dollars or ten hundred dollars or ten thousand dollars he almost yelled ive gut the money and i tell ye ill chuck it up i know yeouve gut a wad in your pocket for ive seen it pull it out put it up ill go ye drive him into his boots mr silence hissed mike mccann youll see him squawk in a minute silence produced his pocketbook as long as youre such a courageous young man he said well test you i am carrying quite a roll with me its a little habit i have i might accidentally drop into a good warm poker game and need it what was that highest figure you named did you say ten thousand dollars i believe i have something like that right here well make it ten thousand will you call the proprietor of the hotel mccann i think hes in the office hell hold the money for us even then gallup did not believe silence in earnest he took it as a bluff and continued to make a front put it up put it up he nodded im right here im waiting to see that money stuck up mike mccann hurried into the office and returned directly followed by fred priley the hotel proprietor mr priley said silence this young man has been making some betting talk you know were going to play frank merriwells team tomorrow at bloomfield its doubtful if the gate money will cover our expenses for that reason ive been looking around to make a little wager on that game this chap says hell bet anything from one hundred dollars to ten thousand dollars let me see if i can dig up ten thousand with perfect coolness he opened a pocketbook and counted out ten onethousand dollars which he handed to priley that leaves me a hundred or two he said which will carry me over until i get my roll back and this gentlemans long green with it with a sneering smile he turned and regarded gallup ive put my money up he said now lets see you do the same thing or squeal gallup swallowed down a lump which had risen in his throat derned if i ever squealed in my life he snarled ive gut ten thousand right in the wellsburg bank and ill draw a check on it jest as soon as i kin make it aout oh no laughed silence that wont do i cant accept your check i want to see the money mebbe yeou think the check aint no good didnt yeou come into the bank and see me deposit the money yes i saw it but youre aware i presume that the law would not enforce the payment of that check in case you lost your wager and i attempted to collect you might stop payment at the bank and i could whistle for my money yeou dont think id do anything like that do ye i dont propose to take any chances mr gallup said the man as he glanced at his watch there are now exactly ten minutes before the bank closes if youre earnest well accompany you to the bank and you can draw your money mebbe they wont have ten thousand on hand to pay a check of that bigness then you can exchange your own check for a bank check if you do that you cant stop payment on the banks check in case you lose lets have all these little matters properly arranged in advance will you do that or are you going to squeal i never squealed in my life repeated ephraim with a snarl come on come on to the bank well fix it chapter xxxiv a troubled mind ephraim found that casper silence was very much in earnest there was no bluff about the mans proposal to bet ten thousand dollars and gallup was not the sort of chap to back down after making such talk naturally the cashier at the bank looked surprised when gallup asked for a bank check in exchange for his own check drawn for the full amount of his deposit mr casin however did not ask questions but made out the bank check and passed it to ephraim in the presence of witnesses this check was placed in the hands of fred priley to cover the ten thousand dollars posted by silence casper silence took pains to examine the bank check over which he nodded and smiled returning it to priley thats all right i fancy he said it ought to be as good as gold coin then he turned to ephraim with pretended admiration young man youve got genuine sporting blood he said youve got nerve i cant help admiring your nerve although i fear your judgment is rather poor i hope you wont feel the loss of that little sum in case you do lose it which you certainly will oh i guess i could stand it retorted the vermonter i presume you could mr gallup youre young and energetic and you may live long enough to accumulate ten thousand more dollars dont yeou fret abaout me snapped gallup in exasperation you quite misunderstand smiled silence im not fretting about you in the least far from it i was seeking to give you a little compliment better tell your friends of the great merriwell baseball team to do their level best tomorrow better tell them what it means to you if your team loses i wont tell them nuthin of the sort growled gallup i dont propose to say a hanged word abaout it and yeoull obleege me if you keep your mouth shet too if mr merriwell found it aout hed be hot under the collar and give me a good dressing daown oh very well agreed silence ill say nothing its a small matter to me silence bearover and priley bade gallup good day and left for prileys hotel ephraim watched the proprietor of the rovers as the man sauntered away yeoure a goldinged gambler thats what yeou be muttered the vermonter yeoure a man thats allus lookin for suckers and yeou think yeouve ketched one naow waal mebbe yeou have but well see abaout that i kinder guess yeoure due to bunt up aginst a redhot surprise tomorrer you wont feel so fine and sarcastic arter that game nevertheless gallup was troubled by an unpleasant feeling that he had been reckless and imprudent to an almost reprehensible degree like many another man he had attempted to call a bluff only to find that the other chap was not bluffing with his hands thrust deep into his pockets the downeaster stood on the sidewalk and stared after silence until the man turned a corner and disappeared he saw the baseball proprietor laughing as he talked to his companions every gesture and every expression indicating that silence was absolutely confident he would win the bet a man is a blamed fool to have anything to do with critters of his caliber was ephraims decision i feel like id kinder lowered myself somehow thutteration what if we should lose that game a cold chill ran over him of course its possible he said but i dont low its probable even frank merriwell can be beat sometimes my jinks wouldnt it be awful if things should go wrong whew he fished out his handkerchief and mopped his face with it at last gallup was beginning faintly to realize the extent of his folly although he continued strolling around the town he found no further pleasure in the sights of wellsburg in vain he sought to turn his mind from the thoughts of the coming contest between the merries and the rovers and the possibility of defeat for franks team never before had he been troubled by such doubts and fears finally he sought the franklin square hotel in the lobby of which he was sitting in moody meditation when frank and barney appeared is it a trance youre in oi dunno cried mulloy as he gave gallup a sharp nudge wake up me bhoy eh grunted gallup looking up and starting to his feet why hanged if i noticed yer when yeou come in your mind seemed to be far away observed merry you actually looked troubled and careworn whats the matter eph not a thing not a blamed thing declared gallup forcing a sickly smile to his face what were you thinking about so glumly oh nuthin i was jest kinder meditatin on the fact that most folks are tarnal fools and i guess im abaout the biggest fool i know thats hardly like you youre not usually troubled with such thoughts hes gitting older and wiser frankie chuckled mulloy oi think hes becomin acquainted wid himself yeou aint gut nuthin to say snapped eph yeou wanted to make a bet with mr silent didnt ye oi did nodded barney av it hadnt been for frankie to kape me sinsible oid cracked up me money on the shpot its frankie whots got the livel head gallup the rest av us are chumps begobs i guess by gum thats correct nodded eph the older i git the bigger chump i become whats it all about laughed merry oh nothing nothing again asserted the vermonter i was jest kinder meditatin on some of my foolish breaks i dont believe i know enough to paound sand i cant understand whats made you so pessimistic concerning yourself a man who can make ten thousand dollars of his own accord at your age and salt it away where its safe has no right to be ashamed of himself who knows whether its safe or not muttered eph its pretty safe in the wellsburg bank old man you neednt worry about that i think ill find toots and have the horses hitched up well strike out for bloomfield right away mulloy lingered with gallup as frank turned away whativer is atin yez ephie demanded barney phwoy dont yez spake up and tell the truth haow do yeou know i aint told the truth asked gallup with mingled offense and shame oive bunked with yez for a year oive known yez under all sorts of circumstances me laddie buck and i can tell when youre spakin the whole truth and whin youre tryin to hide something oim yer frind eph and ye know it phwoy dont ye spake out and make a clane breast av it phwats the mather i dont like to have nobody stomp on my cot tail mumbled the vermonter when a man rubs me the wrong way it kinder riles me and im pretty apt to resent it yeoud made a bet with old silence if frank hadnt happened araound wouldnt ye oi would confessed barney oid been just chump enough to go him for any owld sum up to foive hundrid dollars all the same ephie thot was foolishness on my part whats a feller goin to do when one of these toplofty critters comes araound arubbin it into him demanded gallup nobody likes to have em asneerin and achucklin i like to shet them kind of folks up and shet em up good and hard ive seen old silence sence we left the bank phwat gasped mulloy a sudden light breaking upon him ye dont mane it ephie begorra yeve been bettin on the game thats jest what i have nodded gallup grimly arter yeou and frank went off and i went to roamin araound i run up aginst the big bear he give me a cigar and we went into prileys hotel he wanted me to have a drink with him but i didnt take nuthin intoxicatin silence was there with a whole lot of them baseball fellers they was makin a lot of talk abaout haow theyd trim us tomorrer they gut my blood to biling and i told em a few things that critter silence begun to give me the laugh he said us fellers made a lot of talk but we didnt have sand to back it up dod bim him i guess i showed him i had sand ephie said the young irishman soberly you and oi are a little too suddin in making back talk to thim kind av crathers shtill oi cant blame yez my bhoy dont yeou tell frank nuthin abaout it barney entreated gallup i wouldnt have him find aout for anything thots the bad part av it gallup thots kaping a secret from frankie its doing something we know he wouldnt countenance i guess thats what made me feel so rotten mean abaout it how much did yez bet wid him did yez put up a hundrid moren that two hundrid moren that begobs ye did plunge my bhoy well it wont break yez av we should happen to lose i dunno abaout that half groaned gallup barney looked puzzled and somewhat excited how much did yez bet ephy he asked tell me the truth old mon spake up sh hissed gallup dont say another word here comes frank merriwell rejoined them well start right away boys he said toots will have the team round in less than five minutes chapter xxxv remorse as they were passing prileys hotel casper silence hailed them pull up toots said merry lets see what he wants the colored boy stopped the horses and silence came out one point mr merriwell he said we havent decided on the umpire for that game its generally understood that the home team furnishes the umpire i believe returned frank thats a matter of accommodation in this case it wont be any particular accommodation for us is that so thats right if you dont mind well furnish the umpire what if i do mind why should you i happen to have a good man who will officiate for us he knows the game and i know him but i dont know him protested silence i give you my word that he is square ive been told such things before ive had plenty of experience mr merriwell and i know the sort of square umpires to be found through the country ive had a few experiences myself returned frank and i confess they were not pleasant ones ive been up against crooked umpires more than once nevertheless i promise you ill supply a man who is thoroughly honest and conscientious it doesnt satisfy me youll supply one of your friends of course thats right nodded frank i shall have to object sir said the proprietor of the rovers it would be the most natural thing for your friend to favor you in close decisions it might seem a natural thing but ive often observed that the most conscientious umpires are so very careful that frequently they give their own friends the worst end of a deal silence shrugged his shoulders and laughed languidly i dont think that happens very often he said and i wouldnt expect it to happen in this case if it should youd be sore on the other hand if your friend gave you all the close points wed be sore lets get around that lets take a man who will have no particular interest in either team lets have an umpire from somewhere outside of your town no returned frank firmly ill furnish the umpire i did not seek this game you came to bloomfield looking for it and if youre not satisfied with the arrangements ill make you can easily cancel the engagement i dont want to cancel it all i want is an umpire wholl give both teams a fair show now i understand they have such a man here in wellsburg a chap who is capable of handling a game right up to the mark his name is bowers merriwell laughed i happen to know this bowers he said ive seen him work and the recollection is hardly a pleasant one he does know the game but he can be influenced thats putting it in a mild fashion i have reasons to believe that bowers deliberately tried to give my farnham hall team the short end of a game played here in this city no sir ill not accept bill bowers well we can find some one else dont put yourself to the trouble ive told you i would supply the man and ive guaranteed his honesty if you dont like that youre at liberty to cancel why not have two umpires well furnish one and you may furnish the other under most circumstances frank would have accepted this proposition without demur just now he had a feeling that silence was determined to obtain some advantage in the umpire he knew greg carker to be honest from his head to his feet and therefore he resolved not to yield a point to the proprietor of the rovers therell be only one umpire mr silence he said its useless to argue over that point casper silence frowned youre an obstinate young man he exclaimed i think well have to call that game off oh very well smiled merry well cancel the engagement now and ill step in here and telephone the wellsburg herald to that effect thats right frank put in gallup dont fool with em a bit silence gave the vermonter a queer look you seem rather anxious my friend he drawled no doubt youd like to have the game canceled you appear to be frightened no we wont cancel it merriwell well accept your umpire but i want to give you fair notice now that well stand for no partiality on his part well have a fair show or well make trouble if he tries to rob us hell get thumped it was franks turn to laugh i wouldnt advise you or any of your players to attempt to thump any one on farnham field he said if you do youll precipitate a riot and i dont believe youll like whatll happen dont threaten me mr silence i dont like it and i may take a fancy to cancel the game anyhow oh go ahead sneered silence i know youre frightened cancel it if you like and ill tell the facts to the wellsburg herald i want you to understand that this game means something to me indeed why yesterday you entered into an agreement to play in bloomfield with the greatest reluctance you didnt seem to think it would pay you it wont pay as far as the gate receipts go of course we expect to take the entire gate money but im not fussing about that ive made a little wager on this game and i propose to win it is it possible you found some one in wellsburg who was willing to back us against your professional team questioned merry oh yes i found some one in wellsburg who was willing to do that answered the man again glancing toward gallup ephraim was worried for he feared that silence would break his agreement not to tell about the bet he frowned and shook his head a bit without being observed by frank ive promised you a square deal silence said merriwell if youll take the trouble to inquire youll find plenty of people in this little city who will assure you that i always keep my word were due home at dinner and well have to drive along good day sir toots chirruped to the horses and they were off i dont fancy going back on an agreement with any one observed merry but im rather sorry that we made arrangements to play that team those men are professionals and theyre not in our class its evident silence is a gambler gambling ruins any sort of a game the man who bets money is liable to take most any questionable advantage in order to win betting is bad business anyway you look at it it ruins a mans fine principles yeou dont think that allus happens do ye frank asked gallup dont yeou believe some decent fellers bet occasionally oh yes occasionally but the man who gets into it in a small way is pretty sure to keep it up if he wins it baits him on to repeat if he loses he feels that he must take another chance to get even i saw many bad results of gambling both at school and at college at yale lots of young fellows who had no right to do so made bets on baseball football and other games in most instances the money they risked had been supplied by their parents they knew their parents would not countenance gambling yet they gambled it was not honorable no man has a right to risk money on which any other person has a claim now for instance you ephraim would have no right to risk your money on an uncertainty of this sort youre married you have a child both your wife and child have claims on the money you possess were you to wager that money and lose it you would be robbing them of their just rights i presume youve thought of this matter never thought of it that way mumbled the vermonter huskily spose i should put my money into some sort of business and lose it would that be robbin teresa and the youngster thats a different thing business is business no man has a right to plunge into a reckless venture but if it seems legitimate and he has investigated it carefully he cannot be blamed if the venture proves a failure the best and shrewdest men sometimes fail in business enterprises ive never yet seen a genuine gambler who was thoroughly upright conscientious and respected by decent people i have seen gamblers who were honest to all appearances but they were not respected theres something degrading in gambling the man who gambles is compelled as a rule to associate with a class of men who have no standing in respectable society he places himself on their level now you ephraim would not care to be estimated on the same level as casper silence hes not a man you would invite to your home introduce to your wife and dine with at your table not by a blamed sight growled the vermonter another bad feature of gambling is the effect on the individual who indulges in it it spoils his taste for legitimate money making if hes successful for a time as a gambler the regular methods of making money seem tame and insipid to him very few if any thoroughbred gamblers ever accumulate a fortune or a competence and retain it once the germ of gambling gets into their blood they never quit let them make a small fortune and theyre determined to double it let them make a large fortune and they still pursue gambling for the excitement there is in it in the end nine out of ten go broke if others depend on them they bring hardship and suffering upon those dependent ones most gamblers die poor its logic begobs put in mulloy you both know pursued frank that the loss of a few hundred dollars on a baseball game would not mean a great deal to me i might have made a wager with casper silence had i lost the bet it would not have brought immediate hardship or deprivation on any one it was not the mere loss of a hundred or a thousand dollars that restrained me it was the principle of the thing i looked at that i figured this thing out years ago and thats why ive been opposed to gambling more than once ive been tempted to set aside my scruples when some blatant loudmouthed chap has challenged me and shook his money in my face such a thing stirs my blood its mighty unpleasant to have one of these chaps accuse me of lacking nerve i have one consolation however its not a sign of nerve or courage to be led into anything wrong through the taunts of another usually its a sign of cowardice the boy who does a hazardous and unwise thing simply because a companion dares him to do it is the one who lacks nerve he lacks nerve to say no i wont i guess yeoure right frank confessed gallup dolefully by hemlock ive been dared into a lot of tomfool things in my day next time anybody tries it on me im goin to remember what yeouve jest said ill say no by thutteration and ill say it mighty laoud too chapter xxxvi a friend worth having they arrived at merry home in time to wash up and sit down to dinner with the rest of franks jolly house party it peen some redhot paseball practice we put into us this afternoon frankie said dunnerwurst py chorge der game vill play us tomorrow on well have

sought her friend juanita garcia to whom she confided her fears that ephraim was on the verge of a sick spell gallup wandered off by himself and strolled around the grounds with his head down and his hands in his pockets occasionally muttering and growling in a disgusted manner barney mulloy found an opportunity to follow ephraim come on eph he said slipping an arm through gallups lets you and oi go for a warruk you nade it my bhoy you nade it if yeoull jest take me daown to the lake and kick me in ill be much obleeged to ye barney said the vermonter its moighty bad youre faling oi dunno by

sittled come now lets go back to the house and make belave were happy tomorrow well play baseball loike the divvil himsilf chapter xxxvii a protest the morning paper from wellsburg arrived in bloomfield at seven oclock before the coming of frank merriwell to bloomfield this morning paper had been able to boast of barely a dozen regular subscribers or purchasers in the little town now however things were different and bloomfield took fully fifty copies of the paper each morning the formerly indifferent citizens had become eagerly anxious to get the paper as soon as possible after its arrival each morning in order to be posted on the county and state news the increasing circulation in bloomfield had been noted by the editor of the herald who wisely decided to have a regular correspondent in that town who would furnish a daily news letter this correspondent had faithfully reported the reunion of frank merriwells old flock and the doings of the house party at merry home between eight and nine oclock each forenoon frank found a short period of rest from his duties at farnham hall on the morning following the arrangements for the ball game with the rovers he jogged into town in company with hodge and called at the post office for his mail something unusual seemed to be taking place at the post office more than a dozen villagers were assembled there in two or three groups all of them talking earnestly and some appearing decidedly excited merry observed that many of them held wellsburg heralds in their hands whats up frank questioned hodge suppose the advertisement of that game today has kicked up all this disturbance i cant tell answered merry perhaps well find out as they stepped inside they heard a tall thinlipped man declaiming in a sharp rasping voice youll find out neighbors that my predictions will come true theyre coming true already the spirit of frivolity and sin is running riot in this town wickedness is rampant staid and respectable citizens are losing their dignity good church members are becoming afflicted with this worldly spirit and whos to blame for it all whos to blame theres only one man hes created this indescribable change the foolish ones have regarded him as a public benefactor but i insist that hes doing untold harm he brought about the downfall of brother hewett who was respected and revered by every one in bloomfield for years youre afraid of him thats whats the matter you dont dare to speak out and express yourself now im not afraid of him i am ready to denounce him in public im ready to denounce him to his face you know who i mean his name is er hum how good morning deacon crabtree said frank as the speaker stammered and hemmed having ceased abruptly in his remarks i notice that as usual you are denouncing sin and wickedness bloomfield should be proud of the fact that it has one man who makes no compromise with iniquity evidently you stand firmly rooted on the rock of righteousness yes sir yes sir thats right said crabtree im not one of these whiffleminded creatures who changes his opinion every time the wind changes thats a very good thing nodded merriwell i havent much patience with people who are so extremely changeable at the same time it must be admitted there is some truth in the saying that only mules and fools never change their minds jeremiah crabtree turned red in the face is this a jab at me young man he snapped are you personal in your remarks i hope you wont take it as personal unless it happens to hit your case mr crabtree people seldom care to wear clothes that do not fit them what has happened now thats caused all this commotion and talk mebbe you havent seen the herald this morning i confess i havent well youd better read it if youll look in the second column on the first page youll find something about a great tenthousanddollar baseball game thats going to take place in bloomfield today a tenthousanddollar game yes sir dont you know anything about it well im aware that theres to be a baseball game here this afternoon i was not aware it was to be a tenthousanddollar game well look at that look right there snapped crabtree holding up the paper and pointing a long bony finger at an article in the second column notice the heading in big black type notice it says that frank merriwells own baseball team will play the rovers the champion independent team of the country for ten thousand dollars merry smiled i think thats an exaggeration he said i think thats simply an advertising dodge mr crabtree do you mean to say you aint made no arrangement to play this team for a sum of money do you mean to say there aint been no betting on the game this article distinctly states that one of your friends and a player on your team has made a wager of ten thousand dollars that youll beat the rovers i mean to say i know nothing whatever of such a wager and i do not believe that a bet of that sort has been made i was in wellsburg yesterday and gave the herald certain information to be used in advertising this game but i assure you i gave them no information concerning a wager of that sort on the face of it the yarn appears decidedly preposterous i think bloomfield citizens are generally aware of the fact that i am opposed to betting in any form i know youve always claimed you was said crabtree with a sneer but cordin to some of the things ive heard about ye youve been a mighty sportin young feller in your day youve lived pretty high for a youngster and youve had dealings with sportin people they tell me you dont drink you dont gamble you dont swear and you dont do any of them things but i fail to understand how any man can associate with persons who do drink and swear and gamble without acquiring such habits himself now sir its a wellknown fact that professional ball players are generally dissolute and disreputable these rovers are professionals they claim to be when you play ball against them you sort of put yourself in their class well not exactly mr crabtree denied frank i presume you are aware that a number of college baseball teams play games early every season with teams of the national and american leagues yale usually plays the new york nationals in new york the yale team is made up of nonprofessional college men amateurs in good standing they do not become professionals by engaging in a game with the new york nationals i dont care to discuss this matter with you mr crabtree i simply give you my assurance that i know nothing whatever of this tenthousanddollar wager and i am satisfied that no such wager has been made the story is intended to arouse excitement and interest with the evident purpose of bringing out a crowd of spectators to witness the game then its a fraud and a deception cried jeremiah flourishing the paper in his right hand and shaking his clenched left hand in the air its a falsehood a barefaced lie its an imposition on the public youre concerned in it sir you cant get out of it if you dont know anything about it youre concerned just the same i fail to see how you make that out when you make an agreement to play them professionals you knew what sort of men they were if theyve originated this yarn for the purpose of deceiving people youre responsible because youve had dealings with them thats rather farfetched mr crabtree nothing farfetched about it if i should purchase a horse of you for a hundred dollars and in order to increase the apparent value of that horse with the idea of selling him to some one else i should go around informing people i had paid three hundred dollars would you be responsible in any way do you feel that in any manner you would be party to the falsehood rufus applesnack had been listening to the talk and now he gave crabtree a jab in the ribs hes gut ye deacon hes gut ye chuckled the grocery man hes gut ye right where the wool is short i fail to see it i fail to see it rasped crabtree there aint no similarity in the two cases my mind is made up on the point and i dont propose to change it which sorter reminds me of the mule mr merriwell mentioned a few minutes ago declared applesnack as he turned away frank secured his mail and was leaving the post office when outside the door he came face to face with owen clearpath the new parson of the village church id like to have a word with you mr merriwell said the parson just a word he drew frank aside while hodge waited i dont see how merry keeps his patience and temper in dealing with these hidebound yokels muttered bart clearpath seemed confused and ill at ease he hemmed a little while merry waited quietly for him to speak suddenly the young minister began as if forcing himself with a great effort to say something he regarded as decidedly disagreeable you know mr merriwell he said that i hold you in the highest estimation you know im considered by the members of my church and the people of this town generally as a liberal preacher in fact im entirely too liberal to suit some of the church members youve done a splendid work for bloomfield and youre doing a splendid work im proud of you sir it isnt necessary to sugar coat the pill parson smiled frank just hand it out to me and ill swallow it well you know theres been several unpleasant not to say sensational occurrences in this town of late i dont suppose youre to blame for everything that has happened i have insisted that you could not be blamed for the unfortunate misstep of brother hewett who was tempted to take a little more hard cider than was really good for him your detractors have insisted that the deacon was led into this action through his exuberance over the arrival of your friends some of them have tried to hold you responsible for brother hewetts temporary downfall im very sorry the deacon did such a thing asserted frank i hope youve not been too harsh with him parson i havent mentioned the matter to him ive thought it best to overlook it for im certain he feels deeply humiliated and downcast i know for a fact that hes heard of it from other quarters ive tried to show him that my confidence is unshaken which i believe was a very wise course to pursue another thing that caused a great sensation was the unfortunate death of that mexican who broke into your house some ten days ago there have been all sorts of rumors about that affair im positive the facts were given to the coroners jury who failed to find any one save murillo responsible no one could feel more disturbed over the matter than i have said frank you see your enemies are inclined to use such matters against you if possible a number of persons have come to me this morning and shown me an item in the wellsburg herald ive just seen that item said frank let me assure you parson that so far as i have the slightest knowledge im positive theres not a word of truth in the statement that a tenthousanddollar wager has been made on the result of the baseball game to be played this afternoon clearpath looked relieved im glad to hear you say that he breathed i decided to ask you about it have i your authority to deny the truth of that statement you may say i gave you my word that i knew nothing whatever of the matter ill do so sir ill do so if you think the game will be clean and respectable i may decide to witness it myself its not my intention to permit anything on farnham field that may not be witnessed by you by any lady or by any child in town i hope to see you at the game this afternoon parson chapter xxxviii a confession ere leaving the village frank called on bill hunker the constable mr hunker he said i need your services this afternoon i want you at the baseball ground and you had better bring along five or six good husky assistants let them all have authority as deputies every man will be paid regular wages for special service be you lookin for trouble asked hunker no im not looking for it smiled frank im determined that there shall be no trouble i have a premonition that well see an unusually large crowd and im confident the crowd will contain a rough element it is my purpose to suppress any symptoms of disorder all right nodded hunker ill be there with the boys you can depend on me frank was right in believing the game would bring out an astonishing number of spectators that afternoon all roads seemed to lead to bloomfield with the opening of the gates an hour before the time for the game to begin a stream of spectators commenced pouring on farnham field this stream grew steadily in volume hunker and his companions with their badges prominently displayed were on hand at the gates and held the impatient crowd in check the ticket sellers and ticket takers were kept busy as bees the stand soon became packed to suffocation while the temporary seats which had been erected overflowed before either team appeared on the field frank had taken the precaution to have ropes stretched for the purpose of holding the crowd back it was well that he did so thirty minutes before the hour set for the game two large touring cars brought the rovers onto the field they were received with cheers a party of farnham hall boys escorted them from the cars to the dressing rooms reserved for them in the meantime merriwell and his players were making ready for the contest when they were prepared to go out frank called them around him boys he said as he looked them over its going to be a hard game and i hope every man is prepared to do his best before we go out i have a question to ask you know theres a report that a wager has been made on the result of this game the wellsburg herald made the statement that some one of this team has wagered ten thousand dollars with casper silence ive regarded the yarn as preposterous at the same time ive decided to ask you one and all frankly and fairly if you know anything about such a wager do you know anything about a wager of any sort if theres any one present who knows its up to him to speak out here and now a few moments of dead silence followed then ephraim gallup pale and agitated pushed barney mulloy aside and stepped forward i guess by gum its up to me frank he said i dont blame yeou for thinkin yeou didnt have no friend here who was chump enough to make such a bet im the chump vot vos dot gasped hans dunnerwurst you dond pelief me dit ten thousand dollars pet you ephie mine cootness cracious sakes alife you vos a spordt im a tarnal fool mumbled gallup i know it then you did make a bet ephraim said frank unable to repress his feeling of dismay yes i done it i hope the whole blamed bunch will kick me i aint goin to make no excuses but when that critter silence tried to rub it into me i gut so tarnal hotheaded that i right up and told him id go him for any old figger i didnt spose hed make it so large your talk abaout betting has made me so allfired disgusted with myself that i jest want to jump off the earth this is bad business bad business muttered frank give me all the particulars gallup ephraim did so when the vermonter had finished merry drew a deep breath you cant afford to lose that bet gallup he said what are you going to do with the money if you win do with it dad birn it ill burn it up that would be still more foolish if you lose you will be down to bed rock again yes ill be jest abaout the same as busted divvil a bit av it cried barney mulloy gallup is me owld side parthner av he loses oill divvy wid him but he mustnt lose said frank philanthropists in wellsburg are endeavoring to raise money to found a hospital for consumptives theres an ideal location some ten miles from wellsburg if you win gallup would you donate your winnings to the hospital fund yeou bet i will cried ephraim eagerly ill give em every cent of it thats good nodded frank now boys were going into this game to win it if we ever played ball in our lives were going to play it today i think and hope this experience will teach gallup the folly of betting i shall use all the skill i possess in the game and i want you boys to back me up we cant lose we wont lose although his words were spoken in a quiet tone they aroused something in every listener that stirred his blood and caused it to leap in his veins thats right thats right they cried well win today come on said merry well go out now as he marched onto the field with his friends and comrades following at his heels the great crowd rose and uttered a roar of welcome batting practice fellows said frank and they went at it at once three minutes later the rovers in tigerish suits of yellow and black trotted out from their dressing rooms back of the ropes near first base a toughlooking crowd of wellsburgans greeted the professionals with a cheer eat em up mccann howled a husky fellow with a broken nose take some of the conceit outer this merriwell today hes been crowing over wellsburg long enough merry glanced around and saw hunker with several of his assistants gathering in the vicinity of this tough crowd bill is onto his job muttered frank if theres any disturbance those fellows will make it the rovers took the field for practice they handled themselves like professionals and many of their clever catches or stops elicited exclamations of wonderment and applause casper silence and basil bearover approached frank wheres your umpire merriwell demanded bearover merry looked round and motioned to gregory carker carker promptly stepped forward here he is said frank bearover placed himself in front of carker at whom he glowered see here young man he said we want no monkey business today if you dont give us whats coming to us youll get into trouble in short order we know how to deal with crooked umpires evidently you do not know how to deal with gentlemen said greg youll get your due and not a whit more bullying and browbeating will not give you an advantage oh youre rather a stiffnecked young man aint ye growled the big bear lets understand the ground rules before we begin how about a wild throw into the crowd merriwell perhaps wed better make a rule that such a throw will give the base runner the privilege of advancing one base and no more suggested frank thats satisfactory to us nodded bearover do you think you can keep the crowd off the outfields i have six officers here for the purpose of handling this crowd not only will i see that the spectators do not intrude on the outfields but ill guarantee that those officers will suppress any riot or disturbance they have full authority to arrest any one who attempts to make trouble here today casper silence yawned and lighted a cigarette there wont be any disturbance unless you chaps try to steal this game said bearover we dont have to steal games returned merry quick as a flash we can win them silence smiled scornfully as he breathed forth a whiff of smoke that may have been your experience in the past he observed but youre up against a different proposition today young man will you give your batting order to our scorer asked bearover youll find our scorer sitting yonder said merry hell give you the batting order one more point suggested silence you seem determined to have things pretty much your own way here i know its customary for the home team to take its choice of innings in this case its possible you may be able to concede a point and give us the choice why certainly replied frank with a smile you may choose then well let you bat first a few minutes later the rovers came in and merrys team trotted onto the field the scorers recorded the batting order of each team as follows merries rovers mulloy d b mccann ss hodge c mertez rf merriwell p grifford cf badger d b holmes st b diamond ss oday d b browning st b clover d b gallup cf roach lf carson lf bancroft c dunnerwust rf bender p practice was soon over and merry called his team in again the rovers trotted onto the field greg carker broke open a box and tossed out a snowwhite ball bender caught the ball with one hand and promptly proceeded to soil it by rubbing it on the grass outside the pitchers box play ball called carker clearly chapter xxxix jolts for bullies bender was a thin sinewy longarmed hatchetfaced chap who looked like an indian he had traveled in fast company for years but was said to be a hard man to handle having jumped more than one contract and being of a sullen and revengeful disposition bancroft the catcher was a rather stocky individual inclined to be a trifle too fat the general observer decided him out of condition and unfit for baseball his position under the bat was awkward and his face wore an expression of blankness which seemed to indicate a lack of that quick wit and keen intelligence to be found in every exceptional baseball player nevertheless bang bancroft was one of the cleverest players on the rovers he was a great shortarm thrower to bases he could bat like a fiend and he had a knack of coaching and steadying a pitcher which brought out the best there was in any slab artist who handed em up to him mccann shortstop and captain of the team was a fighting irishman with a peppery temper and a bullying disposition this chap had a trick of bulldozing umpires and opposing players and he generally played what is commonly called scrappy baseball the other members of the team took their cues from mccann and their aggressiveness was made apparent almost before the first ball was pitched over the plate heres a mark bender cried mccann as mulloy stepped out with his bat eat him up come on mitt came from oday burn a few hot ones over make him dizzy get back from the plate rasped bender as barney took his position get back or youll get hit hit him if he crowds came from holmes but dont kill him you know you killed one man last year and broke another mans jaw go ahead and hit him came from clover hes irish and you cant kill him frank merriwells eyes began to gleam with a peculiar light and his lips tightened they fancy theyre up against a lot of youngsters they can intimidate he thought they mean to frighten us at the start again bender motioned for mulloy to move back from the plate pitch the ball me frind pitch the ball said barney oim in me box and ill shtand here an instant later bender delivered the ball deliberately snapping a swift one straight at mulloy barney might have dropped to the ground and thus avoided being hit but instead of doing so he leaned far forward with his left shoulder advanced and his right shoulder held well back in this manner he escaped being hit fairly by the ball which glanced from the back of his right shoulder take your base called carker promptly instantly there was a howl of protestation from the crowd back of first base mccann made a rush at carker call him back snarled the captain of the rovers he didnt try to dodge that ball he didnt try to get out of the way the pitcher hit him deliberately said greg calmly he was threatened before the ball was pitched get back into your position mccann placed his hands on his hips and glared at carker who are ye tellin to git back he rasped do ye know who yere talkin to young feller im talking to you said greg in the same calm manner if you dont get back in your position and play the game ill put you on the bench what shouted the irishman put me on the bench you put me on the bench id like to see you do it greg pulled out his watch ill give you just thirty seconds to get into your position and go on with this game he said if you put me on the bench ill take my team off the field threatened mccann and ill forfeit the game to the home team retorted carker twenty seconds you have ten seconds more mccann turned and retreated to his position growling and muttering in an ugly manner play ball boys he called we can win the game even if the umpire is against us basil bearover hurried to the bench of the home players and grasped frank merriwell by the shoulder is this the kind of square deal you promised us he demanded merry rose turned and faced the man whats the matter was his question you know mulloy was entitled to his base but your umpire threatened to put one of my men out of the game he has authority to put any player out of the game he cant fine the men but he can order them off the field if they raise a disturbance and make back talk to him if one of my players should rush at him the way mccann did i should expect him to put the man on the bench or off the field if he didnt do it id do it myself you know bender threw that ball at mulloy to drive him back from the plate and you also know that mulloy was in his proper position arent we going to have any sort of a square deal here gurgled bearover furiously youre going to have as square a deal as you ever received in all your career but youre not going to bulldoze the umpire or any one else on this field if we dont get what we want well stop the game in the very first inning threatened bearover you can stop it by refusing to play said frank you heard carker tell mccann that he would forfeit the game if he did such a thing it will be all over in short order in case you or your captain pulls the team off the field but look at this crowd youll disappoint this crowd youll have to refund the gate money which ill do said merriwell ill refund every cent thats been taken at the gate did you read the wellsburg herald this morning if so mr bearover i presume you saw a little item regarding a tenthousanddollar bet now if such a bet has been made and you lose this game through forfeit youll likewise lose the bet it may not cost you anything but it will cost mr silence ten thousand dollars i dont think youll take your team off the field today bearover was purple with anger look at that bunch of boys back of first he directed if you are not careful mr merriwell theyll waltz onto the field and wipe up the earth with you and your team and the umpire i dont think they will said frank at the present time theyre being watched by six deputies every man of which carries a billy and a pair of handcuffs in case your tough crowd from wellsburg attempts to make a disturbance the ringleaders will find themselves in bloomfield lockup weve made preparations for you and your paid thugs mr bearover while this conversation was taking place bender had pretended to busy himself in tying a shoestring which he untied and retied several times before it seemed satisfactory to him if you can win this game squarely bearover youll win it said frank but youll never win it through intimidation and bulldozing now dont bother me any more better keep on your own side and let your men play the game theyll have to play the best game they know if they want to win all this was quite unexpected by the big bear and his companions feeling that he was up against an unusual proposition bearover returned to the visitors bench where silence was somewhat nervously smoking a cigarette bart hodge was in position to strike bender whipped the ball over hodge let it pass one strike announced carker benders curve had carried the ball over the outside corner the visiting pitcher followed this up with a sharp drop which came down across barts shoulders again bart declined to swing two strikes cried carker bart did not kick he did not even frown although he realized he had failed to swing at two fair balls the next ball was wide then followed a high one hodge hit the next ball and put up an infield fly which was easily captured by mccann mulloy had promptly returned to first as soon as he realized the ball was going to the infield frank merriwell received an ovation from the crowd as he stepped out with a bat in his hand he held the bat in a position which was a signal for mulloy to attempt to steal on the first ball pitched merry swung at the ball but was careful not to hit it mulloy went down to second bancroft made a sharp shortarm throw clover took the ball handsomely and mulloy was tagged as he slid out announced carker why the kids think they can steal on ye mitt sneered mccann while the rovers with the exception of bender shouted with laughter two men were out and there was a strike on merriwell bender tried to pull frank with a couple of wide ones failing in this he whipped over a sharp shoot merry fouled it foul ball two strikes came from carker the tough crowd back of first howled with satisfaction strike him out bender they cried show him up bender followed with a drop but it was a ball and frank declined to swing at it three balls said the calm clear voice of the umpire a valk vill take you frankie cried dunnerwurst from the coaching line he vill made you a present to der virst pase yah bender pretended to kick a pebble from beneath his feet suddenly without any preliminary swing he sent over a swift straight ball smash merriwell nailed the ball on the trademark chapter xl a determined front frank drove the ball out on a line and reached second base by sharp running vale vale vale spluttered dunnerwurst as he danced round like a huge fat toad dot peen too pad it vos an awful surprise dot der ball dit not make a home run vor him naow were started gol ding it shouted gallup excitedly as he pranced out to coach lets keep her agoin fellers ephraim was in a wildly excited condition he felt himself tingling and shaking all over at one moment he was hot and burning and the next moment he was cold and shivering buck badger looked dangerous to bender the solid stocky squareshouldered westerner seemed like a man who would hit the ball a terrible crack if he hit it at all in the stand sitting amid the ladies of merriwells house party was winnie badger whose eyes gleamed with pride as she watched her husband i hope buck will get a hit she murmured he used to hit well oo eet ees the strange game exclaimed teresa gallup what ees eet ephraim ees doing now does he have to hollaire so loud hes a coach explained elsie a coach questioned teresa why the coach ees sometheeng for a horse to pull ees ephraim sometheeng for a horse to pull he isnt just that sort of a coach laughed inza hes out there to give frank instructions about running bases oo murmured teresa does he know more about the way bases to run than frank knows perhaps not smiled inza but you see the runner cant keep watch of the ball and the players while hes running he cant tell just what every one is doing if he has to pay attention to himself a coach can tell him what to do juanita garcia had not spoken since the beginning of the game but now she ventured to ask what ees eet seсor carkaire he play he keep saying one ball one strike two ball two strike but he do nothing else hes the umpire he is the judge who gives the decisions oo breathed juanita he ees the judge he ees the magistrate then he must know everytheeng about the game he must know more than every one else eet ees splendeed i am so proud of seсor carkaire suddenly winnie badger clapped her hands uttered a cry of delight and started up buck had hit the ball a moment later winnies joy turned to dismay for with a leap oday thrust out his gloved left hand and caught badgers liner it was the third putout and merry was left on second thats playing ball roared the man with the broken nose now get after frank merriwell and send him to the stable put the blanket on him polish him off the rovers trotted in while the home team took the field casper silence lighted a fresh cigarette as the players in yellow and black settled down on the bench beyond question you faced the four leading batters of that team bender said the proprietor of the visitors you know now what merriwell and badger can hit if oday had not made a great catch merriwell would have scored oh ill get onto their style of hitting all right nodded bender neither of those chaps will touch me next time bearover was speaking to mccann we want to make some runs in this inning mike he said if we can roll up a few tallies it ought to discourage the youngsters its not easy to bluff them but we may be able to get their tails down and an uphill game is a hard game for any team to play start us off mccann the captain of the visitors walked out and hit the first ball pitched to him although it was fully six inches higher than his shoulders the hit was a sharp drive into the field and carson took it on the first bound and promptly sent it to badger which held mccann at first frank believed mertez would try to bunt and he kept the ball high mertez fouled the first one and a strike was called mccann was forced to return to first after getting a big start toward second merry fancied he saw a signal exchanged between the batter and the base runner something told him mccann would try to steal nevertheless frank appeared careless in permitting the captain of the rovers to get a lead off first when he pitched however merry whistled the ball over high and wide so that it came into barts hands in such a manner that hodge was in perfect position to throw to second mccann was scooting down the line bart threw to second badger covered the sack took the ball and tagged mccann as the runner was sliding it was a close play but buck caught mccann as the latters hand was fully six inches from the bag out at second declared carker there was a hush as the runner scrambled to his feet what roared mccann rushing at carker and seizing him in a fury did you call me out you chump what do you mean he swung greg round roughly frank promptly reached for the back of mccanns neck his fingers closed there and he sent the fellow reeling to one side hold on carker he said as greg started to speak he realized it was the umpires intention to put mccann out of the game there were indications that the crowd of toughs contemplated rushing onto the field bill hunker sprang in front of those men and roared ill put the irons on the first son of a gun who ducks under that rope that stopped them mccann was livid with fury it seemed that he meant to spring at merriwell who stood calmly facing him hold on you said frank shaking a finger at the captain of the rovers i want to say just one word and then you may come at me if you feel like it i kept the umpire from putting you out of the game you were out at second and you know it if you lift your hand against carker during the remainder of this game or make any insulting talk to him ill back him up if he orders you off the field perhaps your team can get along without you perhaps it will be better off without you take the matter into consideration on the temporary bleachers a crowd of farnham hall lads led by dale sparkfair gave a cheer for merry as this cheer died away uncle eb small rose in the stand waved his crooked cane and shrilly cried thats right frank thats jest right were here to see a game of baseball and not a fight all the same if them fellers start a row well back you up to the finish we know youre a gentleman on the baseball field and off it youve gut the sympathy of every decent man here thats right thats right came from all sides of the field basil bearover stepped out from the bench and called mccanns attention play ball mike he said we can win anyhow let the umpire alone muttering to himself the captain of the rovers walked in from the field things simmered down at once at last the visiting players and the sympathizing crowd of thugs realized that the sentiment of the crowd would not tolerate such conduct as mccanns the merries were not frightened by it and frank had prepared to quell any outbreak of ruffianism toby mertez tried hard for a hit fouling the ball a number of times finally he put up a high foul which hodge gathered in grifford was regarded as one of the heaviest and surest hitters among the visitors nevertheless to his astonishment he missed the first two balls pitched by frank although both crossed the pan two wide ones followed and then hodge called for the double shoot merry threw his great curve for the first time that day and again grifford missed three strikes youre out rang forth carkers decision the first inning was over chapter xli the hour and the man casper silence succeeded in repressing his anxiety and disappointment as inning after inning passed and neither side secured a run the rovers had fancied ere beginning the game that it would be an easy thing to down merriwells team they had believed franks reputation as a pitcher to be exaggerated they were confident of their batting ability but gradually that confidence weakened before the wonderful boxwork of merriwell who seemed in his best form fortunately most of the decisions against the visitors were not close and there were few excuses for kicks had mccann and the men been inclined to keep it up ephraim gallup could not throw off his feeling of anxiety and nervousness and he was thankful as the innings passed and no opportunity came for him to display what he could do in the field at bat he was a failure in past days gallup had batted well but today merriwells wisdom in placing him far down on the batting order became apparent as the vermonter continued to strike out in the sixth inning ephraim had a chance to drive in a run for with two men gone the merries pushed a runner round to third again ephraim struck out you vos a peach uf a hitter i dond pelief sneered dunnerwurst gol dinged if i could hit a haouse muttered gallup im jest abaout the rottenest thing that ever swung a bat i wish i was to hum on the farm in the last of the seventh the rovers had their opportunity with one man out they landed a runner on the third corner the next hitter succeeded in lifting a short fly to center field gallup made a wonderful run for the ball but muffed it although it struck fairly in his hands as ephraim dropped the ball the runner at third started for the plate now gallup had a reputation as a thrower many a time from deep center he had cut off a man at the plate with remarkable quickness for one who seemed so awkward he caught up the ball and lined it to hodge had ephraim taken more time it would have been better for him his anxiety caused him to throw with too much haste and as a result the ball passed fully ten feet over barts head the runner scored before hodge could recover the ball and return it to the diamond the man who had hit it was safe on third basil bearover slapped casper silence on the shoulder weve got them now he chuckled theyll never get a run off bender the game is ours youve won that ten thousand it looks that way replied silence as he produced a fresh cigarette and lighted it its a pretty good thing for me that we have got them i counted on winning this game a great deal easier than this had we lost id been practically busted im afraid the rovers would have been compelled to disband imagine the feelings of gallup after making that throw ephraim walked round and round in a circle for at least half a dozen times thats abaout the most expensive goldarned fool thing i ever done he mumbled to himself waal by gum i deserve it any man thats fool enough to bet every dollar hes gut in the world on a baseball game oughter lose i dont keer a rap for myself but frank was right in saying i had no business to throw away money that my wife and kid has a claim on i guess this will teach me a lesson i wont be able to look teresa in the face arter this game is over he was aroused by merrys voice calling him to take his position and play ball better put a baby in my place frank he said dolefully any blamed fool could do bettern im doing today i guess ive lost the game the game isnt over yet said frank grimly well play it out the rovers secured no more runs in that inning nevertheless bender had no difficulty in blanking the merries in the first of the eighth in the last of the eighth just three men faced merriwell he struck them all out its all over cried mike mccann with a grin as the rovers again took the field this finishes it frank was the first man up in spite of benders skill merriwell cracked out a clean single badger followed with a bunt that advanced merry to second buck was thrown out at first diamond tried hard for a hit with frank leading off second ready to do his best to score jack finally drove a grounder into the hands of mccann who whistled it over for a putout two gone shouted the captain of the rovers only one more to git bender me boy a few of the disappointed spectators began to leave the field the first two balls pitched by bender were strikes browning touching neither of them then the pitcher tried some wide ones on the big first baseman of the merries bruce had a good eye and he let the wide ones pass two balls were called bender attempted to curve one over but missed the plate by fully six inches three balls came from carker smash it if he puts one over called frank browning gripped his bat and stood ready the crowd was silent and breathless bender tried to put a speedy ball across bruces shoulders but it was far too high four balls take your base cried carker the best thing you could have done mitt laughed mccann here comes the tall jay and he never made a hit in his life ephraim gallups hands were trembling as he picked up a bat and walked out his legs were weak and there was a mist before his eyes ill never touch it he whispered to himself theres too much depending on it i cant do it as if from a great distance he seemed to hear frank merriwell crying just a little single ephraim you never failed in a pinch in all your life you cant fail now those words seemed to brush the mist from gallups eyes and something like confidence crept back into his heavy heart nevertheless he merely fouled benders first shoot one strike the next ball was far too high but gallup swung at it and missed two strikes all over all over whooped mccann the spectators in the stand and on the bleachers were standing i knowed i couldnt do it thought gallup once more he heard frank calling to him for teresa and the baby cried merriwell lace it out gallup get against it for teresa and the baby those words rang through ephraims brain was it possible he was going to prove himself a miserable failure under such circumstances with only himself to consider he might fail but he had believed himself capable of great things for the sake of teresa and the baby he was capable of great things he knew it now and suddenly his hands were steady as iron there was not the slightest quiver of his nerves his eyes were clear and his face wore a look of confidence as he watched bender prepare to deliver the ball the pitcher started the ball wide but with a sudden break it took an inshoot across the plate gallup knew he was going to hit the ball when he swung at it he hit it fairly and squarely with all the strength and skill that he possessed it brought a wild roar from the crowd as the ball went sailing out on a line about fifteen feet from the ground apparently grifford would have little trouble in catching the ball he changed his position a foot or two and prepared to take it just before it reached him he made a sudden backward move and then leaped desperately into the air thrusting up his hand instead of dropping as grifford had expected the ball held up in a marvelous manner and passed fully two feet beyond his reach as he made that leap it finally touched the ground and went bounding away with grifford rushing after it as fast as he could race over the turf the white chalk of the base lines seemed to spin out beneath gallups feet like a thread as he literally flew over the ground he heard a sound like the roaring of many waters it was the joyous shouting of the great crowd as merriwell crossed the plate and diamond came speeding in from third gallup did not realize that these two runs put the merries in the lead he was determined to score if possible as he came up from second he saw hans dunnerwurst dancing like a clown and furiously waving his arms while he yelled ephie you vos a tandy ephie you vos a peach ephie i luf you dot score vill git you und dond nobody forgit him mine cootness dot vos der most peautiful home run you efer saw in my life a homer it was for gallup reached the pan ahead of the ball which grifford had returned to the diamond frank seized ephraim by the hand as he came over the plate the rest of the team rushed at the vermonter hammering him joyously over the head and shoulders much to the agitation of teresa who feared her husband had done some terrible thing and that his friends were beating him on that account bender looked sick and weary as carson seized a bat and rushed out to the plate the pitcher delivered an easy one which berlin drove into left field roach took the ball on the run and this made the third out casper silence was like a caged tiger as the rovers gathered at the bench get in here and win this game you slobs he hissed if you dont this team disbands tonight against frank merriwells pitching there was no chance for them however as in the previous inning only three men faced merry and all three struck out gallup overtook frank ere the excited crowd that rushed onto the field could reach merry its ten thousand for the consumptives home at wellsburg by ginger laughed ephraim remember your promise gallup said frank as he seized the vermonters hand youll never bet again never again vowed ephraim then like merriwell he was caught up by the rejoicing spectators who triumphantly bore these two heroes of the game around the diamond while they cheered themselves hoarse when merry at last had been successful in freeing himself from the grasp of jubilant admirers he joined inza and the ladies who had watched the game from the stand frank and his wife had fallen a little behind the others as they were approaching the house and they were speaking quietly when a heavy slap on franks back caused him to turn around quickly he was confronted by berlin carson a great game merry old man exclaimed berlin enthusiastically by jove that wing of yours has lost none of the tricks that enabled it to send team after team to the bad in the old days at yale and gallup gallup what a wallop that was he gave the ball in the last eh great cжsar i feel almost as exultant over it as if i had made it myself but im more than half inclined to believe that it was something you called to him that put him on his mettle what was it merry but before frank had an opportunity to speak bart hodge who was several paces distant called berlins name see you later see you later merry laughed berlin as he patted
