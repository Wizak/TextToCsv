modern superstition coleridge and opiumeating temperance movement on war the last days of immanuel kant the household wreck to be weak we need not the great archangels voice to tell us is to be miserable all weakness is suffering and humiliation no matter for its mode or its subject beyond all other weakness therefore and by a sad prerogative as more miserable than what is most miserable in all that capital weakness of man which regards the tenure of his enjoyments and his power to protect even for a moment the crown of flowers flowers at the best how frail and few which sometimes settles upon his haughty brow there is no end there never will be an end of the lamentations which ascend from earth and the rebellious heart of her children upon this huge opprobrium of human pride the everlasting mutabilities of all which man can grasp by his power or by his aspirations the fragility of all which he inherits and the hollowness visible amid the very raptures of enjoyment to every eye which looks for a moment underneath the draperies of the shadowy present the hollowness the blank treachery of hollowness upon which all the pomps and vanities of life ultimately repose this trite but unwearying theme this impassioned commonplace of humanity is the subject in every age of variation without end from the poet the rhetorician the fabulist the moralist the divine and the philosopher all amidst the sad vanity of their sighs and groans labor to put on record and to establish this monotonous complaint which needs not other record or evidence than those very sighs and groans what is life darkness and formless vacancy for a beginning or something beyond all beginning then next a dim lotos of human consciousness finding itself afloat upon the bosom of waters without a shore then a few sunny smiles and many tears a little love and infinite strife whisperings from paradise and fierce mockeries from the anarchy of chaos dust and ashes and once more darkness circling round as if from the beginning and in this way rounding or making an island of our fantastic existence that is human life that the inevitable amount of mans laughter and his tears of what he suffers and he does of his motions this way and that way to the right or to the left backwards or forwards of all his seeming realities and all his absolute negations his shadowy pomps and his pompous shadows of whatsoever he thinks finds makes or mars creates or animates loves hates or in dread hope anticipates so it is so it has been so it will be for ever and ever yet in the lowest deep there still yawns a lower deep and in the vast halls of mans frailty there are separate and more gloomy chambers of a frailty more exquisite and consummate we account it frailty that threescore years and ten make the upshot of mans pleasurable existence and that far before that time is reached his beauty and his power have fallen among weeds and forgetfulness but there is a frailty by comparison with which this ordinary flux of the human race seems to have a vast duration cases there are and those not rare in which a single week a day an hour sweeps away all vestiges and landmarks of a memorable felicity in which the ruin travels faster than the flying showers upon the mountainside faster than a musician scatters sounds in which it was and it is not are words of the selfsame tongue in the selfsame minute in which the sun that at noon beheld all sound and prosperous long before its setting hour looks out upon a total wreck and sometimes upon the total abolition of any fugitive memorial that there ever had been a vessel to be wrecked or a wreck to be obliterated these cases though here spoken of rhetorically are of daily occurrence and though they may seem few by comparison with the infinite millions of the species they are many indeed if they be reckoned absolutely for themselves and throughout the limits of a whole nation not a day passes over us but many families are robbed of their heads or even swallowed up in ruin themselves or their course turned out of the sunny beams into a dark wilderness shipwrecks and nightly conflagrations are sometimes and especially among some nations wholesale calamities battles yet more so earthquakes the famine the pestilence though rarer are visitations yet wider in their desolation sickness and commercial illluck if narrower are more frequent scourges and most of all or with most darkness in its train comes the sickness of the brain lunacy which visiting nearly one thousand in every million must in every populous nation make many ruins in each particular day babylon in ruins says a great author is not so sad a sight as a human soul overthrown by lunacy but there is a sadder even than that the sight of a familyruin wrought by crime is even more appalling forgery breaches of trust embezzlement of private or public funds a crime sadly on the increase since the example of fauntleroy and the suggestion of its great feasibility first made by him these enormities followed too often and countersigned for their final result to the future happiness of families by the appalling catastrophe of suicide must naturally in every wealthy nation or wherever property and the modes of property are much developed constitute the vast majority of all that come under the review of public justice any of these is sufficient to make shipwreck of all peace and comfort for a family and often indeed it happens that the desolation is accomplished within the course of one revolving sun often the whole dire catastrophe together with its total consequences is both accomplished and made known to those whom it chiefly concerns within one and the same hour the mighty juggernaut of social life moving onwards with its everlasting thunders pauses not for a moment to spare to pity to look aside but rushes forward for ever impassive as the marble in the quarry caring not for whom it destroys for the how many or for the results direct and indirect whether many or few the increasing grandeur and magnitude of the social system the more it multiplies and extends its victims the more it conceals them and for the very same reason just as in the roman amphitheatres when they grew to the magnitude of mighty cities in some instances accommodating four hundred thousand spectators in many a fifth part of that amount births and deaths became ordinary events which in a small modern theatre are rare and memorable and exactly as these prodigious accidents multiplied pari passu they were disregarded and easily concealed for curiosity was no longer excited the sensation attached to them was little or none from these terrific tragedies which like monsoons or tornadoes accomplish the work of years in an hour not merely an impressive lesson is derived sometimes perhaps a warning but also and this is of universal application some consolation whatever may have been the misfortunes or the sorrows of a mans life he is still privileged to regard himself and his friends as amongst the fortunate by comparison in so far as he has escaped these wholesale storms either as an actor in producing them or a contributor to their violence or even more innocently though oftentimes not less miserably as a participator in the instant ruin or in the long arrears of suffering which they entail the following story falls within the class of hasty tragedies and sudden desolations here described the reader is assured that every incident is strictly true nothing in that respect has been altered nor indeed anywhere except in the conversations of which though the results and general outline are known the separate details have necessarily been lost under the agitating circumstances which produced them it has been judged right and delicate to conceal the name of the great city and therefore of the nation in which these events occurred chiefly out of consideration for the descendants of one person concerned in the narrative otherwise it might not have been requisite for it is proper to mention that every person directly a party to the case has been long laid in the grave all of them with one solitary exception upwards of fifty years it was early spring in the year the day was the th of april and the weather which had been of a wintry fierceness for the preceding six or seven weeks cold indeed beyond anything known for many years gloomy for ever and broken by continual storms was now by a swedish transformation all at once bright genial heavenly so sudden and so early a prelusion of summer it was generally feared could not last but that only made every body the more eager to lose no hour of an enjoyment that might prove so fleeting it seemed as if the whole population of the place a population among the most numerous in christendom had been composed of hybernating animals suddenly awakened by the balmy sunshine from their long winters torpor through every hour of the golden morning the streets were resonant with female parties of young and old the timid and the bold nay even of the most delicate valetudinarians now first tempted to lay aside their wintry clothing together with their fireside habits whilst the whole rural environs of our vast city the woodlands and the interminable meadows began daily to reecho the glad voices of the young and jovial awaking once again like the birds and the flowers and universal nature to the luxurious happiness of this most delightful season happiness do i say yes happiness happiness to me above all others for i also in those days was among the young and the gay i was healthy i was strong i was prosperous in a worldly sense i owed no man a shilling feared no mans face shunned no mans presence i held a respectable station in society i was myself let me venture to say it respected generally for my personal qualities apart from any advantages i might draw from fortune or inheritance i had reason to think myself popular amongst the very slender circle of my acquaintance and finally which perhaps was the crowning grace to all these elements of happiness i suffered not from the presence of ennui nor ever feared to suffer for my temperament was constitutionally ardent i had a powerful animal sensibility and i knew the one great secret for maintaining its equipoise viz by powerful daily exercise and thus i lived in the light and presence or if i should not be suspected of seeking rhetorical expressions i would say in one eternal solstice of unclouded hope these you will say were blessings these were golden elements of felicity they were so and yet with the single exception of my healthy frame and firm animal organization i feel that i have mentioned hitherto nothing but what by comparison might be thought of a vulgar quality all the other advantages that i have enumerated had they been yet wanting might have been acquired had they been forfeited might have been reconquered had they been even irretrievably lost might by a philosophic effort have been dispensed with compensations might have been found for any of them many equivalents or if not consolations at least for their absence but now it remains to speak of other blessings too mighty to be valued not merely as transcending in rank and dignity all other constituents of happiness but for a reason far sadder than that because once lost they were incapable of restoration and because not to be dispensed with blessings in which either we must live or have no life lights to the darkness of our paths and to the infirmity of our steps which once extinguished never more on this side the gates of paradise can any man hope to see reillumined for himself amongst these i may mention an intellect whether powerful or not in itself at any rate most elaborately cultivated and to say the truth i had little other business before me in this life than to pursue this lofty and delightful task i may add as a blessing not in the same positive sense as that which i have just mentioned because not of a nature to contribute so hourly to the employment of the thoughts but yet in this sense equal that the absence of either would have been an equal affliction namely a conscience void of all offence it was little indeed that i drawn by no necessities of situation into temptations of that nature had done no injury to any man that was fortunate but i could not much value myself upon what was so much an accident of my situation something however i might pretend to beyond this negative merit for i had originally a benign nature and as i advanced in years and thoughtfulness the gratitude which possessed me for my own exceeding happiness led me to do that by principle and system which i had already done upon blind impulse and thus upon a double argument i was incapable of turning away from the prayer of the afflicted whatever had been the sacrifice to myself hardly perhaps could it have been said in a sufficient sense at that time that i was a religious man yet undoubtedly i had all the foundations within me upon which religion might hereafter have grown my heart overflowed with thankfulness to providence i had a natural tone of unaffected piety and thus far at least i might have been called a religious man that in the simplicity of truth i could have exclaimed o abner i fear god and i fear none beside but wherefore seek to delay ascending by a natural climax to that final consummation and perfect crown of my felicity that almighty blessing which ratified their value to all the rest wherefore oh wherefore do i shrink in miserable weakness from what is it from reviving from calling up again into fierce and insufferable light the images and features of a longburied happiness that would be a natural shrinking and a reasonable weakness but how escape from reviving whether i give it utterance or not that which is for ever vividly before me what need to call into artificial light that which whether sleeping or waking by night or by day for eightandthirty years has seemed by its miserable splendor to scorch my brain wherefore shrink from giving language simple vocal utterance to that burden of anguish which by so long an endurance has lost no atom of its weight nor can gain any most surely by the loudest publication need there can be none after this to say that the priceless blessing which i have left to the final place in this ascending review was the companion of my life my darling and youthful wife oh dovelike woman fated in an hour the most defenceless to meet with the ravening vulture lamb fallen amongst wolves trembling fluttering fawn whose path was inevitably to be crossed by the bloody tiger angel whose most innocent heart fitted thee for too early a flight from this impure planet if indeed it were a necessity that thou shouldst find no rest for thy footing except amidst thy native heavens if indeed to leave what was not worthy of thee were a destiny not to be evaded a summons not to be put by yet why why again and again i demand why was it also necessary that this thy departure so full of wo to me should also to thyself be heralded by the pangs of martyrdom sainted love if like the ancient children of the hebrews like meshech and abednego thou wert called by divine command whilst yet almost a child to walk and to walk alone through the fiery furnace wherefore then couldst not thou like that meshech and that abednego walk unsinged by the dreadful torment and come forth unharmed why if the sacrifice were to be total was it necessary to reach it by so dire a struggle and if the cup the bitter cup of final separation from those that were the light of thy eyes and the pulse of thy heart might not be put aside yet wherefore was it that thou mightest not drink it up in the natural peace which belongs to a sinless heart but these are murmurings you will say rebellious murmurings against the proclamations of god not so i have long since submitted myself resigned myself nay even reconciled myself perhaps to the great wreck of my life in so far as it was the will of god and according to the weakness of my imperfect nature but my wrath still rises like a towering flame against all the earthly instruments of this ruin i am still at times as unresigned as ever to this tragedy in so far as it was the work of human malice vengeance as a mission for me as a task for my hands in particular is no longer possible the thunderbolts of retribution have been long since launched by other hands and yet still it happens that at times i do i must i shall perhaps to the hour of death rise in maniac fury and seek in the very impotence of vindictive madness groping as it were in blindness of heart for that tiger from hellgates that tore away my darling from my heart let me pause and interrupt this painful strain to say a word or two upon what she was and how far worthy of a love more honorable to her that was possible and deeper but that was not possible than mine when first i saw her she my agnes was merely a child not much if anything above sixteen but as in perfect womanhood she retained a most childlike expression of countenance so even then in absolute childhood she put forward the blossoms and the dignity of a woman never yet did my eye light upon creature that was born of woman nor could it enter my heart to conceive one possessing a figure more matchless in its proportions more statuesque and more deliberately and advisedly to be characterized by no adequate word but the word magnificent a word too often and lightly abused in reality speaking of women i have seen many beautiful figures but hardly one except agnes that could without hyperbole be styled truly and memorably magnificent though in the first order of tall women yet being full in person and with a symmetry that was absolutely faultless she seemed to the random sight as little above the ordinary height possibly from the dignity of her person assisted by the dignity of her movements a stranger would have been disposed to call her at a distance a woman of commanding presence but never after he had approached near enough to behold her face every thought of artifice of practised effect or of haughty pretension fled before the childlike innocence the sweet feminine timidity and the more than cherub loveliness of that countenance which yet in its lineaments was noble whilst its expression was purely gentle and confiding a shade of pensiveness there was about her but that was in her manners scarcely ever in her features and the exquisite fairness of her complexion enriched by the very sweetest and most delicate bloom that ever i have beheld should rather have allied it to a tone of cheerfulness looking at this noble creature as i first looked at her when yet upon the early threshold of womanhood with household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty you might have supposed her some hebe or young aurora of the dawn when you saw only her superb figure and its promise of womanly development with the measured dignity of her step you might for a moment have fancied her some imperial medea of the athenian stage some volumnia from rome or ruling bandits wife amidst the grecian isles but catch one glance from her angelic countenance and then combining the face and the person you would have dismissed all such fancies and have pronounced her a pandora or an eve expressly accomplished and held forth by nature as an exemplary model or ideal pattern for the future female sex a perfect woman nobly plannd to warm to comfort to command and yet a spirit too and bright with something of an angel light to this superb young woman such as i have here sketched her i surrendered my heart for ever almost from my first opportunity of seeing her for so natural and without disguise was her character and so winning the simplicity of her manners due in part to her own native dignity of mind and in part to the deep solitude in which she had been reared that little penetration was required to put me in possession of all her thoughts and to win her love not very much more than to let her see as see she could not avoid in connection with that chivalrous homage which at any rate was due to her sex and her sexual perfections a love for herself on my part which was in its nature as exalted a passion and as profoundly rooted as any merely human affection can ever yet have been on the seventeenth birthday of agnes we were married oh calendar of everlasting months months that like the mighty rivers shall flow on for ever immortal as thou nile or danube euphrates or st lawrence and ye summer and winter day and night wherefore do you bring round continually your signs and seasons and revolving hours that still point and barb the anguish of local recollections telling me of this and that celestial morning that never shall return and of too blessed expectations travelling like yourselves through a heavenly zodiac of changes till at once and for ever they sank into the grave often do i think of seeking for some quiet cell either in the tropics or in arctic latitudes where the changes of the year and the external signs corresponding to them express themselves by no features like those in which the same seasons are invested under our temperate climes so that if knowing we cannot at least feel the identity of their revolutions we were married i have said on the birthday the seventeenth birthday of agnes and pretty nearly on her eighteenth it was that she placed me at the summit of my happiness whilst for herself she thus completed the circle of her relations to this lifes duties by presenting me with a son of this child knowing how wearisome to strangers is the fond exultation of parents i shall simply say that he inherited his mothers beauty the same touching loveliness and innocence of expression the same chiselled nose mouth and chin the same exquisite auburn hair in many other features not of person merely but also of mind and manners as they gradually began to open before me this child deepened my love to him by recalling the image of his mother and what other image was there that i so much wished to keep before me whether waking or asleep at the time to which i am now coming but too rapidly this child still our only one and unusually premature was within four months of completing his third year consequently agnes was at that time in her twentyfirst year and i may here add with respect to myself that i was in my twentysixth but before i come to that period of wo let me say one word on the temper of mind which so fluent and serene a current of prosperity may be thought to have generated too common a course i know it is when the stream of life flows with absolute tranquillity and ruffled by no menace of a breeze the azure overhead never dimmed by a passing cloud that in such circumstances the blood stagnates life from excess and plethora of sweets becomes insipid the spirit of action droops and it is oftentimes found at such seasons that slight annoyances and molestations or even misfortunes in a lower key are not wholly undesirable as means of stimulating the lazy energies and disturbing a slumber which is or soon will be morbid in its character i have known myself cases not a few where by the very nicest gradations and by steps too silent and insensible for daily notice the utmost harmony and reciprocal love had shaded down into fretfulness and petulance purely from too easy a life and because all nobler agitations that might have ruffled the sensations occasionally and all distresses even on the narrowest scale that might have reawakened the solicitudes of love by opening necessities for sympathy for counsel or for mutual aid had been shut out by foresight too elaborate or by prosperity too cloying but all this had it otherwise been possible with my particular mind and at my early age was utterly precluded by one remarkable peculiarity in my temper whether it were that i derived from nature some jealousy and suspicion of all happiness which seems too perfect and unalloyed a spirit of restless distrust which in ancient times often led men to throw valuable gems into the sea in the hope of thus propitiating the dire deity of misfortune by voluntarily breaking the fearful chain of prosperity and led some of them to weep and groan when the gems thus sacrificed were afterwards brought back to their hand by simple fishermen who had recovered them in the intestines of fishes a portentous omen which was interpreted into a sorrowful indication that the deity thus answered the propitiatory appeal and made solemn proclamation that he had rejected it whether i say it were this spirit of jealousy awaked in me by too steady and too profound a felicity or whether it were that great overthrows and calamities have some mysterious power to send forward a dim misgiving of their advancing footsteps and really and indeed that in today already walks tomorrow or whether it were partly as i have already put the case in my first supposition a natural instinct of distrust but irritated and enlivened by a particular shock of superstitious alarm which or whether any of these causes it were that kept me apprehensive and on the watch for disastrous change i will not here undertake to determine too certain it is that i was so i never ridded myself of an overmastering and brooding sense shadowy and vague a dim abiding feeling that sometimes was and sometimes was not exalted into a conscious presentiment of some great calamity travelling towards me not perhaps immediately impending perhaps even at a great distance but already dating from some secret hour already in motion upon some remote line of approach this feeling i could not assuage by sharing it with agnes no motive could be strong enough for persuading me to communicate so gloomy a thought with one who considering her extreme healthiness was but too remarkably prone to pensive if not to sorrowful contemplations and thus the obligation which i felt to silence and reserve strengthened the morbid impression i had received whilst the remarkable incident i have adverted to served powerfully to rivet the superstitious chain which was continually gathering round me the incident was this and before i repeat it let me pledge my word of honor that i report to you the bare facts of the case without exaggeration and in the simplicity of truth there was at that time resident in the great city which is the scene of my narrative a woman from some part of hungary who pretended to the gift of looking into futurity she had made herself known advantageously in several of the greatest cities of europe under the designation of the hungarian prophetess and very extraordinary instances were cited amongst the highest circles of her success in the art which she professed so ample were the pecuniary tributes which she levied upon the hopes and the fears or the simple curiosity of the aristocracy that she was thus able to display not unfrequently a disinterestedness and a generosity which seemed native to her disposition amongst the humbler classes of her applicants for she rejected no addresses that were made to her provided only they were not expressed in levity or scorn but with sincerity and in a spirit of confiding respect it happened on one occasion when a nurseryservant of ours was waiting in her anteroom for the purpose of taking her turn in consulting the prophetess professionally that she had witnessed a scene of consternation and unaffected maternal grief in this hungarian lady upon the sudden seizure of her son a child of four or five years old by a spasmodic inflammation of the throat since called croup peculiar to children and in those days not very well understood by medical men the poor hungarian who had lived chiefly in warm or at least not damp climates and had never so much as heard of this complaint was almost wild with alarm at the rapid increase of the symptoms which attend the paroxysms and especially of that loud and distressing sound which marks the impeded respiration great therefore was her joy and gratitude on finding from our servant that she had herself been in attendance more than once upon cases of the same nature but very much more violent and that consequently she was well qualified to suggest and to superintend all the measures of instant necessity such as the hotbath the peculiar medicines c which are almost sure of success when applied in an early stage staying to give her assistance until a considerable improvement had taken place in the child our servant then hurried home to her mistress agnes it may be imagined dispatched her back with such further and more precise directions as in a very short time availed to reestablish the child in convalescence these practical services and the messages of maternal sympathy repeatedly conveyed from agnes had completely won the heart of the grateful hungarian and she announced her intention of calling with her little boy to make her personal acknowledgments for the kindness which had been shown to her she did so and we were as much impressed by the sultanalike style of her oriental beauty as she on her part was touched and captivated by the youthful loveliness of my angelic wife after sitting for above an hour during which time she talked with a simplicity and good feeling that struck us as remarkable in a person professing an art usually connected with so much of conscious fraud she rose to take her leave i must mention that she had previously had our little boy sitting on her knee and had at intervals thrown a hasty glance upon the palms of his hands on parting agnes with her usual frankness held out her hand the hungarian took it with an air of sad solemnity pressed it fervently and said lady it is my part in this life to look behind the curtain of fate and oftentimes i see such sights in futurity some near some far off as willingly i would not see for you young and charming lady looking like that angel which you are no destiny can be equal to your deserts yet sometimes true it is god sees not as man sees and he ordains after his unfathomable counsels to the heavenlyminded a portion in heaven and to the children whom he loves a rest and a haven not built with hands something that i have seen dimly warns me to look no farther yet if you desire it i will do my office and i will read for you with truth the lines of fate as they are written upon your hands agnes was a little startled or even shocked by this solemn address but in a minute or so a mixed feeling one half of which was curiosity and the other half a lighthearted mockery of her own mysterious awe in the presence of what she had been taught to view as either fraud or insanity prompted her playfully to insist upon the fullest application of the hungarians art to her own case nay she would have the hands of our little francis read and interpreted as well as her own and she desired to hear the full professional judgment delivered without suppression or softening of its harshest awards she laughed whilst she said all this but she also trembled a little the hungarian first took the hand of our young child and perused it with a long and steady scrutiny she said nothing but sighed heavily as she resigned it she then took the hand of agnes looked bewildered and aghast then gazed piteously from agnes to her child and at last bursting into tears began to move steadily out of the room i followed her hastily and remonstrated upon this conduct by pointing her attention to the obvious truth that these mysterious suppressions and insinuations which left all shadowy and indistinct were far more alarming than the most definite denunciations her answer yet rings in my ear why should i make myself odious to you and to your innocent wife messenger of evil i am and have been to many but evil i will not prophecy to her watch and pray much may be done by effectual prayer human means fleshly arms are vain there is an enemy in the house of life here she quitted her palmistry for the language of astrology there is a frightful danger at hand both for your wife and your child already on that dark ocean over which we are all sailing i can see dimly the point at which the enemys course shall cross your wifes there is but little interval remaining not many hours all is finished all is accomplished and already he is almost up with the darlings of your heart be vigilant be vigilant and yet look not to yourself but to heaven for deliverance this woman was not an impostor she spoke and uttered her oracles under a wild sense of possession by some superior being and of mystic compulsion to say what she would have willingly left unsaid and never yet before or since have i seen the light of sadness settle with so solemn an expression into human eyes as when she dropped my wifes hand and refused to deliver that burden of prophetic wo with which she believed herself to be inspired the prophetess departed and what mood of mind did she leave behind her in agnes and myself naturally there was a little drooping of spirits at first the solemnity and the heartfelt sincerity of fear and grief which marked her demeanor made it impossible at the moment when we were just fresh from their natural influences that we should recoil into our ordinary spirits but with the inevitable elasticity of youth and youthful gaiety we soon did so we could not attempt to persuade ourselves that there had been any conscious fraud or any attempt at scenical effect in the hungarians conduct she had no motive for deceiving us she had refused all offerings of money and her whole visit had evidently been made under an overflow of the most grateful feelings for the attentions shown to her child we acquitted her therefore of sinister intentions and with our feelings of jealousy feelings in which we had been educated towards everything that tended to superstition we soon agreed to think her some gentle maniac or sad enthusiast suffering under some form of morbid melancholy fortyeight hours with two nights sleep sufficed to restore the wonted equilibrium of our spirits and that interval brought us onwards to the th of april the day on which as i have already said my story properly commences on that day on that lovely th of april such as i have described it that th of april about nine oclock in the morning we were seated at breakfast near the open window we that is agnes myself and little francis the freshness of morning spirits rested upon us the golden light of the morning sun illuminated the room incense was floating through the air from the gorgeous flowers within and without the house there in youthful happiness we sat gathered together a family of love and there we never sat again never again were we three gathered together nor ever shall be so long as the sun and its golden light the morning and the evening the earth and its flowers endure often have i occupied myself in recalling every circumstance the most trivial of this the final morning of what merits to be called my life eleven oclock i remember was striking when agnes came into my study and said that she would go into the city for we lived in a quite rural suburb that she would execute some trifling commissions which she had received from a friend in the country and would be at home again between one and two for a stroll which we had agreed to take in the neighboring meadows about twenty minutes after this she again came into my study dressed for going abroad for such was my admiration of her that i had a fancy fancy it must have been and yet still i felt it to be real that under every change she looked best if she put on a shawl then a shawl became the most feminine of ornaments if she laid aside her shawl and her bonnet then how nymphlike she seemed in her undisguised and unadorned beauty fulldress seemed for the time to be best as bringing forward into relief the splendor of her person and allowing the exposure of her arms a simple morningdress again seemed better still as fitted to call out the childlike innocence of her face by confining the attention to that but all these are feelings of fond and blind affection hanging with rapture over the object of something too like idolatry god knows if that be a sin i was but too profound a sinner yet sin it never was sin it could not be to adore a beauty such as thine my agnes neither was it her beauty by itself and that only which i sought at such times to admire there was a peculiar sort of double relation in which she stood at moments of pleasurable expectation and excitement since our little francis had become of an age to join our party which made some aspects of her character trebly interesting she was a wife and wife to one whom she looked up to as her superior in understanding and in knowledge of the world whom therefore she leaned to for protection on the other hand she was also a mother whilst therefore to her child she supported the matronly part of guide and the air of an experienced person to me she wore ingenuously and without disguise the part of a child herself with all the giddy hopes and unchastised imaginings of that buoyant age this double character one aspect of which looks towards her husband and one to her children sits most gracefully upon many a young wife whose heart is pure and innocent and the collision between the two separate parts imposed by duty on the one hand by extreme youth on the other the one telling her that she is a responsible head of a family and the depository of her husbands honor in its tenderest and most vital interests the other telling her through the liveliest language of animal sensibility and through the very pulses of her blood that she is herself a child this collision gives an inexpressible charm to the whole demeanor of many a young married woman making her other fascinations more touching to her husband and deepening the admiration she excites and the more so as it is a collision which cannot exist except among the very innocent years at any rate will irresistibly remove this peculiar charm and gradually replace it by the graces of the matronly character but in agnes this change had not yet been effected partly from nature and partly from the extreme seclusion of her life hitherto she still retained the unaffected expression of her childlike nature and so lovely in my eyes was this perfect exhibition of natural feminine character that she rarely or never went out alone upon any little errand to town which might require her to rely upon her own good sense and courage that she did not previously come to exhibit herself before me partly this was desired by me in that loverlike feeling of admiration already explained which leads one to court the sight of a beloved object under every change of dress and under all effects of novelty partly it was the interest i took in that exhibition of sweet timidity and almost childish apprehensiveness half disguised or imperfectly acknowledged by herself which in the way i have just explained so touchingly contrasted with and for that very reason so touchingly drew forth her matronly character but i hear some objector say at this point ought not this very timidity founded as in part at least it was upon inexperience and conscious inability to face the dangers of the world to have suggested reasons for not leaving her to her own protection and does it not argue on my part an arrogant or too blind a confidence in the durability of my happiness as though charmed against assaults and liable to no shocks of sudden revolution i reply that from the very constitution of society and the tone of manners in the city which we inhabited there seemed to be a moral impossibility that any dangers of consequence should meet her in the course of those brief absences from my protection which only were possible that even to herself any dangers of a nature to be anticipated under the known circumstances of the case seemed almost imaginary that even she acknowledged a propriety in being trained by slight and brief separations from my guardianship to face more boldly those cases of longer separation and of more absolute consignment to her own resources which circumstances might arise to create necessarily and perhaps abruptly and it is evident that had she been the wife of any man engaged in the duties of a profession she might have been summoned from the very first and without the possibility of any such gradual training to the necessity of relying almost singly upon her own courage and discretion for the other question whether i did not depend too blindly and presumptuously upon my good luck in not at least affording her my protection so long as nothing occurred to make it impossible i may reply most truly that all my feelings ran naturally in the very opposite channel so far from confiding too much in my luck in the present instance i was engaged in a task of writing upon some points of business which could not admit of further delay but now and at all times i had a secret aversion to seeing so gentle a creature thrown even for an hour upon her own resources though in situations which scarcely seemed to admit of any occasion for taxing those resources and often i have felt anger towards myself for what appeared to be an irrational or effeminate timidity and have struggled with my own mind upon occasions like the present when i knew that i could not have acknowledged my tremors to a friend without something like shame and a fear to excite his ridicule no if in anything i ran into excess it was in this very point of anxiety as to all that regarded my wifes security her good sense her prudence her courage for courage she had in the midst of her timidity her dignity of manner the more impressive from the childlike character of her countenance all should have combined to reassure me and yet they did not i was still anxious for her safety to an irrational extent and to sum up the whole in a most weighty line of shakspeare i lived under the constant presence of a feeling which only that great observer of human nature so far as i am aware has ever noticed viz that merely the excess of my happiness made me jealous of its ability to last and in that extent less capable of enjoying it that in fact the prelibation of my tears as a homage to its fragility was drawn forth by my very sense that my felicity was too exquisite or in the words of the great master i wept to have absolutely by anticipation shed tears in possessing what i so feared to lose thus end my explanations and i now pursue my narrative agnes as i have said came into my room again before leaving the house we conversed for five minutes we parted she went out her last words being that she would return at halfpast one oclock and not long after that time if ever mimic bells bells of rejoicing or bells of mourning are heard in desert spaces of the air and as some have said in unreal worlds that mock our own and repeat for ridicule the vain and unprofitable motions of man then too surely about this hour began to toll the funeral knell of my earthly happiness its final hour had sounded one oclock had arrived fifteen minutes after i strolled into the garden and began to look over the little gardengate in expectation of every moment descrying agnes in the distance half an hour passed and for ten minutes more i was tolerably quiet from this time till half past two i became constantly more agitated agitated perhaps is too strong a word but i was restless and anxious beyond what i should have chosen to acknowledge still i kept arguing what is half an hour what is an hour a thousand things might have occurred to cause that delay without needing to suppose any accident or if an accident why not a very trifling one she may have slightly hurt her foot she may have slightly sprained her ankle oh doubtless i exclaimed to myself it will be a mere trifle or perhaps nothing at all but i remember that even whilst i was saying this i took my hat and walked with nervous haste into the little quiet lane upon which our gardengate opened the lane led by a few turnings and after a course of about five hundred yards into a broad highroad which even at that day had begun to assume the character of a street and allowed an unobstructed range of view in the direction of the city for at least a mile here i stationed myself for the air was so clear that i could distinguish dress and figure to a much greater distance than usual even on such a day however the remote distance was hazy and indistinct and at any other season i should have been diverted with the various mistakes i made from occasional combinations of color modified by light and shade and of course powerfully assisted by the creative state of the eye under this nervous apprehensiveness i continued to shape into images of agnes forms without end that upon nearer approach presented the most grotesque contrasts to her impressive appearance but i had ceased even to comprehend the ludicrous my agitation was now so overruling and engrossing that i lost even my intellectual sense of it and now first i understood practically and feelingly the anguish of hope alternating with disappointment as it may be supposed to act upon the poor shipwrecked seaman alone and upon a desolate coast straining his sight for ever to the fickle element which has betrayed him but which only can deliver him and with his eyes still tracing in the far distance ships dimdiscoverd dropping from the clouds which a brief interval of suspense still for ever disperses into hollow pageants of air or vapor one deception melted away only to be succeeded by another still i fancied that at last to a certainty i could descry the tall figure of agnes her gipsy hat and even the peculiar elegance of her walk often i went so far as to laugh at myself and even to tax my recent fears with unmanliness and effeminacy on recollecting the audible throbbings of my heart and the nervous palpitations which had besieged me but these symptoms whether effeminate or not began to come back tumultuously under the gloomy doubts that succeeded almost before i had uttered this selfreproach still i found myself mocked and deluded with false hopes yet still i renewed my quick walk and the intensity of my watch for that radiant form that was fated never more to be seen returning from the cruel city it was nearly halfpast three and therefore close upon two hours beyond the time fixed by agnes for her return when i became absolutely incapable of supporting the further torture of suspense and i suddenly took the resolution of returning home and concerting with my female servants some energetic measures though what i could hardly say on behalf of their mistress on entering the gardengate i met our little child francis who unconsciously inflicted a pang upon me which he neither could have meditated nor have understood i passed him at his play perhaps even unaware of his presence but he recalled me to that perception by crying aloud that he had just seen his mamma when where i asked convulsively up stairs in her bedroom was his instantaneous answer his manner was such as forbade me to suppose that he could be joking and as it was barely possible though for reasons well known to me in the highest degree improbable that agnes might have returned by a bypath which leading through a dangerous and disreputable suburb would not have coincided at any one point with the public road where i had been keeping my station i sprang forward into the house up stairs and in rapid succession into every room where it was likely that she might be found but everywhere there was a dead silence disturbed only by myself for in my growing confusion of thought i believe that i rang the bell violently in every room i entered no such summons however was needed for the servants two of whom at the least were most faithful creatures and devotedly attached to their young mistress stood ready of themselves to come and make inquiries of me as soon as they became aware of the alarming fact that i had returned without her until this moment though having some private reasons for surprise that she should have failed to come into the house for a minute or two at the hour prefixed in order to make some promised domestic arrangements for the day they had taken it for granted that she must have met with me at some distance from home and that either the extreme beauty of the day had beguiled her of all petty household recollections or as a conjecture more in harmony with past experiences that my impatience and solicitations had persuaded her to lay aside her own plans for the moment at the risk of some little domestic inconvenience now however in a single instant vanished every mode of accounting for their mistresss absence and the consternation of our looks communicated contagiously by the most unerring of all languages from each to the other what thoughts were uppermost in our panicstricken hearts if to any person it should seem that our alarm was disproportioned to the occasion and not justified at least by anything as yet made known to us let that person consider the weight due to the two following facts first that from the recency of our settlement in this neighborhood and from the extreme seclusion of my wifes previous life at a vast distance from the metropolis she had positively no friends on her list of visitors who resided in this great capital secondly and far above all beside let him remember the awful denunciations so unexpectedly tallying with this alarming and mysterious absence of the hungarian prophetess these had been slighted almost dismissed from our thoughts but now in sudden reaction they came back upon us with a frightful power to lacerate and to sting the shadowy outline of a spiritual agency such as that which could at all predict the events combining in one mysterious effect with the shadowy outline of those very predictions the power that could have predicted was as dim and as hard to grasp as was the precise nature of the evil that had been predicted an icy terror froze my blood at this moment when i looked at the significant glances too easily understood by me that were exchanged between the servants my mouth had been for the last two hours growing more and more parched so that at present from mere want of moisture i could not separate my lips to speak one of the women saw the vain efforts i was making and hastily brought me a glass of water with the first recovery of speech i asked them what little francis had meant by saying that he had seen his mother in her bedroom their reply was that they were as much at a loss to discover his meaning as i was that he had made the same assertion to them and with so much earnestness that they had all in succession gone up stairs to look for her and with the fullest expectation of finding her this was a mystery which remained such to the very last there was no doubt whatsoever that the child believed himself to have seen his mother that he could not have seen her in her human bodily presence there is as little doubt as there is alas that in this world he never did see her again the poor child constantly adhered to his story and with a circumstantiality far beyond all power of invention that could be presumed in an artless infant every attempt at puzzling him or entangling him in contradictions by means of crossexamination was but labor thrown away though indeed it is true enough that for those attempts as will soon be seen there was but a brief interval allowed not dwelling upon this subject at present i turned to hannah a woman who held the nominal office of cook in our little establishment but whose real duties had been much more about her mistresss person and with a searching look of appeal i asked her whether in this moment of trial when as she might see i was not so perfectly master of myself as perhaps always to depend upon seeing what was best to be done she would consent to accompany me into the city and take upon herself those obvious considerations of policy or prudence which might but too easily escape my mind darkened and likely to be darkened as to its power of discernment by the hurricane of affliction now too probably at hand she answered my appeal with the fervor i expected from what i had already known of her character she was a woman of a strong fiery perhaps i might say of heroic mind supported by a courage that was absolutely indomitable and by a strength of bodily frame very unusual in a woman and beyond the promise even of her person she had suffered as deep a wrench in her own affections as a human being can suffer she had lost her one sole child a fairhaired boy of most striking beauty and interesting disposition at the age of seventeen and by the worst of all possible fates he lived as we did at that time in a large commercial city overflowing with profligacy and with temptations of every order he had been led astray culpable he had been but by very much the least culpable of the set into which accident had thrown him as regarded acts and probable intentions and as regarded palliations from childish years from total inexperience or any other alleviating circumstances that could be urged having everything to plead and of all his accomplices the only one who had anything to plead interest however he had little or none and whilst some hoary villains of the party who happened to be more powerfully befriended were finally allowed to escape with a punishment little more than nominal he and two others were selected as sacrifices to the offended laws they suffered capitally all three behaved well but the poor boy in particular with a courage a resignation and a meekness so distinguished and beyond his years as to attract the admiration and the liveliest sympathy of the public universally if strangers could feel in that way if the mere hardened executioner could be melted at the final scene it may be judged to what a fierce and terrific height would ascend the affliction of a doating mother constitutionally too fervid in her affections i have heard an official person declare that the spectacle of her desolation and frantic anguish was the most frightful thing he had ever witnessed and so harrowing to the feelings that all who could by their rank venture upon such an irregularity absented themselves during the critical period from the office which corresponded with the government for as i have said the affair took place in a large provincial city at a great distance from the capital all who knew this woman or who were witnesses to the alteration which one fortnight had wrought in her person as well as her demeanor fancied it impossible that she could continue to live or that if she did it must be through the giving way of her reason they proved however to be mistaken or at least if as some thought her reason did suffer in some degree this result showed itself in the inequality of her temper in moody fits of abstraction and the morbid energy of her manner at times under the absence of all adequate external excitement rather than in any positive and apparent hallucinations of thought the charm which had mainly carried off the instant danger to her faculties was doubtless the intense sympathy which she met with and in these offices of consolation my wife stood foremost for and that was fortunate she had found herself able without violence to her own sincerest opinions in the case to offer precisely that form of sympathy which was most soothing to the angry irritation of the poor mother not only had she shown a direct interest in the boy and not a mere interest of reflection from that which she took in the mother and had expressed it by visits to his dungeon and by every sort of attention to his comforts which his case called for or the prison regulations allowed not only had she wept with the distracted woman as if for a brother of her own but which went farther than all the rest in softening the mothers heart she had loudly and indignantly proclaimed her belief in the boys innocence and in the same tone her sense of the crying injustice committed as to the selection of the victims and the proportion of the punishment awarded others in the language of a great poet had pitied her and not her grief they had either not been able to see or from carelessness had neglected to see any peculiar wrong done to her in the matter which occasioned her grief but had simply felt compassion for her as for one summoned in a regular course of providential and human dispensation to face an affliction heavy in itself but not heavy from any special defect of equity consequently their very sympathy being so much built upon the assumption that an only child had offended to the extent implied in his sentence oftentimes clothed itself in expressions which she felt to be not consolations but insults and in fact so many justifications of those whom it relieved her overcharged heart to regard as the very worst of enemies agnes on the other hand took the very same view of the case as herself and though otherwise the gentlest of all gentle creatures yet here from the generous fervor of her reverence for justice and her abhorrence of oppression she gave herself no trouble to moderate the energy of her language nor did i on my part feeling that substantially she was in the right think it of importance to dispute about the exact degrees of the wrong done or the indignation due to it in this way it happened naturally enough that at one and the same time though little contemplating either of these results agnes had done a prodigious service to the poor desolate mother by breaking the force of her misery as well as by arming the active agencies of indignation against the depressing ones of solitary grief and for herself had won a most grateful and devoted friend who would have gone through fire and water to serve her and was thenceforwards most anxious for some opportunity to testify how deep had been her sense of the goodness shown to her by her benign young mistress and how incapable of suffering abatement by time it remains to add which i have slightly noticed before that this woman was of unusual personal strength her bodily frame matched with her intellectual and i notice this now with the more emphasis because i am coming rapidly upon ground where it will be seen that this one qualification was of more summary importance to us did us more yeomans service at a crisis the most awful than other qualities of greater name and pretension hannah was this womans christian name and her name and her memory are to me amongst the most hallowed of my earthly recollections one of her two fellowservants known technically amongst us as the parlor maid was also but not equally attached to her mistress and merely because her nature less powerfully formed and endowed did not allow her to entertain or to comprehend any service equally fervid of passion or of impassioned action she however was good affectionate and worthy to be trusted but a third there was a nursery maid and therefore more naturally and more immediately standing within the confidence of her mistress her i could not trust her i suspected but of that hereafter meantime hannah she upon whom i leaned as upon a staff in all which respected her mistress ran up stairs after i had spoken and received her answer in order hastily to dress and prepare herself for going out along with me to the city i did not ask her to be quick in her movements i knew there was no need and whilst she was absent i took up in one of my fretful movements of nervousness a book which was lying upon a sidetable the book fell open of itself at a particular page and in that perhaps there was nothing extraordinary for it was a little portable edition of paradise lost and the page was one which i must naturally have turned to many a time for to agnes i had read all the great masters of literature especially those of modern times so that few people knew the high classics more familiarly and as to the passage in question from its divine beauty i had read it aloud to her perhaps on fifty separate occasions all this i mention to take away any appearance of a vulgar attempt to create omens but still in the very act of confessing the simple truth and thus weakening the marvellous character of the anecdote i must notice it as a strange instance of the sortes miltonian that precisely at such a moment as this i should find thrown in my way should feel tempted to take up and should open a volume containing such a passage as the following and observe moreover that although the volume once being taken up would naturally open where it had been most frequently read there were however many passages which had been read as frequently or more so the particular passage upon which i opened at this moment was that most beautiful one in which the fatal morning separation is described between adam and his bride that separation so pregnant with wo which eventually proved the occasion of the mortal transgression the last scene between our first parents at which both were innocent and both were happy although the superior intellect already felt and in the slight altercation preceding this separation had already expressed a dim misgiving of some coming change these are the words and in depth of pathos they have rarely been approached oft he to her his charge of quick return repeated she to him as oft engagd to be returned by noon amid the bowr and all things in best order to invite noontide repast or afternoons repose oh much deceived much failing hapless eve of thy presumed return event perverse thou never from that hour in paradise foundst either sweet repast or sound repose my eve i exclaimed partner in my paradise where art thou much failing thou wilt not be found nor much deceived innocent in any case thou art but alas too surely by this time hapless and the victim of some diabolic wickedness thus i murmured to myself thus i ejaculated thus i apostrophized my agnes then again came a stormier mood i could not sit still i could not stand in quiet i threw the book from me with violence against the wall i began to hurry backwards and forwards in a short uneasy walk when suddenly a sound a step it was the sound of the gardengate opening followed by a hasty tread whose tread not for a moment could it be fancied the oread step which belonged to that daughter of the hills my wife my agnes no it was the dull massy tread of a man and immediately there came a loud blow upon the door and in the next moment the bell having been found a furious peal of ringing oh coward heart not for a lease of immortality could i have gone forwards myself my breath failed me an interval came in which respiration seemed to be stifled the blood to halt in its current and then and there i recognised in myself the force and living truth of that scriptural description of a heart consciously beset by evil without escape susannah sighed yes a long long sigh a deep deep sigh that is the natural language by which the overcharged heart utters forth the wo that else would break it i sighed oh how profoundly but that did not give me power to move who will go to the door i whispered audibly who is at the door was the inaudible whisper of my heart then might be seen the characteristic differences of the three women that one whom i suspected i heard raising an upper window to look out and reconnoitre the affectionate rachael on the other hand ran eagerly down stairs but hannah half dressed even her bosom exposed passed her like a storm and before i heard any sound of opening a door i saw from the spot where i stood the door already wide open and a man in the costume of a policeman all that he said i could not hear but this i heard that i was wanted at the police office and had better come off without delay he seemed then to get a glimpse of me and to make an effort towards coming nearer but i slunk away and left to hannah the task of drawing from him any circumstances which he might know but apparently there was not much to tell or rather said i there is too much the much absorbs the many some one mighty evil transcends and quells all particulars at length the door was closed and the man was gone hannah crept slowly along the passage and looked in hesitatingly her very movements and stealthy pace testified that she had heard nothing which even by comparison she could think good news tell me not now hannah i said wait till we are in the open air she went up stairs again how short seemed the time till she descended how i longed for further respite hannah i said at length when we were fairly moving upon the road hannah i am too sure you have nothing good to tell but now tell me the worst and let that be in the fewest words possible sir she said we had better wait until we reach the office for really i could not understand the man he says that my mistress is detained upon some charge but what i could not at all make out he was a man that knew something of you sir i believe and he wished to be civil and kept saying oh i dare say it will turn out nothing at all many such charges are made idly and carelessly and some maliciously but what charges i cried and then he wanted to speak privately to you but i told him that of all persons he must not speak to you if he had anything painful to tell for that you were too much disturbed already and had been for some hours out of anxiety and terror about my mistress to bear much more so when he heard that he was less willing to speak freely than before he might prove wrong he said he might give offence things might turn out far otherwise than according to first appearances for his part he could not believe anything amiss of so sweet a lady and after all it would be better to wait till we reached the office thus much then was clear agnes was under some accusation this was already worse than the worst i had anticipated and then said i thinking aloud to hannah one of two things is apparent to me either the accusation is one of pure hellish malice without a color of probability or the shadow of a foundation and that way alas i am driven in my fears by that hungarian womans prophecy or which but for my desponding heart i should be more inclined to think the charge has grown out of my poor wifes rustic ignorance as to the usages then recently established by law with regard to the kind of money that could be legally tendered this however was a suggestion that did not tend to alleviate my anxiety and my nervousness had mounted to a painful almost to a disabling degree by the time we reached the office already on our road thither some parties had passed us who were conversing with eagerness upon the case so much we collected from the many and ardent expressions about the ladys beauty though the rest of such words as we could catch were ill calculated to relieve my suspense this then at least was certain that my poor timid agnes had already been exhibited before a tumultuous crowd that her name and reputation had gone forth as a subject of discussion for the public and that the domestic seclusion and privacy within which it was her matronly privilege to move had already undergone a rude violation the office and all the purlieus of the office were occupied by a dense crowd that perhaps was always the case more or less at this time of day but at present the crowd was manifestly possessed by a more than ordinary interest and there was a unity in this possessing interest all were talking on the same subject the case in which agnes had so recently appeared in some character or other and by this time it became but too certain in the character of an accused person pity was the prevailing sentiment amongst the mob but the opinions varied much as to the probable criminality of the prisoner i made my way into the office the presiding magistrates had all retired for the afternoon and would not reassemble until eight oclock in the evening some clerks only or officers of the court remained who were too much harassed by applications for various forms and papers connected with the routine of public business and by other official duties which required signatures or attestations to find much leisure for answering individual questions some however listened with a marked air of attention to my earnest request for the circumstantial details of the case but finally referred me to a vast folio volume in which were entered all the charges of whatever nature involving any serious tendency in fact all that exceeded a misdemeanor in the regular chronological succession according to which they came before the magistrate here in this vast calendar of guilt and misery amidst the aliases or cant designations of ruffians prostitutes felons stood the description at full length christian and surnames all properly registered of my agnes of her whose very name had always sounded to my ears like the very echo of mountain innocence purity and pastoral simplicity here in another column stood the name and residence of her accuser i shall call him barratt for that was amongst his names and a name by which he had at one period of his infamous life been known to the public though not his principal name or the one which he had thought fit to assume at this era james barratt then as i shall here call him was a haberdasher keeping a large and conspicuous shop in a very crowded and what was then considered a fashionable part of the city the charge was plain and short did i live to read it it accused agnes m of having on that morning secreted in her muff and feloniously carried away a valuable piece of mechlin lace the property of james barratt and the result of the first examination was thus communicated in a separate column written in red ink remanded to the second day after tomorrow for final examination everything in this sinpolluted register was in manuscript but at night the records of each day were regularly transferred to a printed journal enlarged by comments and explanatory descriptions from some one of the clerks whose province it was to furnish this intelligence to the public journals on that same night therefore would go forth to the world such an account of the case and such a description of my wifes person as would inevitably summon to the next exhibition of her misery as by special invitation and advertisement the whole world of this vast metropolis the idle the curious the brutal the hardened amateur in spectacles of wo and the benign philanthropist who frequents such scenes with the purpose of carrying alleviation to their afflictions all alike whatever might be their motives or the spirit of their actions would rush as to some grand festival of curiosity and sentimental luxury to this public martyrdom of my innocent wife meantime what was the first thing to be done manifestly to see agnes her account of the affair might suggest the steps to be taken prudence therefore at any rate prescribed this course and my heart would not have tolerated any other i applied therefore at once for information as to the proper mode of effecting this purpose without delay what was my horror at learning that by a recent regulation of all the policeoffices under the direction of the public minister who presided over that department of the national administration no person could be admitted to an interview with any accused party during the progress of the official examinations or in fact until the final committal of the prisoner for trial this rule was supposed to be attended by great public advantages and had rarely been relaxed never indeed without a special interposition of the police minister authorizing its suspension but was the exclusion absolute and universal might not at least a female servant simply as the bearer of such articles as were indispensable to female delicacy and comfort have access to her mistress no the exclusion was total and unconditional to argue the point was manifestly idle the subordinate officers had no discretion in the matter nor in fact had any other official person whatever were his rank except the supreme one and to him i neither had any obvious means of introduction nor in case of obtaining such an introduction any chance of success for the spirit of the rule i foresaw it would be answered applied with especial force to cases like the present mere human feelings of pity sympathy with my too visible agitation superadded to something of perhaps reverence for the blighting misery that was now opening its artillery upon me for misery has a privilege and everywhere is felt to be a holy thing had combined to procure for me some attention and some indulgence hitherto answers had been given with precision explanations made at length and anxiety shown to satisfy my inquiries but this could not last the inexorable necessities of public business coming back in a torrent upon the official people after this momentary interruption forbade them to indulge any further consideration for an individual case and i saw that i must not stay any longer i was rapidly coming to be regarded as a hinderance to the movement of public affairs and the recollection that i might again have occasion for some appeal to these men in their official characters admonished me not to abuse my privilege of the moment after returning thanks therefore for the disposition shown to oblige me i retired slowly did i and hannah retrace our steps hannah sustained in the tone of her spirits by the extremity of her anger a mood of feeling which i did not share indignation was to her in the stead of consolation and hope i for my part could not seek even a momentary shelter from my tempestuous affliction in that temper of mind the man who could accuse my agnes and accuse her of such a crime i felt to be a monster and in my thoughts he was already doomed to a bloody atonement atonement alas what atonement whenever the time arrived that her cause would not be prejudiced or the current of public feeling made to turn in his favor by investing him with the semblance of an injured or suffering person so much was settled in my thoughts with the stern serenity of a decree issuing from a judgmentseat but that gave no relief no shadow of relief to the misery which was now consuming me here was an end in one hour to the happiness of a life in one hour it had given way root and branch had melted like so much frostwork or a pageant of vapory exhalations in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and yet for ever and ever i comprehended the total ruin of my situation the case as others might think was yet in suspense and there was room enough for very rational hopes especially where there was an absolute certainty of innocence total freedom from all doubt on that point seemed to justify almost more than hopes this might be said and most people would have been more or less consoled by it i was not i felt as certain as irredeemably as hopelessly certain of the final results as though i had seen the record in the books of heaven hope nothing i said to myself think not of hope in this world but think only how best to walk steadily and not to reel like a creature wanting discourse of reason or incapable of religious hopes under the burden which it has pleased god to impose and which in this life cannot be shaken off the countenance of man is made to look upward and to the skies thither also point henceforwards your heart and your thoughts never again let your thoughts travel earthwards settle them on the heavens to which your agnes is already summoned the call is clear and not to be mistaken little in her fate now depends upon you or upon anything that man can do look therefore to yourself see that you make not shipwreck of your heavenly freight because your earthly freight is lost and miss not by any acts of wild and presumptuous despair that final reunion with your agnes which can only be descried through vistas that open through the heavens such were the thoughts thoughts often made audible which came spontaneously like oracles from afar as i strode homewards with hannah by my side her meantime i seemed to hear for at times i seemed and i intended to answer her but answer her i did not for not ten words of all that she said did i really and consciously hear how i went through that night is more entirely a blank in my memory more entirely a chapter of chaos and the confusion of chaos than any other passage the most impressive in my life if i even slumbered for a moment as at intervals i did sometimes though never sitting down but standing or pacing about throughout the night and if in this way i attained a momentary respite from selfconsciousness no sooner had i reached this enviable state of oblivion than some internal sting of irritation as rapidly dispersed the whole fickle fabric of sleep and as if the momentary trance this fugitive beguilement of my wo had been conceded by a demons subtle malice only with the purpose of barbing the pang by thus forcing it into a stronger relief through the insidious peace preceding it it is a well known and most familiar experience to all the sons and daughters of affliction that under no circumstances is the piercing lancinating torment of a recent calamity felt so keenly as in the first moments of awaking in the morning from the nights slumbers just at the very instant when the clouds of sleep and the whole fantastic illusions of dreaminess are dispersing just as the realities of life are reassuming their steadfast forms reshaping themselves and settling anew into those fixed relations which they are to preserve throughout the waking hours in that particular crisis of transition from the unreal to the real the wo which besieges the brain and the lifesprings at the heart rushes in afresh amongst the other crowd of realities and has at the moment of restoration literally the force and liveliness of a new birth the very same pang and no whit feebler as that which belonged to it when it was first made known from the total hush of oblivion which had buried it and sealed it up as it were during the sleeping hours it starts into sudden life on our first awaking and is to all intents and purposes a new and not an old affliction one which brings with it the old original shock which attended its first annunciation that night that first night of separation from my wife how it passed i know not i know only that it passed i being in our common bedchamber that holiest of all temples that are consecrated to human attachments whenever the heart is pure of man and woman and the love is strong i being in that bedchamber once the temple now the sepulchre of our happiness i there and my wife my innocent wife in a dungeon as the morning light began to break somebody knocked at the door it was hannah she took my hand misery levels all feeble distinctions of station sex age she noticed my excessive feverishness and gravely remonstrated with me upon the necessity there was that i should maintain as much health as possible for the sake of others if not for myself she then brought me some tea which refreshed me greatly for i had tasted nothing at all beyond a little water since the preceding mornings breakfast this refreshment seemed to relax and thaw the stiff frozen state of cheerless rayless despair in which i had passed the night i became susceptible of consolation that consolation which lies involved in kindness and gentleness of manner if not susceptible more than before of any positive hope i sat down and having no witnesses to my weakness but this kind and faithful woman i wept and i found a relief in tears and she with the ready sympathy of woman wept along with me all at once she ventured upon the circumstances so far as she had been able to collect them from the reports of those who had been present at the examination of our calamity there was little indeed either to excite or to gratify any interest or curiosity separate from the personal interest inevitably connected with a case to which there were two such parties as a brutal sensual degraded ruffian on one side in character of accuser and on the other as defendant a meek angel of a woman timid and fainting from the horrors of her situation and under the licentious gaze of the crowd yet at the same time bold in conscious innocence and in the very teeth of the suspicions which beset her winning the good opinion as well as the good wishes of all who saw her there had been at this first examination little for her to say beyond the assigning her name age and place of abode and here it was fortunate that her own excellent good sense concurred with her perfect integrity and intuitive hatred of all indirect or crooked courses in prompting her to an undisguised statement of the simple truth without a momentary hesitation or attempt either at evasion or suppression with equally good intentions in similar situations many a woman has seriously injured her cause by slight evasions of the entire truth where nevertheless her only purpose has been the natural and ingenuous one of seeking to save the reputation untainted of a name which she felt to have been confided to her keeping the purpose was an honorable one but erroneously pursued agnes fell into no such error she answered calmly simply and truly to every question put by the magistrates and beyond that there was little opportunity for her to speak the whole business of this preliminary examination being confined to the deposition of the accuser as to the circumstances under which he alleged the act of felonious appropriation to have taken place these circumstances were perfectly uninteresting considered in themselves but amongst them was one which to us had the most shocking interest from the absolute proof thus furnished of a deeplaid plot against agnes but for this one circumstance there would have been a possibility that the whole had originated in error error growing out of and acting upon a nature originally suspicious and confirmed perhaps by an unfortunate experience and in proportion as that was possible the chances increased that the accuser might as the examinations advanced and the winning character of the accused party began to develop itself begin to see his error and to retract his own overhasty suspicions but now we saw at a glance that for this hope there was no countenance whatever since one solitary circumstance sufficed to establish a conspiracy the deposition bore that the lace had been secreted and afterwards detected in a muff now it was a fact as well known to both of us as the fact of agnes having gone out at all that she had laid aside her winters dress for the first time on this genial sunny day muff she had not at the time nor could have had appropriately from the style of her costume in other respects what was the effect upon us of this remarkable discovery of course there died at once the hope of any abandonment by the prosecutor of his purpose because here was proof of a predetermined plot this hope died at once but then as it was one which never had presented itself to my mind i lost nothing by which i had ever been solaced on the other hand it will be obvious that a new hope at the same time arose to take its place viz the reasonable one that by this single detection if once established we might raise a strong presumption of conspiracy and moreover that as a leading fact or clue it might serve to guide us in detecting others hannah was sanguine in this expectation and for a moment her hopes were contagiously exciting to mine but the hideous despondency which in my mind had settled upon the whole affair from the very first the superstitious presentiment i had of a total blight brooding over the entire harvest of my life and its promises tracing itself originally i am almost ashamed to own up to that prediction of the hungarian woman denied me steady light anything all in short but a wandering ray of hope it was right of course nay indispensable that the circumstance of the muff should be strongly insisted upon at the next examination pressed against the prosecutor and sifted to the uttermost an able lawyer would turn this to a triumphant account and it would be admirable as a means of pre engaging the good opinion as well as the sympathies of the public in behalf of the prisoner but for its final effect my conviction remained not to be shaken that all would be useless that our doom had gone forth and was irrevocable let me not linger too much over those sad times morning came on as usual for it is strange but true that to the very wretched it seems wonderful that times and seasons should keep their appointed courses in the midst of such mighty overthrows and such interruption to the courses of their own wonted happiness and their habitual expectations why should morning and night why should all movements in the natural world be so regular whilst in the moral world all is so irregular and anomalous yet the sun and the moon rise and set as usual upon the mightiest revolutions of empire and of worldly fortune that this planet ever beholds and it is sometimes even a comfort to know that this will be the case a great criminal sentenced to an agonizing punishment has derived a fortitude and a consolation from recollecting that the day would run its inevitable course that a day after all was but a day that the mighty wheel of alternate light and darkness must and would revolve and that the evening star would rise as usual and shine with its untroubled lustre upon the dust and ashes of what had indeed suffered and so recently the most bitter pangs but would then have ceased to suffer la journe said damien la journe sera dure mais elle se passera se passera yes that is true i whispered to myself my day also my season of trial will be hard to bear but that also will have an end that also se passera thus i talked or thought so long as i thought at all for the hour was now rapidly approaching when thinking in any shape would for some time be at an end for me that day as the morning advanced i went again accompanied by hannah to the police court and to the prison a vast ancient in parts ruinous and most gloomy pile of building in those days the administration of justice was if not more corrupt certainly in its inferior departments by far more careless than it is at present and liable to thousands of interruptions and malpractices supporting themselves upon old traditionary usages which required at least half a century and the shattering everywhere given to old systems by the french revolution together with the universal energy of mind applied to those subjects over the whole length and breadth of christendom to approach with any effectual reforms knowing this and having myself had direct personal cognisance of various cases in which bribery had been applied with success i was not without considerable hope that perhaps hannah and myself might avail ourselves of this irregular passport through the gates of the prison and had the new regulation been of somewhat longer standing there is little doubt that i should have been found right unfortunately as yet it had all the freshness of newborn vigor and kept itself in remembrance by the singular irritation it excited besides this it was a pet novelty of one particular minister new to the possession of power anxious to distinguish himself proud of his creative functions within the range of his office and very sensitively jealous on the point of opposition to his mandates vain therefore on this day were all my efforts to corrupt the jailers and in fact anticipating a time when i might have occasion to corrupt some of them for a more important purpose and on a larger scale i did not think it prudent to proclaim my character beforehand as one who tampered with such means and thus to arm against myself those jealousies in official people which it was so peculiarly important that i should keep asleep all that day however i lingered about the avenues and vast courts in the precincts of the prison and near one particular wing of the building which had been pointed out to me by a jailer as the section allotted to those who were in the situation of agnes that is waiting their final commitment for trial the building generally he could indicate with certainty but he professed himself unable to indicate the particular part of it which the young woman brought in on the day previous would be likely to occupy consequently he could not point out the window from which her cell her cell what a word would be lighted but master he went on to say i would advise nobody to try that game he looked with an air so significant and at the same time used a gesture so indicative of private understanding that i at once apprehended his meaning and assured him that he had altogether misconstrued my drift that as to attempts at escape or at any mode of communicating with the prisoner from the outside i trusted all that was perfectly needless and that at any rate in my eyes it was perfectly hopeless well master he replied thats neither here nor there youve come down handsomely that i will say and where a gentleman acts like a gentleman and behaves himself as such im not the man to go and split upon him for a word to be sure its quite natral that a gentleman put case that a young woman is his fancy woman its nothing but natral that he should want to get her out of such an old rathole as this where manys the finetimbered creature both he and she that has lain to rot and has never got out of the old trap at all first or lasthow so i interrupted him surely they dont detain the corpses of prisoners ay but mind you put case that he or that she should die in this rattrap before sentence is past why then the prison counts them as its own children and buries them in its own chapel that old stack of pigeonholes that you see up yonder to the right hand so then after all thought i if my poor agnes should in her desolation and solitary confinement to these wretched walls find her frail strength give way should the moral horrors of her situation work their natural effect upon her health and she should chance to die within this dungeon here within this same dungeon will she lie to the resurrection and in that case her prisondoors have already closed upon her for ever the man who perhaps had some rough kindness in his nature though tainted by the mercenary feelings too inevitably belonging to his situation seemed to guess at the character of my ruminations by the change of my countenance for he expressed some pity for my being in so much trouble and it seemed to increase his respect for me that this trouble should be directed to the case of a woman for he appeared to have a manly sense of the peculiar appeal made to the honor and gallantry of man by the mere general fact of the feebleness and the dependence of woman i looked at him more attentively in consequence of the feeling tone in which he now spoke and was surprised that i had not more particularly noticed him before he was a fine looking youngish man with a bold robinhood style of figure and appearance and morally speaking he was absolutely transfigured to my eyes by the effect worked upon him for the moment through the simple calling up of his better nature however he recurred to his cautions about the peril in a legal sense of tampering with the windows bolts and bars of the old decaying prison which in fact precisely according to the degree in which its absolute power over its prisoners was annually growing less and less grew more and more jealous of its own reputation and punished the attempts to break loose with the more severity in exact proportion as they were the more tempting by the chances of success i persisted in disowning any schemes of the sort and especially upon the ground of their hopelessness but this on the other hand was a ground that in his inner thoughts he treated with scorn and i could easily see that with a little skilful management of opportunity i might upon occasion draw from him all the secrets he knew as to the special points of infirmity in this old ruinous building for the present and until it should certainly appear that there was some use to be derived from this species of knowledge i forbore to raise superfluous suspicions by availing myself further of his communicative disposition taking however the precaution of securing his name together with his particular office and designation in the prison i parted from him as if to go home but in fact to resume my sad roamings up and down the precincts of the jail what made these precincts much larger than otherwise they would have been was the circumstance that by a usage derived from older days both criminal prisoners and those who were prisoners for debt equally fell under the custody of this huge caravanserai for the indifferent reception of crime of misdemeanor and of misfortune and those who came under the two first titles were lodged here through all stages of their connection with public justice alike when mere objects of vague suspicion to the police when under examination upon a specific charge when fully committed for trial when convicted and under sentence awaiting the execution of that sentence and in a large proportion of cases even through their final stage of punishment when it happened to be of any nature compatible with indoor confinement hence it arose that the number of those who haunted the prison gates with or without a title to admission was enormous all the relatives or more properly the acquaintances and connections of the criminal population within the prison being swelled by all the families of needy debtors who came daily either to offer the consolation of their society or to diminish their common expenditure by uniting their slender establishments one of the rules applied to the management of this vast multitude that were every day candidates for admission was that to save the endless trouble as well as risk perhaps of opening and shutting the main gates to every successive arrival periodic intervals were fixed for the admission by wholesale and as these periods came round every two hours it would happen at many parts of the day that vast crowds accumulated waiting for the next opening of the gate these crowds were assembled in two or three large outer courts in which also were many stalls and booths kept there upon some local privilege of ancient inheritance or upon some other plea made good by gifts or bribes some by jews and others by christians perhaps equally jewish superadded to these stationary elements of this miscellaneous population were others drawn thither by pure motives of curiosity so that altogether an almost permanent mob was gathered together in these courts and amid this mob it was from i know not what definite motive partly because i thought it probable that amongst these people i should hear the cause of agnes peculiarly the subject of conversation and so in fact it did really happen but partly and even more i believe because i now awfully began to shrink from solitude tumult i must have and distraction of thought amid this mob i say it was that i passed two days feverish i had been from the first and from bad to worse in such a case was at any rate a natural progress but perhaps also amongst this crowd of the poor the abjectly wretched the illfed the desponding and the dissolute there might be very naturally a larger body of contagion lurking than according to their mere numerical expectations there was at that season a very extensive depopulation going on in some quarters of this great metropolis and in other cities of the same empire by means of a very malignant typhus this fever is supposed to be the peculiar product of jails and though it had not as yet been felt as a scourge and devastator of this particular jail or at least the consequent mortality had been hitherto kept down to a moderate amount yet it was highly probable that a certain quantity of contagion much beyond the proportion of other popular assemblages less uniformly wretched in their composition was here to be found all day long and doubtless my excited state and irritable habit of body had offered a peculiar predisposition that favored the rapid development of this contagion however this might be the result was that on the evening of the second day which i spent in haunting the purlieus of the prison consequently the night preceding the second public examination of agnes i was attacked by ardent fever in such unmitigated fury that before morning i had lost all command of my intellectual faculties for some weeks i became a pitiable maniac and in every sense the wreck of my former self and seven entire weeks together with the better half of an eighth week had passed over my head whilst i lay unconscious of time and its dreadful freight of events excepting in so far as my disordered brain by its fantastic coinages created endless mimicries and mockeries of these events less substantial but oftentimes less afflicting or less agitating it would have been well for me had my destiny decided that i was not to be recalled to this world of wo but i had no such happiness in store i recovered and through twenty and eight years my groans have recorded the sorrow i feel that i did i shall not rehearse circumstantially and point by point the sad unfolding as it proceeded through successive revelations to me of all which had happened during my state of physical incapacity when i first became aware that my wandering senses had returned to me and knew by the cessation of all throbbings and the unutterable pains that had so long possessed my brain that i was now returning from the gates of death a sad confusion assailed me as to some indefinite cloud of evil that had been hovering over me at the time when i first fell into a state of insensibility for a time i struggled vainly to recover the lost connection of my thoughts and i endeavored ineffectually to address myself to sleep i opened my eyes but found the glare of light painful beyond measure strength however it seemed to me that i had and more than enough to raise myself out of bed i made the attempt but fell back almost giddy with the effort at the sound of the disturbance which i had thus made a woman whom i did not know came from behind a curtain and spoke to me shrinking from any communication with a stranger especially one whose discretion i could not estimate in making discoveries to me with the requisite caution i asked her simply what oclock it was eleven in the forenoon she replied and what day of the month the second was her brief answer i felt almost a sense of shame in adding the second but of what month of june was the startling rejoinder on the th of april i had fallen ill and it was now actually the d of june oh sickening calculation revolting register of hours for in that same moment which brought back this one recollection perhaps by steadying my brain rushed back in a torrent all the other dreadful remembrances of the period and now the more so because though the event was still uncertain as regarded my knowledge it must have become dreadfully certain as regarded the facts of the case and the happiness of all who were concerned alas one little circumstance too painfully assured me that this event had not been a happy one had agnes been restored to her liberty and her home where would she have been found but watching at my bedside that too certainly i knew and the inference was too bitter to support on this same day some hours afterwards upon hannahs return from the city i received from her and heard with perfect calmness the whole sum of evil which awaited me little francis she took up her tale at that point was with god so she expressed herself he had died of the same fever which had attacked me had died and been buried nearly five weeks before too probably he had caught the infection from me almost such are the caprices of human feeling almost i could have rejoiced that this young memorial of my vanished happiness had vanished also it gave me a pang nevertheless that the grave should thus have closed upon him before i had seen his fair little face again but i steeled my heart to hear worse things than this next she went on to inform me that already on the first or second day of our calamity she had taken upon herself without waiting for authority on observing the rapid approaches of illness in me and arguing the state of helplessness which would follow to write off at once a summons in the most urgent terms to the brother of my wife this gentleman whom i shall call pierpoint was a highspirited generous young man as i have ever known when i say that he was a sportsman that at one season of the year he did little else than pursue his darling amusement of fox hunting for which indeed he had almost a maniacal passion saying this i shall already have prejudged him in the opinions of many who fancy all such persons the slaves of corporeal enjoyments but with submission the truth lies the other way according to my experience people of these habits have their bodies more than usually under their command as being subdued by severe exercise and their minds neither better nor worse on an average than those of their neighbors are more available from being so much more rarely clogged by morbid habits in that uneasy yokefellow of the intellectual part the body he at all events was a man to justify in his own person this way of thinking for he was a man not only of sound but even of bold and energetic intellect and in all moral respects one whom any man might feel proud to call his friend this young man pierpoint without delay obeyed the summons and on being made acquainted with what had already passed the first step he took was to call upon barratt and without further question than what might ascertain his identity he proceeded to inflict upon him a severe horsewhipping a worse step on his sisters account he could not have taken previously to this the popular feeling had run strongly against barratt but now its unity was broken a new element was introduced into the question democratic feelings were armed against this outrage gentlemen and nobles it was said thought themselves not amenable to justice and again the majesty of the law was offended at this intrusion upon an affair already under solemn course of adjudication everything however passes away under the healing hand of time and this also faded from the public mind people remembered also that he was a brother and in that character at any rate had a right to some allowances for his intemperance and what quickened the oblivion of the affair was which in itself was sufficiently strange that barratt did not revive the case in the public mind by seeking legal reparation for his injuries it was however still matter of regret that pierpoint should have indulged himself in this movement of passion since undoubtedly it broke and disturbed the else uniform stream of public indignation by investing the original aggressor with something like the character of an injured person and therefore with some setoff to plead against his own wantonness of malice his malice might now assume the nobler aspect of revenge thus far in reporting the circumstances hannah had dallied thus far i had rejoiced that she dallied with the main burden of the wo but now there remained nothing to dally with any longer and she rushed along in her narrative hurrying to tell i hurrying to hear a second a third examination had ensued then a final committal all this within a week by that time all the world was agitated with the case literally not the city only vast as that city was but the nation was convulsed and divided into parties upon the question whether the prosecution were one of mere malice or not the very government of the land was reported to be equally interested and almost equally divided in opinion in this state of public feeling came the trial image to yourself oh reader whosoever you are the intensity of the excitement which by that time had arisen in all people to be spectators of the scene then image to yourself the effect of all this a perfect consciousness that in herself as a centre was settled the whole mighty interest of the exhibition that interest again of so dubious and mixed a character sympathy in some with mere misfortune sympathy in others with female frailty and guilt not perhaps founded upon an absolute unwavering belief in her innocence even amongst those who were most loud and positive as partisans in affirming it and then remember that all this hideous scenical display and notoriety settled upon one whose very nature constitutionally timid recoiled with the triple agony of womanly shame of matronly dignity of insulted innocence from every mode and shape of public display combine all these circumstances and elements of the case and you may faintly enter into the situation of my poor agnes perhaps the best way to express it at once is by recurring to the case of a young female christian martyr in the early ages of christianity exposed in the bloody amphitheatre of rome or verona to fight with wild beasts as it was expressed in mockery she to fight the lamb to fight with lions but in reality the young martyr had a fight to maintain and a fight in contempt of that cruel mockery fiercer than the fiercest of her persecutors could have faced perhaps the combat with the instincts of her own shrinking trembling fainting nature such a fight had my agnes to maintain and at that time there was a large party of gentlemen in whom the gentlemanly instinct was predominant and who felt so powerfully the cruel indignities of her situation that they made a public appeal in her behalf one thing and a strong one which they said was this we all talk and move in this case as if because the question appears doubtful to some people and the accused party to some people wears a doubtful character it would follow that she therefore had in reality a mixed character composed in joint proportions of the best and the worst that is imputed to her but let us not forget that this mixed character belongs not to her but to the infirmity of our human judgments they are mixed they are dubious but she is not she is or she is not guilty there is no middle case and let us consider for a single moment that if this young lady as many among us heartily believe is innocent then and upon that supposition let us consider how cruel we should all think the public exposure which aggravates the other injuries as in that case they must be thought to which her situation exposes her they went on to make some suggestions for the officers of the court in preparing the arrangements for the trial and some also for the guidance of the audience which showed the same generous anxiety for sparing the feelings of the prisoner if these did not wholly succeed in repressing the open avowal of coarse and brutal curiosity amongst the intensely vulgar at least they availed to diffuse amongst the neutral and indifferent part of the public a sentiment of respect and forbearance which emanating from high quarters had a very extensive influence upon most of what met the eye or the ear of my poor wife she on the day of trial was supported by her brother and by that time she needed support indeed i was reported to be dying her little son was dead neither had she been allowed to see him perhaps these things by weaning her from all further care about life might have found their natural effect in making her indifferent to the course of the trial or even to its issue and so perhaps in the main they did but at times some lingering sense of outraged dignity some fitful gleams of old sympathies the hectic of a moment came back upon her and prevailed over the deadening stupor of her grief then she shone for a moment into a starry light sweet and woful to remember thenbut why linger i hurry to the close she was pronounced guilty whether by a jury or a bench of judges i do not say having determined from the beginning to give no hint of the land in which all these events happened neither is that of the slightest consequence guilty she was pronounced but sentence at that time was deferred ask me not i beseech you about the muff or other circumstances inconsistent with the hostile evidence these circumstances had the testimony you will observe of my own servants only nay as it turned out of one servant exclusively that naturally diminished their value and on the other side evidence was arrayed perjury was suborned that would have wrecked a wilderness of simple truth trusting to its own unaided forces what followed did this judgment of the court settle the opinion of the public opinion of the public did it settle the winds did it settle the motion of the atlantic wilder fiercer and louder grew the cry against the wretched accuser mighty had been the power over the vast audience of the dignity the affliction the perfect simplicity and the madonna beauty of the prisoner that beauty so childlike and at the same time so saintly made besides so touching in its pathos by means of the abandonment the careless abandonment and the infinite desolation of her air and manner would of itself and without further aid have made many converts much more was done by the simplicity of her statements and the indifference with which she neglected to improve any strong points in her own favor the indifference as every heart perceived of despairing grief then came the manners on the hostile side the haggard consciousness of guilt the drooping tone the bravado and fierce strut which sought to dissemble all this not one amongst all the witnesses assembled on that side had by all agreement the bold natural tone of conscious uprightness hence it could not be surprising that the storm of popular opinion made itself heard with a louder and a louder sound the government itself began to be disturbed the ministers of the sovereign were agitated and had no menaces been thrown out it was generally understood that they would have given way to the popular voice now continually more distinct and clamorous in the midst of all this tumult obscure murmurs began to arise that barratt had practised the same or similar villanies in former instances one case in particular was beginning to be whispered about which at once threw a light upon the whole affair it was the case of a young and very beautiful married woman who had been on the very brink of a catastrophe such as had befallen my own wife when some seasonable interference of what nature was not known had critically delivered her this case arose like a little cloud no bigger than a mans hand then spread and threatened to burst in tempest upon the public mind when all at once more suddenly even than it had arisen it was hushed up or in some way disappeared but a trifling circumstance made it possible to trace this case in after times when means offered but unfortunately no particular purpose of good nor any purpose in fact beyond that of curiosity it was traced and enough was soon ascertained to have blown to fragments any possible conspiracy emanating from this barratt had that been of any further importance however in spite of all that money or art could effect a sullen growl continued to be heard amongst the populace of villanies many and profound that had been effected or attempted by this barratt and accordingly much in the same way as was many years afterwards practised in london when a hosier had caused several young people to be prosecuted to death for passing forged banknotes the wrath of the people showed itself in marking the shop for vengeance upon any favorable occasion offering through fire or riots and in the mean time in deserting it these things had been going on for some time when i awoke from my long delirium but the effect they had produced upon a weak and obstinate and haughty government or at least upon the weak and obstinate and haughty member of the government who presided in the police administration was to confirm and rivet the line of conduct which had been made the object of popular denunciation more energetically more scornfully to express that determination of flying in the face of public opinion and censure four days before my awakening agnes had been brought up to receive her sentence on that same day nay it was said in that same hour petitions very numerously signed and various petitions from different ranks different ages different sexes were carried up to the throne praying upon manifold grounds but all noticing the extreme doubtfulness of the case for an unconditional pardon by whose advice or influence it was guessed easily though never exactly ascertained these petitions were unanimously almost contemptuously rejected and to express the contempt of public opinion as powerfully as possible agnes was sentenced by the court reassembled in full pomp order and ceremonial costume to a punishment the severest that the laws allowed viz hard labor for ten years the people raged more than ever threats public and private were conveyed to the ears of the minister chiefly concerned in the responsibility and who had indeed by empty and ostentatious talking assumed that responsibility to himself in a way that was perfectly needless thus stood matters when i awoke to consciousness and this was the fatal journal of the interval interval so long as measured by my fierce calendar of delirium so brief measured by the huge circuit of events which it embraced and their mightiness for evil wrath wrath immeasurable unimaginable unmitigable burned at my heart like a cancer the worst had come and the thing which kills a man for action the living in two climates at once a torrid and a frigid zone of hope and fear that was past weak suppose i were for the moment i felt that a day or two might bring back my strength no miserable tremors of hope now shook my nerves if they shook from that inevitable rocking of the waters that follows a storm so much might be pardoned to the infirmity of a nature that could not lay aside its fleshly necessities nor altogether forego its homage to these frail elements but which by inspiration already lived within a region where no voices were heard but the spiritual voices of transcendent passions of wrongs unrevenged and insults unredressd six days from that time i was well well and strong i rose from bed i bathed i dressed dressed as if i were a bridegroom and that was in fact a great day in my life i was to see agnes oh yes permission had been obtained from the lordly minister that i should see my wife is it possible can such condescensions exist yes solicitations from ladies eloquent notes wet with ducal tears these had won from the thriceradiant secretary redolent of roseate attar a countersign to some order or other by which i yes i under license of a fop and supervision of a jailer was to see and for a time to converse with my own wife the hour appointed for the first days interview was eight oclock in the evening on the outside of the jail all was summer light and animation the sports of children in the streets of mighty cities are but sad and too painfully recall the circumstances of freedom and breezy nature that are not there but still the pomp of glorious summer and the presence not to be put by of the everlasting light that is either always present or always dawning these potent elements impregnate the very city life and the dim reflex of nature which is found at the bottom of welllike streets with more solemn powers to move and to soothe in summer i struck upon the prison gates the first among multitudes waiting to strike not because we struck but because the hour had sounded suddenly the gate opened and in we streamed i as a visitor for the first time was immediately distinguished by the jailers whose glance of the eye is fatally unerring who was it that i wanted at the name a stir of emotion was manifest even there the dry bones stirred and moved the passions outside had long ago passed to the interior of this gloomy prison and not a man but had his hypothesis on the case not a man but had almost fought with some comrade many had literally fought about the merits of their several opinions if any man had expected a scene at this reunion he would have been disappointed exhaustion and the ravages of sorrow had left to dear agnes so little power of animation or of action that her emotions were rather to be guessed at both for kind and for degree than directly to have been perceived she was in fact a sick patient far gone in an illness that should properly have confined her to bed and was as much past the power of replying to my frenzied exclamations as a dying victim of fever of entering upon a strife of argument in bed however she was not when the door opened she was discovered sitting at a table placed against the opposite wall her head pillowed upon her arms and these resting upon the table her beautiful long auburn hair had escaped from its confinement and was floating over the table and her own person she took no notice of the disturbance made by our entrance did not turn did not raise her head nor make an effort to do so nor by any sign whatever intimate that she was conscious of our presence until the turnkey in a respectful tone announced me upon that a low groan or rather a feeble moan showed that she had become aware of my presence and relieved me from all apprehension of causing too sudden a shock by taking her in my arms the turnkey had now retired we were alone i knelt by her side threw my arms about her and pressed her to my heart she drooped her head upon my shoulder and lay for some time like one who slumbered but alas not as she had used to slumber her breathing which had been like that of sinless infancy was now frightfully short and quick she seemed not properly to breathe but to gasp this thought i may be sudden agitation and in that case she will gradually recover half an hour will restore her wo is me she did not recover and internally i said she never will recover the arrows have gone too deep for a frame so exquisite in its sensibility and already her hours are numbered at this first visit i said nothing to her about the past that and the whole extent to which our communications should go i left rather to her own choice at the second visit however upon some word or other arising which furnished an occasion for touching on this hateful topic i pressed her contrary to my own previous intention for as full an account of the fatal event as she could without a distressing effort communicate to my surprise she was silent gloomily almost it might have seemed obstinately silent a horrid thought came into my mind could it might it have been possible that my nobleminded wife such she had ever seemed to me was open to temptations of this nature could it have been that in some moment of infirmity when her better angel was away from her side she had yielded to a sudden impulse of frailty such as a second moment for consideration would have resisted but which unhappily had been followed by no such opportunity of retrieval i had heard of such things cases there were in our own times and not confined to one nation when irregular impulses of this sort were known to have haunted and besieged natures not otherwise ignoble and base i ran over some of the names amongst those which were taxed with this propensity more than one were the names of people in a technical sense held noble that nor any other consideration abated my horror better i said better because more compatible with elevation of mind better to have committed some bloody act some murderous act dreadful was the panic i underwent god pardon the wrong i did and even now i pray to him as though the past thing were a future thing and capable of change that he would forbid her for ever to know what was the derogatory thought i had admitted i sometimes think by recollecting a momentary blush that suffused her marble countenance i think i fear that she might have read what was fighting in my mind yet that would admit of another explanation if she did read the very worst meek saint she suffered no complaint or sense of that injury to escape her it might however be that perception or it might be that fear which roused her to an effort that otherwise had seemed too revolting to undertake she now rehearsed the whole steps of the affair from first to last but the only material addition which her narrative made to that which the trial itself had involved was the following on two separate occasions previous to the last and fatal one when she had happened to walk unaccompanied by me in the city the monster barratt had met her in the street he had probably and this was indeed subsequently ascertained at first and for some time afterwards mistaken her rank and had addressed some proposals to her which from the suppressed tone of his speaking or from her own terror and surprise she had not clearly understood but enough had reached her alarmed ear to satisfy her that they were of a nature in the last degree licentious and insulting terrified and shocked rather than indignant for she too easily presumed the man to be a maniac she hurried homewards and was rejoiced on first venturing to look round when close to her own gate to perceive that the man was not following there however she was mistaken for either on this occasion or on some other he had traced her homewards the last of these rencontres had occurred just three months before the fatal th of april and if in any one instance agnes had departed from the strict line of her duty as a wife or had shown a defect of judgment it was at this point in not having frankly and fully reported the circumstances to me on the last of these occasions i had met her at the gardengate and had particularly remarked that she seemed agitated and now at recalling these incidents agnes reminded me that i had noticed that circumstance to herself and that she had answered me faithfully as to the main fact it was true she had done so for she had said that she had just met a lunatic who had alarmed her by fixing his attention upon herself and speaking to her in a ruffian manner and it was also true that she did sincerely regard him in that light this led me at the time to construe the whole affair into a casual collision with some poor maniac escaping from his keepers and of no future moment having passed by without present consequences but had she instead of thus reporting her own erroneous impression reported the entire circumstances of the case i should have given them a very different interpretation affection for me and fear to throw me needlessly into a quarrel with a man of apparently brutal and violent nature these considerations as too often they do with the most upright wives had operated to check agnes in the perfect sincerity of her communications she had told nothing but the truth only and fatally it turned out for us both she had not told the whole truth the very suppression to which she had reconciled herself under the belief that thus she was providing for my safety and her own consequent happiness had been the indirect occasion of ruin to both it was impossible to show displeasure under such circumstances or under any circumstances to one whose selfreproaches were at any rate too bitter but certainly as a general rule every conscientious woman should resolve to consider her husbands honor in the first case and far before all other regards whatsoever to make this the first the second the third law of her conduct and his personal safety but the fourth or fifth yet women and especially when the interests of children are at stake upon their husbands safety rarely indeed are able to take this roman view of their duties to return to the narrative agnes had not nor could have the most remote suspicion of this barratts connection with the shop which he had not accidentally entered and the sudden appearance of this wretch it was at the very moment of finding herself charged with so vile and degrading an offence that contributed most of all to rob her of her natural firmness by suddenly revealing to her terrified heart the depth of the conspiracy which thus yawned like a gulf below her and not only had this sudden horror upon discovering a guilty design in what before had seemed accident and links uniting remote incidents which else seemed casual and disconnected greatly disturbed and confused her manner which confusion again had become more intense upon her own consciousness that she was confused and that her manner was greatly to her disadvantage but which was the worst effect of all because the rest could not operate against her except upon those who were present to witness it whereas this was noted down and recorded so utterly did her confusion strip her of all presence of mind that she did not consciously notice and consequently could not protest against at the moment when it was most important to do so and most natural the important circumstance of the muff this capital objection therefore though dwelt upon and improved to the utmost at the trial was looked upon by the judges as an afterthought and merely because it had not been seized upon by herself and urged in the first moments of her almost incapacitating terror on finding this amongst the circumstances of the charge against her as if an ingenuous nature in the very act of recoiling with horror from a criminal charge the most degrading and in the very instant of discovering with a perfect rapture of alarm the too plausible appearance of probability amongst the circumstances would be likely to pause and with attorney like dexterity to pick out the particular circumstance that might admit of being proved to be false when the conscience proclaimed though in despondence for the result that all the circumstances were as to the use made of them one tissue of falsehoods agnes who had made a powerful effort in speaking of the case at all found her calmness increase as she advanced and she now told me that in reality there were two discoveries which she made in the same instant and not one only which had disarmed her firmness and ordinary presence of mind one i have mentioned the fact of barratt the proprietor of the shop being the same person who had in former instances persecuted her in the street but the other was even more alarming it has been said already that it was not a pure matter of accident that she had visited this particular shop in reality that nurserymaid of whom some mention has been made above and in terms expressing the suspicion with which even then i regarded her had persuaded her into going thither by some representations which agnes had already ascertained to be altogether unwarranted other presumptions against this girls fidelity crowded dimly upon my wifes mind at the very moment of finding her eyes thus suddenly opened and it was not five minutes after her first examination and in fact five minutes after it had ceased to be of use to her that she remembered another circumstance which now when combined with the sequel told its own tale the muff had been missed some little time before the th of april search had been made for it but the particular occasion which required it having passed off this search was laid aside for the present in the expectation that it would soon reappear in some corner of the house before it was wanted then came the sunny day which made it no longer useful and would perhaps have dismissed it entirely from the recollection of all parties until it was now brought back in this memorable way the name of my wife was embroidered within upon the lining and it thus became a serviceable link to the hellish cabal against her upon reviewing the circumstances from first to last upon recalling the manner of the girl at the time when the muff was missed and upon combining the whole with her recent deception by which she had misled her poor mistress into visiting this shop agnes began to see the entire truth as to this servants wicked collusion with barratt though perhaps it might be too much to suppose her aware of the unhappy result to which her collusion tended all this she saw at a glance when it was too late for her first examination was over this girl i must add had left our house during my illness and she had afterwards a melancholy end one thing surprised me in all this barratts purpose must manifestly have been to create merely a terror in my poor wifes mind and to stop short of any legal consequences in order to profit of that panic and confusion for extorting compliances with his hideous pretensions it perplexed me therefore that he did not appear to have pursued this manifestly his primary purpose the other being merely a mask to conceal his true ends and also as he fancied a means for effecting them in this however i had soon occasion to find that i was deceived he had but without the knowledge of agnes taken such steps as were then open to him for making overtures to her with regard to the terms upon which he would agree to defeat the charge against her by failing to appear but the law had travelled too fast for him and too determinately so that by the time he supposed terror to have operated sufficiently in favor of his views it had already become unsafe to venture upon such explicit proposals as he would otherwise have tried his own safety was now at stake and would have been compromised by any open or written avowal of the motives on which he had been all along acting in fact at this time he was foiled by the agent in whom he confided but much more he had been confounded upon another point the prodigious interest manifested by the public thus it seems that whilst he meditated only a snare for my poor agnes he had prepared one for himself and finally to evade the suspicions which began to arise powerfully as to his true motives and thus to stave off his own ruin had found himself in a manner obliged to go forward and consummate the ruin of another the state of agnes as to health and bodily strength was now becoming such that i was forcibly warned whatsoever i meditated doing to do quickly there was this urgent reason for alarm once conveyed into that region of the prison in which sentences like hers were executed it became hopeless that i could communicate with her again all intercourse whatsoever and with whomsoever was then placed under the most rigorous interdict and the alarming circumstance was that this transfer was governed by no settled rules but might take place at any hour and would certainly be precipitated by the slightest violence on my part the slightest indiscretion or the slightest argument for suspicion hard indeed was the part i had to play for it was indispensable that i should appear calm and tranquil in order to disarm suspicions around me whilst continually contemplating the possibility that i myself might be summoned to extremities which i could not so much as trust myself to name or distinctly to conceive but thus stood the case the government it was understood angered by the public opposition resolute for the triumph of what they called principle had settled finally that the sentence should be carried into execution now that she that my agnes being the frail wreck that she had become could have stood one week of this sentence practically and literally enforced was a mere chimera a few hours probably of the experiment would have settled that question by dismissing her to the death she longed for but because the suffering would be short was i to stand by and to witness the degradation the pollution attempted to be fastened upon her what to know that her beautiful tresses would be shorn ignominiously a felons dress forced upon her a vile taskmaster with authority to blistered be the tongue that could go on to utter in connection with her innocent name the vile dishonors which were to settle upon her person i however and her brother had taken such resolutions that this result was one barely possible and yet i sickened yes literally i many times experienced the effect of physical sickness at contemplating our own utter childish helplessness and recollecting that every night during our seclusion from the prison the last irreversible step might be taken and in the morning we might find a solitary cell and the angel form that had illuminated it gone where we could not follow and leaving behind her the certainty that we should see her no more every night at the hour of locking up she at least manifestly had a fear that she saw us for the last time she put her arms feebly about my neck sobbed convulsively and i believe guessed but if really so did not much reprove or quarrel with the desperate purposes which i struggled with in regard to her own life one thing was quite evident that to the peace of her latter days now hurrying to their close it was indispensable that she should pass them undivided from me and possibly as was afterwards alleged when it became easy to allege any thing some relenting did take place in high quarters at this time for upon some medical reports made just now a most seasonable indulgence was granted viz that hannah was permitted to attend her mistress constantly and it was also felt as a great alleviation of the horrors belonging to this prison that candles were now allowed throughout the nights but i was warned privately that these indulgences were with no consent from the police minister and that circumstances might soon withdraw the momentary intercession by which we profited with this knowledge we could not linger in our preparations we had resolved upon accomplishing an escape for agnes at whatever risk or price the main difficulty was her own extreme feebleness which might forbid her to cooperate with us in any degree at the critical moment and the main danger was delay we pushed forward therefore in our attempts with prodigious energy and i for my part with an energy like that of insanity the first attempt we made was upon the fidelity to his trust of the chief jailer he was a coarse vulgar man brutal in his manners but with vestiges of generosity in his character though damaged a good deal by his daily associates him we invited to a meeting at a tavern in the neighborhood of the prison disguising our names as too certain to betray our objects and baiting our invitation with some hints which we had ascertained were likely to prove temptations under his immediate circumstances he had a graceless young son whom he was most anxious to wean from his dissolute connections and to steady by placing him in some office of no great responsibility upon this knowledge we framed the terms of our invitation these proved to be effectual as regarded our immediate object of obtaining an interview of persuasion the night was wet and at seven oclock the hour fixed for the interview we were seated in readiness much perplexed to know whether he would take any notice of our invitation we had waited three quarters of an hour when we heard a heavy lumbering step ascending the stair the door was thrown open to its widest extent and in the centre of the doorway stood a short stoutbuilt man and the very broadest i ever beheld staring at us with bold inquiring eyes his salutation was something to this effect what the hell do you gay fellows want with me what the blazes is this humbugging letter about my son and be hanged what do you know of my son upon this overture we ventured to request that he would come in and suffer us to shut the door which we also locked next we produced the official paper nominating his son to a small place in the customs not yielding much it was true in the way of salary but fortunately and in accordance with the known wishes of the father unburdened with any dangerous trust well i suppose i must say thank ye but what comes next what am i to do to pay the damages we informed him that for this particular little service we asked no return no no said he thatll not go down that catll not jump im not green enough for that so say away whats the damage we then explained that we had certainly a favor and a great one to ask ay ill be bound you have was his parenthesis but that for this we were prepared to offer a separate remuneration repeating that with respect to the little place procured for his son it had not cost us anything and therefore we did really and sincerely decline to receive anything in return satisfied that by this little offering we had procured the opportunity of this present interview at this point we withdrew a covering from the table upon which we had previously arranged a heap of gold coins amounting in value to twelve hundred english guineas this being the entire sum which circumstances allowed us to raise on so sudden a warning for some landed property that we both had was so settled and limited that we could not convert it into money either by way of sale loan or mortgage this sum stating to him its exact amount we offered to his acceptance upon the single condition that he would look aside or wink hard or in whatever way he chose to express it would make or suffer to be made such facilities for our liberating a female prisoner as we would point out he mused full five minutes he sat deliberating without opening his lips at length he shocked us by saying in a firm decisive tone that left us little hope of altering his resolution no gentlemen its a very fair offer and a good deal of money for a single prisoner i think i can guess at the person its a fair offer fair enough but bless your heart if i were to do the thing you want why perhaps another case might be overlooked but this prisoner no theres too much depending no they would turn me out of my place now the place is worth more to me in the long run than what you offer though you bid fair enough if it were only for my time in it but look here in case i can get my son to come into harness im expecting to get the office for him after ive retired so i cant do it but ill tell you what youve been kind to my son and therefore ill not say a word about it youre safe for me and so goodnight to you saying which and standing no further question he walked resolutely out of the room and down stairs two days we mourned over this failure and scarcely knew which way to turn for another ray of hope on the third morning we received intelligence that this very jailer had been attacked by the fever which after long desolating the city had at length made its way into the prison in a very few days the jailer was lying without hope of recovery and of necessity another person was appointed to fill his station for the present this person i had seen and i liked him less by much than the one he succeeded he had an italian appearance and he wore an air of italian subtlety and dissimulation i was surprised to find on proposing the same service to him and on the same terms that he made no objection whatever but closed instantly with my offers in prudence however i had made this change in the articles a sum equal to two hundred english guineas or onesixth part of the whole money he was to receive beforehand as a retaining fee but the remainder was to be paid only to himself or to anybody of his appointing at the very moment of our finding the prison gates thrown open to us he spoke fairly enough and seemed to meditate no treachery nor was there any obvious or known interest to serve by treachery and yet i doubted him grievously the night came it was chosen as a gala night one of two nights throughout the year in which the prisoners were allowed to celebrate a great national event and in those days of relaxed prison management the utmost license was allowed to the rejoicing this indulgence was extended to prisoners of all classes though of course under more restrictions with regard to the criminal class ten oclock came the hour at which we had been instructed to hold ourselves in readiness we had been long prepared agnes had been dressed by hannah in such a costume externally a mans hat and cloak c that from her height she might easily have passed amongst a mob of masquerading figures in the debtors halls and galleries for a young stripling pierpoint and myself were also to a certain degree disguised so far at least that we should not have been recognized at any hurried glance by those of the prison officers who had become acquainted with our persons we were all more or less disguised about the face and in that age when masks were commonly used at all hours by people of a certain rank there would have been nothing suspicious in any possible costume of the kind in a night like this if we could succeed in passing for friends of debtors i am impatient of these details and i hasten over the ground one entire hour passed away and no jailer appeared we began to despond heavily and agnes poor thing was now the most agitated of us all at length eleven struck in the harsh tones of the prisonclock a few minutes after we heard the sound of bolts drawing and bars unfastening the jailer entered drunk and much disposed to be insolent i thought it advisable to give him another bribe and he resumed the fawning insinuation of his manner he now directed us by passages which he pointed out to gain the other side of the prison there we were to mix with the debtors and their mob of friends and to await his joining us which in that crowd he could do without much suspicion he wished us to traverse the passages separately but this was impossible for it was necessary that one of us should support agnes on each side i previously persuaded her to take a small quantity of brandy which we rejoiced to see had given her at this moment of starting a most seasonable strength and animation the gloomy passages were more than usually empty for all the turnkeys were employed in a vigilant custody of the gates and examination of the parties going out so the jailer had told us and the news alarmed us we came at length to a turning which brought us in sight of a strong iron gate that divided the two main quarters of the prison for this we had not been prepared the man however opened the gate without a word spoken only putting out his hand for a fee and in my joy perhaps i gave him one imprudently large after passing this gate the distant uproar of the debtors guided us to the scene of their merriment and when there such was the tumult and the vast multitude assembled that we now hoped in good earnest to accomplish our purpose without accident just at this moment the jailer appeared in the distance he seemed looking towards us and at length one of our party could distinguish that he was beckoning to us we went forward and found him in some agitation real or counterfeit he muttered a word or two quite unintelligible about the man at the wicket told us we must wait a while and he would then see what could be done for us we were beginning to demur and to express the suspicions which now too seriously arose when he seeing or affecting to see some object of alarm pushed us with a hurried movement into a cell opening upon the part of the gallery at which we were now standing not knowing whether we really might not be retreating from some danger we could do no otherwise than comply with his signals but we were troubled at finding ourselves immediately locked in from the outside and thus apparently all our motions had only sufficed to exchange one prison for another we were now completely in the dark and found by a hard breathing from one corner of the little dormitory that it was not unoccupied having taken care to provide ourselves separately with means for striking a light we soon had more than one torch burning the brilliant light falling upon the eyes of a man who lay stretched on the iron bedstead woke him it proved to be my friend the underjailer ratcliffe but no longer holding any office in the prison he sprang up and a rapid explanation took place he had become a prisoner for debt and on this evening after having caroused through the day with some friends from the country had retired at an early hour to sleep away his intoxication i on my part thought it prudent to intrust him unreservedly with our situation and purposes not omitting our gloomy suspicions ratcliffe looked with a pity that won my love upon the poor wasted agnes he had seen her on her first entrance into the prison had spoken to her and therefore knew from what she had fallen to what even then he had felt for her how much more at this time when he beheld by the fierce light of the torches her wo worn features who was it he asked eagerly you made the bargain with manasseh the same then i can tell you this not a greater villain walks the earth he is a jew from portugal he has betrayed many a man and will many another unless he gets his own neck stretched which might happen if i told all i know but what was it probable that this man meditated or how could it profit him to betray us thats more than i can tell he wants to get your money and that he doesnt know how to bring about without doing his part but thats what he never will do take my word for it that would cut him out of all chance for the headjailers place he mused a little and then told us that he could himself put us outside the prison walls and would do it without fee or reward but we must be quiet or that devil will bethink him of me ill wager something he thought that i was out merrymaking like the rest and if he should chance to light upon the truth hell be back in no time ratcliffe then removed an old firegrate at the back of which was an iron plate that swung round into a similar fireplace in the contiguous cell from that by a removal of a few slight obstacles we passed by a long avenue into the chapel then he left us whilst he went out alone to reconnoitre his ground agnes was now in so pitiable a condition of weakness as we stood on the very brink of our final effort that we placed her in a pew where she could rest as upon a sofa previously we had stood upon graves and with monuments more or less conspicuous all around us some raised by friends to the memory of friends some by subscriptions in the prison some by children who had risen into prosperity to the memory of a father brother or other relative who had died in captivity i was grieved that these sad memorials should meet the eye of my wife at this moment of awe and terrific anxiety pierpoint and i were well armed and all of us determined not to suffer a recapture now that we were free of the crowds that made resistance hopeless this agnes easily perceived and that by suggesting a bloody arbitration did not lessen her agitation i hoped therefore that by placing her in the pew i might at least liberate her for the moment from the besetting memorials of sorrow and calamity but as if in the very teeth of my purpose one of the large columns which supported the roof of the chapel had its basis and lower part of the shaft in this very pew on the side of it and just facing her as she lay reclining on the cushions appeared a mural tablet with a basrelief in white marble to the memory of two children twins who had lived and died at the same time and in this prison children who had never breathed another air than that of captivity their parents having passed many years within these walls under confinement for debt the sculptures were not remarkable being a trite but not the less affecting representation of angels descending to receive the infants but the hallowed words of the inscription distinct and legible suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god met her eye and by the thoughts they awakened made me fear that she would become unequal to the exertions which yet awaited her at this moment ratcliffe returned and informed us that all was right and that from the ruinous state of all the buildings which surrounded the chapel no difficulty remained for us who were in fact beyond the strong part of the prison excepting at a single door which we should be obliged to break down but had we any means arranged for pursuing our flight and turning this escape to account when out of confinement all that i assured him was provided for long ago we proceeded and soon reached the door we had one crowbar amongst us but beyond that had no better weapons than the loose stones found about some newmade graves in the chapel ratcliffe and pierpoint both powerful men applied themselves by turns to the door whilst hannah and i supported agnes the door did not yield being of enormous strength but the wall did and a large mass of stonework fell outwards twisting the door aside so that by afterwards working with our hands we removed stones many enough to admit of our egress unfortunately this aperture was high above the ground and it was necessary to climb over a huge heap of loose rubbish in order to profit by it my brotherinlaw passed first in order to receive my wife quite helpless at surmounting the obstacle by her own efforts out of my arms he had gone through the opening and turning round so as to face me he naturally could see something that i did not see look behind he called out rapidly i did so and saw the murderous villain manasseh with his arm uplifted and in the act of cutting at my wife nearly insensible as she was with a cutlass the blow was not for me but for her as the fugitive prisoner and the law would have borne him out in the act i saw i comprehended the whole i groped as far as i could without letting my wife drop for my pistols but all that i could do would have been unavailing and too late she would have been murdered in my arms but and that was what none of us saw neither i nor pierpoint nor the hound manasseh one person stood back in the shade one person had seen but had not uttered a word on seeing manasseh advancing through the shades one person only had forecast the exact succession of all that was coming me she saw embarrassed and my hands preoccupied pierpoint and ratcliffe useless by position and the gleam of the dogs eye directed her to his aim the crowbar was leaning against the shattered wall this she had silently seized one blow knocked up the sword a second laid the villain prostrate at this moment appeared another of the turnkeys advancing from the rear for the noise of our assault upon the door had drawn attention in the interior of the prison from which however no great number of assistants could on this dangerous night venture to absent themselves what followed for the next few minutes hurried onwards incident crowding upon incident like the motions of a dream manasseh lying on the ground yelled out the bell the bell to him who followed the man understood and made for the belfrydoor attached to the chapel upon which pierpoint drew a pistol and sent the bullet whizzing past his ear so truly that fear made the man obedient to the counterorders of pierpoint for the moment he paused and awaited the issue in a moment had all cleared the wall traversed the waste ground beyond it lifted agnes over the low railing shaken hands with our benefactor ratcliffe and pushed onwards as rapidly as we were able to the little dark lane a quarter of a mile distant where had stood waiting for the last two hours a chaiseandfour ratcliffe before my story closes i will pursue to the last of my acquaintance with him according to the just claims of his services he had privately whispered to me as we went along that he could speak to the innocence of that lady pointing to my wife better than anybody he was the person whom as then holding an office in the prison barratt had attempted to employ as agent in conveying any messages that he found it safe to send obscurely hinting the terms on which he would desist from prosecution ratcliffe had at first undertaken the negotiation from mere levity of character but when the story and the public interest spread and after himself becoming deeply struck by the prisoners affliction beauty and reputed innocence he had pursued it only as a means of entrapping barratt into such written communications and such private confessions of the truth as might have served agnes effectually he wanted the art however to disguise his purposes barratt came to suspect him violently and feared his evidence so far even for those imperfect and merely oral overtures which he had really sent through ratcliffe that on the very day of the trial he as was believed though by another nominally contrived that ratcliffe should be arrested for debt and after harassing him with intricate forms of business had finally caused him to be conveyed to prison ratcliffe was thus involved in his own troubles at the time and afterwards supposed that without written documents to support his evidence he could not be of much service to the reestablisment of my wifes reputation six months after his services in the nightescape from the prison i saw him and pressed him to take the money so justly forfeited to him by manassehs perfidy he would however be persuaded to take no more than paid his debts a second and a third time his debts were paid by myself and pierpoint but the same habits of intemperance and dissolute pleasure which led him into these debts finally ruined his constitution and he died though otherwise of a fine generous manly nature a martyr to dissipation at the early age of twentynine with respect to his prison confinement it was so frequently recurring in his life and was alleviated by so many indulgences that he scarcely viewed it as a hardship having once been an officer of the prison and having thus formed connections with the whole official establishment and done services to many of them and being of so convivial a turn he was even as a prisoner treated with distinction and considered as a privileged son of the house it was just striking twelve oclock as we entered the lane where the carriage was drawn up rain about the profoundest i had ever witnessed was falling though near to midsummer the night had been unusually dark to begin with and from the increasing rain had become much more so we could see nothing and at first we feared that some mistake had occurred as to the station of the carriage in which case we might have sought for it vainly through the intricate labyrinth of the streets in that quarter i first descried it by the light of a torch reflected powerfully from the large eyes of the leaders all was ready horsekeepers were at the horses heads the postilions were mounted each door had the steps let down agnes was lifted in hannah and i followed pierpoint mounted his horse and at the word oh how strange a word alls right the horses sprang off like leopards a manner illsuited to the slippery pavement of a narrow street at that moment but we valued it little indeed we heard the prisonbell ringing out loud and clear thrice within the first three minutes we had to pull up suddenly on the brink of formidable accidents from the dangerous speed we maintained and which nevertheless the driver had orders to maintain as essential to our plan all the stoppages and hinderances of every kind along the road had been anticipated previously and met by contrivance of one kind or other and pierpoint was constantly a little ahead of us to attend to anything that had been neglected the consequence of these arrangements was that no person along the road could possibly have assisted to trace us by any thing in our appearance for we passed all objects at too flying a pace and through darkness too profound to allow of any one feature in our equipage being distinctly noticed ten miles out of town a space which we traversed in fortyfour minutes a second relay of horses was ready but we carried on the same postilions throughout six miles ahead of this distance we had a second relay and with this set of horses after pushing two miles further along the road we crossed by a miserable lane five miles long scarcely even a bridge road into another of the great roads from the capital and by thus crossing the country we came back upon the city at a point far distant from that at which we left it we had performed a distance of fortytwo miles in three hours and lost a fourth hour upon the wretched five miles of crossroad it was therefore four oclock and broad daylight when we drew near the suburbs of the city but a most happy accident now favored us a fog the most intense now prevailed nobody could see an object six feet distant we alighted in an uninhabited newbuilt street plunged into the fog thus confounding our traces to any observer we then stepped into a hackneycoach which had been stationed at a little distance thence according to our plan we drove to a miserable quarter of the town whither the poor only and the wretched resorted mounted a gloomy dirty staircase and befriended by the fog still growing thicker and thicker and by the early hour of the morning reached a house previously hired which if shocking to the eye and the imagination from its squalid appearance and its gloom still was a home a sanctuary an asylum from treachery from captivity from persecution here pierpoint for the present quitted us and once more agnes hannah and i the shattered members of a shattered family were thus gathered together in a house of our own yes once again daughter of the hills thou sleptst as heretofore in my encircling arms but not again in that peace which crowned thy innocence in those days and should have crowned it now through the whole of our flying journey in some circumstances at its outset strikingly recalling to me that blessed one which followed our marriage agnes slept away unconscious of our movements she slept through all that day and the following night and i watched over her with as much jealousy of all that might disturb her as a mother watches over her newborn baby for i hoped i fancied that a long long rest a rest a halcyon calm a deep deep sabbath of security might prove healing and medicinal i thought wrong her breathing became more disturbed and sleep was now haunted by dreams all of us indeed were agitated by dreams the past pursued me and the present for high rewards had been advertised by government to those who traced us and though for the moment we were secure because we never went abroad and could not have been naturally sought in such a neighborhood still that very circumstance would eventually operate against us at length every night i dreamed of our insecurity under a thousand forms but more often by far my dreams turned upon our wrongs wrath moved me rather than fear every night for the greater part i lay painfully and elaborately involved by deep sense of wrong in long orations which i pleaded before unjust tribunals footnote from a ms poem of a great living poet and for poor agnes her also did the remembrance of mighty wrongs occupy through vast worlds of sleep in the same way though colored by that tenderness which belonged to her gentler nature one dream in particular a dream of sublime circumstances she repeated to me so movingly with a pathos so thrilling that by some profound sympathy it transplanted itself to my own sleep settled itself there and is to this hour a part of the fixed dream scenery which revolves at intervals through my sleeping life this it was she would hear a trumpet sound though perhaps as having been the prelude to the solemn entry of the judges at a town which she had once visited in her childhood other preparations would follow and at last all the solemnities of a great trial would shape themselves and fall into settled images the audience was assembled the judges were arrayed the court was set the prisoner was cited inquest was made witnesses were called and false witnesses came tumultuously to the bar then again a trumpet was heard but the trumpet of a mighty archangel and then would roll away thick clouds and vapors again the audience but another audience was assembled again the tribunal was established again the court was set but a tribunal and a court how different to her that had been composed of men seeking indeed for truth but themselves erring and fallible creatures the witnesses had been full of lies the judges of darkness but here was a court composed of heavenly witnesses here was a righteous tribunal and then at last a judge that could not be deceived the judge smote with his eye a person who sought to hide himself in the crowd the guilty man stepped forward the poor prisoner was called up to the presence of the mighty judge suddenly the voice of a little child was heard ascending before her then the trumpet sounded once again and then there were new heavens and a new earth and her tears and her agitation for she had seen her little francis awoke the poor palpitating dreamer two months passed on nothing could possibly be done materially to raise the standard of those wretched accommodations which the house offered the dilapidated walls the mouldering plaster the blackened mantelpieces the stained and polluted wainscots what could be attempted to hide or to repair all this by those who durst not venture abroad yet whatever could be done hannah did and in the mean time very soon indeed my agnes ceased to see or to be offended by these objects first of all her sight went from her and nothing which appealed to that sense could ever more offend her it is to me the one only consolation i have that my presence and that of hannah with such innocent frauds as we concerted together made her latter days pass in a heavenly calm by persuading her that our security was absolute and that all search after us had ceased under a belief on the part of government that we had gained the shelter of a foreign land all this was a delusion but it was a delusion blessed be heaven which lasted exactly as long as her life and was just commensurate with its necessity i hurry over the final circumstances there was fortunately now even for me no fear that the hand of any policeman or emissary of justice could effectually disturb the latter days of my wife for besides pistols always lying loaded in an inner room there happened to be a long narrow passage on entering the house which by means of a blunderbuss i could have swept effectually and cleared many times over and i know what to do in a last extremity just two months it was to a day since we had entered the house and it happened that the medical attendant upon agnes who awakened no suspicion by his visits had prescribed some opiate or anodyne which had not come being dark early for it was now september i had ventured out to fetch it in this i conceived there could be no danger on my return i saw a man examining the fastenings of the door he made no opposition to my entrance nor seemed much to observe it but i was disturbed two hours after both hannah and i heard a noise about the door and voices in low conversation it is remarkable that agnes heard this also so quick had grown her hearing she was agitated but was easily calmed and at ten oclock we were all in bed the hand of agnes was in mine so only she felt herself in security she had been restless for an hour and talking at intervals in sleep once she certainly wakened for she pressed her lips to mine two minutes after i heard something in her breathing which did not please me i rose hastily brought a light raised her head two long long gentle sighs that scarcely moved the lips were all that could be perceived at that moment at that very moment hannah called out to me that the door was surrounded open it i said six men entered agnes it was they sought i pointed to the bed they advanced gazed and walked away in silence after this i wandered about caring little for life or its affairs and roused only at times to think of vengeance upon all who had contributed to lay waste my happiness in this pursuit however i was confounded as much by my own thoughts as by the difficulties of accomplishing my purpose to assault and murder either of the two principal agents in this tragedy what would it be what other effect could it have than to invest them with the character of injured and suffering people and thus to attract a pity or a forgiveness at least to their persons which never otherwise could have illustrated their deaths i remembered indeed the words of a seacaptain who had taken such vengeance as had offered at the moment upon his bitter enemy and persecutor a young passenger on board his ship who had informed against him at the customhouse on his arrival in port and had thus effected the confiscation of his ship and the ruin of the captains family the vengeance and it was all that circumstances allowed consisted in coming behind the young man clandestinely and pushing him into the deep waters of the dock when being unable to swim he perished by drowning and the like said the captain when musing on his trivial vengeance and the like happens to many an honest sailor yes thought i the captain was right the momentary shock of a pistol bullet what is it perhaps it may save the wretch after all from the pangs of some lingering disease and then again i shall have the character of a murderer if known to have shot him he will with many people have no such character but at worst the character of a man too harsh they will say and possibly mistaken in protecting his property and then if not known as the man who shot him where is the shadow even of vengeance strange it seemed to me and passing strange that i should be the person to urge arguments in behalf of letting this man escape for at one time i had as certainly as inexorably doomed him as ever i took any resolution in my life but the fact is and i began to see it upon closer view it is not easy by any means to take an adequate vengeance for any injury beyond a very trivial standard and that with common magnanimity one does not care to avenge whilst i was in this mood of mind still debating with myself whether i should or should not contaminate my hands with the blood of this monster and still unable to shut my eyes upon one fact viz that my buried agnes could above all things have urged me to abstain from such acts of violence too evidently useless listlessly and scarcely knowing what i was in quest of i strayed by accident into a church where a venerable old man was preaching at the very moment i entered he was either delivering as a text or repeating in the course of his sermon these words vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord by some accident also he fixed his eyes upon me at the moment and this concurrence with the subject then occupying my thoughts so much impressed me that i determined very seriously to review my halfformed purposes of revenge and well it was that i did so for in that same week an explosion of popular fury brought the life of this wretched barratt to a shocking termination pretty much resembling the fate of the de witts in holland and the consequences to me were such and so full of all the consolation and indemnification which this world could give me that i have often shuddered since then at the narrow escape i had had from myself intercepting this remarkable retribution the villain had again been attempting to play off the same hellish scheme with a beautiful young rustic which had succeeded in the case of my illfated agnes but the young woman in this instance had a high and in fact termagant spirit rustic as she was she had been warned of the character of the man everybody in fact was familiar with the recent tragedy either her lover or her brother happened to be waiting for her outside the window he saw in part the very tricks in the act of perpetration by which some article or other meant to be claimed as stolen property was conveyed into a parcel she had incautiously laid down he heard the charge against her made by barratt and seconded by his creatures heard her appeal sprang to her aid dragged the ruffian into the street when in less time than the tale could be told and before the police though tolerably alert could effectually interpose for his rescue the mob had so used or so abused the opportunity they had long wished for that he remained the mere disfigured wreck of what had once been a man rather than a creature with any resemblance to humanity i myself heard the uproar at a distance and the shouts and yells of savage exultation they were sounds i shall never forget though i did not at that time know them for what they were or understood their meaning the result however to me was something beyond this and worthy to have been purchased with my hearts blood barratt still breathed spite of his mutilations he could speak he was rational one only thing he demanded it was that his dying confession might be taken two magistrates and a clergyman attended he gave a list of those whom he had trepanned and had failed to trepan by his artifices and threats into the sacrifice of their honor he expired before the record was closed but not before he had placed my wifes name in the latter list as the one whose injuries in his dying moments most appalled him this confession on the following day went into the hands of the hostile minister and my revenge was perfect the spanish nun why is it that adventures are so generally repulsive to people of meditative minds it is for the same reason that any other want of law that any other anarchy is repulsive floating passively from action to action as helplessly as a withered leaf surrendered to the breath of winds the human spirit out of which comes all grandeur of human motions is exhibited in mere adventures as either entirely laid asleep or as acting only by lower organs that regulate the means whilst the ends are derived from alien sources and are imperiously predetermined it is a case of exception however when even amongst such adventures the agent reacts upon his own difficulties and necessities by a temper of extraordinary courage and a mind of premature decision further strength arises to such an exception if the very moulding accidents of the life if the very external coercions are themselves unusually romantic they may thus gain a separate interest of their own and lastly the whole is locked into validity of interest even for the psychological philosopher by complete authentication of its truth in the case now brought before him the reader must not doubt for no memoir exists or personal biography that is so trebly authenticated by proofs and attestations direct and collateral from the archives of the royal marine at seville from the autobiography or the heroine from contemporary chronicles and from several official sources scattered in and out of spain some of them ecclesiastical the amplest proofs have been drawn and may yet be greatly extended of the extraordinary events here recorded m de ferrer a spaniard of much research and originally incredulous as to the facts published about seventeen years ago a selection from the leading documents accompanied by his palinode as to their accuracy his materials have been since used for the basis of more than one narrative not inaccurate in french german and spanish journals of high authority it is seldom the case that french writers err by prolixity they have done so in this case the present narrative which contains no sentence derived from any foreign one has the great advantage of close compression my own pages after equating the size being as to of the shortest continental form in the mode of narration i am vain enough to flatter myself that the reader will find little reason to hesitate between us mine at least weary nobody which is more than can be always said for the continental versions on a night in the year but which night is a secret liable to answers a spanish son of somebody footnote ie hidalgo in the fortified town of st sebastian received the disagreeable intelligence from a nurse that his wife had just presented him with a daughter no present that the poor misjudging lady could possibly have made him was so entirely useless for any purpose of his he had three daughters already which happened to be more by than his reckoning assumed as a reasonable allowance of daughters a supernumerary son might have been stowed away but daughters in excess were the very nuisance of spain he did therefore what in such cases every proud and lazy spanish gentleman was apt to do he wrapped the new little daughter odious to his paternal eyes in a pocket handkerchief and then wrapping up his own throat with a good deal more care off he bolted to the neighboring convent of st sebastian not merely of that city but also amongst several convents the one dedicated to that saint it is well that in this quarrelsome world we quarrel furiously about tastes since agreeing too closely about the objects to be liked and appropriated would breed much more fighting than is bred by disagreeing that little human tadpole which the old toad of a father would not suffer to stay ten minutes in his house proved as welcome at the nunnery of st sebastian as she was odious elsewhere the superior of the convent was aunt by the mothers side to the newborn stranger she therefore kissed and blessed the little lady the poor nuns who were never to have any babies of their own and were languishing for some amusement perfectly doated on this prospect of a wee pet the superior thanked the hidalgo for his very splendid present the nuns thanked him each and all until the old crocodile actually began to cry and whimper sentimentally at what he now perceived to be excess of munificence in himself munificence indeed he remarked was his foible next after parental tenderness what a luxury it is sometimes to a cynic that there go two words to a bargain in the convent of st sebastian all was gratitude gratitude as aforesaid to the hidalgo from all the convent for his present until at last the hidalgo began to express gratitude to them for their gratitude to him then came a rolling fire of thanks to st sebastian from the superior for sending a future saint from the nuns for sending such a love of a plaything and finally from papa for sending such substantial board and wellbolted lodgings from which said the malicious old fellow my pussy will never find her way out to a thorny and dangerous world wont she i suspect son of somebody that the next time you see pussy which may happen to be also the last will not be in a convent of any kind at present whilst this general rendering of thanks was going on one person only took no part in them that person was pussy whose little figure lay quietly stretched out in the arms of a smiling young nun with eyes nearly shut yet peering a little at the candles pussy said nothing its of no great use to say much when all the world is against you but if st sebastian had enabled her to speak out the whole truth pussy would have said so mr hidalgo you have been engaging lodgings for me lodgings for life wait a little well try that question when my claws are grown a little longer disappointment therefore was gathering ahead but for the present there was nothing of the kind that noble old crocodile papa was not in the least disappointed as regarded his expectation of having no anxiety to waste and no money to pay on account of his youngest daughter he insisted on his right to forget her and in a week had forgotten her never to think of her again but once the lady superior as regarded her demands was equally content and through a course of several years for as often as she asked pussy if she would be a saint pussy replied that she would if saints were allowed plenty of sweetmeats but least of all were the nuns disappointed everything that they had fancied possible in a human plaything fell short of what pussy realized in racketing racing and eternal plots against the peace of the elder nuns no fox ever kept a henroost in such alarm as pussy kept the dormitory of the senior sisters whilst the younger ladies were run off their legs by the eternal wiles and had their chapel gravity discomposed even in chapel by the eternal antics of this privileged little kitten the kitten had long ago received a baptismal name which was kitty this is catharine or kate or hispanice catalina it was a good name as it recalled her original name of pussy and by the way she had also an ancient and honorable surname viz de erauso which is to this day a name rooted in biscay her father the hidalgo was a military officer in the spanish service and had little care whether his kitten should turn out a wolf or a lamb having made over the fee simple of his own interest in the little kate to st sebastian to have and to hold so long as kate should keep her hold of this present life kate had no apparent intention to let slip that hold for she was blooming as a rosebush in june tall and strong as a young cedar yet notwithstanding this robust health and the strength of the convent walls the time was drawing near when st sebastians lease in kate must in legal phrase determine and any chateaux en espagne that the saint might have built on the cloisteral fidelity of his pet catalina must suddenly give way in one hour like many other vanities in our own days of spanish bonds and promises after reaching her tenth year catalina became thoughtful and not very docile at times she was even headstrong and turbulent so that the gentle sisterhood of st sebastian who had no other pet or plaything in the world began to weep in secret fearing that they might have been rearing by mistake some future tigress for as to infancy that you know is playful and innocent even in the cubs of a tigress but there the ladies were going too far catalina was impetuous and aspiring but not cruel she was gentle if people would let her be so but woe to those that took liberties with her a female servant of the convent in some authority one day in passing up the aisle to matins wilfully gave kate a push and in return kate who never left her debts in arrear gave the servant for a keepsake a look which that servant carried with her in fearful remembrance to her grave it seemed as if kate had tropic blood in her veins that continually called her away to the tropics it was all the fault of that blue rejoicing sky of those purple biscayan mountains of that tumultuous ocean which she beheld daily from the nunnery gardens or if only half of it was their fault the other half lay in those golden tales streaming upwards even into the sanctuaries of convents like morning mists touched by earliest sunlight of kingdoms overshadowing a new world which had been founded by her kinsmen with the simple aid of a horse and a lance the reader is to remember that this is no romance or at least no fiction that he is reading and it is proper to remind the reader of real romances in ariosto or our own spenser that such martial ladies as the marfisa or bradamant of the first and britomart of the other were really not the improbabilities that modern society imagines many a stout man as you will soon see found that kate with a sabre in hand and well mounted was but too serious a fact the day is come the evening is come when our poor kate that had for fifteen years been so tenderly rocked in the arms of st sebastian and his daughters and that henceforth shall hardly find a breathing space between eternal storms must see her peaceful cell must see the holy chapel for the last time it was at vespers it was during the chanting of the vesper service that she finally read the secret signal for her departure which long she had been looking for it happened that her aunt the lady principal had forgotten her breviary as this was in a private scrutoire she did not choose to send a servant for it but gave the key to her niece the niece on opening the scrutoire saw with that rapidity of eyeglance for the one thing needed in any great emergency which ever attended her through life that now was the moment for an attempt which if neglected might never return there lay the total keys in one massive trousseau of that fortress impregnable even to armies from without saint sebastian do you see what your pet is going to do and do it she will as sure as your name is st sebastian kate went back to her aunt with the breviary and the key but taking good care to leave that awful door on whose hinge revolved her whole life unlocked delivering the two articles to the superior she complained of a headache ah kate what did you know of headaches except now and then afterwards from a stray bullet or so upon which her aunt kissing her forehead dismissed her to bed now then through three fourths of an hour kate will have free elbowroom for unanchoring her boat for unshipping her oars and for pulling ahead right out of st sebastians cove into the main ocean of life catalina the reader is to understand does not belong to the class of persons in whom chiefly i pretend to an interest but everywhere one loves energy and indomitable courage i for my part admire not by preference anything that points to this world it is the child of reverie and profounder sensibility who turns away from the world as hateful and insufficient that engages my interest whereas catalina was the very model of the class fitted for facing this world and who express their love to it by fighting with it and kicking it from year to year but always what is best in its kind one admires even though the kind be disagreeable kates advantages for her role in this life lay in four things viz in a wellbuilt person and a particularly strong wrist d in a heart that nothing could appal d in a sagacious head never drawn aside from the hoc age from the instant question of life by any weakness of imagination th in a tolerably thick skin not literally for she was fair and blooming and decidedly handsome having such a skin as became a young woman of family in northernmost spain but her sensibilities were obtuse as regarded some modes of delicacy some modes of equity some modes of the worlds opinion and all modes whatever of personal hardship lay a stress on that word some for as to delicacy she never lost sight of the kind which peculiarly concerns her sex long afterwards she told the pope himself when confessing without disguise her sad and infinite wanderings to the paternal old man and i feel convinced of her veracity that in this respect even then at middle age she was as pure as is a child and as to equity it was only that she substituted the equity of camps for the polished but often more iniquitous equity of courts and towns as to the third item the worlds opinion i dont know that you need lay a stress on some for generally speaking all that the world did said or thought was alike contemptible in her eyes in which perhaps she was not so very far wrong i must add though at the cost of interrupting the story by two or three more sentences that catalina had also a fifth advantage which sounds humbly but is really of use in a world where even to fold and seal a letter adroitly is not the least of accomplishments she was a handy girl she could turn her hand to anything of which i will give you two memorable instances was there ever a girl in this world but herself that cheated and snapped her fingers at that awful inquisition which brooded over the convents of spain that did this without collusion from outside trusting to nobody but to herself and what to one needle two hanks of thread and a very inferior pair of scissors for that the scissors were bad though kate does not say so in her memoirs i knew by an a priori argument viz because all scissors were bad in the year now say all decent logicians from a universal to a particular valet consequentia all scissors were bad ergo some scissors were bad the second instance of her handiness will surprise you even more she once stood upon a scaffold under sentence of death but understand on the evidence of false witnesses jack ketch was absolutely tying the knot under her ear and the shameful man of ropes fumbled so deplorably that kate who by much nautical experience had learned from another sort of jack how a knot should be tied in this world lost all patience with the contemptible artist told him she was ashamed of him took the rope out of his hand and tied the knot irreproachably herself the crowd saluted her with a festal roll long and loud of vivas and this word viva of good augury but stop let me not anticipate from this sketch of catalinas character the reader is prepared to understand the decision of her present proceeding she had no time to lose the twilight favored her but she must get under hiding before pursuit commenced consequently she lost not one of her fortyfive minutes in picking and choosing no shillyshally in kate she saw with the eyeball of an eagle what was indispensable some little money perhaps to pay the first tollbar of life so out of four shillings in auntys purse she took one you cant say that was exorbitant which of us wouldnt subscribe a shilling for poor katy to put into the first trouser pockets that ever she will wear i remember even yet as a personal experience that when first arrayed at four years old in nankeen trousers though still so far retaining hermaphrodite relations of dress as to wear a petticoat above my trousers all my female friends because they pitied me as one that had suffered from years of ague filled my pockets with halfcrowns of which i can render no account at this day but what were my poor pretensions by the side of kates kate was a fine blooming girl of fifteen with no touch of ague and before the next sun rises kate shall draw on her first trousers and made by her own hand and that she may do so of all the valuables in auntys repository she takes nothing beside the shilling quantum sufficit of thread one stout needle and as i told you before if you would please to remember things one bad pair of scissors now she was ready ready to cast off st sebastians towingrope ready to cut and run for port anywhere the finishing touch of her preparations was to pick out the proper keys even there she showed the same discretion she did do no gratuitous mischief she did not take the winecellar key which would have irritated the good father confessor she took those keys only that belonged to her if ever keys did for they were the keys that locked her out from her natural birthright of liberty show me says the romish casuist her right in law to let herself out of that nunnery show us we reply your right to lock her in right or wrong however in strict casuistry kate was resolved to let herself out and did so and for fear any man should creep in whilst vespers lasted and steal the kitchen grate she locked her old friends in then she sought a shelter the air was not cold she hurried into a chestnut wood and upon withered leaves slept till dawn spanish diet and youth leaves the digestion undisordered and the slumbers light when the lark rose up rose catalina no time to lose for she was still in the dress of a nun and liable to be arrested by any man in spain with her armed finger aye by the way i forgot the thimble but kate did not she set to work upon her amplyembroidered petticoat she turned it wrong side out and with the magic that only female hands possess she had soon sketched and finished a dashing pair of wellington trousers all other changes were made according to the materials she possessed and quite sufficiently to disguise the two main perils her sex and her monastic dedication what was she to do next speaking of wellington trousers would remind us but could hardly remind her of vittoria where she dimly had heard of some maternal relative to vittoria therefore she bent her course and like the duke of wellington but arriving more than two centuries earlier though he too is an early riser she gained a great victory at that place she had made a two days march baggage far in the rear and no provisions but wild berries she depended for anything better as lightheartedly as the duke upon attacking sword in hand storming her dear friends entrenchments and effecting a lodgment in his breakfastroom should he happen to have one this amiable relative an elderly man had but one foible or perhaps one virtue in this world but that he had in perfection it was pedantry on that hint catalina spoke she knew by heart from the services of the convent a few latin phrases latin oh but that was charming and in one so young the grave don owned the soft impeachment relented at once and clasped the hopeful young gentleman in the wellington trousers to his uncular and rather angular breast in this house the yarn of life was of a mingled quality the table was good but that was exactly what kate cared little about the amusement was of the worst kind it consisted chiefly in conjugating latin verbs especially such as were obstinately irregular to show him a withered frostbitten verb that wanted its preterite wanted its supines wanted in fact everything in this world fruits or blossoms that make a verb desirable was to earn the dons gratitude for life all day long he was marching and countermarching his favorite brigades of verbs verbs frequentative verbs inceptive verbs desiderative horse foot and artillery changing front advancing from the rear throwing out skirmishing parties until kate not given to faint must have thought of such a resource as once in her life she had thought so seasonably of a vesper headache this was really worse than st sebastians it reminds one of a french gayety in thiebault or some such author who describes a rustic party under equal despair as employing themselves in conjugating the verb sennuyer je mennuie tu tennuies il sennuit nous nous ennuyons c thence to the imperfect je mennuyois tu tennuyois c thence to the imperative quil sennuye c and so on through the whole melancholy conjugation now you know when the time comes that nous nous ennuyons the best course is to part kate saw that and she walked off from the dons of whose amorous passion for defective verbs one would have wished to know the catastrophe and took from his mantelpiece rather move silver than she had levied on her aunt but the don also was a relative and really he owed her a small cheque on his banker for turning out on his fielddays a man if he is a kinsman has no right to bore one gratis from vittoria kate was guided by a carrier to valladolid luckily as it seemed at first but it made little difference in the end here at valladolid were the king and his court consequently there was plenty of regiments and plenty of regimental bands attracted by one of these catalina was quietly listening to the music when some street ruffians in derision of the gay colors and the form of her forestmade costume rascals one would like to have seen what sort of trousers they would have made with no better scissors began to pelt her with stones ah my friends of the genus blackguard you little know who it is that you are selecting for experiments this is the one creature of fifteen in all spain be the other male or female whom nature and temper and provocation have qualified for taking the conceit out of you this she very soon did laying open a head or two with a sharp stone and letting out rather too little than too much of bad valladolid blood but mark the constant villany of this world certain alguazils very like some other alguazils that i know nearer home having stood by quietly to see the friendless stranger insulted and assaulted now felt it their duty to apprehend the poor nun for murderous violence and had there been such a thing as a treadmill in valladolid kate was booked for a place on it without further inquiry luckily injustice does not always prosper a gallant young cavalier who had witnessed from his windows the whole affair had seen the provocation and admired catalinas behavior equally patient at first and bold at last hastened into the street pursued the officers forced them to release their prisoner upon stating the circumstances of the case and instantly offered catalina a situation amongst his retinue he was a man of birth and fortune and the place offered that of an honorary page not being at all degrading even to a daughter of somebody was cheerfully accepted here catalina spent a happy month she was now splendidly dressed in dark blue velvet by a tailor that did not work within the gloom of a chestnut forest she and the young cavalier don francisco de cardenas were mutually pleased and had mutual confidence all went well when one evening but luckily not until the sun had been set so long as to make all things indistinct who should march into the antechamber of the cavalier but that sublime of crocodiles papa that we lost sight of fifteen years ago and shall never see again after this night he had his crocodile tears all ready for use in working order like a good industrious fire engine it was absolutely to catalina herself that he advanced whom for many reasons he could not be supposed to recognise lapse of years male attire twilight were all against him still she might have the family countenance and kate thought he looked with a suspicious scrutiny into her face as he inquired for the young don to avert her own face to announce him to don francisco to wish him on the shores of that ancient river for crocodiles the nile furnished but one moments work to the active catalina she lingered however as her place entitled her to do at the door of the audience chamber she guessed already but in a moment she heard from papas lips what was the nature of his errand his daughter catharine he informed the don had eloped from the convent of st sebastian a place rich in delight then he laid open the unparalleled ingratitude of such a step oh the unseen treasure that had been spent upon that girl oh the untold sums of money that he had sunk in that unhappy speculation the nights of sleeplessness suffered during her infancy the fifteen years of solicitude thrown away in schemes for her improvement it would have moved the heart of a stone the hidalgo wept copiously at his own pathos and to such a height of grandeur had he carried his spanish sense of the sublime that he disdained to mention the pocket handkerchief which he had left at st sebastians fifteen years ago by way of envelope for pussy and which to the best of pussys knowledge was the one sole memorandum of papa ever heard of at st sebastians pussy however saw no use in revising and correcting the text of papas remembrances she showed her usual prudence and her usual incomparable decision it did not appear as yet that she would be reclaimed or was at all suspected for the fugitive by her father for it is an instance of that singular fatality which pursued catalina through life that to her own astonishment as she now collected from her fathers conference nobody had traced her to valladolid nor had her fathers visit any connection with suspicious travelling in that direction the case was quite different strangely enough her street row had thrown her into the one sole household in all spain that had an official connection with st sebastians that convent had been founded by the young cavaliers family and according to the usage of spain the young man as present representative of his house was the responsible protector of the establishment it was not to the don as harborer of his daughter but to the don as ex officio visitor of the convent that the hidalgo was appealing probably kate might have staid safely some time longer yet again this would but have multiplied the clues for tracing her and finally she would too probably have been discovered after which with all his youthful generosity the poor don could not have protected her too terrific was the vengeance that awaited an abettor of any fugitive nun but above all if such a crime were perpetrated by an official mandatory of the church yet again so far it was the more hazardous course to abscond that it almost revealed her to the young don as the missing daughter still if it really had that effect nothing at present obliged him to pursue her as might have been the case a few weeks later kate argued i dare say rightly as she always did her prudence whispered eternally that safety there was none for her until she had laid the atlantic between herself and st sebastians life was to be for her a bay of biscay and it was odds but she had first embarked upon this billowy life from the literal bay of biscay chance ordered otherwise or as a frenchman says with eloquent ingenuity in connection with this story chance is but the pseudonyme of god for those particular cases which he does not subscribe openly with his own sign manual she crept up stairs to her bedroom simple are the travelling preparations of those that possessing nothing have no imperials to pack she had juvenals qualification for carolling gaily through a forest full of robbers for she had nothing to lose but a change of linen that rode easily enough under her left arm leaving the right free for answering any questions of impertinent customers as she crept down stairs she heard the crocodile still weeping forth his sorrows to the pensive ear of twilight and to the sympathetic don francisco now it would not have been filial or ladylike for kate to do what i am going to suggest but what a pity that some gay brother page had not been there to turn aside into the room armed with a roasted potato and taking a sportsmans aim to have lodged it in the crocodiles abominable mouth yet what an anachronism there were no roasted potatoes in spain at that date and very few in england but anger drives a man to say anything catalina had seen her last of friends and enemies in valladolid short was her time there but she had improved it so far as to make a few of both there was an eye or two in valladolid that would have glared with malice upon her had she been seen by all eyes in that city as she tripped through the streets in the dusk and eyes there were that would have softened into tears had they seen the desolate condition of the child or in vision had seen the struggles that were before her but whats the use of wasting tears upon our kate wait till tomorrow morning at sunrise and see if she is particularly in need of pity what now should a young lady do i propose it as a subject for a prize essay that finds herself in valladolid at nighfall having no letters of introduction not aware of any reason great or small for preferring any street in general except so far as she knows of some reason for avoiding one or two streets in particular the great problem i have stated kate investigated as she went along and she solved it with the accuracy with which she ever applied to practical exigencies her conclusion was that the best door to knock at in such a case was the door where there was no need to knock at all as being unfastened and open to all comers for she argued that within such a door there would be nothing to steal so that at least you could not be mistaken in the ark for a thief then as to stealing from her they might do that if they could upon these principles which hostile critics will in vain endeavor to undermine she laid her hand upon what seemed a rude stable door such it proved there was an empty cart inside certainly there was but you couldnt take that away in your pocket and there were five loads of straw but then of those a lady could take no more than her reticule would carry which perhaps was allowed by the courtesy of spain so kate was right as to the difficulty of being challenged for a thief closing the door as gently as she had opened it she dropped her person dressed as she was upon the nearest heap of straw some ten feet further were lying two muleteers honest and happy enough as compared with the lords of the bedchamber then in valladolid but still gross men carnally deaf from eating garlic and onions and other horrible substances accordingly they never heard her nor were aware until dawn that such a blooming person existed but she was aware of them and of their conversation they were talking of an expedition for america on the point of sailing under don ferdinand de cordova it was to sail from some andalusian port that was the very thing for her at daylight she woke and jumped up needing no more toilet than the birds that already were singing in the gardens or than the two muleteers who good honest fellows saluted the handsome boy kindly thinking no ill at his making free with their straw though no leave had been asked with these philogarlic men kate took her departure the morning was divine and leaving valladolid with the transports that befitted such a golden dawn feeling also already in the very obscurity of her exit the pledge of her escape she cared no longer for the crocodile or for st sebastian or in the way of fear for the protector of st sebastian though of him she thought with some tenderness so deep is the remembrance of kindness mixed with justice andalusia she reached rather slowly but many months before she was sixteen years old and quite in time for the expedition st lucar being the port of rendezvous for the peruvian expedition thither she went all comers were welcome on board the fleet much more a fine young fellow like kate she was at once engaged as a mate and her ship in particular after doubling cape horn without loss made the coast of peru paita was the port of her destination very near to this port they were when a storm threw them upon a coral reef there was little hope of the ship from the first for she was unmanageable and was not expected to hold together for twentyfour hours in this condition with death before their faces mark what kate did and please to remember it for her benefit when she does any other little thing that angers you the crew lowered the longboat vainly the captain protested against this disloyal desertion of a kings ship which might yet perhaps be run on shore so as to save the stores all the crew to a man deserted the captain you may say that literally for the single exception was not a man being our boldhearted kate she was the only sailor that refused to leave her captain or the king of spains ship the rest pulled away for the shore and with fair hopes of reaching it but one halfhour told another tale just about that time came a broad sheet of lightning which through the darkness of evening revealed the boat in the very act of mounting like a horse upon an inner reef instantly filling and throwing out the crew every man of whom disappeared amongst the breakers the night which succeeded was gloomy for both the representatives of his catholic majesty it cannot be denied by the greatest of philosophers that the muleteers stable at valladolid was worth twenty such ships though the stable was not insured against fire and the ship was insured against the sea and the wind by some fellow that thought very little of his engagements but whats the use of sitting down to cry that was never any trick of catalinas by daybreak she was at work with an axe in her hand i knew it before ever i came to this place in her memoirs i felt as sure as if i had read it that when day broke we should find kate hard at work thimble or axe trousers or raft all one to her the captain though true to his duty seems to have desponded he gave no help towards the raft signs were speaking however pretty loudly that he must do something for notice to quit was now served pretty liberally kates raft was ready and she encouraged the captain to think that it would give both of them something to hold by in swimming if not even carry double at this moment when all was waiting for a start and the ship herself was waiting for a final lurch to say goodbye to the king of spain kate went and did a thing which some misjudging people will object to she knew of a box laden with gold coins reputed to be the king of spains and meant for contingencies in the voyage out this she smashed open with her axe and took a sum equal to one hundred guineas english which having well secured in a pillowcase she then lashed firmly to the raft now this you know though not flotsam because it would not float was certainly by maritime law jetsom it would be the idlest of scruples to fancy that the sea or a shark had a better right to it than a philosopher or a splendid girl who showed herself capable of writing a very fair vo to say nothing of her decapitating in battle several of the kings enemies and recovering the kings banner no sane moralist would hesitate to do the same thing under the same circumstances on board an english vessel though the first lord of the admiralty should be looking on the raft was now thrown into the sea kate jumped after it and then entreated the captain to follow her he attempted it but wanting her youthful agility he struck his head against a spar and sank like lead giving notice below that his ship was coming kate mounted the raft and was gradually washed ashore but so exhausted as to have lost all recollection she lay for hours until the warmth of the sun revived her on sitting up she saw a desolate shore stretching both ways nothing to eat nothing to drink but fortunately the raft and the money had been thrown near her none of the lashings having given way only what is the use of a guinea amongst tangle and seagulls the money she distributed amongst her pockets and soon found strength to rise and march forward but which was forward and which backward she knew by the conversation of the sailors that paita must be in the neighborhood and paita being a port could not be in the inside of peru but of course somewhere on its outside and the outside of a maritime land must be the shore so that if she kept the shore and went far enough she could not fail of hitting her foot against paita at last in the very darkest night provided only she could first find out which was up and which was down else she might walk her shoes off and find herself six thousand miles in the wrong here was an awkward case all for want of a guidepost still when one thinks of kates prosperous horoscope that after so long a voyage she only out of the total crew was thrown on the american shore with one hundred and five pounds in her purse of clear gain on the voyage a conviction arises that she could not guess wrongly she might have tossed up having coins in her pocket heads or tails but this kind of sortilege was then coming to be thought irreligious in christendom as a jewish and a heathen mode of questioning the dark future she simply guessed therefore and very soon a thing happened which though adding nothing to strengthen her guess as a true one did much to sweeten it if it should prove a false one on turning a point of the shore she came upon a barrel of biscuit washed ashore from the ship biscuit is about the best thing i know but it is the soonest spoiled and one would like to hear counsel on one puzzling point why it is that a touch of water utterly ruins it taking its life and leaving a caput mortuum corpse upon this caput kate breakfasted though her case was worse than mine for any water that ever plagued me was always fresh now hers was a present from the pacific ocean she that was always prudent packed up some of the catholic kings biscuit as she had previously packed up far too little of his gold but in such cases a most delicate question occurs pressing equally on medicine and algebra it is this if you pack up too much then by this extra burthen of salt provisions you may retard for days your arrival at fresh provisions on the other hand if you pack up too little you may never arrive at all catalina hit the juste milieu and about twilight on the second day she found herself entering paita without having had to swim any river in her walk the first thing in such a case of distress which a young lady does even if she happens to be a young gentleman is to beautify her dress kate always attended to that as we know having overlooked her in the chestnut wood the man she sent for was not properly a tailor but one who employed tailors he himself furnishing the materials his name was urquiza a fact of very little importance to us in if it had stood only at the head and foot of kates little account but unhappily for kates dbut on this vast american stage the case was otherwise mr urquiza had the misfortune equally common in the old world and the new of being a knave and also a showy specious knave kate who had prospered under sea allowances of biscuit and hardship was now expanding in proportions with very little vanity or consciousness on that head she now displayed a really fine person and when drest anew in the way that became a young officer in the spanish service she looked footnote she looked etc if ever the reader should visit aixlachapelle he will probably feel interest enough in the poor wild impassioned girl to look out for a picture of her in that city and the only one known certainly to be authentic it is in the collection of mr sempeller for some time it was supposed that the best if not the only portrait of her lurked somewhere in italy since the discovery of the picture at aixla chapelle that notion has been abandoned but there is great reason to believe that both in madrid and rome many portraits of her must have been painted to meet the intense interest which arose in her history subsequently amongst all the men of rank military or ecclesiastical whether in italy or spain the date of these would range between sixteen and twentytwo years from the period which we have now reached the representative picture of a spanish caballador it is strange that such an appearance and such a rank should have suggested to urquiza the presumptuous idea of wishing that kate might become his clerk he did however wish it for kate wrote a beautiful hand and a stranger thing is that kate accepted his proposal this might arise from the difficulty of moving in those days to any distance in peru the ship had been merely bringing stores to the station of paita and no corps of the royal armies was readily to be reached whilst something must be done at once for a livelihood urquiza had two mercantile establishments one at trujillo to which he repaired in person on kates agreeing to undertake the management of the other in paita like the sensible girl that we have always found her she demanded specific instructions for her guidance in duties so new certainly she was in a fair way for seeing life telling her beads at st sebastians manoeuvreing irregular verbs at vittoria acting as gentlemanusher at valladolid serving his spanish majesty round cape horn fighting with storms and sharks off the coast of peru and now commencing as bookkeeper or commis to a draper at paita does she not justify the character that i myself gave her just before dismissing her from st sebastians of being a handy girl mr urquizas instructions were short easy to be understood but rather comic and yet which is odd they led to tragic results there were two debtors of the shop many it is to be hoped but two meriting his affectionate notice with respect to whom he left the most opposite directions the one was a very handsome lady and the rule as to her was that she was to have credit unlimited strictly unlimited that was plain the other customer favored by mr urquizas valedictory thoughts was a young man cousin to the handsome lady and bearing the name of reyes this youth occupied in mr urquizas estimate the same hyperbolical rank as the handsome lady but on the opposite side of the equation the rule as to him was that he was to have no credit strictly none in this case also kate saw no difficulty and when she came to know mr reyes a little she found the path of pleasure coinciding with the path of duty mr urquiza could not be more precise in laying down the rule than kate was in enforcing it but in the other case a scruple arose unlimited might be a word not of spanish law but of spanish rhetoric such as live a thousand years which even annuity offices hear and perhaps utter without a pang kate therefore wrote to trujillo expressing her honest fears and desiring to have more definite instructions these were positive if the lady chose to send for the entire shop her account was to be debited instantly with that she had however as yet not sent for the shop but she began to manifest strong signs of sending for the shop man upon the blooming young biscayan had her roving eye settled and she was in a course of making up her mind to take kate for a sweetheart poor kate saw this with a heavy heart and at the same time that she had a prospect of a tender friend more than she wanted she had become certain of an extra enemy that she wanted quite as little what she had done to offend mr reyes kate could not guess except as to the matter of the credit but then in that she only executed her instructions still mr reyes was of opinion that there were two ways of executing orders but the main offence was unintentional on kates part reyes though as yet she did not know it had himself been a candidate for the situation of clerk and intended probably to keep the equation precisely as it was with respect to the allowance of credit only to change places with the handsome lady keeping her on the negative side himself on the affirmative an arrangement that you know could have made no sort of pecuniary difference to urquiza thus stood matters when a party of strolling players strolled into paita kate as a spaniard being one held of the paita aristocracy was expected to attend she did so and there also was the malignant reyes he came and seated himself purposely so as to shut out kate from all view of the stage she who had nothing of the bully in her nature and was a gentle creature when her wild biscayan blood had not been kindled by insult courteously requested him to move a little upon which reyes remarked that it was not in his power to oblige the clerk as to that but that he could oblige him by cutting his throat the tiger that slept in catalina wakened at once she seized him and would have executed vengeance on the spot but that a party of young men interposed to part them the next day when kate always ready to forget and forgive was thinking no more of the row reyes passed by spitting at the window and other gestures insulting to kate again he roused her spanish blood out she rushed sword in hand a duel began in the street and very soon kates sword had passed into the heart of reyes now that the mischief was done the police were as usual all alive for the pleasure of avenging it kate found herself suddenly in a strong prison and with small hopes of leaving it except for execution the relations of the dead man were potent in paita and clamorous for justice so that the corregidor in a case where he saw a very poor chance of being corrupted by bribes felt it his duty to be sublimely incorruptible the reader knows however that amongst the relatives of the deceased bully was that handsome lady who differed as much from her cousin in her sentiments as to kate as she did in the extent of her credit with mr urquiza to her kate wrote a note and using one of the spanish kings gold coins for bribing the jailor got it safely delivered that perhaps was unnecessary for the lady had been already on the alert and had summoned urquiza from trujillo by some means not very luminously stated and by paying proper fees in proper quarters kate was smuggled out of the prison at nightfall and smuggled into a pretty house in the suburbs had she known exactly the footing she stood on as to the law she would have been decided as it was she was uneasy and jealous of mischief abroad and before supper she understood it all urquiza briefly informed his clerk that it would be requisite for him to marry the handsome lady but why because said urquiza after talking for hours with the corregidor who was infamous for obstinacy he had found it impossible to make him hear reason and release the prisoner until this compromise of marriage was suggested but how could public justice be pacified for the clerks unfortunate homicide of reyes by a female cousin of the deceased man engaging to love honor and obey the clerk for life kate could not see her way through this logic nonsense my friend said urquiza you dont comprehend as it stands the affair is a murder and hanging the penalty but if you marry into the murdered mans house then it becomes a little family murder all quiet and comfortable amongst ourselves what has the corregidor to do with that or the public either now let me introduce the bride supper entered at that moment and the bride immediately after the thoughtfulness of kate was narrowly observed and even alluded to but politely ascribed to the natural anxieties of a prisoner and the very imperfect state of liberation even yet from prison surveillance kate had indeed never been in so trying a situation before the anxieties of the farewell night at st sebastian were nothing to this because even if she had failed then a failure might not have been always irreparable it was but to watch and wait but now at this supper table she was not more alive to the nature of the peril than she was to the fact that if before the night closed she did not by some means escape from it she never would escape with life the deception as to her sex though resting on no motive that pointed to these people or at all concerned them would be resented as if it had the lady would resent the case as a mockery and urquiza would lose his opportunity of delivering himself from an imperious mistress according to the usages of the times and country kate knew that in twelve hours she would be assassinated people of infirmer resolution would have lingered at the supper table for the sake of putting off the evil moment of final crisis not so kate she had revolved the case on all its sides in a few minutes and had formed her resolution this done she was as ready for the trial at one moment as another and when the lady suggested that the hardships of a prison must have made repose desirable kate assented and instantly rose a sort of procession formed for the purpose of doing honor to the interesting guest and escorting him in pomp to his bedroom kate viewed it much in the same light as the procession to which for some days she had been expecting an invitation from the corregidor far ahead ran the servantwoman as a sort of outrider then came urquiza like a pasha of two tails who granted two sorts of credit viz unlimited and none at all bearing two wax lights one in each hand and wanting only cymbals and kettledrums to express emphatically the pathos of his castilian strut next came the bride a little in advance of the clerk but still turning obliquely towards him and smiling graciously into his face lastly bringing up the rear came the prisoner our kate the nun the page the mate the clerk the homicide the convict and for this day only by particular desire the bridegroom elect it was kates fixed opinion that if for a moment she entered any bedroom having obviously no outlet her fate would be that of an ox once driven within the shambles outside the bullock might make some defence with his horns but once in with no space for turning he is muffled and gagged she carried her eye therefore like a hawks steady though restless for vigilant examination of every angle she turned before she entered any bedroom she was resolved to reconnoiter it from the doorway and in case of necessity show fight at once before entering as the best chance after all where all chances were bad everything ends and at last the procession reached the bedroom door the outrider having filed off to the rear one glance sufficed to satisfy kate that windows there were none and therefore no outlet for escape treachery appeared even in that and kate though unfortunately without arms was now fixed for resistance mr urquiza entered first sound the trumpets beat the drums there were as we know already no windows but a slight interruption to mr urquizas pompous tread showed that there were steps downwards into the room those thought kate will suit me even better she had watched the unlocking of the bedroom door she had lost nothing she had marked that the key was left in the lock at this moment the beautiful lady as one acquainted with the details of the house turning with the air of a gracious monitress held out her fair hand to guide kate in careful descent of the steps this had the air of taking out kate to dance and kate at that same moment answering to it by the gesture of a modern waltzer threw her arm behind the ladys waist hurled her headlong down the steps right against mr urquiza draper and haberdasher and then with the speed of lightning throwing the door home within its architrave doubly locked the creditor and debtor into the rattrap which they had prepared for herself the affrighted outrider fled with horror she already knew that the clerk had committed one homicide a second would cost him still less thought and thus it happened that egress was left easy but when out and free once more in the bright starry night which way should kate turn the whole city would prove but a rattrap for her as bad as mr urquizas if she was not off before morning at a glance she comprehended that the sea was her only chance to the port she fled all was silent watchmen there were none she jumped into a boat to use the oars was dangerous for she had no means of muffling them but she contrived to hoist a sail pushed off with a boathook and was soon stretching across the water for the mouth of the harbor before a breeze light but favorable having cleared the difficulties of exit she lay down and unintentionally fell asleep when she awoke the sun had been up three or four hours all was right otherwise but had she not served as a sailor kate would have trembled upon finding that during her long sleep of perhaps seven or eight hours she had lost sight of land by what distance she could only guess and in what direction was to some degree doubtful all this however seemed a great advantage to the bold girl throwing her thoughts back on the enemies she had left behind the disadvantage was having no breakfast not even damaged biscuit and some anxiety naturally arose as to ulterior prospects a little beyond the horizon of breakfast but whos afraid as sailors whistle for a wind catalina really had but to whistle for anything with energy and it was sure to come like caesar to the pilot of dyrrhachium she might have said for the comfort of her poor timorous boat though destined soon to perish catalinam vehis et fortunas ejus meantime being very doubtful as to the best course for sailing and content if her course did but lie offshore she carried on as sailors say under easy sail going in fact just whither and just how the pacific breezes suggested in the gentlest of whispers all right behind was kates opinion and what was better very soon she might say all right ahead for some hour or two before sunset when dinner was for once becoming even to kate the most interesting of subjects for meditation suddenly a large ship began to swell upon the brilliant atmosphere in those latitudes and in those years any ship was pretty sure to be spanish sixty years later the odds were in favor of its being an english buccaneer which would have given a new direction to kates energy kate continued to make signals with a handkerchief whiter than the crocodiles of ann dom else it would hardly have been noticed perhaps after all it would not but that the ships course carried her very nearly across kates the stranger layto for her it was dark by the time kate steered herself under the ships quarter and then was seen an instance of this girls eternal wakefulness something was painted on the stern of her boat she could not see what but she judged that it would express some connection with the port that she had just quitted now it was her wish to break the chain of traces connecting her with such a scamp as urquiza since else through his commercial correspondence he might disperse over peru a portrait of herself by no means flattering how should she accomplish this it was dark and she stood as you may see an etonian do at times rocking her little boat from side to side until it had taken in water as much as might be agreeable too much it proved for the boats constitution and the boat perished of dropsy kate declining to tap it she got a ducking herself but what cared she up the ships side she went as gaily as ever in those years when she was called pussy she had raced after the nuns of st sebastian jumped upon deck and told the first lieutenant when he questioned her about her adventures quite as much truth as any man under the rank of admiral had a right to expect this ship was full of recruits for the spanish army and bound to concepcion even in that destiny was an iteration or repeating memorial of the significance that ran through catalinas most casual adventures she had enlisted amongst the soldiers and on reaching port the very first person who came off from shore was a dashing young military officer whom at once by his name and rank though she had never consciously seen him she identified as her own brother he was splendidly situated in the service being the governorgenerals secretary besides his rank as a cavalry officer and his errand on board being to inspect the recruits naturally on reading in the roll one of them described as a biscayan the ardent young man came up with highbred courtesy to catalina took the young recruits hand with kindness feeling that to be a compatriot at so great a distance was to be a sort of relative and asked with emotion after old boyish remembrances there was a scriptural pathos in what followed as if it were some scene of domestic reunion opening itself from patriarchal ages the young officer was the eldest son of the house and had left spain when catalina was only three years old but singularly enough catalina it was the little wild cat that he yet remembered seeing at st sebastians upon whom his earliest inquiries settled did the recruit know his family the de erausos o yes every body knew them did the recruit know little catalina catalina smiled as she replied that she did and gave such an animated description of the little fiery wretch as made the officers eye flash with gratified tenderness and with certainty that the recruit was no counterfeit biscayan indeed you know if kate couldnt give a good description of pussy who could the issue of the interview was that the officer insisted on kates making a home of his quarters he did other services for his unknown sister he placed her as a trooper in his own regiment and favored her in many a way that is open to one having authority but the person after all that did most to serve our kate was kate war was then raging with indians both from chili and peru kate had always done her duty in action but at length in the decisive battle of puren there was an opening for doing something more havoc had been made of her own squadron most of the officers were killed and the standard was carried off kate gathered around her a small party galloped after the indian column that was carrying away the trophy charged saw all her own party killed but in spite of wounds on her face and shoulder succeeded in bearing away the recovered standard she rode up to the general and his staff she dismounted she rendered up her prize and fainted away much less from the blinding blood than from the tears of joy which dimmed her eyes as the general waving his sword in admiration over her head pronounced our kate on the spot an alferez footnote alferez this rank in the spanish army is or was on a level with the modern souslieutenant of france or standardbearer with a commission from the king of spain and the indies bonny kate noble kate i would there were not two centuries laid between us so that i might have the pleasure of kissing thy fair hand kate had the good sense to see the danger of revealing her sex or her relationship even to her own brother the grasp of the church never relaxed never prescribed unless freely and by choice the nun if discovered would have been taken out of the horsebarracks or the dragoonsaddle she had the firmness therefore for many years to resist the sisterly impulses that sometimes suggested such a confidence for years and those years the most important of her life the years that developed her character she lived undetected as a brilliant cavalry officer under her brothers patronage and the bitterest grief in poor kates whole life was the tragical and were it not fully attested one might say the ultrascenical event that dissolved their long connection let me spend a word of apology on poor kates errors we all commit many both you and i reader no stop thats not civil you reader i know are a saint i am not though very near it i do err at long intervals and then i think with indulgence of the many circumstances that plead for this poor girl the spanish armies of that day inherited from the days of cortez and pizarro shining remembrances of martial prowess and the very worst of ethics to think little of bloodshed to quarrel to fight to gamble to plunder belonged to the very atmosphere of a camp to its indolence to its ancient traditions in your own defence you were obliged to do such things besides all these grounds of evil the spanish army had just there an extra demoralization from a war with savages faithless and bloody do not think i beseech you too much reader of killing a man that word kill is sprinkled over every page of kates own autobiography it ought not to be read by the light of these days yet how if a man that she killed were hush it was sad but is better hurried over in a few words years after this period a young officer one day dining with kate entreated her to become his second in a duel such things were everyday affairs however kate had reasons for declining the service and did so but the officer as he was sullenly departing said that if he were killed as he thought he should be his death would lie at kates door i do not take his view of the case and am not moved by his rhetoric or his logic kate was and relented the duel was fixed for eleven at night under the walls of a monastery unhappily the night proved unusually dark so that the two principals had to tie white handkerchiefs round their elbows in order to descry each other in the confusion they wounded each other mortally upon that according to a usage not peculiar to spaniards but extending as doubtless the reader knows for a century longer to our own countrymen the two seconds were obliged in honor to do something towards avenging their principals kate had her usual fatal luck her sword passed sheer through the body of her opponent this unknown opponent falling dead had just breath left to cry out ah villain you have killed me in a voice of horrific reproach and the voice was the voice of her brother the monks of the monastery under whose silent shadows this murderous duel had taken place roused by the clashing of swords and the angry shouts of combatants issued out with torches to find one only of the four officers surviving every convent and altar had a right of asylum for a short period according to the custom the monks carried kate insensible with anguish of mind to the sanctuary of their chapel there for some days they detained her but then having furnished her with a horse and some provisions they turned her adrift which way should the unhappy fugitive turn in blindness of heart she turned towards the sea it was the sea that had brought her to peru it was the sea that would perhaps carry her away it was the sea that had first showed her this land and its golden hopes it was the sea that ought to hide from her its fearful remembrances the sea it was that had twice spared her life in extremities the sea it was that might now if it chose take back the bauble that it had spared in vain kates passage over the andes three days our poor heroine followed the coast her horse was then almost unable to move and on his account she turned inland to a thicket for grass and shelter as she drew near to it a voice challenged who goes there kate answered spain what people a friend it was two soldiers deserters and almost starving kate shared her provisions with these men and on hearing their plan which was to go over the cordilleras she agreed to join the party their object was the wild one of seeking the river dorado whose waters rolled along golden sands and whose pebbles were emeralds hers was to throw herself upon a line the least liable to pursuit and the readiest for a new chapter of life in which oblivion might be found for the past after a few days of incessant climbing and fatigue they found themselves in the regions of perpetual snow summer would come as vainly to this kingdom of frost as to the grave of her brother no fire but the fire of human blood in youthful veins could ever be kept burning in these aerial solitudes fuel was rarely to be found and kindling a secret hardly known except to indians however our kate can do everything and shes the girl if ever girl did such a thing or ever girl did not such a thing that i back at any odds for crossing the cordilleras i would bet you something now reader if i thought you would deposit your stakes by return of post as they play at chess through the postoffice that kate does the trick that she gets down to the other side that the soldiers do not and that the horse if preserved at all is preserved in a way that will leave him very little to boast of the party had gathered wild berries and esculent roots at the foot of the mountains and the horse was of very great use in carrying them but this larder was soon emptied there was nothing then to carry so that the horses value as a beast of burthen fell cent per cent in fact very soon he could not carry himself and it became easy to calculate when he would reach the bottom on the wrong side the cordilleras he took three steps back for one upwards a council of war being held the small army resolved to slaughter their horse he though a member of the expedition had no vote and if he had the votes would have stood three to one majority two against him he was cut into quarters which surprises me for unless one quarter was considered his own share it reminds one too much of this amongst the many faceti of english midshipmen who ask on any one of their number looking sulky if it is his intention to marry and retire from the service upon a superannuation of s d a year paid quarterly by way of bothering the purser the purser cant do it with the help of farthings and as respects aliquot parts four shares among three persons are as incommensurable as a guinea is against any attempt at giving change in halfcrowns however this was all the preservation that the horse found no saltpetre or sugar could be had but the frost was antiseptic and the horse was preserved in as useful a sense as ever apricots were preserved or strawberries on a fire painfully devised out of broom and withered leaves a horse steak was dressed for drink snow as allowed a discretion this ought to have revived the party and kate perhaps it did but the poor deserters were thinly clad and they had not the boiling heart of catalina more and more they drooped kate did her best to cheer them but the march was nearly at an end for them and they were going in one half hour to receive their last billet yet before this consummation they have a strange spectacle to see such as few places could show but the upper chambers of the cordilleras they had reached a billowy scene of rocky masses large and small looking shockingly black on their perpendicular sides as they rose out of the vast snowy expanse upon the highest of these that was accessible kate mounted to look around her and she saw oh rapture at such an hour a man sitting on a shelf of rock with a gun by his side she shouted with joy to her comrades and ran down to communicate the joyful news here was a sportsman watching perhaps for an eagle and now they would have relief one mans cheek kindled with the hectic of sudden joy and he rose eagerly to march the other was fast sinking under the fatal sleep that frost sends before herself as her merciful minister of death but hearing in his dream the tidings of relief and assisted by his friends he also staggeringly arose it could not be three minutes walk kate thought to the station of the sportsman that thought supported them all under kates guidance who had taken a sailors glance at the bearings they soon unthreaded the labyrinth of rocks so far as to bring the man within view he had not left his restingplace their steps on the soundless snow naturally he could not hear and as their road brought them upon him from the rear still less could he see them kate hailed him but so keenly was he absorbed in some speculation or in the object of his watching that he took no notice of them not even moving his head kate began to think there would be another man to rouse from sleep coming close behind him she touched his shoulder and said my friend are you sleeping yes he was sleeping sleeping the sleep from which there is no awaking and the slight touch of kate having disturbed the equilibrium of the corpse down it rolled on the snow the frozen body rang like a hollow iron cylinder the face uppermost and blue with mould mouth open teeth ghastly and bleaching in the frost and a frightful grin upon the lips this dreadful spectacle finished the struggles of the weaker man who sank and died at once the other made an effort with so much spirit that in kates opinion horror had acted upon him beneficially as a stimulant but it was not really so it was a spasm of morbid strength a collapse succeeded his blood began to freeze he sat down in spite of kate and he also died without further struggle gone are the poor suffering deserters stretched and bleaching upon the snow and insulted discipline is avenged great kings have long arms and sycophants are ever at hand for the errand of the potent what had frost and snow to do with the quarrel yet they made themselves sycophantic servants of the king of spain and they dogged his deserters up to the summit of the cordilleras more surely than any spanish bloodhound or any spanish tirailleurs bullet now is our kate standing alone on the summits of the andes in solitude that is shocking for she is alone with her own afflicted conscience twice before she had stood in solitude as deep upon the wild wild waters of the pacific but her conscience had been then untroubled now is there nobody left that can help her horse is dead the soldiers are dead there is nobody that she can speak to except god and very soon you will find that she does speak to him for already on these vast aerial deserts he has been whispering to her the condition of kate is exactly that of coleridges ancient mariner but possibly reader you may be amongst the many careless readers that have never fully understood what that condition was suffer me to enlighten you else you ruin the story of the mariner and by losing all its pathos lose half the jewels of its beauty there are three readers of the ancient mariner the first is gross enough to fancy all the imagery of the mariners visions delivered by the poet for actual facts of experience which being impossible the whole pulverizes for that reader into a baseless fairy tale the second reader is wiser than that he knows that the imagery is not baseless it is the imagery of febrile delirium really seen but not seen as an external reality the mariner had caught the pestilential fever which carried off all his mates he only had survived the delirium had vanished but the visions that had haunted the delirium remained yes says the third reader they remained naturally they did being scorched by fever into his brain but how did they happen to remain on his belief as gospel truths the delirium had vanished why had not the painted scenery of the delirium vanished except as visionary memorials of a sorrow that was cancelled why was it that craziness settled upon this mariners brain driving him as if he were a cain or another wandering jew to pass like night from land to land and at uncertain intervals wrenching him until he made rehearsal of his errors even at the hard price of holding children from their play and old men from the chimney corner footnote the beautiful words of sir philip sidney in his defense of poesie that craziness as the third reader deciphers rose out of a deeper soil than any bodily affection it had its root in penitential sorrow oh bitter is the sorrow to a conscientious heart when too late it discovers the depth of a love that has been trampled under foot this mariner had slain the creature that on all the earth loved him best in the darkness of his cruel superstition he had done it to save his human brothers from a fancied inconvenience and yet by that very act of cruelty he had himself called destruction upon their heads the nemesis that followed punished him through them him that wronged through those that wrongfully he sought to benefit that spirit who watches over the sanctities of love is a strong angel is a jealous angel and this angel it was that lovd the bird that lovd the man that shot him with his bow he it was that followed the cruel archer into silent and slumbering seas nine fathom deep he had followd him through the realms of mist and snow this jealous angel it was that pursued the man into noonday darkness and the vision of dying oceans into delirium and finally when recovered from disease into an unsettled mind such also had been the offence of kate such also was the punishment that now is dogging her steps she like the mariner had slain the one sole creature that loved her upon the whole wide earth she like the mariner for this offence had been hunted into frost and snow very soon will be hunted into delirium and from that if she escapes with life will be hunted into the trouble of a heart that cannot rest there was the excuse of one darkness for her there was the excuse of another darkness for the mariner but with all the excuses that earth and the darkness of earth can furnish bitter it would be for you or me reader through every hour of life waking or dreaming to look back upon one fatal moment when we had pierced the heart that would have died for us in this only the darkness had been merciful to kate that it had hidden for ever from her victim the hand that slew him but now in such utter solitude her thoughts ran back to their earliest interview she remembered with anguish how on first touching the shores of america almost the very first word that met her ear had been from him the brother whom she had killed about the pussy of times long past how the gallant young man had hung upon her words as in her native basque she described her own mischievous little self of twelve years back how his color went and came whilst his loving memory of the little sister was revived by her own descriptive traits giving back as in a mirror the fawnlike grace the squirrel like restlessness that once had kindled his own delighted laughter how he would take no denial but showed on the spot that simply to have touched to have kissed to have played with the little wild thing that glorified by her innocence the gloom of st sebastians cloisters gave a right to his hospitality how through him only she had found a welcome in camps how through him she had found the avenue to honor and distinction and yet this brother so loving and generous it was that she had dismissed from life she paused she turned round as if looking back for his grave she saw the dreadful wildernesses of snow which already she had traversed silent they were at this season even as in the panting heats of noon the zaarrahs of the torrid zone are oftentimes silent dreadful was the silence it was the nearest thing to the silence of the grave graves were at the foot of the andes that she knew too well graves were at the summit of the andes that she saw too well and as she gazed a sudden thought flashed upon her when her eyes settled upon the corpses of the poor deserters could she like them have been all this while unconsciously executing judgment upon herself running from a wrath that was doubtful into the very jaws of a wrath that was inexorable flying in panic and behold there was no man that pursued for the first time in her life kate trembled not for the first time kate wept far less for the first time was it that kate bent her knee that kate clasped her hands that kate prayed but it was the first time that she prayed as they pray for whom no more hope is left but in prayer here let me pause a moment for the sake of making somebody angry a frenchman who sadly misjudges kate looking at her through a parisian operaglass gives it as his opinion that because kate first records her prayer on this occasion therefore now first of all she prayed i think not so i love this kate blood stained as she is and i could not love a woman that never bent her knee in thankfulness or in supplication however we have all a right to our own little opinion and it is not you mon cher you frenchman that i am angry with but somebody else that stands behind you you frenchman and your compatriots i love oftentimes for your festal gaiety of heart and i quarrel only with your levity and that eternal worldliness that freezes too fiercely that absolutely blisters with its frost like the upper air of the andes you speak of kate only as too readily you speak of all women the instinct of a natural scepticism being to scoff at all hidden depths of truth else you are civil enough to kate and your homage such as it may happen to be is always at the service of a woman on the shortest notice but behind you i see a worse fellow a gloomy fanatic a religious sycophant that seeks to propitiate his circle by bitterness against the offences that are most unlike his own and against him i must say one word for kate to the too hasty reader this villain whom i mark for a shot if he does not get out of the way opens his fire on our kate under shelter of a lie for there is a standing lie in the very constitution of civil society a necessity of error misleading us as to the proportions of crime mere necessity obliges man to create many acts into felonies and to punish them as the heaviest offences which his better sense teaches him secretly to regard as perhaps among the lightest those poor deserters for instance were they necessarily without excuse they might have been oppressively used but in critical times of war no matter for the individual palliations the deserter from his colors must be shot there is no help for it as in extremities of general famine we shoot the man alas we are obliged to shoot him that is found robbing the common stores in order to feed his own perishing children though the offence is hardly visible in the sight of god only blockheads adjust their scale of guilt to the scale of human punishments now our wicked friend the fanatic who calumniates kate abuses the advantage which for such a purpose he derives from the exaggerated social estimate of all violence personal security being so main an object of social union we are obliged to frown upon all modes of violence as hostile to the central principle of that union we are obliged to rate it according to the universal results towards which it tends and scarcely at all according to the special condition of circumstances in which it may originate hence a horror arises for that class of offences which is philosophically speaking exaggerated and by daily use the ethics of a policeoffice translate themselves insensibly into the ethics even of religious people but i tell that sycophantish fanatic not this only viz that he abuses unfairly against kate the advantage which he has from the inevitably distorted bias of society but also i tell him this second little thing viz that upon turning away the glass from that one obvious aspect of kates character her too fiery disposition to vindicate all rights by violence and viewing her in relation to general religious capacities she was a thousand times more promisingly endowed than himself it is impossible to be noble in many things without having many points of contact with true religion if you deny that you it is that calumniate religion kate was noble in many things her worst errors never took a shape of selfinterest or deceit she was brave she was generous she was forgiving she bore no malice she was full of truth qualities that god loves either in man or woman she hated sycophants and dissemblers i hate them and more than ever at this moment on her behalf i wish she were but here to give a punch on the head to that fellow who traduces her and coming round again to the occasion from which this short digression has started viz the question raised by the frenchman whether kate were a person likely to pray under other circumstances than those of extreme danger i offer it as my opinion that she was violent people are not always such from choice but perhaps from situation and though the circumstances of kates position allowed her little means for realizing her own wishes it is certain that those wishes pointed continually to peace and an unworldly happiness if that were possible the stormy clouds that enveloped her in camps opened overhead at intervals showing her a far distant blue serene she yearned at many times for the rest which is not in camps or armies and it is certain that she ever combined with any plans or daydreams of tranquillity as their most essential ally some aid derived from that dovelike religion which at st sebastians as an infant and through girlhood she had been taught so profoundly to adore now let us rise from this discussion of kate against libellers as kate herself is rising from prayer and consider in conjunction with her the character and promise of that dreadful ground which lies immediately before her what is to be thought of it i could wish we had a theodolite here and a spiritlevel and other instruments for settling some important questions yet no on consideration if one had a wish allowed by that kind fairy without whose assistance it would be quite impossible to send even for the spiritlevel nobody would throw away the wish upon things so paltry i would not put the fairy upon any such errand i would order the good creature to bring no spiritlevel but a stiff glass of spirits for kate a palanquin and relays of fifty stout bearers all drunk in order that they might not feel the cold the main interest at this moment and the main difficulty indeed the open question of the case was to ascertain whether the ascent were yet accomplished or not and when would the descent commence or had it perhaps long commenced the character of the ground in those immediate successions that could be connected by the eye decided nothing for the undulations of the level had been so continual for miles as to perplex any eye but an engineers in attempting to judge whether upon the whole the tendency were upwards or downwards possibly it was yet neither way it is indeed probable that kate had been for some time travelling along a series of terraces that traversed the whole breadth of the topmost area at that point of crossing the cordilleras and which perhaps but not certainly compensated any casual tendencies downwards by corresponding reascents then came the question how long would these terraces yet continue and had the ascending parts really balanced the descending upon that seemed to rest the final chance for kate because unless she very soon reached a lower level and a warmer atmosphere mere weariness would oblige her to lie down under a fierceness of cold that would not suffer her to rise after once losing the warmth of motion or inversely if she even continued in motion mere extremity of cold would of itself speedily absorb the little surplus energy for moving which yet remained unexhausted by weariness at this stage of her progress and whilst the agonizing question seemed yet as indeterminate as ever kates struggle with despair which had been greatly soothed by the fervor of her prayer revolved upon her in deadlier blackness all turned she saw upon a race against time and the arrears of the road and she poor thing how little qualified could she be in such a condition for a race of any kind and against two such obstinate brutes as time and space this hour of the progress this noontide of kates struggle must have been the very crisis of the whole despair was rapidly tending to ratify itself hope in any degree would be a cordial for sustaining her efforts but to flounder along a dreadful chaos of snowdrifts or snowchasms towards a point of rock which being turned should expose only another interminable succession of the same character might that be endured by ebbing spirits by stiffening limbs by the ghastly darkness that was now beginning to gather upon the inner eye and if once despair became triumphant all the little arrear of physical strength would collapse at once oh verdure of human fields cottages of men and women that now suddenly seemed all brothers and sisters cottages with children around them at play that are so far below oh summer and spring flowers and blossoms to which as to his symbols god has given the gorgeous privilege of rehearsing for ever upon earth his most mysterious perfection life and the resurrections of life is it indeed true that poor kate must never see you more mutteringly she put that question to herself but strange are the caprices of ebb and flow in the deep fountains of human sensibilities at this very moment when the utter incapacitation of despair was gathering fast at kates heart a sudden lightening shot far into her spirit a reflux almost supernatural from the earliest effects of her prayer a thought had struck her all at once and this thought prompted her immediately to turn round perhaps it was in some blind yearning after the only memorials of life in this frightful region that she fixed her eye upon a point of hilly ground by which she identified the spot near which the three corpses were lying the silence seemed deeper than ever neither was there any phantom memorial of life for the eye or for the ear nor wing of bird nor echo nor green leaf nor creeping thing that moved or stirred upon the soundless waste oh what a relief to this burthen of silence would be a human groan here seemed a motive for still darker despair and yet at that very moment a pulse of joy began to thaw the ice at her heart it struck her as she reviewed the ground that undoubtedly it had been for some time slowly descending her senses were much dulled by suffering but this thought it was suggested by a sudden apprehension of a continued descending movement which had caused her to turn round sight had confirmed the suggestion first derived from her own steps the distance attained was now sufficient to establish the tendency oh yes yes to a certainty she had been descending for some time frightful was the spasm of joy which whispered that the worst was over it was as when the shadow of midnight that murderers had relied on is passing away from your beleagured shelter and dawn will soon be manifest it was as when a flood that all day long has raved against the walls of your house has ceased you suddenly think to rise yes measured by a golden plummet it is sinking beyond a doubt and the darlings of your household are saved kate faced round in agitation to her proper direction she saw what previously in her stunning confusion she had not seen that hardly two stones throw in advance lay a mass of rock split as into a gateway through that opening it now became probable that the road was lying hurrying forward she passed within the natural gates gates of paradise they were ah what a vista did that gateway expose before her dazzled eye what a revelation of heavenly promise full two miles long stretched a long narrow glen everywhere descending and in many parts rapidly all was now placed beyond a doubt she was descending for hours perhaps had been descending insensibly the mighty staircase yes kate is leaving behind her the kingdom of frost and the victories of death two miles farther there may be rest if there is not shelter and very soon as the crest of her newborn happiness she distinguished at the other end of that rocky vista a pavilionshaped mass of dark green foliage a belt of trees such as we see in the lovely parks of england but islanded by a screen though not everywhere occupied by the usurpations of a thick bushy undergrowth oh verdure of dark olive foliage offered suddenly to fainting eyes as if by some winged patriarchal herald of wrath relenting solitary arabs tent rising with saintly signals of peace in the dreadful desert must kate indeed die even yet whilst she sees but cannot reach you outpost on the frontier of mans dominions standing within life but looking out upon everlasting death wilt thou hold up the anguish of thy mocking invitation only to betray never perhaps in this world was the line so exquisitely grazed that parts salvation and ruin as the dove to her dovecot from the swooping hawk as the christian pinnace to christian batteries from the bloody mahometan corsair so flew so tried to fly towards the anchoring thickets that alas could not weigh their anchors and make sail to meet her the poor exhausted kate from the vengeance of pursuing frost and she reached them staggering fainting reeling she entered beneath the canopy of umbrageous trees but as oftentimes the hebrew fugitive to a city of refuge flying for his life before the avenger of blood was pressed so hotly that on entering the archway of what seemed to him the heavenly citygate as he kneeled in deep thankfulness to kiss its holy merciful shadow he could not rise again but sank instantly with infant weakness into sleep sometimes to wake no more so sank so collapsed upon the ground without power to choose her couch and with little prospect of ever rising again to her feet the martial nun she lay as luck had ordered it with her head screened by the undergrowth of bushes from any gales that might arise she lay exactly as she sank with her eyes up to heaven and thus it was that the nun saw before falling asleep the two sights that upon earth are fittest for the closing eyes of a nun whether destined to open again or to close for ever she saw the interlacing of boughs overhead forming a dome that seemed like the dome of a cathedral she saw through the fretwork of the foliage another dome far beyond the dome of an evening sky the dome of some heavenly cathedral not built with hands she saw upon this upper dome the vesper lights all alive with pathetic grandeur of coloring from a sunset that had just been rolling down like a chorus she had not till now consciously observed the time of day whether it were morning or whether it were afternoon in her confusion she had not distinctly known but now she whispered to herself it is evening and what lurked half unconsciously in these words might be the sun that rejoices has finished his daily toil man that labors has finished his i that suffer have finished mine that might be what she thought but what she said was it is evening and the hour is come when the angelus is sounding through st sebastian what made her think of st sebastian so far away in depths of space and time her brain was wandering now that her feet were not and because her eyes had descended from the heavenly to the earthly dome that made her think of earthly cathedrals and of cathedral choirs and of st sebastians chapel with its silvery bells that carried the angelus far into mountain recesses perhaps as her wanderings increased she thought herself back in childhood became pussy once again fancied that all since then was a frightful dream that she was not upon the dreadful andes but still kneeling in the holy chapel at vespers still innocent as then loved as then she had been loved and that all men were liars who said her hand was ever stained with blood little enough is mentioned of the delusions which possessed her but that little gives a key to the impulse which her palpitating heart obeyed and which her rambling brain for ever reproduced in multiplying mirrors restlessness kept her in waking dreams for a brief half hour but then fever and delirium would wait no longer the killing exhaustion would no longer be refused the fever the delirium and the exhaustion swept in together with power like an army with banners and the nun ceased through the gathering twilight any more to watch the cathedrals of earth or the more solemn cathedrals that rose in the heavens above all night long she slept in her verdurous st bernards hospice without awaking and whether she would ever awake seemed to depend upon an accident the slumber that towered above her brain was like that fluctuating silvery column which stands in scientific tubes sinking rising deepening lightening contracting expanding or like the mist that sits through sultry afternoons upon the river of the american st peter sometimes rarefying for minutes into sunny gauze sometimes condensing for hours into palls of funeral darkness you fancy that after twelve hours of any sleep she must have been refreshed better at least than she was last night ah but sleep is not always sent upon missions of refreshment sleep is sometimes the secret chamber in which death arranges his machinery sleep is sometimes that deep mysterious atmosphere in which the human spirit is slowly unsettling its wings for flight from earthly tenements it is now eight oclock in the morning and to all appearance if kate should receive no aid before noon when next the sun is departing to his rest kate will be departing to hers when next the sun is holding out his golden christian signal to man that the hour is come for letting his anger go down kate will be sleeping away for ever into the arms of brotherly forgiveness what is wanted just now for kate supposing kate herself to be wanted by this world is that this world would be kind enough to send her a little brandy before it is too late the simple truth was and a truth which i have known to take place in more ladies than kate who died or did not die accordingly as they had or had not an adviser like myself capable of giving so sound an opinion that the jewelly star of life had descended too far down the arch towards setting for any chance of reascending by spontaneous effort the fire was still burning in secret but needed to be rekindled by potent artificial breath it lingered and might linger but would never culminate again without some stimulus from earthly vineyards footnote though not exactly in the same circumstances as kate or sleeping la belle toile on a declivity of the andes i have known or heard circumstantially reported the cases of many ladies besides kate who were in precisely the same critical danger of perishing for want of a little brandy a dessert spoonful or two would have saved them avaunt you wicked temperance medallist repent as fast as ever you can or perhaps the next time we hear of you anasarca and hydro thorax will be running after you to punish your shocking excesses in water seriously the case is one of constant recurrence and constantly ending fatally from unseasonable and pedantic rigor of temperance the fact is that the medical profession composes the most generous and liberal body of men amongst us taken generally by much the most enlightened but professionally the most timid want of boldness in the administration of opium c though they can be bold enough with mercury is their besetting infirmity and from this infirmity females suffer most one instance i need hardly mention the fatal case of an august lady mourned by nations with respect to whom it was and is the belief of multitudes to this hour well able to judge that she would have been saved by a glass of brandy and her attendant who shot himself came to think so too late too late for her and too late for himself amongst many cases of the same nature which personally i have been acquainted with twenty years ago a man illustrious for his intellectual accomplishments mentioned to me that his own wife during her first or second confinement was suddenly reported to him by one of her female attendants who slipped away unobserved by the medical people as undoubtedly sinking fast he hurried to her chamber and saw that it was so the presiding medical authority however was inexorable oh by no means shaking his ambrosial wig any stimulant at this crisis would be fatal but no authority could overrule the concurrent testimony of all symptoms and of all unprofessional opinions by some pious falsehood my friend smuggled the doctor out of the room and immediately smuggled a glass of brandy into the poor ladys lips she recovered with magical power the doctor is now dead and went to his grave under the delusive persuasion that not any vile glass of brandy but the stern refusal of all brandy was the thing that saved his collapsing patient the patient herself who might naturally know something of the matter was of a different opinion she sided with the factious body around her bed comprehending all beside the doctor who felt sure that death was rapidly approaching barring that brandy the same result in the same appalling crisis i have known repeatedly produced by twenty five drops of laudanum an obstinate man will say oh never listen to a nonmedical man like this writer consult in such a case your medical adviser you will will you then let me tell you that you are missing the very logic of all i have been saying for the improvement of blockheads which is that you should consult any man but a medical man since no other man has any obstinate prejudice of professional timidity n b i prescribe for kate gratis because she poor thing has so little to give but from other ladies who may have the happiness to benefit by my advice i expect a fee not so large a one considering the service a flowering plant suppose the second best in their collection i know it would be of no use to ask for the very best which else i could wish to do because that would only be leading them into little fibs i dont insist on a yucca gloriosa or a magnolia speciosissima i hope there is such a plant a rose or a violet will do i am sure there is such a plant as that and if they settle their debts justly i shall very soon be master of the prettiest little conservatory in england for treat it not as a jest reader no case of timid practice is so fatally frequent kate was ever lucky though ever unfortunate and the world being of my opinion that kate was worth saving made up its mind about halfpast eight oclock in the morning to save her just at that time when the night was over and its sufferings were hidden in one of those intermitting gleams that for a moment or two lightened the clouds of her slumber kates dull ear caught a sound that for years had spoken a familiar language to her what was it it was the sound though muffled and deadened like the ear that heard it of horsemen advancing interpreted by the tumultuous dreams of kate was it the cavalry of spain at whose head so often she had charged the bloody indian scalpers was it according to the legend of ancient days cavalry that had been sown by her brothers blood cavalry that rose from the ground on an inquest of retribution and were racing up the andes to seize her her dreams that had opened sullenly to the sound waited for no answer but closed again into pompous darkness happily the horsemen had caught the glimpse of some bright ornament clasp or aiguillette on kates dress they were hunters and foresters from below servants in the household of a beneficent lady and in some pursuit of flying game had wandered beyond their ordinary limits struck by the sudden scintillation from kates dress played upon by the morning sun they rode up to the thicket great was their surprise great their pity to see a young officer in uniform stretched within the bushes upon the ground and perhaps dying borderers from childhood on this dreadful frontier sacred to winter and death they understood the case at once they dismounted and with the tenderness of women raising the poor frozen cornet in their arms washed her temples with brandy whilst one at intervals suffered a few drops to trickle within her lips as the restoration of a warm bed was now most likely to be successful they lifted the helpless stranger upon a horse walking on each side with supporting arms once again our kate is in the saddle once again a spanish caballador but kates bridlehand is deadly cold and her spurs that she had never unfastened since leaving the monastic asylum hung as idle as the flapping sail that fills unsteadily with the breeze upon a stranded ship this procession had some miles to go and over difficult ground but at length it reached the forestlike park and the chateau of the wealthy proprietress kate was still halffrozen and speechless except at intervals heavens can this corpselike languishing young woman be the kate that once in her radiant girlhood rode with a handful of comrades into a column of two thousand enemies that saw her comrades die that persisted when all were dead that tore from the heart of all resistance the banner of her native spain chance and change have written strange defeatures in her face much is changed but some things are not changed there is still kindness that overflows with pity there is still helplessness that asks for this pity without a voice she is now received by a senora not less kind than that maternal aunt who on the night of her birth first welcomed her to a loving home and she the heroine of spain is herself as helpless now as that little lady who then at ten minutes of age was kissed and blessed by all the household of st sebastian let us suppose kate placed in a warm bed let us suppose her in a few hours recovering steady consciousness in a few days recovering some power of selfsupport in a fortnight able to seek the gay saloon where the senora was sitting alone and rendering thanks with that deep sincerity which ever characterized our wildhearted kate for the critical services received from that lady and her establishment this lady a widow was what the french call a mtisse the spaniards a mestizza that is the daughter of a genuine spaniard and an indian mother i shall call her simply a creole footnote creole at that time the infusion of negro or african blood was small consequently none of the negro hideousness was diffused after these intercomplexities had arisen between all complications of descent from three original strands european american african the distinctions of social consideration founded on them bred names so many that a court calendar was necessary to keep you from blundering as yet the varieties were few meantime the word creole has always been misapplied in our english colonies to a person though of strictly european blood simply because born in the west indies in this english use it expresses the same difference as the romans indicated by hispanus and hispanicus the first meant a person of spanish blood a native of spain the second a roman born in spain so of germanus and germanicus italus and italicus anglus and anglicus c an important distinction on which see casaubon apud scriptores hist augustan which will indicate her want of pure spanish blood sufficiently to explain her deference for those who had it she was a kind liberal woman rich rather more than needed where there were no opera boxes to rent a widow about fifty years old in the wicked worlds account some fortyfour in her own and happy above all in the possession of a most lovely daughter whom even the wicked world did not accuse of more than sixteen years this daughter juana was but stop let her open the door of the saloon in which the senora and the cornet are conversing and speak for herself she did so after an hour had passed which length of time to her that never had any business whatever in her innocent life seemed sufficient to settle the business of the old world and the new had pietro diaz as catalina now called herself been really a peter and not a sham peter what a vision of loveliness would have rushed upon his sensibilities as the door opened do not expect me to describe her for which however there are materials extant sleeping in archives where they have slept for two hundred and twenty years it is enough that she is reported to have united the stately tread of andalusian women with the innocent voluptuousness of peruvian eyes as to her complexion and figure be it known that juanas father was a gentleman from grenada having in his veins the grandest blood of all this earth blood of goths and vandals tainted for which heaven be thanked twice over with blood of arabs once through moors once through jews footnote it is well known that the very reason why the spanish of all nations became the most gloomily jealous of a jewish cross in the pedigree was because until the vigilance of the church rose into ferocity in no nation was such a cross so common the hatred of fear is ever the deepest and men hated the jewish taint as once in jerusalem they hated the leprosy because even whilst they raved against it the secret proofs of it might be detected amongst their own kindred even as in the temple whilst once a king rose in mutiny against the priesthood chron xxvi suddenly the leprosy that dethroned him blazed out upon his forehead whilst from her grandmother juana drew the deep subtle melancholy and the beautiful contours of limb which belong to the indian race a race destined silently and slowly to fade from the earth no awkwardness was or could be in this antelope when gliding with forest grace into the room no townbred shame nothing but the unaffected pleasure of one who wishes to speak a fervent welcome but knows not if she ought the astonishment of a miranda bred in utter solitude when first beholding a princely ferdinand and just so much reserve as to remind you that if catalina thought fit to dissemble her sex she did not and consider reader if you look back and are a great arithmetician that whilst the senora had only fifty per cent of spanish blood juana had seventyfive so that her indian melancholy after all was swallowed up for the present by her vandal by her arab by her spanish fire catalina seared as she was by the world has left it evident in her memoirs that she was touched more than she wished to be by this innocent child juana formed a brief lull for catalina in her too stormy existence and if for her in this life the sweet reality of a sister had been possible here was the sister she would have chosen on the other hand what might juana think of the cornet to have been thrown upon the kind hospitalities of her native home to have been rescued by her mothers servants from that fearful death which lying but a few miles off had filled her nursery with traditionary tragedies that was sufficient to create an interest in the stranger but his bold martial demeanor his yet youthful style of beauty his frank manners his animated conversation that reported a hundred contests with suffering and peril wakened for the first time her admiration men she had never seen before except menial servants or a casual priest but here was a gentleman young like herself that rode in the cavalry of spain that carried the banner of the only potentate whom peruvians knew of the king of the spains and the indies that had doubled cape horn that had crossed the andes that had suffered shipwreck that had rocked upon fifty storms and had wrestled for life through fifty battles the reader knows all that followed the sisterly love which catalina did really feel for this young mountaineer was inevitably misconstrued embarrassed but not able from sincere affection or almost in bare propriety to refuse such expressions of feeling as corresponded to the artless and involuntary kindnesses of the ingenuous juana one day the cornet was surprised by mamma in the act of encircling her daughters waist with his martial arm although waltzing was premature by at least two centuries in peru she taxed him instantly with dishonorably abusing her confidence the cornet made but a bad defence he muttered something about fraternal affection about esteem and a great deal of metaphysical words that are destined to remain untranslated in their original spanish the good senora though she could boast only of fortyfour years experience was not altogether to be had in that fashion she was as learned as if she had been fifty and she brought matters to a speedy crisis you are a spaniard she said a gentleman therefore remember that you are a gentleman this very night if your intentions are not serious quit my house go to tucuman you shall command my horses and servants but stay no longer to increase the sorrow that already you will have left behind you my daughter loves you that is sorrow enough if you are trifling with us but if not and you also love her and can be happy in our solitary mode of life stay with us stay for ever marry juana with my free consent i ask not for wealth mine is sufficient for you both the cornet protested that the honor was one never contemplated by him that it was too great that but of course reader you know that gammon flourishes in peru amongst the silver mines as well as in some more boreal lands that produce little better than copper and tin tin however has its uses the delighted senora overruled all objections great and small and she confirmed juanas notion that the business of two worlds could be transacted in an hour by settling her daughters future happiness in exactly twenty minutes the poor weak catalina not acting now in any spirit of recklessness grieving sincerely for the gulf that was opening before her and yet shrinking effeminately from the momentary shock that would be inflicted by a firm adherence to her duty clinging to the anodyne of a short delay allowed herself to be installed as the lover of juana considerations of convenience however postponed the marriage it was requisite to make various purchases and for this it was requisite to visit tucuman where also the marriage ceremony could be performed with more circumstantial splendor to tucuman therefore after some weeks interval the whole party repaired and at tucuman it was that the tragical events arose which whilst interrupting such a mockery for ever left the poor juana still happily deceived and never believing for a moment that hers was a rejected or a deluded heart one reporter of mr de ferrers narrative forgets his usual generosity when he says that the senoras gift of her daughter to the alferez was not quite so disinterested as it seemed to be certainly it was not so disinterested as european ignorance might fancy it but it was quite as much so as it ought to have been in balancing the interests of a child very true it is that being a genuine spaniard who was still a rare creature in so vast a world as peru being a spartan amongst helots an englishman amongst savages an alferez would in those days have been a natural noble his alliance created honor for his wife and for his descendants something therefore the cornet would add to the family consideration but instead of selfishness it argued just regard for her daughters interest to build upon this as some sort of equipoise to the wealth which her daughter would bring spaniard however as he was our alferez on reaching tucuman found no spaniards to mix with but instead twelve portuguese catalina remembered the spanish proverb subtract from a spaniard all his good qualities and the remainder makes a pretty fair portuguese but as there was nobody else to gamble with she entered freely into their society very soon she suspected that there was foul play all modes of doctoring dice had been made familiar to her by the experience of camps she watched and by the time she had lost her final coin she was satisfied that she had been plundered in her first anger she would have been glad to switch the whole dozen across the eyes but as twelve to one were too great odds she determined on limiting her vengeance to the immediate culprit him she followed into the street and coming near enough to distinguish his profile reflected on a wall she continued to keep him in view from a short distance the lighthearted young cavalier whistled as he went an old portuguese ballad of romance and in a quarter of an hour came up to an house the front door of which he began to open with a passkey this operation was the signal for catalina that the hour of vengeance had struck and stepping hastily up she tapped the portuguese on the shoulder saying senor you are a robber the portuguese turned coolly round and seeing his gaming antagonist replied possibly sir but i have no particular fancy for being told so at the same time drawing his sword catalina had not designed to take any advantage and the touching him on the shoulder with the interchange of speeches and the known character of kate sufficiently imply it but it is too probable in such cases that the party whose intention has been regularly settled from the first will and must have an advantage unconsciously over a man so abruptly thrown on his defence however this might be they had not fought a minute before catalina passed her sword through her opponents body and without a groan or a sigh the portuguese cavalier fell dead at his own door kate searched the street with her ears and as far as the indistinctness of night allowed with her eyes all was profoundly silent and she was satisfied that no human figure was in motion what should be done with the body a glance at the door of the house settled that fernando had himself opened it at the very moment when he received the summons to turn round she dragged the corpse in therefore to the foot of the staircase put the key by the dead mans side and then issuing softly into the street drew the door close with as little noise as possible catalina again paused to listen and to watch went home to the hospitable senoras house retired to bed fell asleep and early the next morning was awakened by the corregidor and four alguazils the lawlessness of all that followed strikingly exposes the frightful state of criminal justice at that time wherever spanish law prevailed no evidence appeared to connect catalina in any way with the death of fernando acosta the portuguese gamblers besides that perhaps they thought lightly of such an accident might have reasons of their own for drawing off public attention from their pursuits in tucuman not one of these men came forward openly else the circumstances at the gaming table and the departure of catalina so closely on the heels of her opponent would have suggested reasonable grounds for detaining her until some further light should be obtained as it was her imprisonment rested upon no colorable ground whatever unless the magistrate had received some anonymous information which however he never alleged one comfort there was meantime in spanish injustice it did not loiter full gallop it went over the ground one week often sufficed for informations for trial for execution and the only bad consequence was that a second or a third week sometimes exposed the disagreeable fact that everything had been premature a solemn sacrifice had been made to offended justice in which all was right except as to the victim it was the wrong man and that gave extra trouble for then all was to do over again another man to be executed and possibly still to be caught justice moved at her usual spanish rate in the present case kate was obliged to rise instantly not suffered to speak to anybody in the house though in going out a door opened and she saw the young juana looking out with saddest indian expression in one day the trial was all finished catalina said which was true that she hardly knew acosta and that people of her rank were used to attack their enemies face to face not by murderous surprises the magistrates were impressed with catalinas answers yet answered to what things were beginning to look well when all was suddenly upset by two witnesses whom the reader who is a sort of accomplice after the fact having been privately let into the truths of the case and having concealed his knowledge will know at once to be false witnesses but whom the old spanish buzwigs doated on as models of all that could be looked for in the best both were very illlooking fellows as it was their duty to be and the first deposed as follows that through his quarter of tucuman the fact was notorious of acostas wife being the object of a criminal pursuit on the part of the alferez catalina that doubtless the injured husband had surprised the prisoner which of course had led to the murder to the staircase to the key to everything in short that could be wished no stop what am i saying to everything that ought to be abominated finally for he had now settled the main question that he had a friend who would take up the case where he himself from shortsightedness was obliged to lay it down this friend the pythias of this shortsighted damon started up in a frenzy of virtue at this summons and rushing to the front of the alguazils said that since his friend had proved sufficiently the fact of the alferez having been lurking in the house and having murdered a man all that rested upon him to show was how that murderer got out of the house which he could do satisfactorily for there was a balcony running along the windows on the second floor one of which windows he himself lurking in a corner of the street saw the alferez throw up and from the said balcony take a flying leap into the said street evidence like this was conclusive no defence was listened to nor indeed had the prisoner any to produce the alferez could deny neither the staircase nor the balcony the street is there to this day like the bricks in jack cades chimney testifying all that may be required and as to our friend who saw the leap there he was nobody could deny him the prisoner might indeed have suggested that she never heard of acostas wife nor had the existence of such a wife been ripened even into a suspicion but the bench were satisfied chopping logic was of no use and sentence was pronounced that on the eighth day from the day of arrest the alferez should be executed in the public square it was not amongst the weaknesses of catalina who had so often inflicted death and by her own journal thought so lightly of inflicting it if not under cowardly advantages to shrink from facing death in her own person many incidents in her career show the coolness and even gaiety with which in any case where death was apparently inevitable she would have gone to meet it but in this case she had a temptation for escaping it which was probably in her power she had only to reveal the secret of her sex and the ridiculous witnesses beyond whose testimony there was nothing at all against her must at once be covered with derision catalina had some liking for fun and a main inducement to this course was that it would enable her to say to the judges now you see what old fools youve made of yourselves every woman and child in peru will soon be laughing at you i must acknowledge my own weakness this last temptation i could not have withstood flesh is weak and fun is strong but catalina did on consideration she fancied that although the particular motive for murdering acosta would be dismissed with laughter still this might not clear her of the murder which on some other motive she might have committed but supposing that she were cleared altogether what most of all she feared was that the publication of her sex would throw a reflex light upon many past transactions in her life would instantly find its way to spain and would probably soon bring her within the tender attentions of the inquisition she kept firm to the resolution of not saving her life by this discovery and so far as her fate lay in her own hands she would as the reader will perceive from a little incident at the scaffold have perished to a certainty but even at this point how strange a case a woman falsely accused of an act which she really did commit and falsely accused of a true offence upon a motive that was impossible as the sun set upon the seventh day when the hours were numbered for the prisoner there filed into her cell four persons in religious habits they came on the charitable mission of preparing the poor convict for death catalina however watching all things narrowly remarked something earnest and significant in the eye of the leader as of one who had some secret communication to make she contrived to clasp this mans hands as if in the energy of internal struggles and he contrived to slip into hers the very smallest of billets from poor juana it contained for indeed it could contain only these three words do not confess j this one caution so simple and so brief was a talisman it did not refer to any confession of the crime that would have been assuming what juana was neither entitled nor disposed to assume but in the technical sense of the church to the act of devotional confession catalina found a single moment for a glance at it understood the whole resolutely refused to confess as a person unsettled in her religious opinions that needed spiritual instructions and the four monks withdrew to make their report the principal judge upon hearing of the prisoners impenitence granted another day at the end of that no change having occurred either in the prisoners mind or in the circumstances he issued his warrant for the execution accordingly as the sun went down the sad procession formed within the prison into the great square of tucuman it moved where the scaffold had been built and the whole city had assembled for the spectacle catalina steadily ascended the ladder of the scaffold even then she resolved not to benefit by revealing her sex even then it was that she expressed her scorn for the lubberly executioners mode of tying a knot did it herself in a shipshape orthodox manner received in return the enthusiastic plaudits of the crowd and so far ran the risk of precipitating her fate for the timid magistrates fearing a rescue from the impetuous mob angrily ordered the executioner to finish the scene the clatter of a galloping horse however at this instant forced them to pause the crowd opened a road for the agitated horseman who was the bearer of an order from the president of la plata to suspend the execution until two prisoners could be examined the whole was the work of the senora and her daughter the elder lady having gathered informations against the witnesses had pursued them to la plata there by her influence with the governor they were arrested recognised as old malefactors and in their terror had partly confessed their perjury catalina was removed to la plata solemnly acquitted and by the advice of the president for the present the connection with the senoras family was postponed indefinitely now was the last adventure approaching that ever catalina should see in the new world some fine sights she may yet see in europe but nothing after this which she has recorded in america europe if it had ever heard of her name which very shortly it shall kings pope cardinals if they were but aware of her existence which in six months they shall be would thirst for an introduction to our catalina you hardly thought now reader that she was such a great person or anybodys pet but yours and mine bless you sir she would scorn to look at us i tell you royalties are languishing to see her or soon will be but how can this come to pass if she is to continue in her present obscurity certainly it cannot without some great peripetteia or vertiginous whirl of fortune which therefore you shall now behold taking place in one turn of her next adventure that shall let in a light that shall throw back a claude lorraine gleam over all the past able to make kings that would have cared not for her under peruvian daylight come to glorify her setting beams the senora and observe whatever kindness she does to catalina speaks secretly from two hearts her own and juanas had by the advice of mr president mendonia given sufficient money for catalinas travelling expenses so far well but mr m chose to add a little codicil to this bequest of the senoras never suggested by her or by her daughter pray said this inquisitive president who surely might have found business enough in la plata pray senor pietro diaz did you ever live at concepcion and were you ever acquainted there with senor miguel de erauso that man sir was my friend what a pity that on this occasion catalina could not venture to be candid what a capital speech it would have made to say friend were you i think you could hardly be that with seven hundred miles between you but that man was my friend also and secondly my brother true it is i killed him but if you happen to know that this was by pure mistake in the dark what an old rogue you must be to throw that in my teeth which is the affliction of my life again however as so often in the same circumstances catalina thought that it would cause more ruin than it could heal to be candid and indeed if she were really p diaz esq how came she to be brother to the late mr erauso on consideration also if she could not tell all merely to have professed a fraternal connection which never was avowed by either whilst living together would not have brightened the reputation of catalina which too surely required a scouring still from my kindness for poor kate i feel uncharitably towards the president for advising senor pietro to travel for his health what had he to do with peoples health however mr peter as he had pocketed the senoras money thought it right to pocket also the advice that accompanied its payment that he might be in a condition to do so he went off to buy a horse he was in luck today for beside money and advice he obtained at a low rate a horse both beautiful and serviceable for a journey to paz it was a city of prosperous name that the cornet first moved but paz did not fulfil the promise of its name for it laid the grounds of a feud that drove our kate out of america her first adventure was a bagatelle and fitter for a jestbook than a history yet it proved no jest either since it led to the tragedy that followed riding into paz our gallant standardbearer and her bonny black horse drew all eyes comme de raison upon their separate charms this was inevitable amongst the indolent population of a spanish town and kate was used to it but having recently had a little too much of the public attention she felt nervous on remarking two soldiers eyeing the handsome horse and the handsome rider with an attention that seemed too solemn for mere aesthetics however kate was not the kind of person to let anything dwell on her spirits especially if it took the shape of impudence and whistling gaily she was riding forward when who should cross her path but the alcalde ah alcalde you see a person now that has a mission against you though quite unknown to herself he looked so sternly that kate asked if his worship had any commands these men said the alcalde these two soldiers say that this horse is stolen to one who had so narrowly and so lately escaped the balcony witness and his friend it was really no laughing matter to hear of new affidavits in preparation kate was nervous but never disconcerted in a moment she had twitched off a saddlecloth on which she sat and throwing it over the horses head so as to cover up all between the ears and the mouth she replied that she had bought and paid for the horse at la plata but now your worship if this horse has really been stolen from these men they must know well of which eye it is blind for it can be only in the right eye or the left one of the soldiers cried out instantly that it was the left eye but the other said no no you forget its the right kate maliciously called attention to this little schism but the men said ah that was nothing they were hurried but now on recollecting themselves they were agreed that it was the left eye did they stand to that oh yes positive they were left eye left upon which our kate twitching off the horsecloth said gaily to the magistrate now sir please to observe that this horse has nothing the matter with either eye and in fact it was so then his worship ordered his alguazils to apprehend the two witnesses who posted off to bread and water with other reversionary advantages whilst kate rode in quest of the best dinner that paz could furnish this alcaldes acquaintance however was not destined to drop here something had appeared in the young caballeros bearing which made it painful to have addressed him with harshness or for a moment to have entertained such a charge against such a person he despatched his cousin therefore don antonio calderon to offer his apologies and at the same time to request that the stranger whose rank and quality he regretted not to have known would do him the honor to come and dine with him this explanation and the fact that don antonio had already proclaimed his own position as cousin to the magistrate and nephew to the bishop of cuzco obliged catalina to say after thanking the gentlemen for their obliging attentions i myself hold the rank of alferez in the service of his catholic majesty i am a native of biscay and i am now repairing to cuzco on private business to cuzco exclaimed don antonio how very fortunate my cousin is a basque like you and like you he starts for cuzco tomorrow morning so that if it is agreeable to you senor alferez we will travel together it was settled that they should to travel amongst balcony witnesses and anglers for blind horses not merely with a just man but with the very abstract idea and riding allegory of justice was too delightful to the stormwearied cornet and he cheerfully accompanied don antonio to the house of the magistrate called don pedro de chavarria distinguished was his reception the alcalde personally renewed his regrets for the ridiculous scene of the two scampish oculists and presented him to his wife a splendid andalusian beauty to whom he had been married about a year this lady there is a reason for describing and the french reporter of catalinas memoirs dwells upon the theme she united he says the sweetness of the german lady with the energy of the arabian a combination hard to judge of as to her feet he adds i say nothing for she had scarcely any at all je ne parle point de ses pieds elle nen avait presque pas poor lady says a compassionate rustic no feet what a shocking thing that so fine a woman should have been so sadly mutilated oh my dear rustic youre quite in the wrong box the frenchman means this as the very highest compliment beautiful however she must have been and a cinderella i hope not a cinderellula considering that she had the inimitable walk and step of the andalusians which cannot be accomplished without something of a proportionate basis to stand upon the reason which there is as i have said for describing this lady arises out of her relation to the tragic events which followed she by her criminal levity was the cause of all and i must here warn the moralizing blunderer of two errors that he is too likely to make st that he is invited to read some extract from a licentious amour as if for its own interest d or on account of donna catalinas memoirs with a view to relieve their too martial character i have the pleasure to assure him of his being so utterly in the darkness of error that any possible change he can make in his opinions right or left must be for the better he cannot stir but he will mend which is a delightful thought for the moral and blundering mind as to the first point what little glimpse he obtains of a licentious amour is as a court of justice will sometimes show him such a glimpse simply to make intelligible the subsequent facts which depend upon it secondly as to the conceit that catalina wished to embellish her memoirs understand that no such practice then existed certainly not in spanish literature her memoirs are electrifying by their facts else in the manner of telling these facts they are systematically dry don antonio calderon was a handsome accomplished cavalier and in the course of dinner catalina was led to judge from the behavior to each other of this gentleman and the lady the alcaldes beautiful wife that they had an improper understanding this also she inferred from the furtive language of their eyes her wonder was that the alcalde should be so blind though upon that point she saw reason in a day or two to change her opinion some people see everything by affecting to see nothing the whole affair however was nothing at all to her and she would have dismissed it from her thoughts altogether but for what happened on the journey from the miserable roads eight hours a day of travelling was found quite enough for man and beast the product of which eight hours was from ten to twelve leagues on the last day but one of the journey the travelling party which was precisely the original dinner party reached a little town ten leagues short of cuzco the corregidor of this place was a friend of the alcalde and through his influence the party obtained better accommodations than those which they had usually had in a hovel calling itself a venta or in the sheltered corner of a barn the alcalde was to sleep at the corregidors house the two young cavaliers calderon and our kate had sleeping rooms at the public locanda but for the lady was reserved a little pleasurehouse in an enclosed garden this was a plaything of a house but the season being summer and the house surrounded with tropical flowers the lady preferred it in spite of its loneliness to the damp mansion of the official grandee who in her humble opinion was quite as fusty as his mansion and his mansion not much less so than himself after dining gaily together at the locanda and possibly taking a rise out of his worship the corregidor as a repeating echo of don quixote then growing popular in spanish america the young man who was no young officer and the young officer who was no young man lounged down together to the little pavilion in the flowergarden with the purpose of paying their respects to the presiding belle they were graciously received and had the honor of meeting there his mustiness the alcalde and his fustiness the corregidor whose conversation was surely improving but not equally brilliant how they got on under the weight of two such muffs has been a mystery for two centuries but they did to a certainty for the party did not break up till eleven tea and turn out you could not call it for there was the turn out in rigor but not the tea one thing however catalina by mere accident had an opportunity of observing and observed with pain the two official gentlemen had gone down the steps into the garden catalina having forgot her hat went back into the little vestibule to look for it there stood the lady and don antonio exchanging a few final words they were final and a few final signs amongst the last kate observed distinctly this and distinctly she understood it first drawing calderons attention to the gesture as one of significant pantomime by raising her forefinger the lady snuffed out one of the candles the young man answered it by a look of intelligence and all three passed down the steps together the lady was disposed to take the cool air and accompanied them to the gardengate but in passing down the walk catalina noticed a second illomened sign that all was not right two glaring eyes she distinguished amongst the shrubs for a moment and a rustling immediately after whats that said the lady and don antonio answered carelessly a bird flying out of the bushes catalina as usual had read everything not a wrinkle or a rustle was lost upon her and therefore when she reached the locanda knowing to an iota all that was coming she did not retire to bed but paced before the house she had not long to wait in fifteen minutes the door opened softly and out stepped calderon kate walked forward and faced him immediately telling him laughingly that it was not good for his health to go abroad on this night the young man showed some impatience upon which very seriously kate acquainted him with her suspicions and with the certainty that the alcalde was not so blind as he had seemed calderon thanked her for the information would be upon his guard but to prevent further expostulation he wheeled round instantly into the darkness catalina was too well convinced however of the mischief on foot to leave him thus she followed rapidly and passed silently into the garden almost at the same time with calderon both took their stations behind trees calderon watching nothing but the burning candles catalina watching circumstances to direct her movements the candles burned brightly in the little pavilion presently one was extinguished upon this calderon pressed forward to the steps hastily ascended them and passed into the vestibule catalina followed on his traces what succeeded was all one scene of continued dreadful dumb show different passions of panic or deadly struggle or hellish malice absolutely suffocated all articulate words in a moment a gurgling sound was heard as of a wild beast attempting vainly to yell over some creature that it was strangling next came a tumbling out at the door of one black mass which heaved and parted at intervals into two figures which closed which parted again which at last fell down the steps together then appeared a figure in white it was the unhappy andalusian and she seeing the outline of catalinas person ran up to her unable to utter one syllable pitying the agony of her horror catalina took her within her own cloak and carried her out at the garden gate calderon had by this time died and the maniacal alcalde had risen up to pursue his wife but kate foreseeing what he would do had stepped silently within the shadow of the garden wall looking down the road to the town and seeing nobody moving the maniac for some purpose went back to the house this moment kate used to recover the locanda with the lady still panting in horror what was to be done to think of concealment in this little place was out of the question the alcalde was a man of local power and it was certain that he would kill his wife on the spot kates generosity would not allow her to have any collusion with this murderous purpose at cuzco the principal convent was ruled by a near relative of the andalusian and there she would find shelter kate therefore saddled her horse rapidly placed the lady behind and rode off in the darkness about five miles out of the town their road was crossed by a torrent over which they could not hit the bridge forward cried the lady and kate repeating the word to the horse the docile creature leaped down into the water they were all sinking at first but having its head free the horse swam clear of all obstacles through the midnight darkness and scrambled out on the opposite bank the two riders were dripping from the shoulders downward but seeing a light twinkling from a cottage window kate rode up obtained a little refreshment and the benefit of a fire from a poor laboring man from this man she also bought a warm mantle for the lady who besides her torrent bath was dressed in a light evening robe so that but for the horsemans cloak of kate she would have perished but there was no time to lose they had already lost two hours from the consequences of their cold bath cuzco was still eighteen miles distant and the alcaldes shrewdness would at once divine this to be his wifes mark they remounted very soon the silent night echoed the hoofs of a pursuing rider and now commenced the most frantic race in which each party rode as if the whole game of life were staked upon the issue the pace was killing and kate has delivered it as her opinion in the memoirs which she wrote that the alcalde was the better mounted this may be doubted and certainly kate had ridden too many years in the spanish cavalry to have any fear of his worships horsemanship but it was a prodigious disadvantage that her horse had to carry double while the horse ridden by her opponent was one of those belonging to the murdered don antonio and known to kate as a powerful animal at length they had come within three miles at cuzco the road after this descended the whole way to the city and in some places rapidly so as to require a cool rider suddenly a deep trench appeared traversing the whole extent of a broad heath it was useless to evade it to have hesitated was to be lost kate saw the necessity of clearing it but doubted much whether her poor exhausted horse after twentyone miles of work so severe had strength for the effort kates maxim however which never yet had failed both figuratively for life and literally for the saddle was to ride at everything that showed a front of resistance she did so now having come upon the trench rather too suddenly she wheeled round for the advantage of coming down upon it more determinately rode resolutely at it and gained the opposite bank the hind feet of her horse were sinking back from the rottenness of the ground but the strong supporting bridlehand of kate carried him forward and in ten minutes more they would be in cuzco this being seen by the vicious alcalde who had built great hopes on the trench he unslung his carbine pulled up and fired after the bonny black horse and its bonny fair riders but this manoeuvre would have lost his worship any bet that he might have had depending on this admirable steeplechase had i been stakeholder what a pleasure it would have been in fifteen minutes from this very vicious shot to pay into kates hands every shilling of the deposits i would have listened to no nonsense about referees or protests the bullets says kate whistled round the poor clinging lady en croupe luckily none struck her but one wounded the horse and that settled the odds kate now planted herself well in her stirrups to enter cuzco almost dangerously a winner for the horse was so maddened by the wound and the road so steep that he went like blazes and it really became difficult for kate to guide him with any precision through narrow episcopal paths henceforwards the wounded horse required kates continued attention and yet in the mere luxury of strife it was impossible for kate to avoid turning a little in her saddle to see the alcaldes performance on this tight rope of the trench his worships horsemanship being perhaps rather rusty and he not perfectly acquainted with his horse it would have been agreeable to compromise the case by riding round or dismounting but all that was impossible the job must be done and i am happy to report for the readers satisfaction the sequel so far as kate could attend the performance gathering himself up for mischief the alcalde took a sweep as if ploughing out the line of some vast encampment or tracing the pomrium for some future rome then like thunder and lightning with arms flying aloft in the air down he came upon the trembling trench but the horse refused the leap and as the only compromise that his unlearned brain could suggest he threw his worship right over his ears lodging him safely in a sandheap that rose with clouds of dust and screams of birds into the morning air kate had now no time to send back her compliments in a musical halloo the alcalde missed breaking his neck on this occasion very narrowly but his neck was of no use to him in twenty minutes more as the reader will soon find kate rode right onwards and coming in with a lady behind her horse bloody and pace such as no hounds could have lived with she ought to have made a great sensation in cuzco but unhappily the people were all in bed the steeplechase into cuzco had been a fine headlong thing considering the torrent the trench the wounded horse the lovely lady with her agonizing fears mounted behind kate together with the meek dovelike dawn but the finale crowded together the quickest succession of changes that out of a melodrama can ever have been witnessed kate reached the convent in safety carried into the cloisters and delivered like a parcel the fair andalusian but to rouse the servants caused delay and on returning to the street through the broad gateway of the convent whom should she face but the alcalde how he escaped the trench who can tell he had no time to write memoirs his horse was too illiterate but he had escaped temper not at all improved by that adventure and now raised to a hell of malignity by seeing that he had lost his prey in the morning light he now saw how to use his sword he attacked kate with fury both were exhausted and kate besides that she had no personal quarrel with the alcalde having now accomplished her sole object in saving the lady would have been glad of a truce she could with difficulty wield her sword and the alcalde had so far the advantage that he wounded kate severely that roused her ancient blood she turned on him now with determination at that moment in rode two servants of the alcalde who took part with their master these odds strengthened kates resolution but weakened her chances just then however rode in and ranged himself on kates side the servant of the murdered don calderon in an instant kate had pushed her sword through the alcalde who died upon the spot in an instant the servant of calderon had fled in an instant the alguazils had come up they and the servants of the alcalde pressed furiously on kate who now again was fighting for life against such odds she was rapidly losing ground when in an instant on the opposite side of the street the great gates of the episcopal palace rolled open thither it was that calderons servant had fled the bishop and his attendants hurried across senor caballador said the bishop in the name of the virgin i enjoin you to surrender your sword my lord said kate i dare not do it with so many enemies about me but i replied the bishop become answerable to the law for your safe keeping upon which with filial reverence all parties dropped their swords kate being severely wounded the bishop led her into his palace in an instant came the catastrophe kates discovery could no longer be delayed the blood flowed too rapidly the wound was in her bosom she requested a private interview with the bishop all was known in a moment for surgeons and attendants were summoned hastily and kate had fainted the good bishop pitied her and had her attended in his palace then removed to a convent then to a second at lima and after many months had passed his report to the spanish government at home of all the particulars drew from the king of spain and from the pope an order that the nun should be transferred to spain yes at length the warrior lady the blooming cornet this nun that is so martial this dragoon that is so lovely must visit again the home of her childhood which now for seventeen years she has not seen all spain portugal italy rang with her adventures spain from north to south was frantic with desire to behold her fiery child whose girlish romance whose patriotic heroism electrified the national imagination the king of spain must kiss his faithful daughter that would not suffer his banner to see dishonor the pope must kiss his wandering daughter that henceforwards will be a lamb travelling back into the christian fold potentates so great as these when they speak words of love do not speak in vain all was forgiven the sacrilege the bloodshed the flight and the scorn of st peters keys the pardons were made out were signed were sealed and the chanceries of earth were satisfied ah what a day of sorrow and of joy was that one day in the first week of november when the returning kate drew near to the shore of andalusia when descending into the ships barge she was rowed to the piers of cadiz by bargemen in the royal liveries when she saw every ship street house convent church crowded like a day of judgment with human faces with men with women with children all bending the lights of their flashing and their loving eyes upon herself forty myriads of people had gathered in cadiz alone all andalusia had turned out to receive her ah what joy if she had not looked back to the andes to their dreadful summits and their more dreadful feet ah what sorrow if she had not been forced by music and endless banners and triumphant clamors to turn away from the andes to the joyous shore which she approached upon this shore stood ready to receive her in front of all this mighty crowd the prime minister of spain the same conde olivarez who but one year before had been so haughty and so defying to our haughty and defying duke of buckingham but a year ago the prince of wales was in spain and he also was welcomed with triumph and great joy but not with the hundredth part of that enthusiasm which now met the returning nun and olivarez that had spoken so roughly to the english duke to her was sweet as summer footnote griffith in shakspeare when vindicating in that immortal scene with queen catherine cardinal wolsey through endless crowds of festive compatriots he conducted her to the king the king folded her in his arms and could never be satisfied with listening to her he sent for her continually to his presence he delighted in her conversation so new so natural so spirited he settled a pension upon her at that time of unprecedented amount in the case of a subaltern officer and by his desire because the year was a year of jubilee she departed in a few months from madrid to rome she went through barcelona there and everywhere welcomed as the lady whom the king delighted to honor she travelled to rome and all doors flew open to receive her she was presented to his holiness with letters from his most catholic majesty but letters there needed none the pope admired her as much as all before had done he caused her to recite all her adventures and what he loved most in her account was the sincere and sorrowing spirit in which she described herself as neither better nor worse than she had been neither proud was kate nor sycophantishly and falsely humble urban viii it was that then filled the chair of st peter he did not neglect to raise his daughters thoughts from earthly things he pointed her eyes to the clouds that were above the dome of st peters cathedral he told her what the cathedral had told her in the gorgeous clouds of the andes and the vesper lights how sweet a thing how divine a thing it was for christs sake to forgive all injuries and how he trusted that no more she would think of bloodshed he also said two words to her in latin which if i had time to repeat a spanish bishops remark to kate some time afterwards upon those two mysterious words with kates most natural and ingenuous answer to the bishop upon what she supposed to be their meaning would make the reader smile not less than they made myself you know that kate did understand a little latin which probably had not been much improved by riding in the light dragoons i must find time however whether the press and the compositors are in a fury or not to mention that the pope in his farewell audience to his dear daughter whom he was to see no more gave her a general license to wear henceforth in all countries even in partibus infidelium a cavalry officers dress boots spurs sabre and sabretache in fact anything that she and the horse guards might agree upon consequently reader remember for your life never to say one word nor suffer any tailor to say one word against those wellington trousers made in the chestnut forest for understand that the papal indulgence as to this point runs backwards as well as forwards it is equally shocking and heretical to murmur against trousers in the forgotten rear or against trousers yet to come from rome kate returned to spain she even went to st sebastians to the city but whether it was that her heart failed her or not never to the convent she roamed up and down everywhere she was welcome everywhere an honored guest but everywhere restless the poor and humble never ceased from their admiration of her and amongst the rich and aristocratic of spain with the king at their head kate found especial love from two classes of men the cardinals and bishops all doated upon her as their daughter that was returning the military men all doated upon her as their sister that was retiring some time or other when i am allowed more elbowroom i will tell you why it is that i myself love this kate now at this moment when it is necessary for me to close if i allow you one question before laying down my pen if i say come now be quick ask anything you have to ask for in one minute i am going to write finis after which unless the queen wished it i could not add a syllable twenty to one i guess what your question will be you will ask me what became of kate what was her end ah reader but if i answer that question you will say i have not answered it if i tell you that secret you will say that the secret is still hidden yet because i have promised and because you will be angry if i do not let me do my best and bad is the best after ten years of restlessness in spain with thoughts always turning back to the andes kate heard of an expedition on the point of sailing to spanish america all soldiers knew her so that she had information of everything that stirred in camps men of the highest military rank were going out with the expedition but they all loved kate as a sister and were delighted to hear that she would join their mess on board ship this ship with others sailed whither finally bound i really forget but on reaching america all the expedition touched at vera cruz thither a great crowd of the military went on shore the leading officers made a separate party for the same purpose their intention was to have a gay happy dinner after their long confinement to a ship at the chief hotel and happy in perfection it could not be unless kate would consent to join it she that was ever kind to brother soldiers agreed to do so she descended into the boat along with them and in twenty minutes the boat touched the shore all the bevy of gay laughing officers junior and senior like schoolboys escaping from school jumped on shore and walked hastily as their time was limited up to the hotel arriving there all turned round in eagerness saying where is our dear kate ah yes my dear kate at that solemn moment where indeed were you she had certainly taken her seat in the boat that was sure nobody in the general confusion was certain of having seen her on coming ashore the sea was searched for her the forests were ransacked the sea made no answer the forests gave up no sign i have a conjecture of my own but her brother soldiers were lost in sorrow and confusion and could never arrive even at a conjecture that happened two hundred and fourteen years ago here is the brief sum of all this nun sailed from spain to peru and she found no rest for the sole of her foot this nun sailed back from peru to spain and she found no rest for the agitations of her heart this nun sailed again from spain to america and she found the rest which all of us find but where it was could never be made known to the father of spanish camps that sat in madrid nor to kates spiritual father that sat in rome known it is to the great father that once whispered to kate on the andes but else it has been a secret for two centuries and to man it remains a secret for ever and ever flight of a tartar tribe there is no great event in modern history or perhaps it may be said more broadly none in all history from its earliest records less generally known or more striking to the imagination than the flight eastwards of a principal tartar nation across the boundless steppes of asia in the latter half of the last century the terminus a quo of this flight and the terminus ad quem are equally magnificent the mightiest of christian thrones being the one the mightiest of pagan the other and the grandeur of these two terminal objects is harmoniously supported by the romantic circumstances of the flight in the abruptness of its commencement and the fierce velocity of its execution we read an expression of the wild barbaric character of the agents in the unity of purpose connecting this myriad of wills and in the blind but unerring aim at a mark so remote there is something which recalls to the mind those almighty instincts that propel the migrations of the swallow or the life withering marches of the locust then again in the gloomy vengeance of russia and her vast artillery which hung upon the rear and the skirts of the fugitive vassals we are reminded of miltonic images such for instance as that of the solitary hand pursuing through desert spaces and through ancient chaos a rebellious host and overtaking with volleying thunders those who believed themselves already within the security of darkness and of distance we shall have occasion farther on to compare this event with other great national catastrophes as to the magnitude of the suffering but it may also challenge a comparison with similar events under another relation viz as to its dramatic capabilities few cases perhaps in romance or history can sustain a close collation with this as to the complexity of its separate interests the great outline of the enterprise taken in connection with the operative motives hidden or avowed and the religious sanctions under which it was pursued give to the case a triple character st that of a conspiracy with as close a unity in the incidents and as much of a personal interest in the moving characters with fine dramatic contrasts as belongs to venice preserved or to the fiesco of schiller dly that of a great military expedition offering the same romantic features of vast distances to be traversed vast reverses to be sustained untried routes enemies obscurely ascertained and hardships too vaguely prefigured which mark the egyptian expedition of cambyses the anabasis of the younger cyrus and the subsequent retreat of the ten thousand to the black sea the parthian expeditions of the romans especially those of crassus and julian or as more disastrous than any of them and in point of space as well as in amount of forces more extensive the russian anabasis and katabasis of napoleon dly that of a religious exodus authorized by an oracle venerated throughout many nations of asia an exodus therefore in so far resembling the great scriptural exodus of the israelites under moses and joshua as well as in the very peculiar distinction of carrying along with them their entire families women children slaves their herds of cattle and of sheep their horses and their camels this triple character of the enterprise naturally invests it with a more comprehensive interest but the dramatic interest which we ascribed to it or its fitness for a stage representation depends partly upon the marked variety and the strength of the personal agencies concerned and partly upon the succession of scenical situations even the steppes the camels the tents the snowy and the sandy deserts are not beyond the scale of our modern representative powers as often called into action in the theatres both of paris and london and the series of situations unfolded beginning with the general conflagration on the wolga passing thence to the disastrous scenes of the flight as it literally was in its commencement to the tartar siege of the russian fortress koulagina the bloody engagement with the cossacks in the mountain passes at ouchim the surprisal by the bashkirs and the advanced posts of the russian army at torgau the private conspiracy at this point against the khan the long succession of running fights the parting massacres at the lake of tengis under the eyes of the chinese and finally the tragical retribution to zebekdorchi at the huntinglodge of the chinese emperor all these situations communicate a scenical animation to the wild romance if treated dramatically whilst a higher and a philosophic interest belongs to it as a case of authentic history commemorating a great revolution for good and for evil in the fortunes of a whole people a people semibarbarous but simple hearted and of ancient descent on the lst of january the young prince oubacha assumed the sceptre of the kalmucks upon the death of his father some part of the power attached to this dignity he had already wielded since his fourteenth year in quality of vicekhan by the express appointment and with the avowed support of the russian government he was now about eighteen years of age amiable in his personal character and not without titles to respect in his public character as a sovereign prince in times more peaceable and amongst a people more entirely civilized or more humanized by religion it is even probable that he might have discharged his high duties with considerable distinction but his lot was thrown upon stormy times and a most difficult crisis amongst tribes whose native ferocity was exasperated by debasing forms of superstition and by a nationality as well as an inflated conceit of their own merit absolutely unparalleled whilst the circumstances of their hard and trying position under the jealous surveillance of an irresistible lord paramount in the person of the russian czar gave a fiercer edge to the natural unamiableness of the kalmuck disposition and irritated its gloomier qualities into action under the restless impulses of suspicion and permanent distrust no prince could hope for a cordial allegiance from his subjects or a peaceful reign under the circumstances of the case for the dilemma in which a kalmuck ruler stood at present was of this nature wanting the sanction and support of the czar he was inevitably too weak from without to command confidence from his subjects or resistance to his competitors on the other hand with this kind of support and deriving his title in any degree from the favor of the imperial court he became almost in that extent an object of hatred at home and within the whole compass of his own territory he was at once an object of hatred for the past being a living monument of national independence ignominiously surrendered and an object of jealousy for the future as one who had already advertised himself to be a fitting tool for the ultimate purposes whatsoever those might prove to be of the russian court coming himself to the kalmuck sceptre under the heaviest weight of prejudice from the unfortunate circumstances of his position it might have been expected that oubacha would have been preeminently an object of detestation for besides his known dependence upon the cabinet of st petersburg the direct line of succession had been set aside and the principle of inheritance violently suspended in favor of his own father so recently as nineteen years before the era of his own accession consequently within the lively remembrance of the existing generation he therefore almost equally with his father stood within the full current of the national prejudices and might have anticipated the most pointed hostility but it was not so such are the caprices in human affairs that he was even in a moderate sense popular a benefit which wore the more cheering aspect and the promises of permanence inasmuch as he owed it exclusively to his personal qualities of kindness and affability as well as to the beneficence of his government on the other hand to balance this unlookedfor prosperity at the outset of his reign he met with a rival in popular favor almost a competitor in the person of zebekdorchi a prince with considerable pretensions to the throne and perhaps it might be said with equal pretensions zebekdorchi was a direct descendant of the same royal house as himself through a different branch on public grounds his claim stood perhaps on a footing equally good with that of oubacha whilst his personal qualities even in those aspects which seemed to a philosophical observer most odious and repulsive promised the most effectual aid to the dark purposes of an intriguer or a conspirator and were generally fitted to win a popular support precisely in those points where oubacha was most defective he was much superior in external appearance to his rival on the throne and so far better qualified to win the good opinion of a semibarbarous people whilst his dark intellectual qualities of machiavelian dissimulation profound hypocrisy and perfidy which knew no touch of remorse were admirably calculated to sustain any ground which he might win from the simplehearted people with whom he had to deal and from the frank carelessness of his unconscious competitor at the very outset of his treacherous career zebekdorchi was sagacious enough to perceive that nothing could be gained by open declaration of hostility to the reigning prince the choice had been a deliberate act on the part of russia and elizabeth petrowna was not the person to recall her own favors with levity or upon slight grounds openly therefore to have declared his enmity towards his relative on the throne could have had no effect but that of arming suspicions against his own ulterior purposes in a quarter where it was most essential to his interest that for the present all suspicion should be hoodwinked accordingly after much meditation the course he took for opening his snares was this he raised a rumor that his own life was in danger from the plots of several saissang that is kalmuck nobles who were leagued together under an oath to assassinate him and immediately after assuming a wellcounterfeited alarm he fled to tcherkask followed by sixtyfive tents from this place he kept up a correspondence with the imperial court and by way of soliciting his cause more effectually he soon repaired in person to st petersburg once admitted to personal conferences with the cabinet he found no difficulty in winning over the russian counsels to a concurrence with some of his political views and thus covertly introducing the point of that wedge which was finally to accomplish his purposes in particular he persuaded the russian government to make a very important alteration in the constitution of the kalmuck state council which in effect reorganized the whole political condition of the state and disturbed the balance of power as previously adjusted of this council in the kalmuck language called sarga there were eight members called sargatchi and hitherto it had been the custom that these eight members should be entirely subordinate to the khan holding in fact the ministerial character of secretaries and assistants but in no respect ranking as coordinate authorities that had produced some inconveniences in former reigns and it was easy for zebekdorchi to point the jealousy of the russian court to others more serious which might arise in future circumstances of war or other contingencies it was resolved therefore to place the sargatchi henceforward on a footing of perfect independence and therefore as regarded responsibility on a footing of equality with the khan their independence however had respect only to their own sovereign for towards russia they were placed in a new attitude of direct duty and accountability by the creation in their favor of small pensions roubles a year which however to a kalmuck of that day were more considerable than might be supposed and had a further value as marks of honorary distinction emanating from a great empress thus far the purposes of zebekdorchi were served effectually for the moment but apparently it was only for the moment since in the further development of his plots this very dependency upon russian influence would be the most serious obstacle in his way there was however another point carried which outweighed all inferior considerations as it gave him a power of setting aside discretionally whatsoever should arise to disturb his plots he was himself appointed president and controller of the sargatchi the russian court had been aware of his high pretensions by birth and hoped by this promotion to satisfy the ambition which in some degree was acknowledged to be a reasonable passion for any man occupying his situation having thus completely blindfolded the cabinet of russia zebekdorchi proceeded in his new character to fulfil his political mission with the khan of the kalmucks so artfully did he prepare the road for his favorable reception at the court of this prince that he was at once and universally welcomed as a public benefactor the pensions of the counsellors were so much additional wealth poured into the tartar exchequer as to the ties of dependency thus created experience had not yet enlightened these simple tribes as to that result and that he himself should be the chief of these mercenary counsellors was so far from being charged upon zebek as any offence or any ground of suspicion that his relative the khan returned him hearty thanks for his services under the belief that he could have accepted this appointment only with a view to keep out other and more unwelcome pretenders who would not have had the same motives of consanguinity or friendship for executing its duties in a spirit of kindness to the kalmucks the first use which he made of his new functions about the khans person was to attack the court of russia by a romantic villany not easy to be credited for those very acts of interference with the council which he himself had prompted this was a dangerous step but it was indispensable to his further advance upon the gloomy path which he had traced out for himself a triple vengeance was what he meditated upon the russian cabinet for having undervalued his own pretensions to the throne upon his amiable rival for having supplanted him and upon all those of the nobility who had manifested their sense of his weakness by their neglect or their sense of his perfidious character by their suspicions here was a colossal outline of wickedness and by one in his situation feeble as it might seem for the accomplishment of its humblest parts how was the total edifice to be reared in its comprehensive grandeur he a worm as he was could he venture to assail the mighty behemoth of muscovy the potentate who counted three hundred languages around the footsteps of his throne and from whose lion ramp recoiled alike baptized and infidel christendom on the one side strong by her intellect and her organization and the barbaric east on the other with her unnumbered numbers the match was a monstrous one but in its very monstrosity there lay this germ of encouragement that it could not be suspected the very hopelessness of the scheme grounded his hope and he resolved to execute a vengeance which should involve as it were in the unity of a welllaid tragic fable all whom he judged to be his enemies that vengeance lay in detaching from the russian empire the whole kalmuck nation and breaking up that system of intercourse which had thus far been beneficial to both this last was a consideration which moved him but little true it was that russia to the kalmucks had secured lands and extensive pasturage true it was that the kalmucks reciprocally to russia had furnished a powerful cavalry but the latter loss would be part of his triumph and the former might be more than compensated in other climates under other sovereigns here was a scheme which in its final accomplishment would avenge him bitterly on the czarina and in the course of its accomplishment might furnish him with ample occasions for removing his other enemies it may be readily supposed indeed that he who could deliberately raise his eyes to the russian autocrat as an antagonist in single duel with himself was not likely to feel much anxiety about kalmuck enemies of whatever rank he took his resolution therefore sternly and irrevocably to effect this astonishing translation of an ancient people across the pathless deserts of central asia intersected continually by rapid rivers rarely furnished with bridges and of which the fords were known only to those who might think it for their interest to conceal them through many nations inhospitable or hostile frost and snow around them from the necessity of commencing their flight in the winter famine in their front and the sabre or even the artillery of an offended and mighty empress hanging upon their rear for thousands of miles but what was to be their final mark the port of shelter after so fearful a course of wandering two things were evident it must be some power at a great distance from russia so as to make return even in that view hopeless and it must be a power of sufficient rank to ensure them protection from any hostile efforts on the part of the czarina for reclaiming them or for chastising their revolt both conditions were united obviously in the person of kien long the reigning emperor of china who was farther recommended to them by his respect for the head of their religion to china therefore and as their first rendezvous to the shadow of the great chinese wall it was settled by zebek that they should direct their flight next came the question of time when should the flight commence and finally the more delicate question as to the choice of accomplices to extend the knowledge of the conspiracy too far was to insure its betrayal to the russian government yet at some stage of the preparations it was evident that a very extensive confidence must be made because in no other way could the mass of the kalmuck population be persuaded to furnish their families with the requisite equipments for so long a migration this critical step however it was resolved to defer up to the latest possible moment and at all events to make no general communication on the subject until the time of departure should be definitely settled in the meantime zebek admitted only three persons to his confidence of whom oubacha the reigning prince was almost necessarily one but him from his yielding and somewhat feeble character he viewed rather in the light of a tool than as one of his active accomplices those whom if anybody he admitted to an unreserved participation in his counsels were two only the great lama among the kalmucks and his own fatherinlaw erempel a ruling prince of some tribe in the neighborhood of the caspian sea recommended to his favor not so much by any strength of talent corresponding to the occasion as by his blind devotion to himself and his passionate anxiety to promote the elevation of his daughter and his soninlaw to the throne of a sovereign prince a titular prince zebek already was but this dignity without the substantial accompaniment of a sceptre seemed but an empty sound to both of these ambitious rivals the other accomplice whose name was loosangdchaltzan and whose rank was that of lama or kalmuck pontiff was a person of far more distinguished pretensions he had something of the same gloomy and terrific pride which marked the character of zebek himself manifesting also the same energy accompanied by the same unfaltering cruelty and a natural facility of dissimulation even more profound it was by this man that the other question was settled as to the time for giving effect to their designs his own pontifical character had suggested to him that in order to strengthen their influence with the vast mob of simpleminded men whom they were to lead into a howling wilderness after persuading them to lay desolate their own ancient hearths it was indispensable that they should be able in cases of extremity to plead the express sanction of god for their entire enterprise this could only be done by addressing themselves to the great head of their religion the dalailama of tibet him they easily persuaded to countenance their schemes and an oracle was delivered solemnly at tibet to the effect that no ultimate prosperity would attend this great exodus unless it were pursued through the years of the tiger and the hare now the kalmuck custom is to distinguish their years by attaching to each a denomination taken from one of twelve animals the exact order of succession being absolutely fixed so that the cycle revolves of course through a period of a dozen years consequently if the approaching year of the tiger were suffered to escape them in that case the expedition must be delayed for twelve years more within which period even were no other unfavorable changes to arise it was pretty well foreseen that the russian government would take the most effectual means for bridling their vagrant propensities by a ring fence of forts or military posts to say nothing of the still readier plan for securing their fidelity a plan already talked of in all quarters by exacting a large body of hostages selected from the families of the most influential nobles on these cogent considerations it was solemnly determined that this terrific experiment should be made in the next year of the tiger which happened to fall upon the christian year with respect to the month there was unhappily for the kalmucks even less latitude allowed to their choice than with respect to the year it was absolutely necessary or it was thought so that the different divisions of the nation which pastured their flocks on both banks of the wolga should have the means of effecting an instantaneous junction because the danger of being intercepted by flying columns of the imperial armies was precisely the greatest at the outset now from the want of bridges or sufficient river craft for transporting so vast a body of men the sole means which could be depended upon especially where so many women children and camels were concerned was ice and this in a state of sufficient firmness could not be absolutely counted upon before the month of january hence it happened that this astonishing exodus of a whole nation before so much as a whisper of the design had begun to circulate amongst those whom it most interested before it was even suspected that any mans wishes pointed in that direction had been definitively appointed for january of the year and almost up to the christmas of the poor simple kalmuck herdsmen and their families were going nightly to their peaceful beds without even dreaming that the fiat had already gone forth from their rulers which consigned those quiet abodes together with the peace and comfort which reigned within them to a withering desolation now close at hand meantime war raged on a great scale between russia and the sultan and until the time arrived for throwing off their vassalage it was necessary that oubacha should contribute his usual contingent of martial aid nay it had unfortunately become prudent that he should contribute much more than his usual aid human experience gives ample evidence that in some mysterious and unaccountable way no great design is ever agitated no matter how few or how faithful may be the participators but that some presentiment some dim misgiving is kindled amongst those whom it is chiefly important to blind and however it might have happened certain it is that already when as yet no syllable of the conspiracy had been breathed to any man whose very existence was not staked upon its concealment nevertheless some vague and uneasy jealousy had arisen in the russian cabinet as to the future schemes of the kalmuck khan and very probable it is that but for the war then raging and the consequent prudence of conciliating a very important vassal or at least of abstaining from what would powerfully alienate him even at that moment such measures would have been adopted as must for ever have intercepted the kalmuck schemes slight as were the jealousies of the imperial court they had not escaped the machiavelian eyes of zebek and the lama and under their guidance oubacha bending to the circumstances of the moment and meeting the jealousy of the russian court with a policy corresponding to their own strove by unusual zeal to efface the czarinas unfavorable impressions he enlarged the scale of his contributions and that so prodigiously that he absolutely carried to head quarters a force of cavalry fully equipped some go further and rate the amount beyond but the smaller estimate is at all events within the truth with this magnificent array of cavalry heavy as well as light the khan went into the field under great expectations and these he more than realized having the good fortune to be concerned with so ill organized and disorderly a description of force as that which at all times composed the bulk of a turkish army he carried victory along with his banners gained many partial successes and at last in a pitched battle overthrew the turkish force opposed to him with a loss of men left upon the field these splendid achievements seemed likely to operate in various ways against the impending revolt oubacha had now a strong motive in the martial glory acquired for continuing his connection with the empire in whose service he had won it and by whom only it could be fully appreciated he was now a great marshal of a great empire one of the paladins around the imperial throne in china he would be nobody or worse than that a mendicantalien prostrate at the feet and soliciting the precarious alms of a prince with whom he had no connection besides it might reasonably be expected that the czarina grateful for the really efficient aid given by the tartar prince would confer upon him such eminent rewards as might be sufficient to anchor his hopes upon russia and to wean him from every possible seduction these were the obvious suggestions of prudence and good sense to every man who stood neutral in the case but they were disappointed the czarina knew her obligations to the khan but she did not acknowledge them wherefore that is a mystery perhaps never to be explained so it was however the khan went unhonored no ukase ever proclaimed his merits and perhaps had he even been abundantly recompensed by russia there were others who would have defeated these tendencies to reconciliation erempel zebek and loosang the lama were pledged lifedeep to prevent any accommodation and their efforts were unfortunately seconded by those of their deadliest enemies in the russian court there were at that time some great nobles preoccupied with feelings of hatred and blind malice towards the kalmucks quite as strong as any which the kalmucks could harbor towards russia and not perhaps so wellfounded just as much as the kalmucks hated the russian yoke their galling assumption of authority the marked air of disdain as towards a nation of ugly stupid and filthy barbarians which too generally marked the russian bearing and language but above all the insolent contempt or even outrages which the russian governors or great military commandants tolerated in their followers towards the barbarous religion and superstitious mummeries of the kalmuck priesthood precisely in that extent did the ferocity of the russian resentment and their wrath at seeing the trampled worm turn or attempt a feeble retaliation react upon the unfortunate kalmucks at this crisis it is probable that envy and wounded pride upon witnessing the splendid victories of oubacha and momotbacha over the turks and bashkirs contributed strength to the russian irritation and it must have been through the intrigues of those nobles about her person who chiefly smarted under these feelings that the czarina could ever have lent herself to the unwise and ungrateful policy pursued at this critical period towards the kalmuck khan that czarina was no longer elizabeth petrowna it was catharine the second a princess who did not often err so injuriously injuriously for herself as much as for others in the measures of her government she had soon ample reason for repenting of her false policy meantime how much it must have co operated with the other motives previously acting upon oubacha in sustaining his determination to revolt and how powerfully it must have assisted the efforts of all the tartar chieftains in preparing the minds of their people to feel the necessity of this difficult enterprise by arming their pride and their suspicions against the russian government through the keenness of their sympathy with the wrongs of their insulted prince may be readily imagined it is a fact and it has been confessed by candid russians themselves when treating of this great dismemberment that the conduct of the russian cabinet throughout the period of suspense and during the crisis of hesitation in the kalmuck council was exactly such as was most desirable for the purposes of the conspirators it was such in fact as to set the seal to all their machinations by supplying distinct evidences and official vouchers for what could otherwise have been at the most matters of doubtful suspicion and indirect presumption nevertheless in the face of all these arguments and even allowing their weight so far as not at all to deny the injustice or the impolicy of the imperial ministers it is contended by many persons who have reviewed the affair with a command of all the documents bearing on the case more especially the letters or minutes of council subsequently discovered in the handwriting of zebekdorchi and the important evidence of the russian captive weseloff who was carried off by the kalmucks in their flight that beyond all doubt oubacha was powerless for any purpose of impeding or even of delaying the revolt he himself indeed was under religious obligations of the most terrific solemnity never to flinch from the enterprise or even to slacken in his zeal for zebekdorchi distrusting the firmness of his resolution under any unusual pressure of alarm or difficulty had in the very earliest stage of the conspiracy availed himself of the khans well known superstition to engage him by means of previous concert with the priests and their head the lama in some dark and mysterious rites of consecration terminating in oaths under such terrific sanctions as no kalmuck would have courage to violate as far therefore as regarded the personal share of the khan in what was to come zebek was entirely at his ease he knew him to be so deeply pledged by religious terrors to the prosecution of the conspiracy that no honors within the czarinas gift could have possibly shaken his adhesion and then as to threats from the same quarter he knew him to be sealed against those fears by others of a gloomier character and better adapted to his peculiar temperament for oubacha was a brave man as respected all bodily enemies or the dangers of human warfare but was as sensitive and timid as the most superstitious of old women in facing the frowns of a priest or under the vague anticipations of ghostly retributions but had it been otherwise and had there been any reason to apprehend an unsteady demeanor on the part of this prince at the approach of the critical moment such were the changes already effected in the state of their domestic politics amongst the tartars by the undermining arts of zebekdorchi and his ally the lama that very little importance would have attached to that doubt all power was now effectually lodged in the hands of zebekdorchi he was the true and absolute wielder of the kalmuck sceptre all measures of importance were submitted to his discretion and nothing was finally resolved but under his dictation this result he had brought about in a year or two by means sufficiently simple first of all by availing himself of the prejudice in his favor so largely diffused amongst the lowest of the kalmucks that his own title to the throne in quality of greatgrandson in a direct line from ajouka the most illustrious of all the kalmuck khans stood upon a better basis than that of oubacha who derived from a collateral branch secondly with respect to that sole advantage which oubacha possessed above himself in the ratification of his title by improving this difference between their situations to the disadvantage of his competitor as one who had not scrupled to accept that triumph from an alien power at the price of his independence which he himself as he would have it understood disdained to court thirdly by his own talents and address coupled with the ferocious energy of his moral character fourthly and perhaps in an equal degree by the criminal facility and goodnature of oubacha finally which is remarkable enough as illustrating the character of the man by that very new modelling of the sarga or privy council which he had used as a principal topic of abuse and malicious insinuation against the russian government whilst in reality he first had suggested the alteration to the empress and he chiefly appropriated the political advantages which it was fitted to yield for as he was himself appointed the chief of the sargatchi and as the pensions of the inferior sargatchi passed through his hands whilst in effect they owed their appointments to his nomination it may be easily supposed that whatever power existed in the state capable of controlling the khan being held by the sarga under its new organization and this body being completely under his influence the final result was to throw all the functions of the state whether nominally in the prince or in the council substantially into the hands of this one man whilst at the same time from the strict league which he maintained with the lama all the thunders of the spiritual power were always ready to come in aid of the magistrate or to supply his incapacity in cases which he could not reach but the time was now rapidly approaching for the mighty experiment the day was drawing near on which the signal was to be given for raising the standard of revolt and by a combined movement on both sides of the wolga for spreading the smoke of one vast conflagration that should wrap in a common blaze their own huts and the stately cities of their enemies over the breadth and length of those great provinces in which their flocks were dispersed the year of the tiger was now within one little month of its commencement the fifth morning of that year was fixed for the fatal day when the fortunes and happiness of a whole nation were to be put upon the hazard of a dicers throw and as yet that nation was in profound ignorance of the whole plan the khan such was the kindness of his nature could not bring himself to make the revelation so urgently required it was clear however that this could not be delayed and zebekdorchi took the task willingly upon himself but where or how should this notification be made so as to exclude russian hearers after some deliberation the following plan was adopted couriers it was contrived should arrive in furious haste one upon the heels of another reporting a sudden inroad of the kirghises and bashkirs upon the kalmuck lands at a point distant about one hundred and twenty miles thither all the kalmuck families according to immemorial custom were required to send a separate representative and there accordingly within three days all appeared the distance the solitary ground appointed for the rendezvous the rapidity of the march all tended to make it almost certain that no russian could be present zebekdorchi then came forward he did not waste many words upon rhetoric he unfurled an immense sheet of parchment visible from the outermost distance at which any of this vast crowd could stand the total number amounted to eighty thousand all saw and many heard they were told of the oppressions of russia of her pride and haughty disdain evidenced towards them by a thousand acts of her contempt for their religion of her determination to reduce them to absolute slavery of the preliminary measures she had already taken by erecting forts upon many of the great rivers of their neighborhood of the ulterior intentions she thus announced to circumscribe their pastoral lands until they would all be obliged to renounce their flocks and to collect in towns like sarepta there to pursue mechanical and servile trades of shoemaker tailor and weaver such as the freeborn tartar had always disdained then again said the subtle prince she increases her military levies upon our population every year we pour out our blood as young men in her defence or more often in support of her insolent aggressions and as old men we reap nothing from our sufferings nor benefit by our survivorship where so many are sacrificed at this point of his harangue zebek produced several papers forged as it is generally believed by himself and the lama containing projects of the russian court for a general transfer of the eldest sons taken en masse from the greatest kalmuck families to the imperial court now let this be once accomplished he argued and there is an end of all useful resistance from that day forwards petitions we might make or even remonstrances as men of words we might play a bold part but for deeds for that sort of language by which our ancestors were used to speak holding us by such a chain russia would make a jest of our wishes knowing full well that we should not dare to make any effectual movement having thus sufficiently roused the angry passions of his vast audience and having alarmed their fears by this pretended scheme against their firstborn an artifice which was indispensable to his purpose because it met beforehand every form of amendment to his proposal coming from the more moderate nobles who would not otherwise have failed to insist upon trying the effect of bold addresses to the empress before resorting to any desperate extremity zebekdorchi opened his scheme of revolt and if so of instant revolt since any preparations reported at st petersburg would be a signal for the armies of russia to cross into such positions from all parts of asia as would effectually intercept their march it is remarkable however that with all his audacity and his reliance upon the momentary excitement of the kalmucks the subtle prince did not venture at this stage of his seduction to make so startling a proposal as that of a flight to china all that he held out for the present was a rapid march to the temba or some other great river which they were to cross and to take up a strong position on the further bank from which as from a post of conscious security they could hold a bolder language to the czarina and one which would have a better chance of winning a favorable audience these things in the irritated condition of the simple tartars passed by acclamation and all returned homewards to push forward with the most furious speed the preparations for their awful undertaking rapid and energetic these of necessity were and in that degree they became noticeable and manifest to the russians who happened to be intermingled with the different hordes either on commercial errands or as agents officially from the russian government some in a financial others in a diplomatic character amongst these last indeed at the head of them was a russian of some distinction by name kichinskoi a man memorable for his vanity and memorable also as one of the many victims to the tartar revolution this kichinskoi had been sent by the empress as her envoy to overlook the conduct of the kalmucks he was styled the grand pristaw or great commissioner and was universally known amongst the tartar tribes by this title his mixed character of ambassador and of political surveillant combined with the dependent state of the kalmucks gave him a real weight in the tartar councils and might have given him a far greater had not his outrageous selfconceit and his arrogant confidence in his own authority as due chiefly to his personal qualities for command led him into such harsh displays of power and menaces so odious to the tartar pride as very soon made him an object of their profoundest malice he had publicly insulted the khan and upon making a communication to him to the effect that some reports began to circulate and even to reach the empress of a design in agitation to fly from the imperial dominions he had ventured to say but this you dare not attempt i laugh at such rumors yes khan i laugh at them to the empress for you are a chained bear and that you know the khan turned away on his heel with marked disdain and the pristaw foaming at the mouth continued to utter amongst those of the khans attendants who staid behind to catch his real sentiments in a moment of unguarded passion all that the blindest frenzy of rage could suggest to the most presumptuous of fools it was now ascertained that suspicions had arisen but at the same time it was ascertained that the pristaw spoke no more than the truth in representing himself to have discredited these suspicions the fact was that the mere infatuation of vanity made him believe that nothing could go on undetected by his allpiercing sagacity and that no rebellion could prosper when rebuked by his commanding presence the tartars therefore pursued their preparations confiding in the obstinate blindness of the grand pristaw as in their perfect safeguard and such it proved to his own ruin as well as that of myriads beside christmas arrived and a little before that time courier upon courier came dropping in one upon the very heels of another to st petersburg assuring the czarina that beyond all doubt the kalmucks were in the very crisis of departure these despatches came from the governor of astrachan and copies were instantly forwarded to kichinskoi now it happened that between this governor a russian named beketoff and the pristaw had been an ancient feud the very name of beketoff inflamed his resentment and no sooner did he see that hated name attached to the despatch than he felt himself confirmed in his former views with tenfold bigotry and wrote instantly in terms of the most pointed ridicule against the new alarmist pledging his own head upon the visionariness of his alarms beketoff however was not to be put down by a few hard words or by ridicule he persisted in his statements the russian ministry were confounded by the obstinacy of the disputants and some were beginning even to treat the governor of astrachan as a bore and as the dupe of his own nervous terrors when the memorable day arrived the fatal th of january which for ever terminated the dispute and put a seal upon the earthly hopes and fortunes of unnumbered myriads the governor of astrachan was the first to hear the news stung by the mixed furies of jealousy of triumphant vengeance and of anxious ambition he sprang into his sledge and at the rate of three hundred miles a day pursued his route to st petersburg rushed into the imperial presence announced the total realization of his worst predictions and upon the confirmation of this intelligence by subsequent despatches from many different posts on the wolga he received an imperial commission to seize the person of his deluded enemy and to keep him in strict captivity these orders were eagerly fulfilled and the unfortunate kichinskoi soon afterwards expired of grief and mortification in the gloomy solitude of a dungeon a victim to his own immeasurable vanity and the blinding self delusions of a presumption that refused all warning the governor of astrachan had been but too faithful a prophet perhaps even he was surprised at the suddenness with which the verification followed his reports precisely on the th of january the day so solemnly appointed under religious sanctions by the lama the kalmucks on the east bank of the wolga were seen at the earliest dawn of day assembling by troops and squadrons and in the tumultuous movement of some great morning of battle tens of thousands continued moving off the ground at every halfhours interval women and children to the amount of two hundred thousand and upwards were placed upon wagons or upon camels and drew off by masses of twenty thousand at once placed under suitable escorts and continually swelled in numbers by other outlying bodies of the horde who kept falling in at various distances upon the first and second days march from sixty to eighty thousand of those who were the best mounted stayed behind the rest of the tribes with purposes of devastation and plunder more violent than prudence justified or the amiable character of the khan could be supposed to approve but in this as in other instances he was completely overruled by the malignant counsels of zebekdorchi the first tempest of the desolating fury of the tartars discharged itself upon their own habitations but this as cutting off all infirm looking backward from the hardships of their march had been thought so necessary a measure by all the chieftains that even oubacha himself was the first to authorize the act by his own example he seized a torch previously prepared with materials the most durable as well as combustible and steadily applied it to the timbers of his own palace nothing was saved from the general wreck except the portable part of the domestic utensils and that part of the woodwork which could be applied to the manufacture of the long tartar lances this chapter in their memorable days work being finished and the whole of their villages throughout a district of ten thousand square miles in one simultaneous blaze the tartars waited for further orders these it was intended should have taken a character of valedictory vengeance and thus have left behind to the czarina a dreadful commentary upon the main motives of their flight it was the purpose of zebekdorchi that all the russian towns churches and buildings of every description should be given up to pillage and destruction and such treatment applied to the defenceless inhabitants as might naturally be expected from a fierce people already infuriated by the spectacle of their own outrages and by the bloody retaliations which they must necessarily have provoked this part of the tragedy however was happily intercepted by a providential disappointment at the very crisis of departure it has been mentioned already that the motive for selecting the depth of winter as the season of flight which otherwise was obviously the very worst possible had been the impossibility of effecting a junction sufficiently rapid with the tribes on the west of the wolga in the absence of bridges unless by a natural bridge of ice for this one advantage the kalmuck leaders had consented to aggravate by a thousandfold the calamities inevitable to a rapid flight over boundless tracts of country with women children and herds of cattle for this one single advantage and yet after all it was lost the reason never has been explained satisfactorily but the fact was such some have said that the signals were not properly concerted for marking the moment of absolute departure that is for signifying whether the settled intention of the eastern kalmucks might not have been suddenly interrupted by adverse intelligence others have supposed that the ice might not be equally strong on both sides of the river and might even be generally insecure for the treading of heavy and heavilyladen animals such as camels but the prevailing notion is that some accidental movements on the d and th of january of russian troops in the neighborhood of the western kalmucks though really having no reference to them or their plans had been construed into certain signs that all was discovered and that the prudence of the western chieftains who from situation had never been exposed to those intrigues by which zebekdorchi had practised upon the pride of the eastern tribes now stepped in to save their people from ruin be the cause what it might it is certain that the western kalmucks were in some way prevented from forming the intended junction with their brethren of the opposite bank and the result was that at least one hundred thousand of these tartars were left behind in russia this accident it was which saved their russian neighbors universally from the desolation which else awaited them one general massacre and conflagration would assuredly have surprised them to the utter extermination of their property their houses and themselves had it not been for this disappointment but the eastern chieftains did not dare to put to hazard the safety of their brethren under the first impulse of the czarinas vengeance for so dreadful a tragedy for as they were well aware of too many circumstances by which she might discover the concurrence of the western people in the general scheme of revolt they justly feared that she would thence infer their concurrence also in the bloody events which marked its outset little did the western kalmucks guess what reasons they also had for gratitude on account of an interposition so unexpected and which at the moment they so generally deplored could they but have witnessed the thousandth part of the sufferings which overtook their eastern brethren in the first month of their sad flight they would have blessed heaven for their own narrow escape and yet these sufferings of the first month were but a prelude or foretaste comparatively slight of those which afterwards succeeded for now began to unroll the most awful series of calamities and the most extensive which is anywhere recorded to have visited the sons and daughters of men it is possible that the sudden inroads of destroying nations such as the huns or the avars or the mongol tartars may have inflicted misery as extensive but there the misery and the desolation would be sudden like the flight of volleying lightning those who were spared at first would generally be spared to the end those who perished would perish instantly it is possible that the french retreat from moscow may have made some nearer approach to this calamity in duration though still a feeble and miniature approach for the french sufferings did not commence in good earnest until about one month from the time of leaving moscow and though it is true that afterwards the vials of wrath were emptied upon the devoted army for six or seven weeks in succession yet what is that to this kalmuck tragedy which lasted for more than as many months but the main feature of horror by which the tartar march was distinguished from the french lies in the accompaniment of women footnote singular it is and not generally known that grecian women accompanied the anabasis of the younger cyrus and the subsequent retreat of the ten thousand xenophon affirms that there were many women in the greek army pollai aesun etairai en tosratenaeazi and in a late stage of that trying expedition it is evident that women were amongst the survivors and children there were both it is true with the french army but so few as to bear no visible proportion to the total numbers concerned the french in short were merely an army a host of professional destroyers whose regular trade was bloodshed and whose regular element was danger and suffering but the tartars were a nation carrying along with them more than two hundred and fifty thousand women and children utterly unequal for the most part to any contest with the calamities before them the children of israel were in the same circumstances as to the accompaniment of their families but they were released from the pursuit of their enemies in a very early stage of their flight and their subsequent residence in the desert was not a march but a continued halt and under a continued interposition of heaven for their comfortable support earthquakes again however comprehensive in their ravages are shocks of a moments duration a much nearer approach made to the wide range and the long duration of the kalmuck tragedy may have been in a pestilence such as that which visited athens in the peloponnesian war or london in the reign of charles ii there also the martyrs were counted by myriads and the period of the desolation was counted by months but after all the total amount of destruction was on a smaller scale and there was this feature of alleviation to the conscious pressure of the calamity that the misery was withdrawn from public notice into private chambers and hospitals the siege of jerusalem by vespasian and his son taken in its entire circumstances comes nearest of all for breadth and depth of suffering for duration for the exasperation of the suffering from without by internal feuds and finally for that last most appalling expression of the furnaceheat of the anguish in its power to extinguish the natural affections even of maternal love but after all each case had circumstances of romantic misery peculiar to itself circumstances without precedent and wherever human nature is ennobled by christianity it may be confidently hoped never to be repeated the first point to be reached before any hope of repose could be encouraged was the river jaik this was not above three hundred miles from the main point of departure on the wolga and if the march thither was to be a forced one and a severe one it was alleged on the other hand that the suffering would be the more brief and transient one summary exertion not to be repeated and all was achieved forced the march was and severe beyond example there the forewarning proved correct but the promised rest proved a mere phantom of the wilderness a visionary rainbow which fled before their hopesick eyes across these interminable solitudes for seven months of hardship and calamity without a pause these sufferings by their very nature and the circumstances under which they arose were like the scenery of the steppes somewhat monotonous in their coloring and external features what variety however there was will be most naturally exhibited by tracing historically the successive stages of the general misery exactly as it unfolded itself under the double agency of weakness still increasing from within and hostile pressure from without viewed in this manner under the real order of development it is remarkable that these sufferings of the tartars though under the moulding hands of accident arrange themselves almost with a scenical propriety they seem combined as with the skill of an artist the intensity of the misery advancing regularly with the advances of the march and the stages of the calamity corresponding to the stages of the route so that upon raising the curtain which veils the great catastrophe we behold one vast climax of anguish towering upwards by regular gradations as if constructed artificially for picturesque effect a result which might not have been surprising had it been reasonable to anticipate the same rate of speed and even an accelerated rate as prevailing through the later stages of the expedition but it seemed on the contrary most reasonable to calculate upon a continual decrement in the rate of motion according to the increasing distance from the headquarters of the pursuing enemy this calculation however was defeated by the extraordinary circumstance that the russian armies did not begin to close in very fiercely upon the kalmucks until after they had accomplished a distance of full two thousand miles one thousand miles further on the assaults became even more tumultuous and murderous and already the great shadows of the chinese wall were dimly descried when the frenzy and acharnement of the pursuers and the bloody desperation of the miserable fugitives had reached its uttermost extremity let us briefly rehearse the main stages of the misery and trace the ascending steps of the tragedy according to the great divisions of the route marked out by the central rivers of asia the first stage we have already said was from the wolga to the jaik the distance about three hundred miles the time allowed seven days for the first week therefore the rate of marching averaged about fortythree english miles a day the weather was cold but bracing and at a more moderate pace this part of the journey might have been accomplished without much distress by a people as hardy as the kalmucks as it was the cattle suffered greatly from overdriving milk began to fail even for the children the sheep perished by wholesale and the children themselves were saved only by the innumerable camels the cossacks who dwelt upon the banks of the jaik were the first among the subjects of russia to come into collision with the kalmucks great was their surprise at the suddenness of the irruption and great also their consternation for according to their settled custom by far the greater part of their number was absent during the winter months at the fisheries upon the caspian some who were liable to surprise at the most exposed points fled in crowds to the fortress of koulagina which was immediately invested and summoned by oubacha he had however in his train only a few light pieces of artillery and the russian commandant at koulagina being aware of the hurried circumstances in which the khan was placed and that he stood upon the very edge as it were of a renewed flight felt encouraged by these considerations to a more obstinate resistance than might else have been advisable with an enemy so little disposed to observe the usages of civilized warfare the period of his anxiety was not long on the fifth day of the siege he descried from the walls a succession of tartar couriers mounted upon fleet bactrian camels crossing the vast plains around the fortress at a furious pace and riding into the kalmuck encampment at various points great agitation appeared immediately to follow orders were soon after despatched in all directions and it became speedily known that upon a distant flank of the kalmuck movement a bloody and exterminating battle had been fought the day before in which one entire tribe of the khans dependents numbering not less than nine thousand fighting men had perished to the last man this was the ouloss or clan called fekazechorr between whom and the cossacks there was a feud of ancient standing in selecting therefore the points of attack on occasion of the present hasty inroad the cossack chiefs were naturally eager so to direct their efforts as to combine with the service of the empress some gratification to their own party hatreds more especially as the present was likely to be their final opportunity for revenge if the kalmuck evasion should prosper having therefore concentrated as large a body of cossack cavalry as circumstances allowed they attacked the hostile ouloss with a precipitation which denied to it all means for communicating with oubacha for the necessity of commanding an ample range of pasturage to meet the necessities of their vast flocks and herds had separated this ouloss from the khans headquarters by an interval of eighty miles and thus it was and not from oversight that it came to be thrown entirely upon its own resources these had proved insufficient retreat from the exhausted state of their horses and camels no less than from the prodigious encumbrances of their live stock was absolutely out of the question quarter was disdained on the one side and would not have been granted on the other and thus it had happened that the setting sun of that one day the th from the first opening of the revolt threw his parting rays upon the final agonies of an ancient ouloss stretched upon a bloody field who on that days dawning had held and styled themselves an independent nation universal consternation was diffused through the wide borders of the khans encampment by this disastrous intelligence not so much on account of the numbers slain or the total extinction of a powerful ally as because the position of the cossack force was likely to put to hazard the future advances of the kalmucks or at least to retard and hold them in check until the heavier columns of the russian army should arrive upon their flanks the siege of koulagina was instantly raised and that signal so fatal to the happiness of the women and their children once again resounded through the tents the signal for flight and this time for a flight more rapid than ever about one hundred and fifty miles ahead of their present position there arose a tract of hilly country forming a sort of margin to the vast sealike expanse of champaign savannas steppes and occasionally of sandy deserts which stretched away on each side of this margin both eastwards and westwards pretty nearly in the centre of this hilly range lay a narrow defile through which passed the nearest and the most practicable route to the river torgai the further bank of which river offered the next great station of security for a general halt it was the more essential to gain this pass before the cossacks inasmuch as not only would the delay in forcing the pass give time to the russian pursuing columns for combining their attacks and for bringing up their artillery but also because even if all enemies in pursuit were thrown out of the question it was held by those best acquainted with the difficult and obscure geography of these pathless steppes that the loss of this one narrow strait amongst the hills would have the effect of throwing them as their only alternative in a case where so wide a sweep of pasturage was required upon a circuit of at least five hundred miles extra besides that after all this circuitous route would carry them to the torgai at a point ill fitted for the passage of their heavy baggage the defile in the hills therefore it was resolved to gain and yet unless they moved upon it with the velocity of light cavalry there was little chance but it would be found preoccupied by the cossacks they it is true had suffered greatly in the recent sanguinary action with their enemies but the excitement of victory and the intense sympathy with their unexampled triumph had again swelled their ranks and would probably act with the force of a vortex to draw in their simple countrymen from the caspian the question therefore of preoccupation was reduced to a race the cossacks were marching upon an oblique line not above fifty miles longer than that which led to the same point from the kalmuck headquarters before koulagina and therefore without the most furious haste on the part of the kalmucks there was not a chance for them burdened and trashed footnote trashed this is an expressive word used by beaumont and fletcher in their bonduca etc to describe the case of a person retarded and embarrassed in flight or in pursuit by some encumbrance whether thing or person too valuable to be left behind as they were to anticipate so agile a light cavalry as the cossacks in seizing this important pass dreadful were the feelings of the poor women on hearing this exposition of the case for they easily understood that too capital an interest the summa rerum was now at stake to allow of any regard to minor interests or what would be considered such in their present circumstances the dreadful week already passed their inauguration in misery was yet fresh in their remembrance the scars of suffering were impressed not only upon their memories but upon their very persons and the persons of their children and they knew that where no speed had much chance of meeting the cravings of the chieftains no test would be accepted short of absolute exhaustion that as much had been accomplished as could be accomplished weseloff the russian captive has recorded the silent wretchedness with which the women and elder boys assisted in drawing the tentropes on the th of january all had been animation and the joyousness of indefinite expectation now on the contrary a brief but bitter experience had taught them to take an amended calculation of what it was that lay before them one whole day and far into the succeeding night had the renewed flight continued the sufferings had been greater than before for the cold had been more intense and many perished out of the living creatures through every class except only the camels whose powers of endurance seemed equally adapted to cold and heat the second morning however brought an alleviation to the distress snow had begun to fall and though not deep at present it was easily foreseen that it soon would be so and that as a halt would in that case become unavoidable no plan could be better than that of staying where they were especially as the same cause would check the advance of the cossacks here then was the last interval of comfort which gleamed upon the unhappy nation during their whole migration for ten days the snow continued to fall with little intermission at the end of that time keen bright frosty weather succeeded the drifting had ceased in three days the smooth expanse became firm enough to support the treading of the camels and the flight was recommenced but during the halt much domestic comfort had been enjoyed and for the last time universal plenty the cows and oxen had perished in such vast numbers on the previous marches that an order was now issued to turn what remained to account by slaughtering the whole and salting whatever part should be found to exceed the immediate consumption this measure led to a scene of general banqueting and even of festivity amongst all who were not incapacitated for joyous emotions by distress of mind by grief for the unhappy experience of the few last days and by anxiety for the too gloomy future seventy thousand persons of all ages had already perished exclusively of the many thousand allies who had been cut down by the cossack sabre and the losses in reversion were likely to be many more for rumors began now to arrive from all quarters by the mounted couriers whom the khan had despatched to the rear and to each flank as well as in advance that large masses of the imperial troops were converging from all parts of central asia to the fords of the river torgai as the most convenient point for intercepting the flying tribes and it was already well known that a powerful division was close in their rear and was retarded only by the numerous artillery which had been judged necessary to support their operations new motives were thus daily arising for quickening the motions of the wretched kalmucks and for exhausting those who were previously but too much exhausted it was not until the d day of february that the khans advanced guard came in sight of ouchim the defile among the hills of moulgaldchares in which they anticipated so bloody an opposition from the cossacks a pretty large body of these light cavalry had in fact preoccupied the pass by some hours but the khan having too great advantages namely a strong body of infantry who had been conveyed by sections of five on about two hundred camels and some pieces of light artillery which he had not yet been forced to abandon soon began to make a serious impression upon this unsupported detachment and they would probably at any rate have retired but at the very moment when they were making some dispositions in that view zebekdorchi appeared upon their rear with a body of trained riflemen who had distinguished themselves in the war with turkey these men had contrived to crawl unobserved over the cliffs which skirted the ravine availing themselves of the dry beds of the summer torrents and other inequalities of the ground to conceal their movement disorder and trepidation ensued instantly in the cossack files the khan who had been waiting with the elite of his heavy cavalry charged furiously upon them total overthrow followed to the cossacks and a slaughter such as in some measure avenged the recent bloody extermination of their allies the ancient ouloss of fekazechorr the slight horses of the cossacks were unable to support the weight of heavy polish dragoons and a body of trained cameleers that is cuirassiers mounted on camels hardy they were but not strong nor a match for their antagonists in weight and their extraordinary efforts through the last few days to gain their present position had greatly diminished their powers for effecting an escape very few in fact did escape and the bloody day of ouchim became as memorable amongst the cossacks as that which about twenty days before had signalized the complete annihilation of the fakazechorr footnote there was another ouloss equally strong with that of fekazechorr viz that of erketunn under the government of assarcho and machi whom some obligations of treaty or other hidden motives drew into the general conspiracy of revolt but fortunately the two chieftains found means to assure the governor of astrachan on the first outbreak of the insurrection that their real wishes were for maintaining the old connection with russia the cossacks therefore to whom the pursuit was intrusted had instructions to act cautiously and according to circumstances on coming up with them the result was through the prudent management of assarcho that the clan without compromising their pride or independence made such moderate submissions as satisfied the cossacks and eventually both chiefs and people received from the czarina the rewards and honors of exemplary fidelity the road was now open to the river igritch and as yet even far beyond it to the torgau but how long this state of things would continue was every day more doubtful certain intelligence was now received that a large russian army well appointed in every arm was advancing upon the torgau under the command of general traubenberg this officer was to be joined on his route by ten thousand bashkirs and pretty nearly the same amount of kirghises both hereditary enemies of the kalmucks both exasperated to a point of madness by the bloody trophies which oubacha and momotbacha had in late years won from such of their compatriots as served under the sultan the czarinas yoke these wild nations bore with submissive patience but not the hands by which it had been imposed and accordingly catching with eagerness at the present occasion offered to their vengeance they sent an assurance to the czarina of their perfect obedience to her commands and at the same time a message significantly declaring in what spirit they meant to execute them viz that they would not trouble her majesty with prisoners here then arose as before with the cossacks a race for the kalmucks with the regular armies of russia and concurrently with nations as fierce and semihumanized as themselves besides that they were stung into threefold activity by the furies of mortified pride and military abasement under the eyes of the turkish sultan the forces and more especially the artillery of russia were far too overwhelming to permit the thought of a regular opposition in pitched battles even with a less dilapidated state of their resources than they could reasonably expect at the period of their arrival on the torgau in their speed lay their only hope in strength of foot as before and not in strength of arm onward therefore the kalmucks pressed marking the lines of their wideextending march over the sad solitudes of the steppes by a neverending chain of corpses the old and the young the sick man on his couch the mother with her baby all were left behind sights such as these with the many rueful aggravations incident to the helpless condition of infancy of disease and of female weakness abandoned to the wolves amidst a howling wilderness continued to track their course through a space of full two thousand miles for so much at the least it was likely to prove including the circuits to which they were often compelled by rivers or hostile tribes from the point of starting on the wolga until they could reach their destined haltingground on the east bank of the torgau for the first seven weeks of this march their sufferings had been embittered by the excessive severity of the cold and every night so long as wood was to be had for fires either from the lading of the camels or from the desperate sacrifice of their baggagewagons or as occasionally happened from the forests which skirted the banks of the many rivers which crossed their path no spectacle was more frequent than that of a circle composed of men women and children gathered by hundreds round a central fire all dead and stiff at the return of morning light myriads were left behind from pure exhaustion of whom none had a chance under the combined evils which beset them of surviving through the next twentyfour hours frost however and snow at length ceased to persecute the vast extent of the march at length brought them into more genial latitudes and the unusual duration of the march was gradually bringing them into the more genial seasons of the year two thousand miles had at least been traversed february march april were gone the balmy month of may had opened vernal sights and sounds came from every side to comfort the heartweary travellers and at last in the latter end of may they crossed the torgau and took up a position where they hoped to find liberty to repose themselves for many weeks in comfort as well as in security and to draw such supplies from the fertile neighborhood as might restore their shattered forces to a condition for executing with less of wreck and ruin the large remainder of the journey yes it was true that two thousand miles of wandering had been completed but in a period of nearly five months and with the terrific sacrifice of at least two hundred and fifty thousand souls to say nothing of herds and flocks past all reckoning these had all perished ox cow horse mule ass sheep or goat not one survived only the camels these arid and adust creatures looking like the mummies of some antediluvian animals without the affections or sensibilities of flesh and blood these only still erected their speaking eyes to the eastern heavens and had to all appearance come out from this long tempest of trial unscathed and unharmed the khan knowing how much he was individually answerable for the misery which had been sustained must have wept tears even more bitter than those of xerxes when he threw his eyes over the myriads whom he had assembled for the tears of xerxes were unmingled with compunction whatever amends were in his power he resolved to make by sacrifices to the general good of all personal regards and accordingly even at this point of their advance he once more deliberately brought under review the whole question of the revolt the question was formally debated before the council whether even at this point they should untread their steps and throwing themselves upon the czarinas mercy return to their old allegiance in that case oubacha professed himself willing to become the scapegoat for the general transgression this he argued was no fantastic scheme but even easy of accomplishment for the unlimited and sacred power of the khan so well known to the empress made it absolutely iniquitous to attribute any separate responsibility to the people upon the khan rested the guilt upon the khan would descend the imperial vengeance this proposal was applauded for its generosity but was energetically opposed by zebekdorchi were they to lose the whole journey of two thousand miles was their misery to perish without fruit true it was that they had yet reached only the halfway house but in that respect the motives were evenly balanced for retreat or for advance either way they would have pretty nearly the same distance to traverse but with this difference that forwards their rout lay through lands comparatively fertile backwards through a blasted wilderness rich only in memorials of their sorrow and hideous to kalmuck eyes by the trophies of their calamity besides though the empress might accept an excuse for the past would she the less forbear to suspect for the future the czarinas pardon they might obtain but could they ever hope to recover her confidence doubtless there would now be a standing presumption against them an immortal ground of jealousy and a jealous government would be but another name for a harsh one finally whatever motives there ever had been for the revolt surely remained unimpaired by anything that had occurred in reality the revolt was after all no revolt but strictly speaking a return to their old allegiance since not above one hundred and fifty years ago viz in the year their ancestors had revolted from the emperor of china they had now tried both governments and for them china was the land of promise and russia the house of bondage spite however of all that zebek could say or do the yearning of the people was strongly in behalf of the khans proposal the pardon of their prince they persuaded themselves would be readily conceded by the empress and there is little doubt that they would at this time have thrown themselves gladly upon the imperial mercy when suddenly all was defeated by the arrival of two envoys from traubenberg this general had reached the fortress of orsk after a very painful march on the th of april thence he set forwards towards oriembourg which he reached upon the st of june having been joined on his route at various times through the month of may by the kirghises and a corps of ten thousand bashkirs from oriembourg he sent forward his official offer to the khan which were harsh and peremptory holding out no specific stipulations as to pardon or impunity and exacting unconditional submission as the preliminary price of any cessation from military operations the personal character of traubenberg which was anything but energetic and the condition of his army disorganized in a great measure by the length and severity of the march made it probable that with a little time for negotiation a more conciliatory tone would have been assumed but unhappily for all parties sinister events occurred in the meantime such as effectually put an end to every hope of the kind the two envoys sent forward by traubenberg had reported to this officer that a distance of only ten days march lay between his own head quarters and those of the khan upon this fact transpiring the kirghises by their prince nourali and the bashkirs entreated the russian general to advance without delay once having placed his cannon in position so as to command the kalmuck camp the fate of the rebel khan and his people would be in his own hands and they would themselves form his advanced guard traubenberg however why has not been certainly explained refused to march grounding his refusal upon the condition of his army and their absolute need of refreshment long and fierce was the altercation but at length seeing no chance of prevailing and dreading above all other events the escape of their detested enemy the ferocious bashkirs went off in a body by forced marches in six days they reached the torgau crossed by swimming their horses and fell upon the kalmucks who were dispersed for many a league in search of food or provender for their camels the first days action was one vast succession of independent skirmishes diffused over a field of thirty to forty miles in extent one party often breaking up into three or four and again according to the accidents of ground three or four blending into one flight and pursuit rescue and total overthrow going on simultaneously under all varieties of form in all quarters of the plain the bashkirs had found themselves obliged by the scattered state of the kalmucks to split up into innumerable sections and thus for some hours it had been impossible for the most practised eye to collect the general tendency of the days fortune both the khan and zebekdorchi were at one moment made prisoners and more than once in imminent danger of being cut down but at length zebek succeeded in rallying a strong column of infantry which with the support of the camelcorps on each flank compelled the bashkirs to retreat clouds however of these wild cavalry continued to arrive through the next two days and nights followed or accompanied by the kirghises these being viewed as the advanced parties of traubenbergs army the kalmuck chieftains saw no hope of safety but in flight and in this way it happened that a retreat which had so recently been brought to a pause was resumed at the very moment when the unhappy fugitives were anticipating a deep repose without further molestation the whole summer through it seemed as though every variety of wretchedness were predestined to the kalmucks and as if their sufferings were incomplete unless they were rounded and matured by all that the most dreadful agencies of summers heat could superadd to those of frost and winter to this sequel of their story we shall immediately revert after first noticing a little romantic episode which occurred at this point between oubacha and his unprincipled cousin zebekdorchi there was at the time of the kalmuck flight from the wolga a russian gentleman of some rank at the court of the khan whom for political reasons it was thought necessary to carry along with them as a captive for some weeks his confinement had been very strict and in one or two instances cruel but as the increasing distance was continually diminishing the chances of escape and perhaps also as the misery of the guards gradually withdrew their attention from all minor interests to their own personal sufferings the vigilance of the custody grew more and more relaxed until at length upon a petition to the khan mr weseloff was formally restored to liberty and it was understood that he might use his liberty in whatever way he chose even for returning to russia if that should be his wish accordingly he was making active preparations for his journey to st petersburg when it occurred to zebekdorchi that not improbably in some of the battles which were then anticipated with traubenberg it might happen to them to lose some prisoner of rank in which case the russian weseloff would be a pledge in their hands for negotiating an exchange upon this plea to his own severe affliction the russian was detained until the further pleasure of the khan the khans name indeed was used through the whole affair but as it seemed with so little concurrence on his part that when weseloff in a private audience humbly remonstrated upon the injustice done him and the cruelty of thus sporting with his feelings by setting him at liberty and as it were tempting him into dreams of home and restored happiness only for the purpose of blighting them the goodnatured prince disclaimed all participation in the affair and went so far in proving his sincerity as even to give him permission to effect his escape and as a ready means of commencing it without raising suspicion the khan mentioned to mr weseloff that he had just then received a message from the hetman of the bashkirs soliciting a private interview on the banks of the torgau at a spot pointed out that interview was arranged for the coming night and mr weseloff might go in the khans suite which on either side was not to exceed three persons weseloff was a prudent man acquainted with the world and he read treachery in the very outline of this scheme as stated by the khan treachery against the khans person he mused a little and then communicated so much of his suspicions to the khan as might put him on his guard but upon further consideration he begged leave to decline the honor of accompanying the khan the fact was that three kalmucks who had strong motives for returning to their countrymen on the west bank of the wolga guessing the intentions of weseloff had offered to join him in his escape these men the khan would probably find himself obliged to countenance in their project so that it became a point of honor with weseloff to conceal their intentions and therefore to accomplish the evasion from the camp of which the first steps only would be hazardous without risking the notice of the khan the district in which they were now encamped abounded through many hundred miles with wild horses of a docile and beautiful breed each of the four fugitives had caught from seven to ten of these spirited creatures in the course of the last few days this raised no suspicion for the rest of the kalmucks had been making the same sort of provision against the coming toils of their remaining route to china these horses were secured by halters and hidden about dusk in the thickets which lined the margin of the river to these thickets about ten at night the four fugitives repaired they took a circuitous path which drew them as little as possible within danger of challenge from any of the outposts or of the patrols which had been established on the quarters where the bashkirs lay and in three quarters of an hour they reached the rendezvous the moon had now risen the horses were unfastened and they were in the act of mounting when the deep silence of the woods was disturbed by a violent uproar and the clashing of arms weseloff fancied that he heard the voice of the khan shouting for assistance he remembered the communication made by that prince in the morning and requesting his companions to support him he rode off in the direction of the sound a very short distance brought him to an open glade in the wood where he beheld four men contending with a party of at least nine or ten two of the four were dismounted at the very instant of weseloffs arrival one of these he recognized almost certainly as the khan who was fighting hand to hand but at great disadvantage with two of the adverse horsemen seeing that no time was to be lost weseloff fired and brought down one of the two his companions discharged their carbines at the same moment and then all rushed simultaneously into the little open area the thundering sound of about thirty horses all rushing at once into a narrow space gave the impression that a whole troop of cavalry was coming down upon the assailants who accordingly wheeled about and fled with one impulse weseloff advanced to the dismounted cavalier who as he expected proved to be the khan the man whom weseloff had shot was lying dead and both were shocked though weseloff at least was not surprised on stooping down and scrutinizing his features to recognize a well known confidential servant of zebekdorchi nothing was said by either party the khan rode off escorted by weseloff and his companions and for some time a dead silence prevailed the situation of weseloff was delicate and critical to leave the khan at this point was probably to cancel their recent services for he might be again crossed on his path and again attacked by the very party from whom he had just been delivered yet on the other hand to return to the camp was to endanger the chances of accomplishing the escape the khan also was apparently revolving all this in his mind for at length he broke silence and said i comprehend your situation and under other circumstances i might feel it my duty to detain your companions but it would ill become me to do so after the important service you have just rendered me let us turn a little to the left there where you see the watchfire is an outpost attend me so far i am then safe you may turn and pursue your enterprise for the circumstances under which you will appear as my escort are sufficient to shield you from all suspicion for the present i regret having no better means at my disposal for testifying my gratitude but tell me before we part was it accident only which led you to my rescue or had you acquired any knowledge of the plot by which i was decoyed into this snare weseloff answered very candidly that mere accident had brought him to the spot at which he heard the uproar but that having heard it and connecting it with the khans communication of the morning he had then designedly gone after the sound in a way which he certainly should not have done at so critical a moment unless in the expectation of finding the khan assaulted by assassins a few minutes after they reached the outpost at which it became safe to leave the tartar chieftain and immediately the four fugitives commenced a flight which is perhaps without a parallel in the annals of travelling each of them led six or seven horses besides the one he rode and by shifting from one to the other like the ancient desultors of the roman circus so as never to burden the same horse for more than half an hour at a time they continued to advance at the rate of two hundred miles in the twentyfour hours for three days consecutively after that time considering themselves beyond pursuit they proceeded less rapidly though still with a velocity which staggered the belief of weseloffs friends in after years he was however a man of high principle and always adhered firmly to the details of his printed report one of the circumstances there stated is that they continued to pursue the route by which the kalmucks had fled never for an instant finding any difficulty in tracing it by the skeletons and other memorials of their calamities in particular he mentions vast heaps of money as part of the valuable property which it had been necessary to sacrifice these heaps were found lying still untouched in the deserts from these weseloff and his companions took as much as they could conveniently carry and this it was with the price of their beautiful horses which they afterwards sold at one of the russian military settlements for about apiece which eventually enabled them to pursue their journey in russia this journey as regarded weseloff in particular was closed by a tragical catastrophe he was at that time young and the only child of a doating mother her affliction under the violent abduction of her son had been excessive and probably had undermined her constitution still she had supported it weseloff giving way to the natural impulses of his filial affection had imprudently posted through russia to his mothers house without warning of his approach he rushed precipitately into her presense and she who had stood the shocks of sorrow was found unequal to the shock of joy too sudden and too acute she died upon the spot we now revert to the final scenes of the kalmuck flight these it would be useless to pursue circumstantially through the whole two thousand miles of suffering which remained for the character of that suffering was even more monotonous than on the former half of the flight but also more severe its main elements were excessive heat with the accompaniments of famine and thirst but aggravated at every step by the murderous attacks of their cruel enemies the bashkirs and the kirghises these people more fell than anguish hunger or the sea stuck to the unhappy kalmucks like a swarm of enraged hornets and very often whilst they were attacking them in the rear their advanced parties and flanks were attacked with almost equal fury by the people of the country which they were traversing and with good reason since the law of selfpreservation had now obliged the fugitive tartars to plunder provisions and to forage wherever they passed in this respect their condition was a constant oscillation of wretchedness for sometimes pressed by grinding famine they took a circuit of perhaps a hundred miles in order to strike into a land rich in the comforts of life but in such a land they were sure to find a crowded population of which every arm was raised in unrelenting hostility with all the advantages of local knowledge and with constant preoccupation of all the defensible positions mountain passes or bridges sometimes again wearied out with this mode of suffering they took a circuit of perhaps a hundred miles in order to strike into a land with few or no inhabitants but in such a land they were sure to meet absolute starvation then again whether with or without this plague of starvation whether with or without this plague of hostility in front whatever might he the fierce varieties of their misery in this respect no rest ever came to their unhappy rear post equitem sedet atra cura it was a torment like the undying worm of conscience and upon the whole it presented a spectacle altogether unprecedented in the history of mankind private and personal malignity is not unfrequently immortal but rare indeed is it to find the same pertinacity of malice in a nation and what embittered the interest was that the malice was reciprocal thus far the parties met upon equal terms but that equality only sharpened the sense of their dire inequality as to other circumstances the bashkirs were ready to fight from morn to dewy eve the kalmucks on the contrary were always obliged to run was it from their enemies as creatures whom they feared no but towards their friends towards that final haven of china as what was hourly implored by their wives and the tears of their children but though they fled unwillingly too often they fled in vain being unwillingly recalled there lay the torment every day the bashkirs fell upon them every day the same unprofitable battle was renewed as a matter of course the kalmucks recalled part of their advanced guard to fight them every day the battle raged for hours and uniformly with the same result for no sooner did the bashkirs find themselves too heavily pressed and that the kalmuck march had been retarded by some hours than they retired into the boundless deserts where all pursuit was hopeless but if the kalmucks resolved to press forward regardless of their enemies in that case their attacks became so fierce and overwhelming that the general safety seemed likely to be brought into question nor could any effectual remedy be applied to the case even for each separate day except by a most embarrassing halt and by countermarches that to men in their circumstances were almost worse than death it will not be surprising that the irritation of such a systematic persecution superadded to a previous and hereditary hatred and accompanied by the stinging consciousness of utter impotence as regarded all effectual vengeance should gradually have inflamed the kalmuck animosity into the wildest expression of downright madness and frenzy indeed long before the frontiers of china were approached the hostility of both sides had assumed the appearance much more of a warfare amongst wild beasts than amongst creatures acknowledging the restraints of reason or the claims of a common nature the spectacle became too atrocious it was that of a host of lunatics pursued by a host of fiends on a fine morning in early autumn of the year kien long the emperor of china was pursuing his amusements in a wild frontier district lying on the outside of the great wall for many hundred square leagues the country was desolate of inhabitants but rich in woods of ancient growth and overrun with game of every description in a central spot of this solitary region the emperor had built a gorgeous huntinglodge to which he resorted annually for recreation and relief from the cares of government led onwards in pursuit of game he had rambled to a distance of two hundred miles or more from this lodge followed at a little distance by a sufficient military escort and every night pitching his tent in a different situation until at length he had arrived on the very margin of the vast central deserts of asia footnote all the circumstances are learned from a long state paper upon the subject of this kalmuck migration drawn up in the chinese language by the emperor himself parts of this paper have been translated by the jesuit missionaries the emperor states the whole motives of his conduct and the chief incidents at great length here he was standing by accident at an opening of his pavilion enjoying the morning sunshine when suddenly to the westward there arose a vast cloudy vapor which by degrees expanded mounted and seemed to be slowly diffusing itself over the whole face of the heavens byandby this vast sheet of mist began to thicken towards the horizon and to roll forward in billowy volumes the emperors suite assembled from all quarters the silver trumpets were sounded in the rear and from all the glades and forest avenues began to trot forward towards the pavilion the yagers half cavalry half huntsmen who composed the imperial escort conjecture was on the stretch to divine the cause of this phenomenon and the interest continually increased in proportion as simple curiosity gradually deepened into the anxiety of uncertain danger at first it had been imagined that some vast troops of deer or other wild animals of the chase had been disturbed in their forest haunts by the emperors movements or possibly by wild beasts prowling for prey and might be fetching a compass by way of re entering the forest grounds at some remoter points secure from molestation but this conjecture was dissipated by the slow increase of the cloud and the steadiness of its motion in the course of two hours the vast phenomenon had advanced to a point which was judged to be within five miles of the spectators though all calculations of distance were difficult and often fallacious when applied to the endless expanses of the tartar deserts through the next hour during which the gentle morning breeze had a little freshened the dusty vapor had developed itself far and wide into the appearance of huge aerial draperies hanging in mighty volumes from the sky to the earth and at particular points where the eddies of the breeze acted upon the pendulous skirts of these aerial curtains rents were perceived sometimes taking the form of regular arches portals and windows through which began dimly to gleam the heads of camels indorsed footnote camels indorsed and elephants indorsed with towers milton in paradise regained with human beings and at intervals the moving of men and horses in tumultuous array and then through other openings or vistas at far distant points the flashing of polished arms but sometimes as the wind slackened or died away all those openings of whatever form in the cloudy pall would slowly close and for a time the whole pageant was shut up from view although the growing din the clamors the shrieks and groans ascending from infuriated myriads reported in a language not to be misunderstood what was going on behind the cloudy screen it was in fact the kalmuck host now in the last extremities of their exhaustion and very fast approaching to that final stage of privation and intense misery beyond which few or none could have lived but also happily for themselves fast approaching in a literal sense that final stage of their long pilgrimage at which they would meet hospitality on a scale of royal magnificence and full protection from their enemies these enemies however as yet still were hanging on their rear as fiercely as ever though this day was destined to be the last of their hideous persecution the khan had in fact sent forward couriers with all the requisite statements and petitions addressed to the emperor of china these had been duly received and preparations made in consequence to welcome the kalmucks with the most paternal benevolence but as these couriers had been despatched from the torgau at the moment of arrival thither and before the advance of traubenberg had made it necessary for the khan to order a hasty renewal of the flight the emperor had not looked for their arrival on their frontier until full three months after the present time the khan had indeed expressly notified his intention to pass the summer heats on the banks of the torgau and to recommence his retreat about the beginning of september the subsequent change of plan being unknown to kien long left him for some time in doubt as to the true interpretation to be put upon this mighty apparition in the desert but at length the savage clamors of hostile fury and the clangor of weapons unveiled to the emperor the true nature of those unexpected calamities which had so prematurely precipitated the kalmuck measure apprehending the real state of affairs the emperor instantly perceived that the first act of his fatherly care for these erring children as he esteemed them now returning to their ancient obedience must be to deliver them from their pursuers and this was less difficult than might have been supposed not many miles in the rear was a body of well appointed cavalry with a strong detachment of artillery who always attended the emperors motions these were hastily summoned meantime it occurred to the train of courtiers that some danger might arise to the emperors person from the proximity of a lawless enemy and accordingly he was induced to retire a little to the rear it soon appeared however to those who watched the vapory shroud in the desert that its motion was not such as would argue the direction of the march to be exactly upon the pavilion but rather in a diagonal line making an angle of full fortyfive degrees with that line in which the imperial cortge had been standing and therefore with a distance continually increasing those who knew the country judged that the kalmucks were making for a large freshwater lake about seven or eight miles distant they were right and to that point the imperial cavalry was ordered up and it was precisely in that spot and about three hours after and at noonday on the th of september that the great exodus of the kalmuck tartars was brought to a final close and with a scene of such memorable and hellish fury as formed an appropriate windingup to an expedition in all its parts and details so awfully disastrous the emperor was not personally present or at least he saw whatever he did see from too great a distance to discriminate its individual features but he records in his written memorial the report made to him of this scene by some of his own officers the lake of tengis near the frightful desert of kobi lay in a hollow amongst hills of a moderate height ranging generally from two to three thousand feet high about eleven oclock in the forenoon the chinese cavalry reached the summit of a road which led through a cradlelike dip in the mountains right down upon the margin of the lake from this pass elevated about two thousand feet above the level of the water they continued to descend by a very winding and difficult road for an hour and a half and during the whole of this descent they were compelled to be inactive spectators of the fiendish spectacle below the kalmucks reduced by this time from about six hundred thousand souls to two hundred thousand and after enduring for two months and a half the miseries we have previously described outrageous heat famine and the destroying scimitar of the kirghises and the bashkirs had for the last ten days been traversing a hideous desert where no vestiges were seen of vegetation and no drop of water could be found camels and men were already so overladen that it was a mere impossibility that they should carry a tolerable sufficiency for the passage of this frightful wilderness on the eighth day the wretched daily allowance which had been continually diminishing failed entirely and thus for two days of insupportable fatigue the horrors of thirst had been carried to the fiercest extremity upon this last morning at the sight of the hills and the forest scenery which announced to those who acted as guides the neighborhood of the lake of tengis all the people rushed along with maddening eagerness to the anticipated solace the day grew hotter and hotter the people more and more exhausted and gradually in the general rush forwards to the lake all discipline and command were lost all attempts to preserve a rearguard were neglected the wild bashkirs rode in amongst the encumbered people and slaughtered them by wholesale and almost without resistance screams and tumultuous shouts proclaimed the progress of the massacre but none heeded none halted all alike pauper or noble continued to rush on with maniacal haste to the waters all with faces blackened by the heat preying upon the liver and with tongue drooping from the mouth the cruel bashkir was affected by the same misery and manifested the same symptoms of his misery as the wretched kalmuck the murderer was oftentimes in the same frantic misery as his murdered victim many indeed an ordinary effect of thirst in both nations had become lunatic and in this state whilst mere multitude and condensation of bodies alone opposed any check to the destroying scimitar and the trampling hoof the lake was reached and to that the whole vast body of enemies rushed and together continued to rush forgetful of all things at that moment but of one almighty instinct this absorption of the thoughts in one maddening appetite lasted for a single minute but in the next arose the final scene of parting vengeance far and wide the waters of the solitary lake were instantly dyed red with blood and gore here rode a party of savage bashkirs hewing off heads as fast as the swathes fall before the mowers scythe there stood unarmed kalmucks in a deathgrapple with their detested foes both up to the middle in water and oftentimes both sinking together below the surface from weakness or from struggles and perishing in each others arms did the bashkirs at any point collect into a cluster for the sake of giving impetus to the assault thither were the camels driven in fiercely by those who rode them generally women or boys and even these quiet creatures were forced into a share in this carnival of murder by trampling down as many as they could strike prostrate with the lash of their forelegs every moment the water grew more polluted and yet every moment fresh myriads came up to the lake and rushed in not able to resist their frantic thirst and swallowing large draughts of water visibly contaminated with the blood of their slaughtered compatriots wheresoever the lake was shallow enough to allow of men raising their heads above the water there for scores of acres were to be seen all forms of ghastly fear of agonizing struggle of spasm of convulsion of mortal conflict death and the fear of death revenge and the lunacy of revenge hatred and the frenzy of hatred until the neutral spectators of whom there were not a few now descending the eastern side of the lake at length averted their eyes in horror this horror which seemed incapable of further addition was however increased by an unexpected incident the bashkirs beginning to perceive here and there the approach of the chinese cavalry felt it prudent wheresoever they were sufficiently at leisure from the passions of the murderous scene to gather into bodies this was noticed by the governor of a small chinese fort built upon an eminence above the lake and immediately he threw in a broadside which spread havoc amongst the bashkir tribe as often as the bashkirs collected into globes and turms as their only means of meeting the long line of descending chinese cavalry so often did the chinese governor of the fort pour in his exterminating broadside until at length the lake at the lower end became one vast seething cauldron of human bloodshed and carnage the chinese cavalry had reached the foot of the hills the bashkirs attentive to their movements had formed skirmishes had been fought and with a quick sense that the contest was henceforwards rapidly becoming hopeless the bashkirs and kirghises began to retire the pursuit was not as vigorous as the kalmuck hatred would have desired but at the same time the very gloomiest hatred could not but find in their own dreadful experience of the asiatic deserts and in the certainty that these wretched bashkirs had to repeat that same experience a second time for thousands of miles as the price exacted by a retributary providence for their vindictive cruelty not the very gloomiest of the kalmucks or the least reflecting but found in all this a retaliatory chastisement more complete and absolute than any which their swords and lances could have obtained or human vengeance could have devised here ends the tale of the kalmuck wanderings in the desert for any subsequent marches which awaited them were neither long nor painful every possible alleviation and refreshment for their exhausted bodies had been already provided by kien long with the most princely munificence and lands of great fertility were immediately assigned to them in ample extent along the river ily not very far from the point at which they had first emerged from the wilderness of kobi but the beneficent attention of the chinese emperor may be best stated in his own words as translated into french by one of the jesuit missionaries la nation des torgotes savoir les kalmuques arriva ily toute delabree nayant ni de quoi vivre ni de quoi se vtir je lavais prvu et javais ordonn de faire en tout genre les provisions ncessaires pour pouvoir les secourir promptement cest ce qui a t excut on a fait la division des terres et on a assign chaque famille une portion suffisante pour pouvoir servir son entretien soit en la cultivant soit en y nourissant des bestiaux on a donne a chaque particulier des toffes pour lhabiller des grains pour se nourrir pendant lespace dune anne des ustensiles pour le mnage et dautres choses ncessaires et outre cela plusieurs onces dargent pour se pourvoir de ce quon aurait pu oublier on a dsign des lieux particuliers fertiles en pturages et on leur a donn des boeufs moutons c pour quils pussent dans la suite travailler par euxmmes a leur entretien et leur bientre these are the words of the emperor himself speaking in his own person of his own paternal cares but another chinese treating the same subject records the munificence of this prince in terms which proclaim still more forcibly the disinterested generosity which prompted and the delicate considerateness which conducted this extensive bounty he has been speaking of the kalmucks and he goes on thus lorsquils arrivrent sur nos frontires au nombre de plusieurs centaines de mille quoique la fatigue extrme la faim la soif et toutes les autres incommodits insparables dune trslongue et trs pnible route en eussent fait prir presque autant ils taient rduits a la dernire misre ils manquaient de tout il viz lempereur kien long leur fit prparer des logemens conformes a leur manire de vivre il leur fit distribuer des aliments et des habits il leur fit donner des boeufs des moutons et des ustensiles pour les mettre en tat de former des troupeaux et de cultiver la terre et tout cela ses propres frais qui se sont monts des sommes immenses sans compter largent quil a donn chaque chefdefamille pour pourvoir la subsistance de sa femme et de ses enfans thus after their memorable year of misery the kalmucks were replaced in territorial possessions and in comfort equal perhaps or even superior to that which they had enjoyed in russia and with superior political advantages but if equal or superior their condition was no longer the same if not in degree their social prosperity had altered in quality for instead of being a purely pastoral and vagrant people they were now in circumstances which obliged them to become essentially dependent upon agriculture and thus far raised in social rank that by the natural course of their habits and the necessities of life they were effectually reclaimed from roving and from the savage customs connected with so unsettled a life they gained also in political privileges chiefly through the immunity from military service which their new relations enabled them to obtain these were circumstances of advantage and gain but one great disadvantage there was amply to overbalance all other possible gain the chances were lost or were removed to an incalculable distance for their conversion to christianity without which in these times there is no absolute advance possible on the path of true civilization one word remains to be said upon the personal interests concerned in this great drama the catastrophe in this respect was remarkable and complete oubacha with all his goodness and incapacity of suspecting had since the mysterious affair on the banks of the torgau felt his mind alienated from his cousin he revolted from the man that would have murdered him and he had displayed his caution so visibly as to provoke a reaction in the bearing of zebekdorchi and a displeasure which all his dissimulation could not hide this had produced a feud which by keeping them aloof had probably saved the life of oubacha for the friendship of zebekdorchi was more fatal than his open enmity after the settlement on the ily this feud continued to advance until it came under the notice of the emperor on occasion of a visit which all the tartar chieftains made to his majesty at his huntinglodge in the emperor informed himself accurately of all the particulars connected with the transaction of all the rights and claims put forward and of the way in which they would severally affect the interests of the kalmuck people the consequence was that he adopted the cause of oubacha and repressed the pretensions of zebek dorchi who on his part so deeply resented this discountenance to his ambitious projects that in conjunction with other chiefs he had the presumption even to weave nets of treason against the emperor himself plots were laid were detected were baffled counterplots were constructed upon the same basis and with the benefit of the opportunities thus offered finally zebekdorchi was invited to the imperial lodge together with all his accomplices and under the skilful management of the chinese nobles in the emperors establishment the murderous artifices of these tartar chieftains were made to recoil upon themselves and the whole of them perished by assassination at a great imperial banquet for the chinese morality is exactly of that kind which approves in everything the lex talionis lex nec justior ulla est as they think quam necis artifices arte perire sua so perished zebekdorchi the author and originator of the great tartar exodus oubacha meantime and his people were gradually recovering from the effects of their misery and repairing their losses peace and prosperity under the gentle rule of a fatherly lord paramount redawned upon the tribes their household lares after so harsh a translation to distant climates found again a happy reinstatement in what had in fact been their primitive abodes they found themselves settled in quiet sylvan scenes rich in all the luxuries of life and endowed with the perfect loveliness of arcadian beauty but from the hills of this favored land and even from the level grounds as they approach its western border they still look out upon that fearful wilderness which once beheld a nation in agony the utter extirpation of nearly half a million from amongst its numbers and for the remainder a storm of misery so fierce that in the end as happened also at athens during the peloponnesian war from a different form of misery very many lost their memory all records of their past life were wiped out as with a sponge utterly erased and cancelled and many others lost their reason some in a gentle form of pensive melancholy some in a more restless form of feverish delirium and nervous agitation and others in the fixed forms of tempestuous mania raving frenzy or moping idiocy two great commemorative monuments arose in after years to mark the depth and permanence of the awe the sacred and reverential grief with which all persons looked back upon the dread calamities attached to the year of the tiger all who had either personally shared in those calamities and had themselves drunk from that cup of sorrow or who had effectually been made witnesses to their results and associated with their relief two great monuments we say first of all one in the religious solemnity enjoined by the dalai lama called in the tartar language a romanang that is a national commemoration with music the most rich and solemn of all the souls who departed to the rest of paradise from the afflictions of the desert this took place about six years after the arrival in china secondly another more durable and more commensurate to the scale of the calamity and to the grandeur of this national exodus in the mighty columns of granite and brass erected by the emperor kien long near the banks of the ily these columns stand upon the very margin of the steppes and they bear a short but emphatic inscription footnote this inscription has been slightly altered in one or two phrases and particularly in adapting to the christian era the emperors expressions for the year of the original exodus from china and the retrogressive exodus from russia with respect to the designation adopted for the russian emperor either it is built upon some confusion between him and the byzantine caesars as though the former being of the same religion with the latter and occupying in part the same longitudes though in different latitudes might be considered as his modern successor or else it refers simply to the greek form of christianity professed by the russian emperor and church to the following effect by the will of god here upon the brink of these deserts which from this point begin and stretch away pathless treeless waterless for thousands of miles and along the margins of many mighty nations rested from their labors and from great afflictions under the shadow of the chinese wall and by the favor of kien long gods lieutenant upon earth the ancient children of the wilderness the torgote tartars flying before the wrath of the grecian czar wandering sheep who had strayed away from the celestial empire in the year but are now mercifully gathered again after infinite sorrow into the fold of their forgiving shepherd hallowed be the spot for ever and hallowed be the day september amen end of volume i volume ii system of the heavens as revealed by lord rosses telescopes footnote thoughts on some important points relating to the system of the world by j p nichol lld professor of astronomy in the university of glasgow william tait edinburgh some years ago some person or other in fact i believe it was myself published a paper from the german of kant on a very interesting question viz the age of our own little earth those who have never seen that paper a class of unfortunate people whom i suspect to form rather the majority in our present perverse generation will be likely to misconceive its object kants purpose was not to ascertain how many years the earth had lived a million of years more or less made very little difference to him what he wished to settle was no such barren conundrum for had there even been any means of coercing the earth into an honest answer on such a delicate point which the sicilian canon recupero fancied that there was footnote recupero see brydones travels some sixty or seventy years ago the canon being a beneficed clergyman in the papal church was naturally an infidel he wished exceedingly to refute moses and he fancied that he really had done so by means of some collusive assistance from the layers of lava on mount etna but there survives at this day very little to remind us of the canon except an unpleasant guffaw that rises at times in solitary valleys of etna but which in my own opinion there neither is nor ought to be since a man deserves to be cudgelled who could put such improper questions to a lady planet still what would it amount to what good would it do us to have a certificate of our dear little mothers birth and baptism other people people in jupiter or the uranians may amuse themselves with her pretended foibles or infirmities it is quite safe to do so at their distance and in a female planet like venus it might be natural though strictly speaking not quite correct to scatter abroad malicious insinuations as though our excellent little mamma had begun to wear false hair or had lost some of her front teeth but all this we men of sense know to be gammon our mother tellus beyond all doubt is a lovely little thing i am satisfied that she is very much admired throughout the solar system and in clear seasons when she is seen to advantage with her bonny wee pet of a moon tripping round her like a lamb i should be thankful to any gentleman who will mention where he has happened to observe either he or his telescope will he only have the goodness to say in what part of the heavens he has discovered a more elegant turnout i wish to make no personal reflections i name no names only this i say that though some people have the gift of seeing things that other people never could see and though some other people or other some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths so that generally their geese count for swans yet after all swans or geese it would be a pleasure to me and really a curiosity to see the planet that could fancy herself entitled to sneeze at our earth and then if she viz our earth keeps but one moon even that you know is an advantage as regards some people that keep none there are people pretty well known to you and me that cant make it convenient to keep even one moon and so i come to my moral which is this that to all appearance it is mere justice but supposing it were not still it is our duty as children of the earth right or wrong to stand up for our bonny young mamma if she is young or for our dear old mother if she is old whether young or old to take her part against all comers and to argue through thick and thin which sober or not i always attempt to do that she is the most respectable member of the copernican system meantime what kant understood by being old is something that still remains to be explained if one stumbled in the steppes of tartary on the grave of a megalonyx and after long study had deciphered from some preadamite heiropothooks the following epitaph hic jacet a megalonyx or hic jacet a mammoth as the case might be who departed this life to the grief of his numerous acquaintance in the seventeen thousandth year of his age of course one would be sorry for him because it must be disagreeable at any age to be torn away from life and from all ones little megalonychal comforts thats not pleasant you know even if one is seventeen thousand years old but it would make all the difference possible in your grief whether the record indicated a premature death that he had been cut off in fact whilst just stepping into life or had kicked the bucket when full of honors and been followed to the grave by a train of weeping grandchildren he had died in his teens thats past denying but still we must know to what stage of life in a man had corresponded seventeen thousand years in a mammoth now exactly this was what kant desired to know about our planet let her have lived any number of years that you suggest shall we say if you please that she is in her billionth year still that tells us nothing about the period of life the stage which she may be supposed to have reached is she a child in fact or is she an adult and if an adult and that you gave a ball to the solar system is she that kind of person that you would introduce to a waltzing partner some fiery young gentlemen like mars or would you rather suggest to her the sort of partnership which takes place at a whisttable on this as on so many other questions kant was perfectly sensible that people of the finest understandings may and do take the most opposite views some think that our planet is in that stage of her life which corresponds to the playful period of twelve or thirteen in a spirited girl such a girl were it not that she is checked by a sweet natural sense of feminine grace you might call a romp but not a hoyden observe no horseplay oh no nothing of that sort and these people fancy that earthquakes volcanoes and all such little escapades will be over they will in lawyers phrase cease and determine as soon as our earth reaches the age of maidenly bashfulness poor thing its quite natural you know in a healthy growing girl a little overflow of vivacity a pirouette more or less what harm should that do to any of us nobody takes more delight than i in the fawnlike sportiveness of an innocent girl at this period of life even a shade of espiglerie does not annoy me but still my own impressions incline me rather to represent the earth as a fine noble young woman full of the pride which is so becoming to her sex and well able to take her own part in case that at any solitary point of the heavens she should come across one of those vulgar fussy comets disposed to be rude and take improper liberties these comets by the way are public nuisances very much like the mounted messengers of butchers in great cities who are always at full gallop and moving upon such an infinity of angles to human shinbones that the final purpose of such boys one of whom lately had the audacity nearly to ride down the duke of wellington seems to be not the translation of mutton which would certainly find its way into human mouths even if riding boys were not but the improved geometry of transcendental curves they ought to be numbered ought these boys and to wear badges x c and exactly the same evil asking therefore by implication for exactly the same remedy affects the comets a respectable planet is known everywhere and responsible for any mischief that he does but if a cry should arise stop that wretch who was rude to the earth who is he twenty voices will answer perhaps its enckes comet he is always doing mischief well what can you say it may be enckes it may be some other mans comet there are so many abroad and on so many roads that you might as well ask upon a night of fog such fog as may be opened with an oyster knife whose cab that was whose viz out of in london that floored you into the kennel these are constructive ideas upon the earths stage of evolution which kant was aware of and which will always find toleration even where they do not find patronage but others there are a class whom i perfectly abominate that place our earth in the category of decaying women nay of decayed women going going and all but gone hair like arctic snows failure of vital heat palsy that shakes the head as in the porcelain toys on our mantelpieces asthma that shakes the whole fabric these they absolutely fancy themselves to see they absolutely hear the tellurian lungs wheezing panting crying bellows to mend periodically as the earth approaches her aphelion but suddenly at this point a demur arises upon the total question kants very problem explodes bursts as poison in venetian wineglass of old shivered the glass into fragments for is there after all any stationary meaning in the question perhaps in reality the earth is both young and old young if she is not young at present perhaps she will be so in future old if she is not old at this moment perhaps she has been old and has a fair chance of becoming so again in fact she is a phoenix that is known to have secret processes for rebuilding herself out of her own ashes little doubt there is but she has seen many a birthday many a funeral night and many a morning of resurrection where now the mightiest of oceans rolls in pacific beauty once were anchored continents and boundless forests where the south pole now shuts her frozen gates inhospitably against the intrusions of flesh once were probably accumulated the ribs of empires mans imperial forehead womans roseate lips gleamed upon ten thousand hills and there were innumerable contributions to antarctic journals almost as good but not quite as our own even within our domestic limits even where little england in her south eastern quarter now devolves so quietly to the sea her sweet pastoral rivulets once came roaring down in pomp of waters a regal ganges footnote ganges dr nichol calls it by this name for the purpose of expressing its grandeur and certainly in breadth in diffusion at all times but especially in the rainy season the ganges is the cock of the walk in our british orient else as regards the body of water discharged the absolute payments made into the seas exchequer and the majesty of column riding downwards from the himalaya i believe that since sir alexander burness measurements the indus ranks foremost by a long chalk that drained some hyperbolical continent some quinbus flestrin of asiatic proportions long since gone to the dogs all things pass away generations wax old as does a garment but eternally god says come again ye children of men wildernesses of fruit and worlds of flowers are annually gathered in solitary south america to ancestral graves yet still the pomona of earth yet still the flora of earth does not become superannuated but blossoms in everlasting youth not otherwise by secular periods known to us geologically as facts though obscure as durations tellus herself the planet as a whole is for ever working by golden balances of change and compensation of ruin and restoration she recasts her glorious habitations in decomposing them she lies down for death which perhaps a thousand times she has suffered she rises for a new birth which perhaps for the thousandth time has glorified her disc hers is the wedding garment hers is the shroud that eternally is being woven in the loom and god imposes upon her the awful necessity of working for ever at her own grave yet of listening for ever to his faroff trumpet of palingenesis if this account of the matter be just and were it not treasonable to insinuate the possibility of an error against so great a swell as immanuel kant one would be inclined to fancy that mr kant had really been dozing a little on this occasion or agreeably to his own illustration elsewhere that he had realized the pleasant picture of one learned doctor trying to milk a hegoat whilst another doctor equally learned holds the milkpail below footnote kant applied this illustration to the case where one worshipful scholar proposes some impossible problem as the squaring of the circle or the perpetual motion which another worshipful scholar sits down to solve the reference was of course to virgils line atque idem jungat vulpes et mulgeat hircos and there is apparently this two edged embarrassment pressing upon the case that if our dear excellent mother the earth could be persuaded to tell us her exact age in julian years still that would leave us all as much in the dark as ever since if the answer were why children at my next birthday i shall count a matter of some million centuries we should still be at a loss to value her age would it mean that she was a mere chicken or that she was getting up in years on the other hand if declining to state any odious circumstantialities she were to reply no matter children for my precise years which are disagreeable remembrances i confess generally to being a lady of a certain age here in the inverse order given the valuation of the age we should yet be at a loss for the absolute years numerically would a certain age mean that mamma was a million be the same more or less or perhaps not much above seventy thousand every way you see reader there are difficulties but two things used to strike me as unaccountably overlooked by kant who to say the truth was profound yet at no time very agile in the character of his understanding first what age now might we take our brother and sister planets to be for that determination as to a point in their constitution will do something to illustrate our own we are as good as they i hope any day perhaps in a growl one might modestly insinuate better its not at all likely that there can be any great disproportion of age amongst children of the same household and therefore since kant always countenanced the idea that jupiter had not quite finished the upholstery of his extensive premises as a comfortable residence for a man jupiter having in fact a fine family of mammoths but no family at all of humans as brother jonathan calls them kant was bound ex analogo to hold that any little precedency in the trade of living on the part of our own mother earth could not count for much in the long run at newmarket or doncaster the start is seldom mathematically true trifling advantages will survive all human trials after abstract equity and the logic of this case argues that any few thousands of years by which tellus may have got ahead of jupiter such as the having finished her roman empire finished her crusades and finished her french revolution virtually amounts to little or nothing indicates no higher proportion to the total scale upon which she has to run than the few tickings of a watch by which one horse at the start for the leger is in advance of another when checked in our chronology by each other it transpires that in effect we are but executing the nice manoeuvre of a start and that the small matter of six thousand years by which we may have advanced our own position beyond some of our planetary rivals is but the outstretched neck of an uneasy horse at doncaster this is one of the data overlooked by kant and the less excusably overlooked because it was his own peculiar doctrine that uncle jupiter ought to be considered a greenhorn jupiter may be a younger brother of our mamma but if he is a brother at all he cannot be so very wide of our own chronology and therefore the first datum overlooked by kant was the analogy of our whole planetary system a second datum as it always occurred to myself might reasonably enough be derived from the intellectual vigor of us men if our mother could with any show of reason be considered an old decayed lady snoring stentorously in her armchair there would naturally be some aroma of phthisis or apoplexy beginning to form about us that are her children but is there if ever dr johnson said a true word it was when he replied to the scottish judge burnett so well known to the world as lord monboddo the judge a learned man but obstinate as a mule in certain prejudices had said plaintively querulously piteously ah doctor we are poor creatures we men of the eighteenth century by comparison with our forefathers oh no my lord said johnson we are quite as strong as our ancestors and a great deal wiser yes our kick is at least as dangerous and our logic does three times as much execution this would be a complex topic to treat effectively and i wish merely to indicate the opening which it offers for a most decisive order of arguments in such a controversy if the earth were on her last legs we her children could not be very strong or healthy whereas if there were less pedantry amongst us less malice less falsehood and less darkness of prejudice easy it would be to show that in almost every mode of intellectual power we are more than a match for the most conceited of elder generations and that in some modes we have energies or arts absolutely and exclusively our own amongst a thousand indications of strength and budding youth i will mention two is it likely is it plausible that our earth should just begin to find out effective methods of traversing land and sea when she had a summons to leave both is it not on the contrary a clear presumption that the great career of earthly nations is but on the point of opening that life is but just beginning to kindle when the great obstacles to effectual locomotion and therefore to extensive human intercourse are first of all beginning to give way secondly i ask peremptorily does it stand with good sense is it reasonable that earth is waning science drooping man looking downward precisely in that epoch when first of all mans eye is arming itself for looking effectively into the mighty depths of space a new era for the human intellect upon a path that lies amongst its most aspiring is promised is inaugurated by lord rosses almost awful telescope what is it then that lord rosse has accomplished if a man were aiming at dazzling by effects of rhetoric he might reply he has accomplished that which once the condition of the telescope not only refused its permission to hope for but expressly bade man to despair of what is it that lord rosse has revealed answer he has revealed more by far than he found the theatre to which he has introduced us is immeasurably beyond the old one which he found to say that he found in the visible universe a little wooden theatre of thespis a trteau or shed of vagrants and that he presented us at a price of toil and of anxiety that cannot be measured with a roman colosseum that is to say nothing it is to undertake the measurement of the tropics with the pockettape of an upholsterer columbus when he introduced the old world to the new after all that can be said in his praise did in fact only introduce the majority to the minority but lord rosse has introduced the minority to the majority there are two worlds one called anterosse and the other postrosse and if it should come to voting the latter would shockingly outvote the other augustus csar made it his boast when dying that he had found the city of rome built of brick and that he left it built of marble lateritiam invenit marmoream reliquit lord rosse may say even if today he should die i found gods universe represented for human convenience even after all the sublime discoveries of herschel upon a globe or spherical chart having a radius of one hundred and fifty feet and i left it sketched upon a similar chart keeping exactly the same scale of proportions but now elongating its radius into one thousand feet the reader of course understands that this expression founded on absolute calculations of dr nichol is simply meant to exhibit the relative dimensions of the mundus anterosseanus and the mundus postrosseanus for as to the absolute dimensions when stated in miles leagues or any units familiar to the human experience they are too stunning and confounding if again they are stated in larger units as for instance diameters of the earths orbit the unit itself that should facilitate the grasping of the result and which really is more manageable numerically becomes itself elusive of the mental grasp it comes in as an interpreter and as in some other cases the interpreter is hardest to be understood of the two if finally time be assumed as the exponent of the dreadful magnitudes time combining itself with motion as in the flight of cannonballs or the flight of swallows the sublimity becomes greater but horror seizes upon the reflecting intellect and incredulity upon the irreflective even a railroad generation that should have faith in the miracles of velocity lifts up its hands with an incredulus odi we know that dr nichol speaks the truth but he seems to speak falsehood and the ignorant bystander prays that the doctor may have grace given him and time for repentance whilst his more liberal companion reproves his want of charity observing that travellers into far countries have always had a license for lying as a sort of tax or fine levied for remunerating their own risks and that great astronomers as necessarily far travellers into space are entitled to a double per centage of the same munchausen privilege great is the mystery of space greater is the mystery of time either mystery grows upon man as man himself grows and either seems to be a function of the godlike which is in man in reality the depths and the heights which are in man the depths by which he searches the heights by which he aspires are but projected and made objective externally in the three dimensions of space which are outside of him he trembles at the abyss into which his bodily eyes look down or look up not knowing that abyss to be not always consciously suspecting it to be but by an instinct written in his prophetic heart feeling it to be boding it to be fearing it to be and sometimes hoping it to be the mirror to a mightier abyss that will one day be expanded in himself even as to the sense of space which is the lesser mystery than time i know not whether the reader has remarked that it is one which swells upon man with the expansion of his mind and that it is probably peculiar to the mind of man an infant of a year old or oftentimes even older takes no notice of a sound however loud which is a quarter of a mile removed or even in a distant chamber and brutes even of the most enlarged capacities seem not to have any commerce with distance distance is probably not revealed to them except by a presence viz by some shadow of their own animality which if perceived at all is perceived as a thing present to their organs an animal desire or a deep animal hostility may render sensible a distance which else would not be sensible but not render it sensible as a distance hence perhaps is explained and not out of any self oblivion from higher enthusiasm a fact that often has occurred of deer or hares or foxes and the pack of hounds in pursuit chaser and chased all going headlong over a precipice together depth or height does not readily manifest itself to them so that any strong motive is sufficient to overpower the sense of it man only has a natural function for expanding on an illimitable sensorium the illimitable growths of space man coming to the precipice reads his danger the brute perishes man is saved and the horse is saved by his rider but if this sounds in the ear of some a doubtful refinement the doubt applies only to the lowest degrees of space for the highest it is certain that brutes have no perception to man is as much reserved the prerogative of perceiving space in its higher extensions as of geometrically constructing the relations of space and the brute is no more capable of apprehending abysses through his eye than he can build upwards or can analyze downwards the rial synthesis of geometry such therefore as is space for the grandeur of mans perceptions such as is space for the benefit of mans towering mathematic speculations such is the nature of our debt to lord rosse as being the philosopher who has most pushed back the frontiers of our conquests upon this exclusive inheritance of man we have all heard of a king that sitting on the seashore bade the waves as they began to lave his feet upon their allegiance to retire that was said not vainly or presumptuously but in reproof of sycophantic courtiers now however we see in good earnest another man wielding another kind of sceptre and sitting upon the shores of infinity that says to the ice which had frozen up our progress melt thou before my breath that says to the rebellious nebul submit and burst into blazing worlds that says to the gates of darkness roll back ye barriers and no longer hide from us the infinities of god come and i will show you what is beautiful from the days of infancy still lingers in my ears this opening of a prose hymn by a lady then very celebrated viz the late mrs barbauld the hymn began by enticing some solitary infant into some silent garden i believe or some forest lawn and the opening words were come and i will show you what is beautiful well and what beside there is nothing beside oh disappointed and therefore enraged reader positively this is the sumtotal of what i can recall from the wreck of years and certainly it is not much even of sappho though time has made mere ducks and drakes of her lyrics we have rather more spared to us than this and yet this trifle simple as you think it this shred of a fragment if the reader will believe me still echoes with luxurious sweetness in my ears from some unaccountable hideand seek of fugitive childish memories just as a marine shell if applied steadily to the ear awakens according to the fine image of landor footnote of landor viz in his gebir but also of wordsworth in the excursion and i must tell the reader that a contest raged at one time as to the original property in this image not much less keen than that between neptune and minerva for the chancellorship of athens the great vision of the sea places the listener in the suns palaceporch and murmurs as the ocean murmurs there now on some moonless night in some fitting condition of the atmosphere if lord rosse would permit the reader and myself to walk into the front drawingroom of his telescope then in mrs barbaulds words slightly varied i might say to him come and i will show you what is sublime in fact what i am going to lay before him from dr nichols work is or at least would be when translated into hebrew grandeur by the mighty telescope a step above even that object which some fourandtwenty years ago in the british museum struck me as simply the sublimest sight which in this sightseeing world i had seen it was the memnons head then recently brought from egypt i looked at it as the reader must suppose in order to understand the depth which i have here ascribed to the impression not as a human but as a symbolic head and what it symbolized to me were the peace which passeth all understanding the eternity which baffles and confounds all faculty of computation the eternity which had been the eternity which was to be the diffusive love not such as rises and falls upon waves of life and mortality not such as sinks and swells by undulations of time but a procession an emanation from some mystery of endless dawn you durst not call it a smile that radiated from the lips the radiation was too awful to clothe itself in adumbrations or memorials of flesh in that mode of sublimity perhaps i still adhere to my first opinion that nothing so great was ever beheld the atmosphere for this for the memnon was the breathlessness which belongs to a saintly trance the holy thing seemed to live by silence but there is a picture the pendant of the memnon there is a dreadful cartoon from the gallery which has begun to open upon lord rosses telescope where the appropriate atmosphere for investing it must be drawn from another silence from the frost and from the eternities of death it is the famous nebula in the constellation of orion famous for the unexampled defiance with which it resisted all approaches from the most potent of former telescopes famous for its frightful magnitude and for the frightful depth to which it is sunk in the abysses of the heavenly wilderness famous just now for the submission with which it has begun to render up its secrets to the allconquering telescope and famous in all time coming for the horror of the regal phantasma which it has perfected to eyes of flesh had miltons incestuous mother with her fleshless son and with the warrior angel his father that led the rebellions of heaven been suddenly unmasked by lord rosses instrument in these dreadful distances before which simply as expressions of resistance the mind of man shudders and recoils there would have been nothing more appalling in the exposure in fact it would have been essentially the same exposure the same expression of power in the detestable phantom the same rebellion in the attitude the same pomp of malice in the features to a universe seasoned for its assaults the reader must look to dr nichols book at page for the picture of this abominable apparition but then in order to see what i see the obedient reader must do what i tell him to do let him therefore view the wretch upside down if he neglects that simple direction of course i dont answer for anything that follows without any fault of mine my description will be unintelligible this inversion being made the following is the dreadful creature that will then reveal itself description of the nebula in orion as forced to show out by lord rosse you see a head thrown back and raising its face or eyes if eyes it had in the very anguish of hatred to some unknown heavens what should be its skull wears what might be an assyrian tiara only ending behind in a floating train this head rests upon a beautifully developed neck and throat all power being given to the awful enemy he is beautiful where he pleases in order to point and envenom his ghostly ugliness the mouth in that stage of the apocalypse which sir john herschel was able to arrest in his eighteen inch mirror is amply developed brutalities unspeakable sit upon the upper lip which is confluent with a snout for separate nostrils there are none were it not for this one defect of nostrils and even in spite of this defect since in so mysterious a mixture of the angelic and the brutal we may suppose the sense of odor to work by some compensatory organ one is reminded by the phantoms attitude of a passage ever memorable in milton that passage i mean where death first becomes aware soon after the original trespass of his own future empire over man the meagre shadow even smiles for the first time and the last on apprehending his own abominable bliss by apprehending from afar the savor of mortal change on earth such a scent he says i draw of carnage prey innumerable as illustrating the attitude of the phantom in orion let the reader allow me to quote the tremendous passage so saying with delight he snuffd the smell of mortal change on earth as when a flock of ravenous fowl though many a league remote against the day of battle to a field where armies lie encampd come flying lured with scent of living carcasses designd for death the following day in bloody fight so scented the grim feature footnote so scented the grim feature feature is the old word for form or outline that is shadowy and also for form shadowy or not which abstracts from the matter by the way i have never seen it noticed that milton was indebted for the hint of this immortal passage to a superb lineandahalf in lucans pharsalia and upturnd his nostril wide into the murky air sagacious of his quarry from so far but the lower lip which is drawn inwards with the curve of a conch shell oh what a convolute of cruelty and revenge is there cruelty to whom revenge for what ask not whisper not look upwards to other mysteries in the very region of his temples driving itself downwards into his cruel brain and breaking the continuity of his diadem is a horrid chasm a ravine a shaft that many centuries would not traverse and it is serrated on its posterior wall with a harrow that perhaps is partly hidden from the anterior wall of this chasm rise in vertical directions two processes one perpendicular and rigid as a horn the other streaming forward before some portentous breath what these could be seemed doubtful but now when further examinations by sir john herschel at the cape of good hope have filled up the scattered outline with a rich umbrageous growth one is inclined to regard them as the plumes of a sultan dressed he is therefore as well as armed and finally comes lord rosse that glorifies him with the jewellery footnote the jewellery of stars and one thing is very remarkable viz that not only the stars justify this name of jewellery as usual by the life of their splendor but also in this case by their arrangement no jeweller could have set or disposed with more art the magnificent quadrille of stars which is placed immediately below the upright plume there is also another a truncated quadrille wanting only the left hand star or you might call it a bisected lozenge placed on the diadem but obliquely placed as regards the curve of that diadem two or three other arrangements are striking though not equally so both from their regularity and from their repeating each other as the forms in a kaleidoscope of stars he is now a vision to dream of not to tell he is ready for the worship of those that are tormented in sleep and the stages of his solemn uncovering by astronomy first by sir w herschel secondly by his son and finally by lord rosse is like the reversing of some heavenly doom like the raising of the seals that had been sealed by the angel in the revelations but the reader naturally asks how does all this concern lord rosses telescope on the one side or general astronomy on the other this nebula he will say seems a bad kind of fellow by your account and of course it will not break my heart to hear that he has had the conceit taken out of him but in what way can that affect the pretensions of this new instrument or if it did how can the character of the instrument affect the general condition of a science besides is not the science a growth from very ancient times with great respect for the earl of rosse is it conceivable that he or any man by one hours working the tackle of his new instrument can have carried any stunning revolutionary effect into the heart of a section so ancient in our mathematical physics but the reader is to consider that the ruins made by lord rosse are in sidereal astronomy which is almost wholly a growth of modern times and the particular part of it demolished by the new telescope is almost exclusively the creation of the two herschels father and son laplace it is true adopted their views and he transferred them to the particular service of our own planetary system but he gave to them no new sanction except what arises from showing that they would account for the appearances as they present themselves to our experience at this day that was a negative confirmation by which i mean that had their views failed in the hands of laplace then they were proved to be false but not failing they were not therefore proved to be true it was like proving a gun if the charge is insufficient or if in trying the strength of cast iron timber ropes c the strain is not up to the rigor of the demand you go away with perhaps a favorable impression as to the promises of the article it has stood a moderate trial it has stood all the trial that offered which is always something but you are still obliged to feel that when the ultimate test is applied smash may go the whole concern lord rosse applied an ultimate test and smash went the whole concern really i must have laughed though all the world had been angry when the shrieks and yells of expiring systems began to reverberate all the way from the belt of orion and positively at the very first broadside delivered from this huge four decker of a telescope but what was it then that went to wreck that is a thing more easy to ask than to answer at least for my own part i complain that some vagueness hangs over all the accounts of the nebular hypothesis however in this place a brief sketch will suffice herschel the elder having greatly improved the telescope began to observe with special attention a class of remarkable phenomena in the starry world hitherto unstudied viz milky spots in various stages of diffusion the nature of these appearances soon cleared itself up thus far that generally they were found to be starry worlds separated from ours by inconceivable distances and in that way concealing at first their real nature the whitish gleam was the mask conferred by the enormity of their remotion this being so it might have been supposed that as was the faintness of these cloudy spots or nebul such was the distance but that did not follow for in the treasury of nature it turned out that there were other resources for modifying the powers of distance for muffling and unmuffling the voice of stars suppose a world at the distance x which distance is so great as to make the manifestation of that world weak milky nebular now let the secret power that wields these awful orbs push this world back to a double distance that should naturally make it paler and more dilute than ever and yet by compression by deeper centralization this effect shall be defeated by forcing into far closer neighborhood the stars which compose this world again it shall gleam out brighter when at x than when at x at this point of compression let the great moulding power a second time push it back and a second time it will grow faint but once more let this world be tortured into closer compression again let the screw be put upon it and once again it shall shake off the oppression of distance as the dewdrops are shaken from a lions mane and thus in fact the mysterious architect plays at hideandseek with his worlds i will hide it he says and it shall be found again by man i will withdraw it into distances that shall seem fabulous and again it shall apparel itself in glorious light a third time i will plunge it into aboriginal darkness and upon the vision of man a third time it shall rise with a new epiphany but says the objector there is no such world there is no world that has thus been driven back and depressed from one deep to a lower deep granted but the same effect an illustration of the same law is produced equally whether you take four worlds all of the same magnitude and plunge them simultaneously into four different abysses sinking by graduated distances one below another or take one world and plunge it to the same distances successively so in geology when men talk of substances in different stages or of transitional states they do not mean that they have watched the same individual stratum or phenomenon exhibiting states removed from each other by depths of many thousand years how could they but they have seen one stage in the case a another stage in the case b they take for instance three objects the same to use the technical language of logic generically though numerically different under separate circumstances or in different stages of advance they are one object for logic they are three for human convenience so again it might seem impossible to give the history of a rose tree from infancy to age how could the same rose tree at the same time be young and old yet by taking the different developments of its flowers even as they hang on the same tree from the earliest bud to the full blown rose you may in effect pursue this vegetable growth through all its stages you have before you the bony blushing little rosebud and the respectable medival fullblown rose this point settled let it now be remarked that herschels resources enabled him to unmask many of these nebul stars they were and stars he forced them to own themselves why should any decent world wear an alias there was nothing you know to be ashamed of in being an honest cluster of stars indeed they seemed to be sensible of this themselves and they now yielded to the force of herschels arguments so far as to show themselves in the new character of nebul spangled with stars these are the stellar nebul quite as much as you could expect in so short a time rome was not built in a day and one must have some respect to stellar feelings it was noticed however that where a bright haze and not a weak milk andwater haze had revealed itself to the telescope this arising from a case of compression as previously explained required very little increase of telescopic power to force him into a fuller confession he made a clean breast of it but at length came a dreadful anomaly a nebula in the constellation andromeda turned restive another in orion i grieve to say it still more so i confine myself to the latter a very low power sufficed to bring him to a slight confession which in fact amounted to nothing the very highest would not persuade him to show a star just one said some coaxing person well be satisfied with only one but no he would not he was hardened he wouldnt split and herschel was thus led after waiting as long as flesh and blood could wait to infer two classes of nebul one that were stars and another that were not stars nor ever were meant to be stars yet that was premature he found at last that though not raised to the peerage of stars finally they would be so they were the matter of stars and by gradual condensation would become suns whose atmosphere by a similar process of condensing would become planets capable of brilliant literati and philosophers in several volumes octavo so stood the case for a long time it was settled to the satisfaction of europe that there were two classes of nebul one that were worlds one that were not but only the pabulum of future worlds silence arose a voice was heard let there be lord rosse and immediately his telescope walked into orion destroyed the supposed matter of stars but in return created immeasurable worlds as a hint for apprehending the delicacy and difficulty of the process in sidereal astronomy let the inexperienced reader figure to himself these separate cases of perplexity st a perplexity where the dilemma arises from the collision between magnitude and distance is the size less or the distance greater dly where the dilemma arises between motions a motion in ourselves doubtfully confounded with a motion in some external body or dly where it arises between possible positions of an object is it a real proximity that we see between two stars or simply an apparent proximity from lying in the same visual line though in far other depths of space as regards the first dilemma we may suppose two laws a and b absolutely in contradiction laid down at starting a that all fixed stars are precisely at the same distance in this case every difference in the apparent magnitude will indicate a corresponding difference in the real magnitude and will measure that difference b that all the fixed stars are precisely of the same magnitude in which case every variety in the size will indicate a corresponding difference in the distance and will measure that difference nor could we imagine any exception to these inferences from a or from b whichever of the two were assumed unless through optical laws that might not equally affect objects under different circumstances i mean for instance that might suffer a disturbance as applied under hypoth b to different depths in space or under hypoth a to different arrangements of structure in the star but thirdly it is certain that neither a nor b is the abiding law and next it becomes an object by science and by instruments to distinguish more readily and more certainly between the cases where the distance has degraded the size and the cases where the size being really less has caused an exaggeration of the distance or again where the size being really less yet cooperating with a distance really greater may degrade the estimate though travelling in a right direction below the truth or again where the size being really less yet counteracted by a distance also less may equally disturb the truth of human measurements and so on a second large order of equivocating appearances will arise not as to magnitude but as to motion if it could be a safe assumption that the system to which our planet is attached were absolutely fixed and motionless except as regards its own internal relations of movement then every change outside of us every motion that the registers of astronomy had established would be objective and not subjective it would be safe to pronounce at once that it was a motion in the object contemplated not in the subject contemplating or reversely if it were safe to assume as a universal law that no motion was possible in the starry heavens then every change of relations in space between ourselves and them would indicate and would measure a progress or regress on the part of our solar system in certain known directions but now because it is not safe to rest in either assumption the range of possibilities for which science has to provide is enlarged the immediate difficulties are multiplied but with the result as in the former case of reversionally expanding the powers and consequently the facilities lodged both in the science and in the arts ministerial to the science thus in the constellation cygnus there is a star gradually changing its relation to our system whose distance from ourselves as dr nichol tells us is ascertained to be about six hundred and seventy thousand times our own distance from the sun that is neglecting minute accuracy about six hundred and seventy thousand stages of one hundred million miles each this point being known it falls within the arts of astronomy to translate this apparent angular motion into miles and presuming this change of relation to be not in the star but really in ourselves we may deduce the velocity of our course we may enter into our log daily the rate at which our whole solar system is running bessel it seems the eminent astronomer who died lately computed this velocity to be such viz three times that of our own earth in its proper orbit as would carry us to the star in fortyone thousand years but in the mean time the astronomer is to hold in reserve some small share of his attention some trifle of a sideglance now and then to the possibility of an error after all in the main assumption he must watch the indications if any such should arise that not ourselves but the star in cygnus is the real party concerned in drifting at this shocking rate with no prospect of coming to an anchorage footnote it is worth adding at this point whilst the reader remembers without effort the numbers viz fortyone thousand years for the time the space being our own distance from the sun repeated six hundred and seventy thousand times what would be the time required for reaching in the body that distance to which lord rosses six feet mirror has so recently extended our vision the time would be as dr nichol computes about two hundred and fifty millions of years supposing that our rate of travelling was about three times that of our earth in its orbit now as the velocity is assumed to be the same in both cases the ratio between the distance already so tremendous of bessels cygni and that of lord rosses farthest frontier is as forty one thousand to two hundred and fifty millions this is a simple rule ofthree problem for a child and the answer to it will perhaps convey the simplest expression of the superhuman power lodged in the new telescope as is the ratio of fortyone thousand to two hundred and fifty million so is the ratio of our own distance from the sun multiplied by six hundred and seventy thousand to the outermost limit of lord rosses sidereal vision another class and a frequent one of equivocal phenomena phenomena that are reconcilable indifferently with either of two assumptions though less plausibly reconciled with the one than with the other concerns the position of stars that seem connected with each other by systematic relations and which yet may lie in very different depths of space being brought into seeming connection only by the human eye there have been and there are cases where two stars dissemble an interconnection which they really have and other cases where they simulate an interconnection which they have not all these cases of simulation and dissimulation torment the astronomer by multiplying his perplexities and deepening the difficulty of escaping them he cannot get at the truth in many cases magnitude and distance are in collusion with each other to deceive him motion subjective is in collusion with motion objective duplex systems are in collusion with fraudulent stars having no real partnership whatever but mimicking such a partnership by means of the limitations or errors affecting the human eye where it can apply no other sense to aid or to correct itself so that the business of astronomy in these days is no sinecure as the reader perceives and by another evidence it is continually becoming less of a sinecure formerly one or two men tycho suppose or in a later age cassini and horrox and bradley had observatories one man suppose observed the stars for all christendom and the rest of europe observed him but now up and down europe from the deep blue of italian skies to the cold frosty atmospheres of st petersburg and glasgow the stars are conscious of being watched everywhere and if all astronomers do not publish their observations all use them in their speculations new and brilliantly appointed observatories are rising in every latitude or risen and none by the way of these newborn observatories is more interesting from the circumstances of its position or more picturesque to a higher organ than the eye viz to the human heart than the new observatory raised by the university of glasgowfootnote it has been reported ever since the autumn of and the report is now august gathering strength that some railway potentate having taken a fancy for the ancient college of glasgow as a bauble to hang about his wifes neck no accounting for tastes has offered or will offer such a price that the good old academic lady in this her mossgrown antiquity seriously thinks of taking him at his word packing up her traps and being off when a spirit of galavanting comes across an aged lady it is always difficult to know where it will stop so in fact you know she may choose to steam for texas but the present impression is that she will settle down by the side of what you may call her married or settled daughter the observatory which one would be glad to have confirmed as indicating that no purpose of pleasureseeking had been working in elderly minds but the instinct of religious rest and aspiration the observatory would thus remind one of those early christian anchorites and selfexiled visionaries that being led by almost a necessity of nature to take up their residence in deserts sometimes drew after themselves the whole of their own neighborhood the new observatory of glasgow is now i believe finished and the only fact connected with its history that was painful as embodying and recording that vandal alienation from science literature and all their interests which has ever marked our too haughty and caliphomar like british government lay in the circumstance that the glasses of the apparatus the whole mounting of the establishment in so far as it was a scientific establishment and even the workmen for putting up the machinery were imported from bavaria we that once bade the world stand aside when the question arose about glasses or the graduation of instruments were now literally obliged to stand cap in hand bowing to mr somebody successor of frauenhofer or frauendevil in munich who caused that we should all be glad to know if not the wicked treasury that killed the hen that laid the golden eggs by taxing her until her spine broke it is to be hoped that at this moment and specifically for this offence some scores of exchequer men chancellors and other rubbish are in purgatory and perhaps working with shirtsleeves tucked up in purgatorial glasshouses with very small allowances of beer to defray the cost of perspiration but why trouble a festal remembrance with commemorations of crimes or criminals what makes the glasgow observatory so peculiarly interesting is its position connected with and overlooking so vast a city having more than three hundred thousand inhabitants in spite of an american sceptic nearly all children of toil and a city too which from the necessities of its circumstances draws so deeply upon that fountain of misery and guilt which some ordinance as ancient as our father jacob with his patriarchal well for samaria has bequeathed to manufacturing towns to ninevehs to babylons to tyres how tarnished with eternal canopies of smoke and of sorrow how dark with agitations of many orders is the mighty town below how serene how quiet how lifted above the confusion and the roar how liberated from the strifes of earth is the solemn observatory that crowns the grounds above and duly at night just when the toil of overwrought glasgow is mercifully relaxing then comes the summons to the laboring astronomer he speaks not of the night but of the day and the flaunting daylight as the hours in which no man can work and the least reflecting of men must be impressed by the idea that at wide intervals but intervals scattered over europe whilst all that mighty heart is by sleep resting from its labors secret eyes are lifted up to heaven in astronomical watchtowers eyes that keep watch and ward over spaces that make us dizzy to remember eyes that register the promises of comets and disentangle the labyrinths of worlds another feature of interest connected with the glasgow observatory is personal and founded on the intellectual characteristics of the present professor dr nichol in the deep meditative style of his mind seeking for rest yet placed in conflict for ever with the tumultuous necessity in him for travelling along the line of revolutionary thought and following it loyally wearied or not to its natural home in a sonnet of milton one of three connected with his own blindness he distinguishes between two classes of servants that minister to the purposes of god his state says he meaning gods state the arrangement of his regular service is kingly that is to say it resembles the mode of service established in the courts of kings and in this it resembles that service that there are two classes of ministers attending on his pleasure for as in the trains of kings are some that run without resting night or day to carry the royal messages and also others great lords in waiting that move not from the royal gates so of the divine retinues some are for action only some for contemplation thousands there are that at his bidding speed and post oer land and ocean without rest others on the contrary motionless as statues that share not in the agitations of their times that tremble not in sympathy with the storms around them but that listen that watch that wait for secret indications to be fulfilled or secret signs to be deciphered and of this latter class he addsthat they not less than the others are accepted by god or as it is so exquisitely expressed in the closing line they also serve that only stand and wait something analogous to this one may see in the distributions of literature and science many popularize and diffuse some reap and gather on their own account many translate into languages fit for the multitude messages which they receive from human voices some listen like kubla khan far down in caverns or hanging over subterranean rivers for secret whispers that mingle and confuse themselves with the general uproar of torrents but which can be detected and kept apart by the obstinate prophetic ear which spells into words and ominous sentences the distracted syllables of rial voices dr nichol is one of those who pass to and fro between these classes and has the rare function of keeping open their vital communications as a popularizing astronomer he has done more for the benefit of his great science than all the rest of europe combined and now when he notices without murmur the fact that his office of popular teacher is almost taken out of his hands so many are they who have trained of late for the duty that change has in fact been accomplished through knowledge through explanations through suggestions dispersed and prompted by himself for my own part as one belonging to the laity and not to the clerus in the science of astronomy i could scarcely have presumed to report minutely or to sit in the character of dissector upon the separate details of dr nichols works either this or those which have preceded it had there even been room left disposable for such a task but in this view it is sufficient to have made the general acknowledgment which already has been made that dr nichols works and his oral lectures upon astronomy are to be considered as the fundus of the knowledge on that science now working in this generation more important it is and more in reconciliation with the tenor of my own ordinary studies to notice the philosophic spirit in which dr nichols works are framed the breadth of his views the eternal tendency of his steps in advance or if advance on that quarter or at that point happens to be absolutely walled out for the present the vigor of the reconnoissances by which he examines the hostile intrenchments another feature challenges notice in reading astronomical works there arises from old experience of what is usually most faulty a wish either for the naked severities of science with a total abstinence from all display of enthusiasm or else if the cravings of human sensibility are to be met and gratified that it shall be by an enthusiasm unaffected and grand as its subject of that kind is the enthusiasm of dr nichol the grandeurs of astronomy are such to him who has a capacity for being grandly moved they are none at all to him who has not to the mean they become meannesses space for example has no grandeur to him who has no space in the theatre of his own brain i know writers who report the marvels of velocity c in such a way that they become insults to yourself it is obvious that in their way of insisting on our earths speed in her annual orbit they do not seek to exalt her but to mortify you and besides these fellows are answerable for provoking people into fibs for i remember one day that reading a statement of this nature about how many things the earth had done that we could never hope to do and about the number of cannon balls harnessed as a tandem which the earth would fly past without leaving time to say how are you off for soap in vexation of heart i could not help exclaiming thats nothing ive done a great deal more myself though when one turns it in ones mind you know there must be some inaccuracy there how different is dr nichols enthusiasm from this hypocritical and vulgar wonderment it shows itself not merely in reflecting the grandeurs of his theme and by the sure test of detecting and allying itself with all the indirect grandeurs that arrange themselves from any distance upon or about that centre but by the manifest promptness with which dr nichols enthusiasm awakens itself upon every road that leads to things elevating for man or to things promising for knowledge or to things which like dubious theories or imperfect attempts at systematizing though neutral as regards knowledge minister to what is greater than knowledge viz to intellectual power to the augmented power of handling your materials though with no more materials than before in his geological and cosmological inquiries in his casual speculations the same quality of intellect betrays itself the intellect that labors in sympathy with the laboring nisus of these gladiatorial times that works and sees the necessity of working the apparatus of many sciences towards a composite result the intellect that retires in one direction only to make head in another and that already is prefiguring the route beyond the barriers whilst yet the gates are locked there was a man in the last century and an eminent man too who used to say that whereas people in general pretended to admire astronomy as being essentially sublime he for his part looked upon all that sort of thing as a swindle and on the contrary he regarded the solar system as decidedly vulgar because the planets were all of them so infernally punctual they kept time with such horrible precision that they forced him whether he would or no to think of nothing but post office clocks mailcoaches and bookkeepers regularity may be beautiful but it excludes the sublime what he wished for was something like lloyds list comets due arrived mercury when last seen appeared to be distressed but made no signals pallas and vesta not heard of for some time supposed to have foundered moon spoken last night through a heavy bank of clouds out sixteen days all right now this poor mans misfortune was to have lived in the days of mere planetary astronomy at present when our own little system with all its grandeurs has dwindled by comparison to a subordinate province if any man is bold enough to say so a poor shivering unit amongst myriads that are brighter we ought no longer to talk of astronomy but of the astronomies there is the planetary the cometary the sidereal perhaps also others as for instance even yet the nebular because though lord rosse has smitten it with the son of amrams rod has made it open and cloven a path through it yet other and more fearful nebul may loom in sight if further improvements should be effected in the telescope that may puzzle even lord rosse and when he tells his famulus fire a shot at that strange fellow and make him show his colors possibly the mighty stranger may disdain the summons that would be vexatious we should all be incensed at that but no matter whats a nebula whats a world more or less in the spiritual heavens are many mansions in the starry heavens that are now unfolding and preparing to unfold before us are many vacant areas upon which the astronomer may pitch his secret pavilion he may dedicate himself to the service of the double suns he has my license to devote his whole time to the quadruple system of suns in lyra swammerdam spent his life in a ditch watching frogs and tadpoles why may not an astronomer give nine lives if he had them to the watching of that awful appearance in hercules which pretends to some rights over our own unoffending system why may he not mount guard with public approbation for the next fifty years upon the zodiacal light the interplanetary ether and other rarities which the professional body of astronomers would naturally keep if they could for their own private enjoyment there is no want of variety now nor in fact of irregularity for the most exquisite clockwork which from enormous distance seems to go wrong virtually for us does go wrong so that our friend of the last century who complained of the solar system would not need to do so any longer there are anomalies enough to keep him cheerful there are now even things to alarm us for anything in the starry worlds that look suspicious anything that ought not to be there is for all purposes of frightening us as good as a ghost but of all the novelties that excite my own interest in the expanding astronomy of recent times the most delightful and promising are those charming little pyrotechnic planetoids footnote pyrotechnic planetoids the reader will understand me as alluding to the periodic shooting stars it is now well known that as upon our own poor little earthly ocean we fall in with certain phenomena as we approach certain latitudes so also upon the great ocean navigated by our earth we fall in with prodigious showers of these meteors at periods no longer uncertain but fixed as jaildeliveries these remarkable showers of meteors says dr nichol observed at different periods in august and november seem to demonstrate the fact that at these periods we have come in contact with two streams of such planetoids then intersecting the earths orbit if they intermit it is only because they are shifting their nodes or points of intersection that variegate our annual course it always struck me as most disgusting that in going round the sun we must be passing continually over old roads and yet we had no means of establishing an acquaintance with them they might as well be new for every trip those chambers of ether through which we are tearing along night and day for our train stops at no stations doubtless if we could put some mark upon them must be old fellows perfectly liable to recognition i suppose they never have notice to quit and yet for want of such a mark though all our lives flying past them and through them we can never challenge them as known the same thing happens in the desert one monotonous iteration of sand sand sand unless where some miserable fountain stagnates forbids all approach to familiarity nothing is circumstantiated or differenced travel it for three generations and you are no nearer to identification of its parts so that it amounts to travelling through an abstract idea for the desert really i suspect the thing is hopeless but as regards our planetary orbit matters are mending for the last six or seven years i have heard of these fiery showers but indeed i cannot say how much earlier they were first noticed footnote somewhere i have seen it remarked that if on a public road you meet a party of four women it is at least fifty to one that they are all laughing whereas if you meet an equal party of my own unhappy sex you may wager safely that they are talking gravely and that one of them is uttering the word money hence it must be viz because our sisters are too much occupied with the playful things of this earth and our brothers with its gravities that neither party sufficiently watches the skies and that accounts for a fact which often has struck myself viz that in cities on bright moonless nights when some brilliant skirmishings of the aurora are exhibiting or even a luminous arch which is a broad ribbon of snowy light that spans the skies positively unless i myself say to people eyes upwards not one in a hundred male or female but fails to see the show though it may be seen gratis simply because their eyes are too uniformly reading the earth this downward direction of the eyes however must have been worse in former ages because else it never could have happened that until queen annes days nobody ever hinted in a book that there was such a thing or could be such a thing as the aurora borealis and in fact halley had the credit of discovering it as celebrating two annual festivals one in august one in november you are a little too late reader for seeing this years summer festival but thats no reason why you should not engage a good seat for the november meeting which if i recollect is about the th or the lord mayors day and on the whole better worth seeing for anything we know this may be a great day in the earths earlier history she may have put forth her original rose on this day or tried her hand at a primitive specimen of wheat or she may in fact have survived some gunpowder plot about this time so that the meteoric appearance may be a kind congratulating feudejoye on the anniversary of the happy event what it is that the cosmogony man in the vicar of wakefield would have thought of such novelties whether he would have favored us with his usual opinion upon such topics viz that anarchon ara kai ateleutaion to pan or have sported a new one exclusively for this occasion may be doubtful what it is that astronomers think who are a kind of cosmogony men the reader may learn from dr nichol note b p in taking leave of a book and a subject so well fitted to draw out the highest mode of that grandeur which can connect itself with the external a grandeur capable of drawing down a spiritual being to earth but not of raising an earthly being to heaven i would wish to contribute my own brief word of homage to this grandeur by recalling from a fading remembrance of twentyfive years back a short bravura of john paul richter i call it a bravura as being intentionally a passage of display and elaborate execution and in this sense i may call it partly my own that at twentyfive years distance after one single reading it would not have been possible for any man to report a passage of this length without greatly disturbing footnote disturbing neither perhaps should i much have sought to avoid alterations if the original had been lying before me for it takes the shape of a dream and this most brilliant of all german writers wanted in that field the severe simplicity that horror of the too much belonging to grecian architecture which is essential to the perfection of a dream considered as a work of art he was too elaborate to realize the grandeur of the shadowy the texture of the composition by altering one makes it partly ones own but it is right to mention that the sublime turn at the end belongs entirely to john paul god called up from dreams a man into the vestibule of heaven saying come thou hither and see the glory of my house and to the servants that stood around his throne he said take him and undress him from his robes of flesh cleanse his vision and put a new breath into his nostrils only touch not with any change his human heart the heart that weeps and trembles it was done and with a mighty angel for his guide the man stood ready for his infinite voyage and from the terraces of heaven without sound or farewell at once they wheeled away into endless space sometimes with the solemn flight of angel wing they fled through zaarrahs of darkness through wildernesses of death that divided the worlds of life sometimes they swept over frontiers that were quickening under prophetic motions from god then from a distance that is counted only in heaven light dawned for a time through a sleepy film by unutterable pace the light swept to them they by unutterable pace to the light in a moment the rushing of planets was upon them in a moment the blazing of suns was around them then came eternities of twilight that revealed but were not revealed to the right hand and to the left towered mighty constellations that by selfrepetitions and answers from afar that by counterpositions built up triumphal gates whose architraves whose archways horizontal upright rested rose at altitudes by spans that seemed ghostly from infinitude without measure were the architraves past number were the archways beyond memory the gates within were stairs that scaled the eternities above that descended to the eternities below above was below below was above to the man stripped of gravitating body depth was swallowed up in height insurmountable height was swallowed up in depth unfathomable suddenly as thus they rode from infinite to infinite suddenly as thus they tilted over abysmal worlds a mighty cry arose that systems more mysterious that worlds more billowy other heights and other depths were coming were nearing were at hand then the man sighed and stopped shuddered and wept his overladen heart uttered itself in tears and he said angel i will go no farther for the spirit of man aches with this infinity insufferable is the glory of god let me lie down in the grave from the persecutions of the infinite for end i see there is none and from all the listening stars that shone around issued a choral voice the man speaks truly end there is none that ever yet we heard of end is there none the angel solemnly demanded is there indeed no end and is this the sorrow that kills you but no voice answered that he might answer himself then the angel threw up his glorious hands to the heaven of heavens saying end is there none to the universe of god lo also there is no beginning note on throwing his eyes hastily over the preceding paper the writer becomes afraid that some readers may give such an interpretation to a few playful expressions upon the age of our earth c as to class him with those who use geology cosmology c for purposes of attack or insinuation against the scriptures upon this point therefore he wishes to make a firm explanation of his own opinions which whether right or wrong will liberate him once and for all from any such jealousy it is sometimes said that the revealer of a true religion does not come amongst men for the sake of teaching truths in science or correcting errors in science most justly is this said but often in terms far too feeble for generally these terms are such as to imply that although no function of his mission it was yet open to him although not pressing with the force of an obligation upon the revealer it was yet at his discretion if not to correct other mens errors yet at least in his own person to speak with scientific precision i contend that it was not i contend that to have uttered the truths of astronomy of geology c at the era of new born christianity was not only below the purposes of a religion but would have been against them even upon errors of a far more important class than any errors in science can ever be superstitions for instance that degraded the very idea of god prejudices and false usages that laid waste human happiness such as slavery and many hundreds of other abuses that might be mentioned the rule evidently acted upon by the founder of christianity was this given the purification of the fountain once assumed that the fountains of truth are cleansed all these derivative currents of evil will cleanse themselves and the only exceptions which i remember to this rule are two cases in which from the personal appeal made to his decision christ would have made himself a party to wretched delusions if he had not condescended to expose their folly but as a general rule the branches of error were disregarded and the roots only attacked if then so lofty a station was taken with regard even to such errors as had moral and spiritual relations how much more with regard to the comparative trifles as in the ultimate relations of human nature they are of merely human science but for my part i go further and assert that upon three reasons it was impossible for any messenger from god or offering himself in that character for a moment to have descended into the communication of truth merely scientific or economic or worldly and the reasons are these first because it would have degraded his mission by lowering it to the base level of a collision with human curiosity or with petty and transitory interests secondly because it would have ruined his mission would utterly have prostrated the free agency and the proper agency of that mission he that in those days should have proclaimed the true theory of the solar system and the heavenly forces would have been shut up at once as a lunatic likely to become dangerous but suppose him to have escaped that still as a divine teacher he has no liberty of caprice he must stand to the promises of his own acts uttering the first truth of a science he is pledged to the second taking the main step he is committed to all which follow he is thrown at once upon the endless controversies which science in every stage provokes and in none more than in the earliest or if he retires as from a scene of contest that he had not anticipated he retires as one confessing a human precipitance and a human oversight weaknesses venial in others but fatal to the pretensions of a divine teacher starting besides from such pretensions he could not as others might have the privilege of selecting arbitrarily or partially if upon one science then upon all if upon science then upon art if upon art and science then upon every branch of social economy upon every organ of civilization his reformations and advances are equally due due as to all if due as to any to move in one direction is constructively to undertake for all without power to retreat he has thus thrown the intellectual interests of his followers into a channel utterly alien to the purposes of a spiritual mission thus far he has simply failed but next comes a worse result an evil not negative but positive because thirdly to apply the light of a revelation for the benefit of a merely human science which is virtually done by so applying the illumination of an inspired teacher is to assault capitally the scheme of gods discipline and training for man to improve by heavenly means if but in one solitary science to lighten if but in one solitary section the condition of difficulty which had been designed for the strengthening and training of human faculties is pro tanto to disturb to cancel to contradict a previous purpose of god made known by silent indications from the beginning of the world wherefore did god give to man the powers for contending with scientific difficulties wherefore did he lay a secret train of continual occasions that should rise by intervals through thousands of generations for provoking and developing those activities in mans intellect if after all he is to send a messenger of his own more than human to intercept and strangle all these great purposes when therefore the persecutors of galileo alleged that jupiter for instance could not move in the way alleged because then the bible would have proclaimed it as they thus threw back upon god the burthen of discovery which he had thrown upon galileo why did they not by following out their own logic throw upon the bible the duty of discovering the telescope or discovering the satellites of jupiter and as no such discoveries were there why did they not by parity of logic and for mere consistency deny the telescope as a fact deny the jovian planets as facts but this it is to mistake the very meaning and purposes of a revelation a revelation is not made for the purpose of showing to idle men that which they may show to themselves by faculties already given to them if only they will exert those faculties but for the purpose of showing that which the moral darkness of man will not without supernatural light allow him to perceive with disdain therefore must every considerate person regard the notion that god could wilfully interfere with his own plans by accrediting ambassadors to reveal astronomy or any other science which he has commanded men to cultivate without revelation by endowing them with all the natural powers for doing so even as regards astronomy a science so nearly allying itself to religion by the loftiness and by the purity of its contemplations scripture is nowhere the parent of any doctrine nor so much as the silent sanctioner of any doctrine scripture cannot become the author of falsehood though it were as to a trifle cannot become a party to falsehood and it is made impossible for scripture to teach falsely by the simple fact that scripture on such subjects will not condescend to teach at all the bible adopts the erroneous language of men which at any rate it must do in order to make itself understood not by way of sanctioning a theory but by way of using a fact the bible uses postulates the phenomena of day and night of summer and winter and expresses them in relation to their causes as men express them men even that are scientific astronomers but the results which are all that concern scripture are equally true whether accounted for by one hypothesis which is philosophically just or by another which is popular and erring now on the other hand in geology and cosmology the case is still stronger here there is no opening for a compliance even with popular language here where there is no such stream of apparent phenomena running counter as in astronomy to the real phenomena neither is there any popular language opposed to the scientific the whole are abstruse speculations even as regards their objects not dreamed of as possibilities either in their true aspects or their false aspects till modern times the scriptures therefore nowhere allude to such sciences either under the shape of histories applied to processes current and in movement or under the shape of theories applied to processes past and accomplished the mosaic cosmogony indeed gives the succession of natural births and that succession will doubtless be more and more confirmed and illustrated as geology advances but as to the time the duration of this cosmogony it is the idlest of notions that the scriptures either have or could have condescended to human curiosity upon so awful a prologue to the drama of this world genesis would no more have indulged so mean a passion with respect to the mysterious inauguration of the world than the apocalypse with respect to its mysterious close yet the six days of moses days but is any man so little versed in biblical language as not to know that except in the merely historical parts of the jewish records every section of time has a secret and separate acceptation in the scriptures does an on though a grecian word bear scripturally either in daniel or in saint john any sense known to grecian ears do the seventy weeks of the prophet mean weeks in the sense of human calendars already the psalms xc already st peter d epist warn us of a peculiar sense attached to the word day in divine ears and who of the innumerable interpreters understands the twelve hundred and odd days in daniel or his two thousand and odd days to mean by possibility periods of twentyfour hours surely the theme of moses was as mystical and as much entitled to the benefit of mystical language as that of the prophets the sum of the matter is this god by a hebrew prophet is sublimely described as the revealer and in variation of his own expression the same prophet describes him as the being that knoweth the darkness under no idea can the relations of god to man be more grandly expressed but of what is he the revealer not surely of those things which he has enabled man to reveal for himself and which he has commanded him so to reveal but of those things which were it not through special light from heaven must eternally remain sealed up in the inaccessible darkness on this principle we should all laugh at a revealed cookery but essentially the same ridicule applies to a revealed astronomy or a revealed geology as a fact there is no such astronomy or geology as a possibility by the a priori argument which i have used viz that a revelation on such fields would contradict other machineries of providence there can be no such astronomy or geology consequently there can be none such in the bible consequently there is none consequently there can be no schism or feud upon these subjects between the bible and the philosophies outside geology is a field left open with the amplest permission from above to the widest and wildest speculations of man modern superstition it is said continually that the age of miracles is past we deny that it is so in any sense which implies this age to differ from all other generations of man except one it is neither past nor ought we to wish it past superstition is no vice in the constitution of man it is not true that in any philosophic view primus in orbe deos fecit timor meaning by fecit even so much as raised into light as burke remarked the timor at least must be presumed to preexist and must be accounted for if not the gods if the fear created the gods what created the fear far more true and more just to the grandeur of man it would have been to say primus in orbe deos fecit sensus infiniti even in the lowest caffre more goes to the sense of a divine being than simply his wrath or his power superstition indeed or the sympathy with the invisible is the great test of mans nature as an earthly combining with a celestial in superstition lies the possibility of religion and though superstition is often injurious degrading demoralizing it is so not as a form of corruption or degradation but as a form of nondevelopment the crab is harsh and for itself worthless but it is the germinal form of innumerable finer fruits not apples only the most exquisite and pears the peach and the nectarine are said to have radiated from this austere stock when cultured developed and transferred to all varieties of climate superstition will finally pass into pure forms of religion as man advances it would be matter of lamentation to hear that superstition had at all decayed until man had made corresponding steps in the purification and development of his intellect as applicable to religious faith let us hope that this is not so and by way of judging let us throw a hasty eye over the modes of popular superstition if these manifest their vitality it will prove that the popular intellect does not go along with the bookish or the worldly philosophic we cannot call it in pronouncing the miraculous extinct the popular feeling is all in all this function of miraculous power which is most widely diffused through pagan and christian ages alike but which has the least root in the solemnities of the imagination we may call the ovidian by way of distinction it may be so called and with some justice since ovid in his metamorphoses gave the first elaborate record of such a tendency in human superstition it is a movement of superstition under the domination of human affections a mode of spiritual awe which seeks to reconcile itself with human tenderness or admiration and which represents supernatural power as expressing itself by a sympathy with human distress or passion concurrently with human sympathies and as supporting that blended sympathy by a symbol incarnated with the fixed agencies of nature for instance a pair of youthful lovers perish by a double suicide originating in a fatal mistake and a mistake operating in each case through a noble selfoblivion the tree under which their meeting has been concerted and which witnesses their tragedy is supposed ever afterwards to express the divine sympathy with this catastrophe in the gloomy color of its fruit at tu qu ramis arbor miserabile corpus nunc tegis unius mox es tectura duorum signa tene cdis pullosque et luctibus aptos semper habe fructus gemini monumenta cruoris such is the dying adjuration of the lady to the tree and the fruit becomes from that time a monument of a double sympathy sympathy from man sympathy from a dark power standing behind the agencies of nature and speaking through them meantime the object of this sympathy is understood to be not the individual catastrophe but the universal case of unfortunate love exemplified in this particular romance the inimitable grace with which ovid has delivered these early traditions of human tenderness blending with human superstition is notorious the artfulness of the pervading connection by which every tale in the long succession is made to arise spontaneously out of that which precedes is absolutely unrivalled and this it was with his luxuriant gayety which procured for him a preference even with milton a poet so opposite by intellectual constitution it is but reasonable therefore that this function of the miraculous should bear the name of ovidian pagan it was in its birth and to paganism its titles ultimately ascend yet we know that in the transitional state through the centuries succeeding to christ during which paganism and christianity were slowly descending and ascending as if from two different strata of the atmosphere the two powers interchanged whatsoever they could see conyers middleton and see blount of our own days it marked the earthly nature of paganism that it could borrow little or nothing by organization it was fitted to no expansion but the true faith from its vast and comprehensive adaptation to the nature of man lent itself to many corruptions some deadly in their tendencies some harmless amongst these last was the ovidian form of connecting the unseen powers moving in nature with human sympathies of love or reverence the legends of this kind are universal and endless no land the most austere in its protestantism but has adopted these superstitions and everywhere by those even who reject them they are entertained with some degree of affectionate respect that the ass which in its very degradation still retains an underpower of sublimity footnote an underpower of sublimity everybody knows that homer compared the telamonian ajax in a moment of heroic endurance to an ass this however was only under a momentary glance from a peculiar angle of the case but the mahometan too solemn and also perhaps too stupid to catch the fanciful colors of things absolutely by choice under the bagdad caliphate decorated a most favorite hero with the title of the ass which title is repeated with veneration to this day the wild ass is one of the few animals which has the reputation of never flying from an enemy or of sublime suggestion through its ancient connection with the wilderness with the orient with jerusalem should have been honored amongst all animals by the visible impression upon its back of christian symbols seems reasonable even to the infantine understanding when made acquainted with its meekness its patience its suffering life and its association with the founder of christianity in one great triumphal solemnity the very man who brutally abuses it and feels a hardhearted contempt for its misery and its submission has a semi conscious feeling that the same qualities were possibly those which recommended it to a distinction footnote which recommended it to a distinction it might be objected that the oriental ass was often a superb animal that it is spoken of prophetically as such and that historically the syrian ass is made known to us as having been used in the prosperous ages of judea for the riding of princes but this is no objection those circumstances in the history of the ass were requisite to establish its symbolic propriety in a great symbolic pageant of triumph whilst on the other hand the individual animal there is good reason to think was marked by all the qualities of the general race as a suffering and unoffending tribe in the animal creation the asses on which princes rode were of a separate color of a peculiar breed and improved like the english racer by continual care when all things were valued upon a scale inverse to that of the world certain it is that in all christian lands the legend about the ass is current amongst the rural population the haddock again amongst marine animals is supposed throughout all maritime europe to be a privileged fish even in austere scotland every child can point out the impression of st peters thumb by which from age to age it is distinguished from fishes having otherwise an external resemblance all domesticated cattle having the benefit of mans guardianship and care are believed throughout england and germany to go down upon their knees at one particular moment of christmas eve when the fields are covered with darkness when no eye looks down but that of god and when the exact anniversary hour revolves of the angelic song once rolling over the fields and flocks of palestine footnote mahometanism which everywhere pillages christianity cannot but have its own face at times glorified by its stolen jewels this solemn hour of jubilation gathering even the brutal natures into its fold recalls accordingly the mahometan legend which the reader may remember is one of those incorporated into southeys thalaba of a great hour revolving once in every year during which the gates of paradise were thrown open to their utmost extent and gales of happiness issued forth upon the total family of man the glastonbury thorn is a more local superstition but at one time the legend was as widely diffused as that of loretto with the angelic translation of its sanctities on christmas morning it was devoutly believed by all christendom that this holy thorn put forth its annual blossoms and with respect to the aspen tree which mrs hemans very naturally mistook for a welsh legend having first heard it in denbighshire the popular faith is universal that it shivers mystically in sympathy with the horror of that mother tree in palestine which was compelled to furnish materials for the cross neither would it in this case be any objection if a passage were produced from solinus or theophrastus implying that the aspen tree had always shivered for the tree might presumably be penetrated by remote presentiments as well as by remote remembrances in so vast a case the obscure sympathy should stretch januslike each way and an objection of the same kind to the rainbow considered as the sign or seal by which god attested his covenant in bar of all future deluges may be parried in something of the same way it was not then first created true but it was then first selected by preference amongst a multitude of natural signs as yet unappropriated and then first charged with the new function of a message and a ratification to man pretty much the same theory that is the same way of accounting for the natural existence without disturbing the supernatural functions may be applied to the great constellation of the other hemisphere called the southern cross it is viewed popularly in south america and the southern parts of our northern hemisphere as the great banner or gonfalon held aloft by heaven before the spanish heralds of the true faith in to that superstitious and ignorant race it costs not an effort to suppose that by some synchronizing miracle the constellation had been then specially called into existence at the very moment when the first christian procession bearing a cross in their arms solemnly stepped on shore from the vessels of christendom we protestants know better we understand the impossibility of supposing such a narrow and local reference in orbs so transcendently vast as those composing the constellation orbs removed from each other by such unvoyageable worlds of space and having in fact no real reference to each other more than to any other heavenly bodies whatsoever the unity of synthesis by which they are composed into one figure of a cross we know to be a mere accidental result from an arbitrary synthesis of human fancy take such and such stars compose them into letters and they will spell such a word but still it was our own choice a synthesis of our own fancy originally to combine them in this way they might be divided from each other and otherwise combined all this is true and yet as the combination does spontaneously offer itself footnote does spontaneously offer itself heber bishop of calcutta complains that this constellation is not composed of stars answering his expectation in point of magnitude but he admits that the dark barren space around it gives to this inferior magnitude a very advantageous relief to every eye as the glorious cross does really glitter for ever through the silent hours of a vast hemisphere even they who are not superstitious may willingly yield to the belief that as the rainbow was laid in the very elements and necessities of nature yet still bearing a pre dedication to a service which would not be called for until many ages had passed so also the mysterious cipher of mans imperishable hopes may have been entwined and enwreathed with the starry heavens from their earliest creation as a prefiguration as a silent heraldry of hope through one period and as a heraldry of gratitude through the other all these cases which we have been rehearsing taking them in the fullest literality agree in this general point of union they are all silent incarnations of miraculous power miracles supposing them to have been such originally locked up and embodied in the regular course of nature just as we see lineaments of faces and of forms in petrifactions in variegated marbles in spars or in rocky strata which our fancy interprets as once having been real human existences but which are now confounded with the substance of a mineral product even those who are most superstitious therefore look upon cases of this order as occupying a midway station between the physical and the hyperphysical between the regular course of nature and the providential interruption of that course the stream of the miraculous is here confluent with the stream of the natural by such legends the credulous man finds his superstition but little nursed the incredulous finds his philosophy but little revolted both alike will be willing to admit for instance that the apparent act of reverential thanksgiving in certain birds when drinking is caused and supported by a physiological arrangement and yet perhaps both alike would bend so far to the legendary faith as to allow a child to believe and would perceive a pure childlike beauty in believing that the bird was thus rendering a homage of deep thankfulness to the universal father who watches for the safety of sparrows and sends his rain upon the just and upon the unjust in short the faith in this order of the physico miraculous is open alike to the sceptical and the nonsceptical it is touched superficially with the coloring of superstition with its tenderness its humility its thankfulness its awe but on the other hand it is not therefore tainted with the coarseness with the silliness with the credulity of superstition such a faith reposes upon the universal signs diffused through nature and blends with the mysterious of natural grandeurs wherever found with the mysterious of the starry heavens with the mysterious of music and with that infinite form of the mysterious for mans dimmest misgivings whose dwelling is the light of setting suns but from this earliest note in the ascending scale of superstitious faith let us pass to a more alarming key this first which we have styled in equity as well as for distinction the ovidian is too rial too allegoric almost to be susceptible of much terror it is the mere fancy in a mood halfplayful halftender which submits to the belief it is the feeling the sentiment which creates the faith not the faith which creates the feeling and thus far we see that modern feeling and christian feeling has been to the full as operative as any that is peculiar to paganism judging by the romish legenda very much more so the ovidian illustrations under a false superstition are entitled to give the designation as being the first the earliest but not at all as the richest besides that ovids illustrations emanated often from himself individually not from the popular mind of his country ours of the same classification uniformly repose on large popular traditions from the whole of christian antiquity these again are agencies of the supernatural which can never have a private or personal application they belong to all mankind and to all generations but the next in order are more solemn they become terrific by becoming personal these comprehend all that vast body of the marvellous which is expressed by the word ominous on this head as dividing itself into the ancient and modern we will speak next everybody is aware of the deep emphasis which the pagans laid upon words and upon names under this aspect of the ominous the name of several places was formally changed by the roman government solely with a view to that contagion of evil which was thought to lurk in the syllables if taken significantly thus the town of maleventum ill come as one might render it had its name changed by the romans to beneventum or welcome epidamnum again the grecian calais corresponding to the roman dover of brundusium was a name that would have startled the stoutesthearted roman from his propriety had he suffered this name to escape him inadvertently his spirits would have forsaken him he would have pined away under a certainty of misfortune like a poor negro of koromantyn who is the victim of obifootnote the victim of obi it seems worthy of notice that this magical fascination is generally called obi and the magicians obeah men throughout guinea negroland c whilst the hebrew or syriac word for the rites of necromancy was ob or obh at least when ventriloquism was concerned as a greek word which it was the name imported no ill but for a roman to say ibo epidamnum was in effect saying though in a hybrid dialect halfgreek halfroman i will go to ruin the name was therefore changed to dyrrachium a substitution which quieted more anxieties in roman hearts than the erection of a lighthouse or the deepening of the harbor mouth a case equally strong to take one out of many hundreds that have come down to us is reported by livy there was an officer in a roman legion at some period of the republic who bore the name either of atrius umber or umbrius ater and this man being ordered on some expedition the soldiers refused to follow him they did right we remember that mr coleridge used facetiously to call the wellknown sister of dr aikin mrs barbauld that pleonasm of nakedness the idea of nakedness being reduplicated and reverberated in the bare and the bald this atrius umber might be called that pleonasm of darkness and one might say to him in the words of othello what needs this iteration to serve under the gloomy was enough to darken the spirit of hope but to serve under the black gloomy was really rushing upon destruction yet it will be alleged that captain death was a most favorite and heroic leader in the english navy and that in our own times admiral coffin though an american by birth has not been unpopular in the same service this is true and all that can be said is that these names were twoedged swords which might be made to tell against the enemy as well as against friends and possibly the roman centurion might have turned his name to the same account had he possessed the great dictators presence of mind for he when landing in africa having happened to stumble an omen of the worst character in roman estimation took out its sting by following up his own oversight as if it had been intentional falling to the ground kissing it and ejaculating that in this way he appropriated the soil omens of every class were certainly regarded in ancient rome with a reverence that can hardly be surpassed but yet with respect to these omens derived from names it is certain that our modern times have more memorable examples on record out of a large number which occur to us we will cite two the present king of the french bore in his boyish days a title which he would not have borne but for an omen of bad augury attached to his proper title he was called the duc de chartres before the revolution whereas his proper title was duc de valois and the origin of the change was this the regents father had been the sole brother of louis quatorze he married for his first wife our english princess henrietta the sister of charles ii and through her daughter by the way it is that the house of savoy ie of sardinia has pretensions to the english throne this unhappy lady it is too well established was poisoned voltaire amongst many others has affected to doubt the fact for which in his time there might be some excuse but since then better evidences have placed the matter beyond all question we now know both the fact and the how and the why the duke who probably was no party to the murder of his young wife though otherwise on bad terms with her married for his second wife a coarse german princess homely in every sense and a singular contrast to the elegant creature whom he had lost she was a daughter of the bavarian elector illtempered by her own confession self willed and a plain speaker to excess but otherwise a woman of honest german principles unhappy she was through a long life unhappy through the monotony as well as the malicious intrigues of the french court and so much so that she did her best though without effect to prevent her bavarian niece from becoming dauphiness she acquits her husband however in the memoirs which she left behind of any intentional share in her unhappiness she describes him constantly as a welldisposed prince but whether it were that often walking in the dusk through the numerous apartments of that vast mansion which her husband had so much enlarged naturally she turned her thoughts to the injured lady who had presided there before herself or whether it arose from the inevitable gloom which broods continually over mighty palaces so much is known for certain that one evening in the twilight she met at a remote quarter of the receptionrooms something that she conceived to be a spectre what she fancied to have passed on that occasion was never known except to her nearest friends and if she made any explanations in her memoirs the editor has thought fit to suppress them she mentions only that in consequence of some ominous circumstances relating to the title of valois which was the proper second title of the orleans family her son the regent had assumed in his boyhood that of duc de chartres his elder brother was dead so that the superior title was open to him but in consequence of those mysterious omens whatever they might be which occasioned much whispering at the time the great title of valois was laid aside for ever as of bad augury nor has it ever been resumed through a century and a half that have followed that mysterious warning nor will it be resumed unless the numerous children of the present orleans branch should find themselves distressed for ancient titles which is not likely since they enjoy the honors of the elder house and are now the children of france in a technical sense here we have a great european case of state omens in the eldest of christian houses the next which we shall cite is equally a state case and carries its public verification along with itself in the spring of when napoleon was lying before acre he became anxious for news from upper egypt whither he had despatched dessaix in pursuit of a distinguished mameluke leader this was in the middle of may not many days after a courier arrived with favorable despatches favorable in the main but reporting one tragical occurrence on a small scale that to napoleon for a superstitious reason outweighed the public prosperity a djerme or nile boat of the largest class having on board a large party of troops and of wounded men together with most of a regimental band had run ashore at the village of benouth no case could be more hopeless the neighboring arabs were of the yambo tribe of all arabs the most ferocious these arabs and the fellahs whom by the way many of our countrymen are so ready to represent as friendly to the french and hostile to ourselves had taken the opportunity of attacking the vessel the engagement was obstinate but at length the inevitable catastrophe could be delayed no longer the commander an italian named morandi was a brave man any fate appeared better than that which awaited him from an enemy so malignant he set fire to the powder magazine the vessel blew up morandi perished in the nile and all of less nerve who had previously reached the shore in safety were put to death to the very last man with cruelties the most detestable by their inhuman enemies for all this napoleon cared little but one solitary fact there was in the report which struck him with consternation this illfated djerme what was it called it was called litalie and in the name of the vessel napoleon read an augury of the fate which had befallen the italian territory considered as a dependency of france he felt certain that italy was lost and napoleon was inconsolable but what possible connection it was asked can exist between this vessel on the nile and a remote peninsula of southern europe no matter replied napoleon my presentiments never deceive me you will see that all is ruined i am satisfied that my italy my conquest is lost to france so indeed it was all european news had long been intercepted by the english cruisers but immediately after the battle with the vizier in july an english admiral first informed the french army of egypt that massena and others had lost all that bonaparte had won in but it is a strange illustration of human blindness that this very subject of napoleons lamentation this very campaign of it was with its blunders and its long equipage of disasters that paved the way for his own elevation to the consulship just seven calendar months from the receipt of that egyptian despatch since most certainly in the struggle of brumaire doubtful and critical through every stage it was the pointed contrast between his italian campaigns and those of his successors which gave effect to napoleons pretensions with the political combatants and which procured them a ratification amongst the people the loss of italy was essential to the full effect of napoleons previous conquest that and the imbecile characters of napoleons chief military opponents were the true keys to the great revolution of brumaire the stone which he rejected became the keystone of the arch so that after all he valued the omen falsely though the very next news from europe courteously communicated by his english enemies showed that he had interpreted its meaning rightly these omens derived from names are therefore common to the ancient and the modern world but perhaps in strict logic they ought to have been classed as one subdivision or variety under a much larger head viz words generally no matter whether proper names or appellatives as operative powers and agencies having that is to say a charmed power against some party concerned from the moment that they leave the lips homer describes prayers as having a separate life rising buoyantly upon wings and making their way upwards to the throne of jove such but in a sense gloomy and terrific is the force ascribed under a widespread superstition ancient and modern to words uttered on critical occasions or to words uttered at any time which point to critical occasions hence the doctrine of euphaemismos the necessity of abstaining from strong words or direct words in expressing fatal contingencies it was shocking at all times of paganism to say of a third person if he should die or to suppose the case that he might be murdered the very word death was consecrated and forbidden si quiddam humanum passus fuerit was the extreme form to which men advanced in such cases and this scrupulous feeling originally founded on the supposed efficacy of words prevails to this day it is a feeling undoubtedly supported by good taste which strongly impresses upon us all the discordant tone of all impassioned subjects death religion c with the common key of ordinary conversation but good taste is not in itself sufficient to account for a scrupulousness so general and so austere in the lowest classes there is a shuddering recoil still felt from uttering coarsely and roundly the anticipation of a persons death suppose a child heir to some estate the subject of conversation the hypothesis of his death is put cautiously under such forms as if anything but good should happen if any change should occur if any of us should chance to miscarry and so forth always a modified expression is sought always an indirect one and this timidity arises under the old superstition still lingering amongst men like that ancient awe alluded to by wordsworth for the sea and its deep secrets feelings that have not no nor ever will utterly decay no excess of nautical skill will ever perfectly disenchant the great abyss from its terrors no progressive knowledge will ever medicine that dread misgiving of a mysterious and pathless power given to words of a certain import or uttered in certain situations by a parent to persecuting or insulting children by the victim of horrible oppression when laboring in final agonies and by others whether cursing or blessing who stand central to great passions to great interests or to great perplexities and here by way of parenthesis we may stop to explain the force of that expression so common in scripture thou hast said it it is an answer often adopted by our saviour and the meaning we hold to be this many forms in eastern idioms as well as in the greek occasionally though meant interrogatively are of a nature to convey a direct categorical affirmation unless as their meaning is modified by the cadence and intonation art thou detached from this vocal and accentual modification is equivalent to thou art nay even apart from this accident the popular belief authorized the notion that simply to have uttered any great thesis though unconsciously simply to have united verbally any two great ideas though for a purpose the most different or even opposite had the mysterious power of realizing them in act an exclamation though in the purest spirit of sport to a boy you shall be our imperator was many times supposed to be the forerunner and fatal mandate for the boys elevation such words executed themselves to connect though but for denial or for mockery the ideas of jesus and the messiah furnished an augury that eventually they would be found to coincide and to have their coincidence admitted it was an argumentum ad hominem and drawn from a popular faith but a modern reader will object the want of an accompanying design or serious meaning on the part of him who utters the words he never meant his words to be taken seriously nay his purpose was the very opposite true and precisely that is the reason why his words are likely to operate effectually and why they should be feared here lies the critical point which most of all distinguishes this faith words took effect not merely in default of a serious use but exactly in consequence of that default it was the chance word the stray word the word uttered in jest or in trifling or in scorn or unconsciously which took effect whilst ten thousand words uttered with purpose and deliberation were sure to prove inert one case will illustrate this alexander of macedon in the outset of his great expedition consulted the oracle at delphi for the sake of his army had he been even without personal faith he desired to have his enterprise consecrated no persuasions however would move the priestess to enter upon her painful and agitating duties for the sake of obtaining the regular answer of the god wearied with this alexander seized the great lady by the arm and using as much violence as was becoming to the two characters of a great prince acting and a great priestess suffering he pushed her gently backwards to the tripod on which in her professional character she was to seat herself upon this in the hurry and excitement of the moment the priestess exclaimed o pai anixaitos ei o son thou art irresistible never adverting for an instant to his martial purposes but simply to his personal importunities the person whom she thought of as incapable of resistance was herself and all she meant consciously was o son i can refuse nothing to one so earnest but mark what followed alexander desisted at once he asked for no further oracle he refused it and exclaimed joyously now then noble priestess farewell i have the oracle i have your answer and better than any which you could deliver from the tripod i am invincible so you have declared you cannot revoke it true you thought not of persia you thought only of my importunity but that very fact is what ratifies your answer in its blindness i recognise its truth an oracle from a god might be distorted by political ministers of the god as in time past too often has been suspected the oracle has been said to medize and in my own fathers time to philippize but an oracle delivered unconsciously indirectly blindly that is the oracle which cannot deceive such was the allfamous oracle which alexander accepted such was the oracle on which he and his army reposing went forth conquering and to conquer exactly on this principle do the turks act in putting so high a value on the words of idiots enlightened christians have often wondered at their allowing any weight to people bereft of understanding but that is the very reason for allowing them weight that very defect it is which makes them capable of being organs for conveying words from higher intelligences a fine human intelligence cannot be a passive instrument it cannot be a mere tube for conveying the words of inspiration such an intelligence will intermingle ideas of its own or otherwise modify what is given and pollute what is sacred it is also on this principle that the whole practice and doctrine of sortilegy rest let us confine ourselves to that mode of sortilegy which is conducted by throwing open privileged books at random leaving to chance the page and the particular line on which the oracular functions are thrown the books used have varied with the caprice or the error of ages once the hebrew scriptures had the preference probably they were laid aside not because the reverence for their authority decayed but because it increased in later times virgil has been the favorite considering the very limited range of ideas to which virgil was tied by his theme a colonizing expedition in a barbarous age no worse book could have been selected footnote no worse book could have been selected the probable reason for making so unhappy a choice seems to have been that virgil in the middle ages had the character of a necromancer a diviner c this we all know from dante now the original reason for this strange translation of character and functions we hold to have arisen from the circumstance of his maternal grandfather having borne the name of magus people in those ages held that a powerful enchanter exorciser c must have a magician amongst his cognati the power must run in the blood which on the maternal side could be undeniably ascertained under this preconception they took magus not for a proper name but for a professional designation amongst many illustrations of the magical character sustained by virgil in the middle ages we may mention that a writer about the year or the era of our robin hood published by montfaucon and cited by gibbon in his last volume says of virgil that captus a romanis invisibiliter exiit ivitque neapopolim so little indeed does the aeneid exhibit of human life in its multiformity that much tampering with the text is required to bring real cases of human interest and real situations within the scope of any virgilian sentence though aided by the utmost latitude of accommodation a king a soldier a sailor c might look for correspondences to their own circumstances but not many others accordingly everybody remembers the remarkable answer which charles i received at oxford from this virgilian oracle about the opening of the parliamentary war but from this limitation in the range of ideas it was that others and very pious people too have not thought it profane to resume the old reliance on the scriptures no case indeed can try so severely or put upon record so conspicuously this indestructible propensity for seeking light out of darkness this thirst for looking into the future by the aid of dice real or figurative as the fact of men eminent for piety having yielded to the temptation we give one instance the instance of a person who in practical theology has been perhaps more popular than any other in any church dr doddridge in his earlier days was in a dilemma both of conscience and of taste as to the election he should make between two situations one in possession both at his command he was settled at harborough in leicestershire and was pleasing himself with the view of a continuance in that situation true he had received an invitation to northampton but the reasons against complying seemed so strong that nothing was wanting but the civility of going over to northampton and making an apologetic farewell on the last sunday in november of the year the doctor went and preached a sermon in conformity with those purposes but says he on the morning of that day an incident happened which affected me greatly on the night previous it seems he had been urged very importunately by his northampton friends to undertake the vacant office much personal kindness had concurred with this public importunity the good doctor was affected he had prayed fervently alleging in his prayer as the reason which chiefly weighed with him to reject the offer that it was far beyond his forces and chiefly because he was too young footnote because he was too young dr doddridge was born in the summer of consequently he was at this era of his life about twentyseven years old and consequently not so obviously entitled to the excuse of youth but he pleaded his youth not with a view to the exertions required but to the auctoritas and responsibilities of the situation and had no assistant he goes on thus as soon as ever this address meaning the prayer was ended i passed through a room of the house in which i lodged where a child was reading to his mother and the only words i heard distinctly were these and as thy days so shall thy strength be this singular coincidence between his own difficulty and a scriptural line caught at random in passing hastily through a room but observe a line insulated from the context and placed in high relief to his ear shook his resolution accident cooperated a promise to be fulfilled at northampton in a certain contingency fell due at the instant the doctor was detained this detention gave time for further representations new motives arose old difficulties were removed and finally the doctor saw in all this succession of steps the first of which however lay in the sortes biblic clear indications of a providential guidance with that conviction he took up his abode at northampton and remained there for the next thirtyone years until he left it for his grave at lisbon in fact he passed at northampton the whole of his public life it must therefore be allowed to stand upon the records of sortilegy that in the main direction of his life not indeed as to its spirit but as to its form and local connections a protestant divine of much merit and chiefly in what regards practice and of the class most opposed to superstition took his determining impulse from a variety of the sortes virgilian this variety was known in early times to the jews as early indeed as the era of the grecian pericles if we are to believe the talmud it is known familiarly to this day amongst polish jews and is called bathcol or the daughter of a voice the meaning of which appellation is this the urim and thummim or oracle in the breastplate of the high priest spoke directly from god it was therefore the original or mothervoice but about the time of pericles that is exactly one hundred years before the time of alexander the great the light of prophecy was quenched in malachi or haggai and the oracular jewels in the breastplate became simultaneously dim henceforwards the mothervoice was heard no longer but to this succeeded an imperfect or daughtervoice bathcol which lay in the first words happening to arrest the attention at a moment of perplexity an illustration which has been often quoted from the talmud is to the following effect rabbi tochanan and rabbi simeon ben lachish were anxious about a friend rabbi samuel six hundred miles distant on the euphrates whilst talking earnestly together on this subject in palestine they passed a school they paused to listen it was a child reading the first book of samuel and the words which they caught were these and samuel died these words they received as a bathcol and the next horseman from the euphrates brought word accordingly that rabbi samuel had been gathered to his fathers at some station on the euphrates here is the very same case the same bathcol substantially which we have cited from ortons life of doddridge and du cange himself notices in his glossary the relation which this bore to the pagan sortes it was says he a fantastical way of divination invented by the jews not unlike the sortes virgilian of the heathens for as with them the first words they happened to dip into in the works of that poet were a kind of oracle whereby they predicted future events so with the jews when they appealed to bathcol the first words they heard from any ones mouth were looked upon as a voice from heaven directing them in the matter they inquired about if the reader imagines that this ancient form of the practical miraculous is at all gone out of use even the example of dr doddridge may satisfy him to the contrary such an example was sure to authorize a large imitation but even apart from that the superstition is common the records of conversion amongst felons and other ignorant persons might be cited by hundreds upon hundreds to prove that no practice is more common than that of trying the spiritual fate and abiding by the import of any passage in the scriptures which may first present itself to the eye cowper the poet has recorded a case of this sort in his own experience it is one to which all the unhappy are prone but a mode of questioning the oracles of darkness far more childish and under some shape or other equally common amongst those who are prompted by mere vacancy of mind without that determination to sacred fountains which is impressed by misery may be found in the following extravagant silliness of rousseau which we give in his own words a case for which he admits that he himself would have shut up any other man meaning in a lunatic hospital whom he had seen practising the same absurdities au milieu de mes tudes et dune vie innocente autant quon la puisse mener et malgr tout ce quon mavoit pu dire la peur de lenfer magitoit encore souvent je me demandois en quel tat suisje si je mourrois linstant mme seroisje damn selon mes jansnistes he had been reading the books of the port royal la chose est indubitable mais

salut je ne sais en me rappelant ce trait si je dois rire ou gmir sur moimme les confessions partie i livre vi now really if rousseau thought fit to try such tremendous appeals by taking a shy at any random object he should have governed his sortilegy for such it may be called with something more like equity fair play is a jewel and in such a case a man is supposed to play against an adverse party hid in darkness to shy at a cow within six feet distance gives no chance at all to his dark antagonist a pigeon rising from a trap at a suitable distance might be thought a sincere staking of the interest at issue but as to the massy stem of a tree fort gros et fort prs the sarcasm of a roman emperor applies that to miss under such conditions implied an original genius for stupidity and to hit was no trial of the case after all the sentimentalist had youth to plead in apology for this extravagance he was hypochondriacal he was in solitude and he was possessed by gloomy imaginations from the works of a society in the highest public credit but most readers will be aware of similar appeals to the mysteries of providence made in public by illustrious sectarians speaking from the solemn station of a pulpit we forbear to quote cases of this nature though really existing in print because we feel that the blasphemy of such anecdotes is more revolting and more painful to pious minds than the absurdity is amusing meantime it must not be forgotten that the principle concerned though it may happen to disgust men when associated with ludicrous circumstances is after all the very same which has latently governed very many modes of ordeal or judicial inquiry and which has been adopted blindly as a moral rule or canon equally by the blindest of the pagans the most fanatical of the jews and the most enlightened of the christians it proceeds upon the assumption that man by his actions puts a question to heaven and that heaven answers by the event lucan in a well known passage takes it for granted that the cause of csar had the approbation of the gods and why simply from the event it was notoriously the triumphant cause it was victorious victrix causa deis placuit sed victa catoni it was the victrix causa and as such simply because it was victrix it had a right in his eyes to postulate the divine favor as mere matter of necessary interference whilst on the other hand the victa causa though it seemed to lucan sanctioned by human virtue in the person of cato stood unappealably condemned this mode of reasoning may strike the reader as merely pagan not at all in england at the close of the parliamentary war it was generally argued that providence had decided the question against the royalists by the mere fact of the issue milton himself with all his hightoned morality uses this argument as irrefragable which is odd were it only on this account that the issue ought necessarily to have been held for a time as merely hypothetic and liable to be set aside by possible counterissues through one generation at the least but the capital argument against such doctrine is to be found in the new testament strange that milton should overlook and strange that moralists in general have overlooked the sudden arrest given to this dangerous but most prevalent mode of reasoning by the founder of our faith he first he last taught to his astonished disciples the new truth at that time the astounding truth that no relation exists between the immediate practical events of things on the one side and divine sentences on the other there was no presumption he teaches them against a mans favor with god or that of his parents because he happened to be afflicted to extremity with bodily disease there was no shadow of an argument for believing a party of men criminal objects of heavenly wrath because upon them by fatal preference a tower had fallen and because their bodies were exclusively mangled how little can it be said that christianity has yet developed the fulness of its power when kings and senates so recently acted under a total oblivion of this great though novel christian doctrine and would do so still were it not that religious arguments have been banished by the progress of manners from the field of political discussion but quitting this province of the ominous where it is made the object of a direct personal inquest whether by private or by national trials or the sortilegy of events let us throw our eyes over the broader field of omens as they offer themselves spontaneously to those who do not seek or would even willingly evade them there are few of these perhaps none which are not universal in their authority though every land in turn fancies them like its proverbs of local prescription and origin the deathwatch extends from england to cashmere and across india diagonally to the remotest nook of bengal over a three thousand miles distance from the entrance of the indian punjaub a hare crossing a mans path on starting in the morning has been held in all countries alike to prognosticate evil in the course of that day thus in the confessions of a thug which is partially built on a real judicial document and everywhere conforms to the usages of hindostan the hero of the horrid narrative footnote the hero of the horrid narrative horrid it certainly is and one incident in every case gives a demoniacal air of coolness to the hellish atrocities viz the regular forwarding of the bheels or grave diggers but else the tale tends too much to monotony and for a reason which ought to have checked the author in carrying on the work to three volumes namely that although there is much dramatic variety in the circumstances of the several cases there is none in the catastrophes the brave man and the coward the erect spirit fighting to the last and the poor creature that despairs from the first all are confounded in one undistinguishing end by sudden strangulation this was the original defect of the plan the sudden surprise and the scientific noosing as with a chilian lasso constituted in fact a main feature of thuggee but still the gradual theatrical arrangement of each thug severally by the side of a victim must often have roused violent suspicion and that in time to intercept the suddenness of the murder now for the sake of the dramatic effect this interception ought more often to have been introduced else the murders are but so many blind surprises as if in sleep charges some disaster of his own upon having neglected such an omen of the morning the same belief operated in pagan italy the same omen announced to lord lindsays arab attendants in the desert the approach of some disaster which partially happened in the morning and a highlander of the d regiment in his printed memoirs notices the same harbinger of evil as having crossed his own path on a day of personal disaster in spain birds are even more familiarly associated with such ominous warnings this chapter in the great volume of superstition was indeed cultivated with unusual solicitude amongst the pagans ornithomancy grew into an elaborate science but if every rule and distinction upon the number and the position of birds whether to the right or the left had been collected from our own village matrons amongst ourselves it would appear that no more of this pagan science had gone to wreck than must naturally follow the difference between a believing and a disbelieving government magpies are still of awful authority in village life according to their number c for a striking illustration of which we may refer the reader to sir walter scotts demonology reported not at secondhand but from sir walters personal communication with some seafaring fellowtraveller in a stagecoach among the ancient stories of the same class is one which we shall repeat having reference to that herod agrippa grandson of herod the great before whom st paul made his famous apology at csarea this agrippa overwhelmed by debts had fled from palestine to rome in the latter years of tiberius his mothers interest with the widow of germanicus procured him a special recommendation to her son caligula viewing this child and heir of the popular germanicus as the rising sun agrippa had been too free in his language true the uncle of germanicus was the reigning prince but he was old and breaking up true the son of germanicus was not yet on the throne but he soon would be and agrippa was rash enough to call the emperor a superannuated old fellow and even to wish for his death sejanus was now dead and gone but there was no want of spies and a certain macro reported his words to tiberius agrippa was in consequence arrested the emperor himself condescending to point out the noble jew to the officer on duty the case was a gloomy one if tiberius should happen to survive much longer and the story of the omen proceeds thus now agrippa stood in his bonds before the imperial palace and in his affliction leaned against a certain tree upon the boughs of which it happened that a bird had alighted which the romans call bubo or the owl all this was steadfastly observed by a german prisoner who asked a soldier what might be the name and offence of that man habited in purple being told that the mans name was agrippa and that he was a jew of high rank who had given a personal offence to the emperor the german asked permission to go near and address him which being granted he spoke thus this disaster i doubt not young man is trying to your heart and perhaps you will not believe me when i announce to you beforehand the providential deliverance which is impending however this much i will say and for my sincerity let me appeal to my native gods as well as to the gods of this rome who have brought us both into trouble that no selfish objects prompt me to this revelation for a revelation it is and to the following effect it is fated that you shall not long remain in chains your deliverance will be speedy you shall be raised to the very highest rank and power you shall be the object of as much envy as now you are of pity you shall retain your prosperity till death and you shall transmit that prosperity to your children but and there the german paused agrippa was agitated the bystanders were attentive and after a time the german pointing solemnly to the bird proceeded thus but this remember heedfully that when next you see the bird which now perches above your head you will have only five days longer to live this event will be surely accomplished by that same mysterious god who has thought fit to send the bird as a warning sign and you when you come to your glory do not forget me that foreshadowed it in your humiliation the story adds that agrippa affected to laugh when the german concluded after which it goes on to say that in a few weeks being delivered by the death of tiberius being released from prison by the very prince on whose account he had incurred the risk being raised to a tetrarchy and afterwards to the kingdom of all judea coming into all the prosperity which had been promised to him by the german and not losing any part of his interest at rome through the assassination of his patron caligula he began to look back respectfully to the words of the german and forwards with anxiety to the second coming of the bird seven years of sunshine had now slipped away as silently as a dream a great festival shows and vows was on the point of being celebrated in honor of claudius csar at stratos tower otherwise called csarea the roman metropolis of palestine duty and policy alike required that the king of the land should go down and unite in this mode of religious homage to the emperor he did so and on the second morning of the festival by way of doing more conspicuous honor to the great solemnity he assumed a very sumptuous attire of silver armor burnished so highly as to throw back a dazzling glare from the suns morning beams upon the upturned eyes of the vast multitude around him immediately from the sycophantish part of the crowd of whom a vast majority were pagans ascended a cry of glorification as to some manifestation of deity agrippa gratified by this success of his new apparel and by this flattery not unusual in the case of kings had not the firmness though a jew and conscious of the wickedness greater in himself than in the heathen crowd to reject the blasphemous homage voices of adoration continued to ascend when suddenly looking upward to the vast awnings prepared for screening the audience from the noonday heats the king perceived the same ominous bird which he had seen at rome in the day of his affliction seated quietly and looking down upon himself in that same moment an icy pang shot through his intestines he was removed into the palace and at the end of five days completely worn out by pain agrippa expired in the th year of his age and the seventh of his sovereign power whether the bird here described as an owl was really such may be doubted considering the narrow nomenclature of the romans for all zoological purposes and the total indifference of the roman mind to all distinctions in natural history which are not upon the very largest scale we should much suspect that the bird was a magpie meantime speaking of ornithoscopy in relation to jews we remember another story in that subdivision of the subject which it may be worth while repeating not merely on its own account as wearing a fine oriental air but also for the correction which it suggests to a very common error in some period of syrian warfare a large military detachment was entering at some point of syria from the desert of the euphrates at the head of the whole array rode two men of some distinction one was an augur of high reputation the other was a jew called mosollam a man of admirable beauty a matchless horseman an unerring archer and accomplished in all martial arts as they were now first coming within enclosed grounds after a long march in the wilderness the augur was most anxious to inaugurate the expedition by some considerable omen watching anxiously therefore he soon saw a bird of splendid plumage perching on a low wall halt he said to the advanced guard and all drew up in a line at that moment of silence and expectation mosollam slightly turning himself in his saddle drew his bowstring to his ear his jewish hatred of pagan auguries burned within him his inevitable shaft went right to its mark and the beautiful bird fell dead the augur turned round in fury but the jew laughed at him this bird you say should have furnished us with omens of our future fortunes but had he known anything of his own he would never have perched where he did or have come within the range of mosollams archery how should that bird know our destiny who did not know that it was his own to be shot by mosollam the jew now this is a most common but a most erroneous way of arguing in a case of this kind the bird was not supposed to have any conscious acquaintance with futurity either for his own benefit or that of others but even where such a consciousness may be supposed as in the case of oneiromancy or prophecy by means of dreams it must be supposed limited and the more limited in a personal sense as they are illimitable in a sublime one who imagines that because a daniel or ezekiel foresaw the grand revolutions of the earth therefore they must or could have foreseen the little details of their own ordinary life and even descending from that perfect inspiration to the more doubtful power of augury amongst the pagans concerning which the most eminent of theologians have held very opposite theories one thing is certain that so long as we entertain such pretensions or discuss them at all we must take them with the principle of those who professed such arts not with principles of our own arbitrary invention one example will make this clear there are in england footnote there are in england especially in somersetshire and for twenty miles round wrington the birthplace of locke nobody sinks for wells without their advice we ourselves knew an amiable and accomplished scottish family who at an estate called belmadrothie in memory of a similar property in ross shire built a house in somersetshire and resolved to find water without help from the jowser but after sinking to a greater depth than ever had been known before and spending nearly they were finally obliged to consult the jowser who found water at once a class of men who practise the pagan rhabdomancy in a limited sense they carry a rod or rhabdos rhabdos of willow this they hold horizontally and by the bending of the rod towards the ground they discover the favorable places for sinking wells a matter of considerable importance in a province so illwatered as the northern district of somersetshire c these people are locally called jowsers and it is probable that from the suspicion with which their art has been usually regarded amongst people of education as a mere legerdemain trick of dousterswivels is derived the slang word to chouse for swindle meantime the experimental evidences of a real practical skill in these men and the enlarged compass of speculation in these days have led many enlightened people to a stoic epochey or suspension of judgment on the reality of this somewhat mysterious art now in the east there are men who make the same pretensions in a more showy branch of the art it is not water but treasures which they profess to find by some hidden kind of rhabdomancy the very existence of treasures with us is reasonably considered a thing of improbable occurrence but in the unsettled east and with the low valuation of human life wherever mahometanism prevails insecurity and other causes must have caused millions of such deposits in every century to have perished as to any knowledge of survivors the sword has been moving backwards and forwards for instance like a weavers shuttle since the time of mahmoud the ghaznevide footnote mahmood of ghizni which under the european name of ghaznee was so recently taken in one hour by our indian army under lord keane mahmood was the first mahometan invader of hindostan in anno domini in the vast regions between the tigris the oxus and the indus regularly as it approached gold and jewels must have sunk by whole harvests into the ground a certain per centage has been doubtless recovered a larger per centage has disappeared for ever hence naturally the jealousy of barbarous orientals that we europeans in groping amongst pyramids sphynxes and tombs are looking for buried treasures the wretches are not so wide astray in what they believe as in what they disbelieve the treasures do really exist which they fancy but then also the other treasures in the glorious antiquities have that existence for our sense of beauty which to their brutality is inconceivable in these circumstances why should it surprise us that men will pursue the science of discovery as a regular trade many discoveries of treasure are doubtless made continually which for obvious reasons are communicated to nobody some proportion there must be between the sowing of such grain as diamonds or emeralds and the subsequent reaping whether by accident or by art for with regard to the last it is no more impossible prima fronte that a substance may exist having an occult sympathy with subterraneous water or subterraneous gold than that the magnet should have a sympathy as yet occult with the northern pole of our planet the first flash of careless thought applied to such a case will suggest that men holding powers of this nature need not offer their services for hire to others and this in fact is the objection universally urged by us europeans as decisive against their pretensions their knavery it is fancied stands selfrecorded since assuredly they would not be willing to divide their subterranean treasures if they knew of any but the men are not in such self contradiction as may seem lady hester stanhope from the better knowledge she had acquired of oriental opinions set dr madden right on this point the oriental belief is that a fatality attends the appropriator of a treasure in any case where he happens also to be the discoverer such a person it is held will die soon and suddenly so that he is compelled to seek his remuneration from the wages or fees of his employers not from the treasure itself many more secret laws are held sacred amongst the professors of that art than that which was explained by lady hester stanhope these we shall not enter upon at present but generally we may remark that the same practices of subterranean deposits during our troubled periods in europe led to the same superstitions and it may be added that the same error has arisen in both cases as to some of these superstitions how often must it have struck people of liberal feelings as a scandalous proof of the preposterous value set upon riches by poor men that ghosts should popularly be supposed to rise and wander for the sake of revealing the situations of buried treasures for ourselves we have been accustomed to view this popular belief in the light of an argument for pity rather than for contempt towards poor men as indicating the extreme pressure of that necessity which could so have demoralized their natural sense of truth but certainly in whatever feelings originating such popular superstitions as to motives of ghostly missions did seem to argue a deplorable misconception of the relation subsisting between the spiritual world and the perishable treasures of this perishable world yet when we look into the eastern explanations of this case we find that it is meant to express not any overvaluation of riches but the direct contrary passion a human spirit is punished such is the notion punished in the spiritual world for excessive attachment to gold by degradation to the office of its guardian and from this office the tortured spirit can release itself only by revealing the treasure and transferring the custody it is a penal martyrdom not an elective passion for gold which is thus exemplified in the wanderings of a treasureghost but in a field where of necessity we are so much limited we willingly pass from the consideration of these treasure or khasne phantoms which alone sufficiently ensure a swarm of ghostly terrors for all oriental ruins of cities to the same marvellous apparitions as they haunt other solitudes even more awful than those of ruined cities in this world there are two mighty forms of perfect solitude the ocean and the desert the wilderness of the barren sands and the wilderness of the barren waters both are the parents of inevitable superstitions of terrors solemn ineradicable eternal sailors and the children of the desert are alike overrun with spiritual hauntings from accidents of peril essentially connected with those modes of life and from the eternal spectacle of the infinite voices seem to blend with the raving of the sea which will for ever impress the feeling of beings more than human and every chamber of the great wilderness which with little interruption stretches from the euphrates to the western shores of africa has its own peculiar terrors both as to sights and sounds in the wilderness of zin between palestine and the red sea a section of the desert well known in these days to our own countrymen bells are heard daily pealing for matins or for vespers from some phantom convent that no search of christian or of bedouin arab has ever been able to discover these bells have sounded since the crusades other sounds trumpets the alala of armies c are heard in other regions of the desert forms also are seen of more people than have any right to be walking in human paths sometimes forms of avowed terror sometimes which is a case of far more danger appearances that mimic the shapes of men and even of friends or comrades this is a case much dwelt on by the old travellers and which throws a gloom over the spirits of all bedouins and of every cafila or caravan we all know what a sensation of loneliness or eeriness to use an expressive term of the ballad poetry arises to any small party assembling in a single room of a vast desolate mansion how the timid among them fancy continually that they hear some remote door opening or trace the sound of suppressed footsteps from some distant staircase such is the feeling in the desert even in the midst of the caravan the mighty solitude is seen the dread silence is anticipated which will succeed to this brief transit of men camels and horses awe prevails even in the midst of society but if the traveller should loiter behind from fatigue or be so imprudent as to ramble aside should he from any cause once lose sight of his party it is held that his chance is small of recovering their traces and why not chiefly from the want of footmarks where the wind effaces all impressions in half an hour or of eyemarks where all is one blank ocean of sand but much more from the sounds or the visual appearances which are supposed to beset and to seduce all insulated wanderers everybody knows the superstitions of the ancients about the nympholeptoi or those who had seen pan but far more awful and gloomy are the existing superstitions throughout asia and africa as to the perils of those who are phantomhaunted in the wilderness the old venetian traveller marco polo states them well he speaks indeed of the eastern or tartar deserts the steppes which stretch from european russia to the footsteps of the chinese throne but exactly the same creed prevails amongst the arabs from bagdad to suez and cairo from rosetta to tunis tunis to timbuctoo or mequinez if during the daytime says he any person should remain behind until the caravan is no longer in sight he hears himself unexpectedly called to by name and in a voice with which he is familiar not doubting that the voice proceeds from some of his comrades the unhappy man is beguiled from the right direction and soon finding himself utterly confounded as to the path he roams about in distraction until he perishes miserably if on the other hand this perilous separation of himself from the caravan should happen at night he is sure to hear the uproar of a great cavalcade a mile or two to the right or left of the true track he is thus seduced on one side and at break of day finds himself far removed from man nay even at noonday it is well known that grave and respectable men to all appearance will come up to a particular traveller will bear the look of a friend and will gradually lure him by earnest conversation to a distance from the caravan after which the sounds of men and camels will be heard continually at all points but the true one whilst an insensible turning by the tenth of an inch at each separate step from the true direction will very soon suffice to set the travellers face to the opposite point of the compass from that which his safety requires and which his fancy represents to him as his real direction marvellous indeed and almost passing belief are the stories reported of these desert phantoms which are said at times to fill the air with choral music from all kinds of instruments from drums and the clash of arms so that oftentimes a whole caravan are obliged to close up their open ranks and to proceed in a compact line of march lord lindsay in his very interesting travels in egypt edom c agrees with warton in supposing and probably enough that from this account of the desert traditions in marco polo was derived miltons fine passage in comus of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire and aery tongues that syllable mens names on sands and shores and desert wildernesses but the most remarkable of these desert superstitions as suggested by the mention of lord lindsay is one which that young nobleman in some place which we cannot immediately find has noticed but which he only was destined by a severe personal loss immediately to illustrate lord l quotes from vincent le blanc an anecdote of a man in his own caravan the companion of an arab merchant who disappeared in a mysterious manner four moors with a retaining fee of ducats were sent in quest of him but came back re infecta and tis uncertain adds le blanc whether he was swallowed up in the sands or met his death by any other misfortune as it often happens by the relation of a merchant then in our company who told us that two years before traversing the same journey a comrade of his going a little aside from the company saw three men who called him by his name and one of them to his thinking favored very much his companion and as he was about to follow them his real companion calling him to come back to his company he found himself deceived by the others and thus was saved and all travellers in these parts hold that in the deserts are many such phantasms seen that strive to seduce the traveller thus far it is the travellers own fault warned as he is continually by the extreme anxiety of the arab leaders or guides with respect to all who stray to any distance if he is duped or enticed by these pseudomen though in the case of lapland dogs who ought to have a surer instinct of detection for counterfeits we know from sir capel de broke and others that they are continually wiled away by the wolves who roam about the nightly encampments of travellers but there is a secondary disaster according to the arab superstition awaiting those whose eyes are once opened to the discernment of these phantoms to see them or to hear them even where the traveller is careful to refuse their lures entails the certainty of death in no long time this is another form of that universal faith which made it impossible for any man to survive a bodily commerce by whatever sense with a spiritual being we find it in the old testament where the expression i have seen god and shall die means simply a supernatural being since no hebrew believed it possible for a nature purely human to sustain for a moment the sight of the infinite being we find the same faith amongst ourselves in case of doppelgnger becoming apparent to the sight of those whom they counterfeit and in many other varieties we modern europeans of course laugh at these superstitions though as la place remarks essai sur les probabilits any case however apparently incredible if it is a recurrent case is as much entitled to a fair valuation as if it had been more probable beforehandfootnote is as much entitled to a fair valuation under the lans of induction as if it had been more probable beforehand one of the cases which la place notices as entitled to a grave consideration but which would most assuredly be treated as a trivial phenomenon unworthy of attention by commonplace spectators is when a run of success with no apparent cause takes place on heads or tails pile ou croix most people dismiss such a case as pure accident but la place insists on its being duly valued as a fact however unaccountable as an effect so again if in a large majority of experiences like those of lord lindsays party in the desert death should follow such a phenomenon is as well entitled to its separate valuation as any other this being premised we who connect superstition with the personal result are more impressed by the disaster which happened to lord lindsay than his lordship who either failed to notice the nexus between the events or possibly declined to put the case too forward in his readers eye from the solemnity of the circumstances and the private interest to himself and his own family of the subsequent event the case was this mr william wardlaw ramsay the companion and we believe relative of lord lindsay a man whose honorable character and whose intellectual accomplishments speak for themselves in the posthumus memorabilia of his travels published by lord l had seen an array of objects in the desert which facts immediately succeeding demonstrated to have been a mere ocular lusus or according to arab notions phantoms during the absence from home of an arab sheikh who had been hired as conductor of lord lindsays party a hostile tribe bearing the name of tellaheens had assaulted and pillaged his tents report of this had reached the english travelling party it was known that the tellaheens were still in motion and a hostile rencounter was looked for for some days at length in crossing the well known valley of the wady araba that most ancient channel of communication between the red sea and judea c mr ramsay saw to his own entire conviction a party of horse moving amongst some sandhills afterwards it became certain from accurate information that this must have been a delusion it was established that no horseman could have been in that neighborhood at that time lord lindsay records the case as an illustration of that spiritualized tone the imagination naturally assumes in scenes presenting so little sympathy with the ordinary feelings of humanity and he reports the case in these pointed terms mr ramsay a man of remarkably strong sight and by no means disposed to superstitious credulity distinctly saw a party of horse moving among the sandhills and i do not believe he was ever able to divest himself of that impression no and according to arab interpretation very naturally so for according to their faith he really had seen the horsemen phantom horseman certainly but still objects of sight the sequel remains to be told by the arabian hypothesis mr ramsay had but a short time to live he was under a secret summons to the next world and accordingly in a few weeks after this whilst lord lindsay had gone to visit palmyra mr ramsay died at damascus this was a case exactly corresponding to the pagan nympholepsis he had seen the beings whom it is not lawful to see and live another case of eastern superstition not less determined and not less remarkably fulfilled occurred some years before to dr madden who travelled pretty much in the same route as lord lindsay the doctor as a phrenologist had been struck with the very singular conformation of a skull which he saw amongst many others on an altar in some syrian convent he offered a considerable sum in gold for it but it was by repute the skull of a saint and the monk with whom dr m attempted to negotiate not only refused his offers but protested that even for the doctors sake apart from the interests of the convent he could not venture on such a transfer for that by the tradition attached to it the skull would endanger any vessel carrying it from the syrian shore the vessel might escape but it would never succeed in reaching any but a syrian harbor after this for the credit of our country which stands so high in the east and should be so punctiliously tended by all englishmen we are sorry to record that dr madden though otherwise a man of scrupulous honor yielded to the temptation of substituting for the saints skull another less remarkable from his own collection with this saintly relic he embarked on board a grecian ship was alternately pursued and met by storms the most violent larboard and starboard on every quarter he was buffeted the wind blew from every point of the compass the doctor honestly confesses that he often wished this baleful skull back in safety on the quiet altar from which he took it and finally after many days of anxiety he was too happy in finding himself again restored to some oriental port from which he secretly vowed never again to sail with a saints skull or with any skull however remarkable phrenologically not purchased in an open market thus we have pursued through many of its most memorable sections the spirit of the miraculous as it moulded and gathered itself in the superstitions of paganism and we have shown that in the modern superstitions of christianity or of mahometanism often enough borrowed from christian sources there is a pretty regular correspondence speaking with a reference to the strictly popular belief it cannot be pretended for a moment that miraculous agencies are slumbering in modern ages for one superstition of that nature which the pagans had we can produce twenty and if from the collation of numbers we should pass to that of quality it is a matter of notoriety that from the very philosophy of paganism and its slight root in the terrors or profounder mysteries of spiritual nature no comparison could be sustained for a moment between the true religion and any mode whatever of the false ghosts we have purposely omitted because that idea is so peculiarly christian footnote because that idea is so peculiarly christian one reason additional to the main one why the idea of a ghost could not be conceived or reproduced by paganism lies in the fourfold resolution of the human nature at death viz corpus manes spiritus anima no reversionary consciousness no restitution of the total nature sentient and active was thus possible pliny has a story which looks like a ghost story but it is all moonshine a mere simulacrum as to reject all counterparts or affinities from other modes of the supernatural the christian ghost is too awful a presence and with too large a substratum of the real the impassioned the human for our present purposes we deal chiefly with the wilder and more rial forms of superstition not so far off from fleshly nature as the purely allegoric not so near as the penal the purgatorial the penitential in this middle class gabriels hounds the phantom ship the gloomy legends of the charcoal burners in the german forests and the local or epichorial superstitions from every district of europe come forward by thousands attesting the high activity of the miraculous and the hyperphysical instincts even in this generation wheresoever the voice of the people makes itself heard but in pagan times it will be objected the popular superstitions blended themselves with the highest political functions gave a sanction to national counsels and oftentimes gave their starting point to the very primary movements of the state prophecies omens miracles all worked concurrently with senates or princes whereas in our days says charles lamb the witch who takes her pleasure with the moon and summons beelzebub to her sabbaths nevertheless trembles before the beadle and hides herself from the overseer now as to the witch even the horrid canidia of horace or the more dreadful erichtho of lucan seems hardly to have been much respected in any era but for the other modes of the supernatural they have entered into more frequent combinations with state functions and state movements in our modern ages than in the classical age of paganism look at prophecies for example the romans had a few obscure oracles afloat and they had the sibylline books under the state seal these books in fact had been kept so long that like port wine superannuated they had lost their flavor and body footnote like port wine superannuated the sibylline books had lost their flavor and their body there is an allegoric description in verse by mr rogers of an icehouse in which winter is described as a captive c which is memorable on this account that a brother poet on reading the passage mistook it from not understanding the allegorical expressions either sincerely or maliciously for a description of the housedog now this little anecdote seems to embody the poor sibyls history from a stern icy sovereign with a petrific mace she lapsed into an old toothless mastiff she continued to snore in her ancient kennel for above a thousand years the last person who attempted to stir her up with a long pole and to extract from her paralytic dreaming some growls or snarls against christianity was aurelian in a moment of public panic but the thing was past all tampering the poor creature could neither be kicked nor coaxed into vitality on the other hand look at france henry the historian speaking of the fifteenth century describes it as a national infirmity of the english to be prophecyridden perhaps there never was any foundation for this as an exclusive remark but assuredly not in the next century there had been with us british from the twelfth century thomas of ercildoune in the north and many monkish local prophets for every part of the island but latterly england had no terrific prophet unless indeed nixon of the vale royal in cheshire who uttered his dark oracles sometimes with a merely cestrian sometimes with a national reference whereas in france throughout the sixteenth century every principal event was foretold successively with an accuracy that still shocks and confounds us francis the first who opens the century and by many is held to open the book of modern history as distinguished from the middle or feudal history had the battle of pavia foreshown to him not by name but in its results by his own spanish captivity by the exchange for his own children upon a frontier river of spain finally by his own disgraceful death through an infamous disease conveyed to him under a deadly circuit of revenge this kings son henry the second read some years before the event a description of that tournament on the marriage of the scottish queen with his eldest son francis ii which proved fatal to himself through the awkwardness of the compte de montgomery and his own obstinacy after this and we believe a little after the brief reign of francis ii arose nostradamus the great prophet of the age all the children of henry ii and of catharine de medici one after the other died in circumstances of suffering and horror and nostradamus pursued the whole with ominous allusions charles ix though the authorizer of the bartholomew massacre was the least guilty of his party and the only one who manifested a dreadful remorse henry iii the last of the brothers died as the reader will remember by assassination and all these tragic successions of events are still to be read more or less dimly prefigured in verses of which we will not here discuss the dates suffice it that many authentic historians attest the good faith of the prophets and finally with respect to the first of the bourbon dynasty henry iv who succeeded upon the assassination of his brotherinlaw we have the peremptory assurance of sully and other protestants countersigned by writers both historical and controversial that not only was he prepared by many warnings for his own tragical death not only was the day the hour prefixed not only was an almanac sent to him in which the bloody summers day of was pointed out to his attention in bloody colors but the mere record of the kings last afternoon shows beyond a doubt the extent and the punctual limitation of his anxieties in fact it is to this attitude of listening expectation in the king and breathless waiting for the blow that schiller alludes in that fine speech of wallenstein to his sister where he notices the funeral knells that sounded continually in henrys ears and above all his prophetic instinct that caught the sound from a far distance of his murderers motions and could distinguish amidst all the tumult of a mighty capital those stealthy steps which even then were seeking him throughout the streets of paris we profess not to admire henry the fourth of france whose secret character we shall on some other occasion attempt to expose but his resignation to the appointments of heaven in dismissing his guards as feeling that against a danger so domestic and so mysterious all fleshly arms were vain has always struck us as the most like magnanimity of anything in his very theatrical life passing to our own country and to the times immediately in succession we fall upon some striking prophecies not verbal but symbolic if we turn from the broad highway of public histories to the bypaths of private memories either clarendon it is in his life not his public history or else laud who mentions an anecdote connected with the coronation of charles i the soninlaw of the murdered bourbon which threw a gloom upon the spirits of the royal friends already saddened by the dreadful pestilence which inaugurated the reign of this illfated prince levying a tribute of one life in sixteen from the population of the english metropolis at the coronation of charles it was discovered that all london would not furnish the quantity of purple velvet required for the royal robes and the furniture of the throne what was to be done decorum required that the furniture should be all en suite nearer than genoa no considerable addition could be expected that would impose a delay of days upon mature consideration and chiefly of the many private interests that would suffer amongst the multitudes whom such a solemnity had called up from the country it was resolved to robe the king in white velvet but this as it afterwards occurred was the color in which victims were arrayed and thus it was alleged did the kings council establish an augury of evil three other ill omens of some celebrity occurred to charles i viz on occasion of creating his son charles a knight of the bath at oxford some years after and at the bar of that tribunal which sat in judgment upon him the reign of his second son james ii the next reign that could be considered an unfortunate reign was inaugurated by the same evil omens the day selected for the coronation in was a day memorable for england it was st georges day the d of april and entitled even on a separate account to be held a sacred day as the birthday of shakspeare in and his deathday in the king saved a sum of sixty thousand pounds by cutting off the ordinary cavalcade from the tower of london to westminster even this was imprudent it is well known that amongst the lowest class of the english there is an obstinate prejudice though unsanctioned by law with respect to the obligation imposed by the ceremony of coronation so long as this ceremony is delayed or mutilated they fancy that their obedience is a matter of mere prudence liable to be enforced by arms but not consecrated either by law or by religion the change made by james was therefore highly imprudent shorn of its antique traditionary usages the yoke of conscience was lightened at a moment when it required a double ratification neither was it called for on motives of economy for james was unusually rich this voluntary arrangement was therefore a bad beginning but the accidental omens were worse they are thus reported by blennerhassett history of england to the end of george i vol iv p printed at newcastleupontyne the crown being too little for the kings head was often in a tottering condition and like to fall off even this was observed attentively by spectators of the most opposite feelings but there was another simultaneous omen which affected the protestant enthusiasts and the superstitious whether catholic or protestant still more alarmingly the same day the kings arms pompously painted in the great altar window of a london church suddenly fell down without apparent cause and broke to pieces whilst the rest of the window remained standing blennerhassett mutters the dark terrors which possessed himself and others these says he were reckoned ill omens to the king in france as the dreadful criminality of the french sovereigns through the th century began to tell powerfully and reproduce itself in the miseries and tumults of the french populace through the th century it is interesting to note the omens which unfolded themselves at intervals a volume might be written upon them the french bourbons renewed the picture of that fatal house which in thebes offered to the grecian observers the spectacle of dire auguries emerging from darkness through three generations plusieurs reprises everybody knows the fatal pollution of the marriage pomps on the reception of marie antoinette in paris the numbers who perished are still spoken of obscurely as to the amount and with shuddering awe for the unparalleled horrors standing in the background of the fatal reign horrors that hushd in grim repose await their evening prey but in the life of goethe is mentioned a still more portentous though more shadowy omen in the pictorial decorations of the arras which adorned the pavilion on the french frontier the first objects which met the austrian archduchess on being hailed as dauphiness was a succession of the most tragic groups from the most awful section of the grecian theatre the next alliance of the same kind between the same great empires in the persons of napoleon and the archduchess marie louisa was overshadowed by the same unhappy omens and as we all remember with the same unhappy results within a brief period of five years or if we should resort to the fixed and monumental rather than to these auguries of great nations such for instance as were embodied in those palladia or protesting talismans which capital cities whether pagan or christian glorified through a period of twentyfive hundred years we shall find a long succession of these enchanted pledges from the earliest precedent of troy whose palladium was undoubtedly a talisman down to that equally memorable and bearing the same name at western rome we may pass by a vast transition of two and a half millennia to that great talisman of constantinople the triple serpent having perhaps an original reference to the mosaic serpent of the wilderness which healed the infected by the simple act of looking upon it as the symbol of the redeemer held aloft upon the cross for the deliverance from moral contagion this great consecrated talisman venerated equally by christian by pagan and by mahometan was struck on the head by mahomet the second on that same day may th of in which he mastered by storm this glorious city the bulwark of eastern christendom and the immediate rival of his own european throne at adrianople but mark the superfetation of omens omen supervening upon omen augury engrafted upon augury the hour was a sad one for christianity just years before the western horn of islam had been rebutted in france by the germans chiefly under charles martel but now it seemed as though another horn even more vigorous was preparing to assault christendom and its hopes from the eastern quarter at this epoch in the very hour of triumph when the last of the csars had glorified his station and sealed his testimony by martyrdom the fanatical sultan riding to his stirrups in blood and wielding that iron mace which had been his sole weapon as well as cognizance through the battle advanced to the column round which the triple serpent roared spirally upwards he smote the brazen talisman he shattered one head he left it mutilated as the record of his great revolution but crush it destroy it he did not as a symbol prefiguring the fortunes of mahometanism his people noticed that in the critical hour of fate which stamped the sultans acts with efficacy through ages he had been prompted by his secret genius only to scotch the snake not to crush it afterwards the fatal hour was gone by and this imperfect augury has since concurred traditionally with the mahometan prophecies about the adrianople gate of constantinople to depress the ultimate hopes of islam in the midst of all its insolence the very haughtiest of the mussulmans believe that the gate is already in existence through which the red giaours the russi shall pass to the conquest of stamboul and that everywhere in europe at least the hat of frangistan is destined to surmount the turban the crescent must go down before the cross coleridge and opiumeating what is the deadest of things earthly it is says the world ever forward and rash a doornail but the world is wrong there is a thing deader than a doornail viz gillmans coleridge vol i dead more dead most dead is gillmans coleridge vol i and this upon more arguments than one the book has clearly not completed its elementary act of respiration the systole of vol i is absolutely useless and lost without the diastole of that vol ii which is never to exist that is one argument and perhaps this second argument is stronger gillmans coleridge vol i deals rashly unjustly and almost maliciously with some of our own particular friends and yet until late in this summer anno domini we that is neither ourselves nor our friends ever heard of its existence now a sloth even without the benefit of mr watertons evidence to his character will travel faster than that but malice which travels fastest of all things must be dead and cold at starting when it can thus have lingered in the rear for six years and therefore though the world was so far right that people do say dead as a doornail yet henceforward the weakest of these people will see the propriety of saying dead as gillmans coleridge the reader of experience on sliding over the surface of this opening paragraph begins to think theres mischief singing in the upper air no reader not at all we never were cooler in our days and this we protest that were it not for the excellence of the subject coleridge and opiumeating mr gillman would have been dismissed by us unnoticed indeed we not only forgive mr gillman but we have a kindness for him and on this account that he was good he was generous he was most forbearing through twenty years to poor coleridge when thrown upon his hospitality an excellent thing that mr gillman till noticing the theme suggested by this unhappy vol i we are forced at times to notice its author nor is this to be regretted we remember a line of horace never yet properly translated viz nec scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello the true translation of which as we assure the unlearned reader is nor must you pursue with the horrid knout of christopher that man who merits only a switching very true we protest against all attempts to invoke the exterminating knout for that sends a man to the hospital for two months but you see that the same judicious poet who dissuades an appeal to the knout indirectly recommends the switch which indeed is rather pleasant than otherwise amiably playful in some of its little caprices and in its worst suggesting only a pennyworth of diachylon we begin by professing with hearty sincerity our fervent admiration of the extraordinary man who furnishes the theme for mr gillmans coupdessai in biography he was in a literary sense our brother for he also was amongst the contributors to blackwood and will we presume take his station in that blackwood gallery of portraits which in a century hence will possess more interest for intellectual europe than any merely martial series of portraits or any gallery of statesmen assembled in congress except as regards one or two leaders for defunct majorgenerals and secondary diplomatists when their date is past awake no more emotion than last years advertisements or obsolete directories whereas those who in a stormy age have swept the harps of passion of genial wit or of the wrestling and gladiatorial reason become more interesting to men when they can no longer be seen as bodily agents than even in the middle chorus of that intellectual music over which living they presided of this great camp coleridge was a leader and fought amongst the primipili yet comparatively he is still unknown heavy indeed are the arrears still due to philosophic curiosity on the real merits and on the separate merits of samuel taylor coleridge coleridge as a poet coleridge as a philosopher how extensive are those questions if those were all and upon neither question have we yet any investigation such as by compass of views by research or even by earnestness of sympathy with the subject can or ought to satisfy a philosophic demand blind is that man who can persuade himself that the interest in coleridge taken as a total object is becoming an obsolete interest we are of opinion that even milton now viewed from a distance of two centuries is still inadequately judged or appreciated in his character of poet of patriot and partisan or finally in his character of accomplished scholar but if so how much less can it be pretended that satisfaction has been rendered to the claims of coleridge for upon milton libraries have been written there has been time for the malice of men for the jealousy of men for the enthusiasm the scepticism the adoring admiration of men to expand themselves there has been room for a bentley for an addison for a johnson for a wicked lauder for an avenging douglas for an idolizing chateaubriand and yet after all little enough has been done towards any comprehensive estimate of the mighty being concerned piles of materials have been gathered to the ground but for the monument which should have risen from these materials neither the first stone has been laid nor has a qualified architect yet presented his credentials on the other hand upon coleridge little comparatively has yet been written whilst the separate characters on which the judgment is awaited are more by one than those which milton sustained coleridge also is a poet coleridge also was mixed up with the fervent politics of his age an age how memorably reflecting the revolutionary agitations of miltons age coleridge also was an extensive and brilliant scholar whatever might be the separate proportions of the two men in each particular department of the three here noticed think as the reader will upon that point sure we are that either subject is ample enough to make a strain upon the amplest faculties how alarming therefore for any honest critic who should undertake this later subject of coleridge to recollect that after pursuing him through a zodiac of splendors corresponding to those of milton in kind however different in degree after weighing him as a poet as a philosophic politician as a scholar he will have to wheel after him into another orbit into the unfathomable nimbus of transcendental metaphysics weigh him the critic must in the golden balance of philosophy the most abstruse a balance which even itself requires weighing previously or he will have done nothing that can be received for an estimate of the composite coleridge this astonishing man be it again remembered besides being an exquisite poet a profound political speculator a philosophic student of literature through all its chambers and recesses was also a circumnavigator on the most pathless waters of scholasticism and metaphysics he had sounded without guiding charts the secret deeps of proclus and plotinus he had laid down buoys on the twilight or moonlight ocean of jacob boehmen footnote jacob boehmen we ourselves had the honor of presenting to mr coleridge laws english version of jacob a set of huge quartos some months afterwards we saw this work lying open and one volume at least overflowing in parts with the commentaries and the corollaries of coleridge whither has this work and so many others swathed about with coleridges ms notes vanished from the world he had cruised over the broad atlantic of kant and schelling of fichte and oken where is the man who shall be equal to these things we at least make no such adventurous effort or if ever we should presume to do so not at present here we design only to make a coasting voyage of survey round the headlands and most conspicuous seamarks of our subject as they are brought forward by mr gillman or collaterally suggested by our own reflections and especially we wish to say a word or two on coleridge as an opiumeater naturally the first point to which we direct our attention is the history and personal relations of coleridge living with mr gillman for nineteen years as a domesticated friend coleridge ought to have been known intimately and it is reasonable to expect from so much intercourse some additions to our slender knowledge of coleridges adventures if we may use so coarse a word and of the secret springs at work in those early struggles of coleridge at cambridge london bristol which have been rudely told to the world and repeatedly told as showy romances but never rationally explained the anecdotes however which mr gillman has added to the personal history of coleridge are as little advantageous to the effect of his own book as they are to the interest of the memorable character which he seeks to illustrate always they are told without grace and generally are suspicious in their details mr gillman we believe to be too upright a man for countenancing any untruth he has been deceived for example will any man believe this a certain excellent equestrian falling in with coleridge on horseback thus accosted him pray sir did you meet a tailor along the road a tailor answered coleridge i did meet a person answering such a description who told me he had dropped his goose that if i rode a little further i should find it and i guess he must have meant you in joe miller this story would read perhaps sufferably joe has a privilege and we do not look too narrowly into the mouth of a joemillerism but mr gillman writing the life of a philosopher and no jestbook is under a different law of decorum that retort however which silences the jester it may seem must be a good one and we are desired to believe that in this case the baffled assailant rode off in a spirit of benign candor saying aloud to himself like the excellent philosopher that he evidently was caught a tartar but another story of a sporting baronet who was besides a member of parliament is much worse and altogether degrading to coleridge this gentleman by way of showing off before a party of ladies is represented as insulting coleridge by putting questions to him on the qualities of his horse so as to draw the animals miserable defects into public notice and then closing his display by demanding what he would take for the horse including the rider the supposed reply of coleridge might seem good to those who understand nothing of true dignity for as an impromptu it was smart and even caustic the baronet it seems was reputed to have been bought by the minister and the reader will at once divine that the retort took advantage of that current belief so as to throw back the sarcasm by proclaiming that neither horse nor rider had a price placarded in the market at which any man could become their purchaser but this was not the temper in which coleridge either did reply or could have replied coleridge showed in the spirit of his manner a profound sensibility to the nature of a gentleman and he felt too justly what it became a selfrespecting person to say ever to have aped the sort of flashy fencing which might seem fine to a theatrical blood another story is selfrefuted a hired partisan had come to one of coleridges political lectures with the express purpose of bringing the lecturer into trouble and most preposterously he laid himself open to his own snare by refusing to pay for admission spies must be poor artists who proceed thus upon which coleridge remarked that before the gentleman kicked up a dust surely he would down with the dust so far the story will not do but what follows is possible enough the same hired gentleman by way of giving unity to the tale is described as having hissed upon this a cry arose of turn him out but coleridge interfered to protect him he insisted on the mans right to hiss if he thought fit it was legal to hiss it was natural to hiss for what is to be expected gentlemen when the cool waters of reason come in contact with redhot aristocracy but a hiss euge amongst all the anecdotes however of this splendid man often trivial often incoherent often unauthenticated there is one which strikes us as both true and interesting and we are grateful to mr gillman for preserving it we find it introduced and partially authenticated by the following sentence from coleridge himself from eight to fourteen i was a playless daydreamer a helluo librorum my appetite for which was indulged by a singular incident a stranger who was struck by my conversation made me free of a circulating library in kings street cheapside the more circumstantial explanation of mr gillman is this the incident indeed was singular going down the strand in one of his daydreams fancying himself swimming across the hellespont thrusting his hands before him as in the act of swimming his hand came in contact with a gentlemans pocket the gentleman seized his hand turning round and looking at him with some anger what so young and yet so wicked at the same time accused him of an attempt to pick his pocket the frightened boy sobbed out his denial of the intention and explained to him how he thought himself leander swimming across the hellespont the gentleman was so struck and delighted with the novelty of the thing and with the simplicity and intelligence of the boy that he subscribed as before stated to the library in consequence of which coleridge was further enabled to indulge his love of reading we fear that this slovenly narrative is the very perfection of bad storytelling but the story itself is striking and by the very oddness of the incidents not likely to have been invented the effect from the position of the two parties on the one side a simple child from devonshire dreaming in the strand that he was swimming over from sestos to abydos and on the other the experienced man dreaming only of this world its knaves and its thieves but still kind and generous is beautiful and picturesque oh si sic omnia but the most interesting to us of the personalities connected with coleridge are his feuds and his personal dislikes incomprehensible to us is the war of extermination which coleridge made upon the political economists did sir james steuart in speaking of vinedressers not as vinedressers but generally as cultivators tell his readers that if such a man simply replaced his own consumption having no surplus whatever or increment for the public capital he could not be considered a useful citizen not the beast in the revelation is held up by coleridge as more hateful to the spirit of truth than the jacobite baronet and yet we know of an author viz one s t coleridge who repeated that same doctrine without finding any evil in it look at the first part of the wallenstein where count isolani having said pooh we are all his subjects i e soldiers though unproductive laborers not less than productive peasants the emperors envoy replies yet with a difference general and the difference implies sir jamess scale his vinedresser being the equatorial case between the two extremes of the envoy malthus again in his populationbook contends for a mathematic difference between animal and vegetable life in respect to the law of increase as though the first increased by geometrical ratios the last by arithmetical no proposition more worthy of laughter since both when permitted to expand increase by geometrical ratios and the latter by much higher ratios whereas malthus persuaded himself of his crotchet simply by refusing the requisite condition in the vegetable case and granting it in the other if you take a few grains of wheat and are required to plant all successive generations of their produce in the same flowerpot for ever of course you neutralize its expansion by your own act of arbitrary limitation footnote malthus would have rejoined by saying that the flowerpot limitation was the actual limitation of nature in our present circumstances in america it is otherwise he would say but england is the very flowerpot you suppose she is a flowerpot which cannot be multiplied and cannot even be enlarged very well so be it which we say in order to waive irrelevant disputes but then the true inference will be not that vegetable increase proceeds under a different law from that which governs animal increase but that through an accident of position the experiment cannot be tried in england surely the levers of archimedes with submission to sir edward b lytton were not the less levers because he wanted the locum standi it is proper by the way that we should inform the reader of this generation where to look for coleridges skirmishings with malthus they are to be found chiefly in the late mr william hazlitts work on that subject a work which coleridge so far claimed as to assert that it had been substantially made up from his own conversation but so you would do if you tried the case of animal increase by still exterminating all but one replacing couple of parents this is not to try but merely a pretence of trying one order of powers against another that was folly but coleridge combated this idea in a manner so obscure that nobody understood it and leaving these speculative conundrums in coming to the great practical interests afloat in the poor laws coleridge did so little real work that he left as a res integra to dr alison the capital argument that legal and adequate provision for the poor whether impotent poor or poor accidentally out of work does not extend pauperism no but is the one great resource for putting it down dr alisons overwhelming and experimental manifestations of that truth have prostrated malthus and his generation for ever this comes of not attending to the latin maxim hoc age mind the object before you dr alison a wise man hoc egit coleridge aliud egit and we see the result in a case which suited him by interesting his peculiar feeling coleridge could command attention full ten times as much as there needs but search documents value evidence or thresh out bushels of statistical tables coleridge could not any more than he could ride with elliots dragoons another instance of coleridges inaptitude for such studies as political economy is found in his fancy by no means rich and rare but meagre and trite that taxes can never injure public prosperity by mere excess of quantity if they injure we are to conclude that it must be by their quality and mode of operation or by their false appropriation as for instance if they are sent out of the country and spent abroad because says coleridge if the taxes are exhaled from the country as vapors back they come in drenching showers twenty pounds ascend in a scotch mist to the chancellor of the exchequer from leeds but does it evaporate not at all by return of post down comes an order for twenty pounds worth of leeds cloth on account of government seeing that the poor men of the th regiment want new gaiters true but of this return twenty pounds not more than four will be profit ie surplus accruing to the public capital whereas of the original twenty pounds every shilling was surplus the same unsound fancy has been many times brought forward often in england often in france but it is curious that its first appearance upon any stage was precisely two centuries ago when as yet political economy slept with the preadamites viz in the long parliament in a quarto volume of the debates during printed as an independent work will be found the same identical doctrine supported very sonorously by the same little love of an illustration from the seesaw of mist and rain political economy was not coleridges forte in politics he was happier in mere personal politics he like every man when reviewed from a station distant by forty years will often appear to have erred nay he will be detected and nailed in error but this is the necessity of us all keen are the refutations of time and absolute results to posterity are the fatal touchstone of opinions in the past it is undeniable besides that coleridge had strong personal antipathies for instance to messrs pitt and dundas yet why we never could understand we once heard him tell a story upon windermere to the late mr curwen then m p for workington which was meant apparently to account for this feeling the story amounted to this that when a freshman at cambridge mr pitt had wantonly amused himself at a dinner party in trinity in smashing with filberts discharged in showers like grapeshot a most costly dessert set of cut glass from which samuel taylor coleridge argued a principle of destructiveness in his cerebellum now if this dessert set belonged to some poor suffering trinitarian and not to himself we are of opinion that he was faulty and ought upon his own great subsequent maxim to have been coerced into indemnity for the past and security for the future but besides that this glassy mythus belongs to an ra fifteen years earlier than coleridges so as to justify a shadow of scepticism we really cannot find in such an escapade under the boiling blood of youth any sufficient justification of that withering malignity towards the name of pitt which runs through coleridges famous fire famine and slaughter as this little viperous jeudesprit published anonymously subsequently became the subject of a celebrated afterdinner discussion in london at which coleridge comme de raison was the chief speaker the reader of this generation may wish to know the question at issue and in order to judge of that he must know the outline of this devils squib the writer brings upon the scene three pleasant young ladies viz miss fire miss famine and miss slaughter what are you up to whats the row we may suppose to be the introductory question of the poet and the answer of the ladies makes us aware that they are fresh from larking in ireland and in france a glorious spree they had lots of fun and laughter a discretion at all times gratus puell risus ab angulo so that we listen to their little gossip with interest they had been setting men it seems by the ears and the drollest little atrocities they do certainly report not but we have seen better in the nenagh paper so far as ireland is concerned but the pet little joke was in la vendee miss famine who is the girl for our money raises the question whether any of them can tell the name of the leader and prompter to these high jinks of hell if so let her whisper it whisper it sister so and so in a dark hint distinct and low upon which the playful miss slaughter replies letters four do form his name he came by stealth and unlockd my den and i have drunk the blood since then of thrice three hundred thousand men good but the sting of the hornet lies in the conclusion if this quadriliteral man had done so much for them though really we think s d might have settled his claim what says fire setting her arms akimbo would they do for him slaughter replies rather crustily that as far as a good kicking would go or says famine a little matter of tearing to pieces by the mob they would be glad to take tickets at his benefit how you bitches says fire is that all i alone am faithful i cling to him everlastingly the sentiment is diabolical and the question argued at the london dinnertable was could the writer have been other than a devil the dinner was at the late excellent mr sothebys known advantageously in those days as the translator of wielands oberon several of the great guns amongst the literary body were present in particular sir walter scott and he we believe with his usual goodnature took the apologetic side of the dispute in fact he was in the secret nobody else barring the author knew at first whose good name was at stake the scene must have been high the company kicked about the poor diabolic writers head as if it had been a tennisball coleridge the yet unknown criminal absolutely perspired and fumed in pleading for the defendant the company demurred the orator grew urgent wits began to smoke the case as active verbs the advocate to smoke as a neuter verb the fun grew fast and furious until at length delinquent arose burning tears in his eyes and confessed to an audience now bursting with stifled laughter but whom he supposed to be bursting with fiery indignation lo i am he that wrote it for our own parts we side with coleridge malice is not always of the heart there is a malice of the understanding and the fancy neither do we think the worse of a man for having invented the most horrible and oldwomantroubling curse that demons ever listened to we are too apt to swear horribly ourselves and often have we frightened the cat to say nothing of the kettle by our shocking far too shocking oaths there were other celebrated men whom coleridge detested or seemed to detest paley sir sidney smith lord hutchinson the last lord donoughmore and cuvier to paley it might seem as if his antipathy had been purely philosophic but we believe that partly it was personal and it tallies with this belief that in his earliest political tracts coleridge charged the archdeacon repeatedly with his own joke as if it had been a serious saying viz that he could not afford to keep a conscience such luxuries like a carriage for instance being obviously beyond the finances of poor men with respect to the philosophic question between the parties as to the grounds of moral election we hope it is no treason to suggest that both were perhaps in error against paley it occurs at once that he himself would not have made consequences the practical test in valuing the morality of an act since these can very seldom be traced at all up to the final stages and in the earliest stages are exceedingly different under different circumstances so that the same act tried by its consequences would bear a fluctuating appreciation this could not have been paleys revised meaning consequently had he been pressed by opposition it would have come out that by test he meant only speculative test a very harmless doctrine certainly but useless and impertinent to any purpose of his system the reader may catch our meaning in the following illustration it is a matter of general belief that happiness upon the whole follows in a higher degree from constant integrity than from the closest attention to selfinterest now happiness is one of those consequences which paley meant by final or remotest but we could never use this idea as an exponent of integrity or interchangeable criterion because happiness cannot be ascertained or appreciated except upon long tracts of time whereas the particular act of integrity depends continually upon the election of the moment no man therefore could venture to lay down as a rule do what makes you happy use this as your test of actions satisfied that in that case always you will do the thing which is right for he cannot discern independently what will make him happy and he must decide on the spot the use of the nexus between morality and happiness must therefore be inverted it is not practical or prospective but simply retrospective and in that form it says no more than the good old rules hallowed in every cottage but this furnishes no practical guide for moral election which a man had not before he ever thought of this nexus in the sense in which it is true we need not go to the professors chair for this maxim in the sense in which it would serve paley it is absolutely false on the other hand as against coleridge it is certain that many acts could be mentioned which are judged to be good or bad only because their consequences are known to be so whilst the great catholic acts of life are entirely and if we may so phrase it haughtily independent of consequences for instance fidelity to a trust is a law of immutable morality subject to no casuistry whatever you have been left executor to a friend you are to pay over his last legacy to x though a dissolute scoundrel and you are to give no shilling of it to the poor brother of x though a good man and a wise man struggling with adversity you are absolutely excluded from all contemplation of results it was your deceased friends right to make the will it is yours simply to see it executed now in opposition to this primary class of actions stands another such as the habit of intoxication which are known to be wrong only by observing the consequences if drunkenness did not terminate after some years in producing bodily weakness irritability in the temper and so forth it would not be a vicious act and accordingly if a transcendent motive should arise in favor of drunkenness as that it would enable you to face a degree of cold or contagion else menacing to life a duty would arise pro hac vice of getting drunk we had an amiable friend who suffered under the infirmity of cowardice an awful coward he was when sober but when very drunk he had courage enough for the seven champions of christendom therefore in an emergency where he knew himself suddenly loaded with the responsibility of defending a family we approved highly of his getting drunk but to violate a trust could never become right under any change of circumstances coleridge however altogether overlooked this distinction which on the other hand stirring in paleys mind but never brought out to distinct consciousness nor ever investigated nor limited has undermined his system perhaps it is not very important how a man theorizes upon morality happily for us all god has left no man in such questions practically to the guidance of his understanding but still considering that academic bodies are partly instituted for the support of speculative truth as well as truth practical we must think it a blot upon the splendor of oxford and cambridge that both of them in a christian land make paley the foundation of their ethics the alternative being aristotle and in our mind though far inferior as a moralist to the stoics aristotle is often less of a pagan than paley coleridges dislike to sir sidney smith and the egyptian lord hutchinson fell under the category of martials case non amo te sabidi nec possum dicere quare hoc solum novi non amo te sabidi against lord hutchinson we never heard him plead anything of moment except that he was finically frenchified in his diction of which he gave this instance that having occasion to notice a brick wall which was literally that not more and not less when reconnoitring the french defences he called it a revtement and we ourselves remember his using the french word gloriole rather ostentatiously that is when no particular emphasis attached to the case but every man has his foibles and few perhaps are less conspicuously annoying than this of lord hutchinsons sir sidneys crimes were less distinctly revealed to our mind as to cuvier coleridges hatred of him was more to our taste for though quite unreasonable we fear it took the shape of patriotism he insisted on it that our british john hunter was the genuine article and that cuvier was a humbug now speaking privately to the public we cannot go quite so far as that but when publicly we address that most respectable character en grand costume we always mean to back coleridge for we are a horrible john bull ourselves as joseph hume observes it makes no difference to us right or wrong black or white when our countrymen are concerned and john hunter notwithstanding he had a bee in his bonnet footnote vide in particular for the most exquisite specimen of pigheadedness that the world can furnish his perverse evidence on the once famous case at the warwick assizes of captain donelan for poisoning his brotherinlaw sir theodosius boughton was really a great man though it will not follow that cuvier must therefore have been a little one we do not pretend to be acquainted with the tenth part of cuviers performances but we suspect that coleridges range in that respect was not much greater than our own other cases of monomaniac antipathy we might revive from our recollections of coleridge had we a sufficient motive but in compensation and by way of redressing the balance he had many strange likings equally monomaniac and unaccountably he chose to exhibit his whimsical partialities by dressing up as it were in his own clothes such a set of scarecrows as eye has not beheld heavens what an ark of unclean beasts would have been coleridges private menagerie of departed philosophers could they all have been trotted out in succession but did the reader feel them to be the awful bores which in fact they were no because coleridge had blown upon these withered anatomies through the blowpipe of his own creative genius a stream of gas that swelled the tissue of their antediluvian wrinkles forced color upon their cheeks and splendor upon their sodden eyes such a process of ventriloquism never has existed he spoke by their organs they were the tubes and he forced through their wooden machinery his own beethoven harmonies first came dr andrew bell we knew him was he dull is a wooden spoon dull fishy were his eyes torpedinous was his manner and his main idea out of two which he really had related to the moon from which you infer perhaps that he was lunatic by no means it was no craze under the influence of the moon which possessed him it was an idea of mere hostility to the moon the madras people like many others had an idea that she influenced the weather subsequently the herschels senior and junior systematized this idea and then the wrath of andrew previously in a crescent state actually dilated to a plenilunar orb the westmoreland people for at the lakes it was we knew him expounded his condition to us by saying that he was maffled which word means perplexed in the extreme his wrath did not pass into lunacy it produced simple distraction an uneasy fumbling with the idea like that of an old superannuated dog who longs to worry but cannot for want of teeth in this condition you will judge that he was rather tedious and in this condition coleridge took him up andrews other idea because he had two related to education perhaps sixsevenths of that also came from madras no matter coleridge took that up southey also but southey with his usual temperate fervor coleridge on the other hand found celestial marvels both in the scheme and in the man then commenced the apotheosis of andrew bell and because it happened that his opponent lancaster between ourselves really had stolen his ideas from bell what between the sad wickedness of lancaster and the celestial transfiguration of bell gradually coleridge heated himself to such an extent that people when referring to that subject asked each other have you heard coleridge lecture on bel and the dragon the next man glorified by coleridge was john woolman the quaker him though we once possessed his works it cannot be truly affirmed that we ever read try to read john we often did but read john we did not this however you say might be our fault and not johns very likely and we have a notion that now with our wiser thoughts we should read john if he were here on this table it is certain that he was a good man and one of the earliest in america if not in christendom who lifted up his hand to protest against the slavetrade but still we suspect that had john been all that coleridge represented he would not have repelled us from reading his travels in the fearful way that he did but again we beg pardon and entreat the earth of virginia to lie light upon the remains of john woolman for he was an israelite indeed in whom there was no guile the third person raised to divine honors by coleridge was bowyer the master of christs hospital london a man whose name rises into the nostrils of all who knew him with the gracious odor of a tallow chandlers meltinghouse upon melting day and whose memory is embalmed in the hearty detestation of all his pupils coleridge describes this man as a profound critic our idea of him is different we are of opinion that bowyer was the greatest villain of the eighteenth century we may be wrong but we cannot be far wrong talk of knouting indeed which we did at the beginning of this paper in the mere playfulness of our hearts and which the great master of the knout christopher who visited mens trespasses like the eumenides never resorted to but in love for some great idea which had been outraged why this man knouted his way through life from bloody youth up to truculent old age grim idol whose altars reeked with childrens blood and whose dreadful eyes never smiled except as the stern goddess of the thugs smiles when the sound of human lamentations inhabits her ears so much had the monster fed upon this great idea of flogging and transmuted it into the very nutriment of his heart that he seems to have conceived the gigantic project of flogging all mankind nay worse for mr gillman on coleridges authority tells us p the following anecdote sirrah ill flog you were words so familiar to him that on one occasion some female friend of one of the boys who had come on an errand of intercession still lingering at the door after having been abruptly told to go bowyer exclaimed bring that woman here and ill flog her to this horrid incarnation of whips and scourges coleridge in his biographia literaria ascribes ideas upon criticism and taste which every man will recognise as the intense peculiarities of coleridge could these notions really have belonged to bowyer then how do we know but he wrote the ancient mariner yet on consideration no for even coleridge admitted that spite of his fine theorizing upon composition mr bowyer did not prosper in the practice of which he gave us this illustration and as it is supposed to be the only specimen of the bowyeriana which now survives in this sublunary world we are glad to extend its glory it is the most curious example extant of the melodious in sound twas thou that smoothdst the roughruggd bed of pain smoothdst would the teeth of a crocodile not splinter under that word it seems to us as if mr bowyers verses ought to be boiled before they can be read and when he says twas thou what is the wretch talking to can he be apostrophizing the knout we very much fear it if so then you see reader that even when incapacitated by illness from operating he still adores the image of his holy scourge and invokes it as alone able to smooth his roughruggd bed oh thou infernal bowyer upon whom even trollope history of christs hospital charges a discipline tinctured with more than due severity can there be any partners found for thee in a quadrille except draco the bloody lawgiver bishop bonner and mrs brownrigg the next pet was sir alexander ball concerning bowyer coleridge did not talk much but chiefly wrote concerning bell he did not write much but chiefly talked concerning ball however he both wrote and talked it was in vain to muse upon any plan for having ball blackballed or for rebelling against bell think of a man who had fallen into one pit called bell secondly falling into another pit called ball this was too much we were obliged to quote poetry against them letters four do form his name he came by stealth and unlockd my den and the nightmare i have felt since then of thrice three hundred thousand men not that we insinuate any disrespect to sir alexander ball he was about the foremost we believe in all good qualities amongst nelsons admirable captains at the nile he commanded a seventyfour most effectually in that battle he governed malta as well as sancho governed barataria and he was a true practical philosopher as indeed was sancho but still by all that we could ever learn sir alexander had no taste for the abstract upon any subject and would have read as mere delirious wanderings those philosophic opinions which coleridge fastened like wings upon his respectable but astounded shoulders we really beg pardon for having laughed a little at these crazes of coleridge but laugh we did of mere necessity in those days at bell and ball whenever we did not groan and as the same precise alternative offered itself now viz that in recalling the case we must reverberate either the groaning or the laughter we presumed the reader would vote for the last coleridge we are well convinced owed all these wandering and exaggerated estimates of men these diseased impulses that like the mirage showed lakes and fountains where in reality there were only arid deserts to the derangements worked by opium but now for the sake of change let us pass to another topic suppose we say a word or two on coleridges accomplishments as a scholar we are not going to enter on so large a field as that of his scholarship in connection with his philosophic labors scholarship in the result not this but scholarship in the means and machinery range of verbal scholarship is what we propose for a moments review for instance what sort of a german scholar was coleridge we dare say that because in his version of the wallenstein there are some inaccuracies those who may have noticed them will hold him cheap in this particular pretension but to a certain degree they will be wrong coleridge was not very accurate in anything but in the use of logic all his philological attainments were imperfect he did not talk german or so obscurely and if he attempted to speak fast so erroneously that in his second sentence when conversing with a german lady of rank he contrived to assure her that in his humble opinion she was a hard it is to fill up the hiatus decorously but in fact the word very coarsely expressed that she was no better than she should be which reminds us of a parallel misadventure to a german whose colloquial english had been equally neglected having obtained an interview with an english lady he opened his business whatever it might be thus highborn madam since your husband have kicked de bucketsir interrupted the lady astonished and displeased oh pardon nine ten thousand pardon now i make new beginning quite oder beginning madam since your husband have cut his stickit may be supposed that this did not mend matters and reading that in the ladys countenance the german drew out an octavo dictionary and said perspiring with shame at having a second time missed fire madam since your husband have gone to kingdom come this he said beseechingly but the lady was past propitiation by this time and rapidly moved towards the door things had now reached a crisis and if something were not done quickly the game was up now therefore taking a last hurried look at his dictionary the german flew after the lady crying out in a voice of despair madam since your husband your most respected husband have hopped de twigthis was his sheetanchor and as this also came home of course the poor man was totally wrecked it turned out that the dictionary he had used arnolds we think a work of a hundred years back and from mere ignorance giving slang translations from tom brown lestrange and other jocular writers had put down the verb sterben to die with the following worshipful series of equivalents to kick the bucket to cut ones stick to go to kingdom come to hop the twig but though coleridge did not pretend to any fluent command of conversational german he read it with great ease his knowledge of german literature was indeed too much limited by his rare opportunities for commanding anything like a wellmounted library and particularly it surprised us that coleridge knew little or nothing of john paul richter but his acquaintance with the german philosophic masters was extensive and his valuation of many individual german words or phrases was delicate and sometimes profound as a grecian coleridge must be estimated with a reference to the state and standard of greek literature at that time and in this country porson had not yet raised our ideal the earliest laurels of coleridge were gathered however in that field yet no man will at this day pretend that the greek of his prize ode is sufferable neither did coleridge ever become an accurate grecian in later times when better models of scholarship and better aids to scholarship had begun to multiply but still we must assert this point of superiority for coleridge that whilst he never was what may be called a wellmounted scholar in any department of verbal scholarship he yet displayed sometimes a brilliancy of conjectural sagacity and a felicity of philosophic investigation even in this path such as better scholars do not often attain and of a kind which cannot be learned from books but as respects his accuracy again we must recall to the reader the state of greek literature in england during coleridges youth and in all equity as a means of placing coleridge in the balances specifically we must recall the state of greek metrical composition at that period to measure the condition of greek literature even in cambridge about the initial period of coleridge we need only look back to the several translations of grays elegy by three if not four of the reverend gentlemen at that time attached to eton college mathias no very great scholar himself in this particular field made himself merry in his pursuits of literature with these eton translations in that he was right but he was not right in praising a contemporary translation by cook who we believe was the immediate predecessor of porson in the greek chair as a specimen of this translation footnote it was printed at the end of aristotles poetics which dr cook edited we cite one stanza and we cannot be supposed to select unfairly because it is the stanza which mathias praises in extravagant terms here says he gray cook and nature do seem to contend for the mastery the english quatrain must be familiar to every body the boast of heraldry the pomp of powr and all that beauty all that wealth eer gave await alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave and the following we believe though quoting from a thirtythree years recollection of it is the exact greek version of cook a charis eugenon charis a basilaeidos achas lora tuchaes chryseaes aphroditaes kala ta dora paith ama tauta tethiake kai eiden morsimon amar proon kle olole kai ocheto xunon es adaen now really these verses by force of a little mosaic tesselation from genuine greek sources pass fluently over the tongue but can they be considered other than a cento swarms of english schoolboys at this day would not feel very proud to adopt them in fact we remember at a period say twelve years later than this some iambic verses which were really composed by a boy viz a son of dr prettyman afterwards tomline bishop of winchester and in earlier times private tutor to mr pitt they were published by middleton first bishop of calcutta in the preface to his work on the greek article and for racy idiomatic greek selforiginated and not a mere mocking birds iteration of alien notes are so much superior to all the attempts of these sexagenarian doctors as distinctly to mark the growth of a new era and a new generation in this difficult accomplishment within the first decennium of this century it is singular that only one blemish is suggested by any of the contemporary critics in dr cooks verses viz in the word xunon for which this critic proposes to substitute ooinon to prevent as he observes the last syllable of ocheto from being lengthened by the x such considerations as these are necessary to the trutin castigatio before we can value coleridges place on the scale of his own day which day quoad hoc be it remembered was as to french coleridge read it with too little freedom to find pleasure in french literature accordingly we never recollect his referring for any purpose either of argument or illustration to a french classic latin from his regular scholastic training naturally he read with a scholars fluency and indeed he read constantly in authors such as petrarch erasmus calvin c whom he could not then have found in translations but coleridge had not cultivated an acquaintance with the delicacies of classic latinity and it is remarkable that wordsworth educated most negligently at hawkshead school subsequently by reading the lyric poetry of horace simply for his own delight as a student of composition made himself a master of latinity in its most difficult form whilst coleridge trained regularly in a great southern school never carried his latin to any classical polish there is another accomplishment of coleridges less broadly open to the judgment of this generation and not at all of the next viz his splendid art of conversation on which it will be interesting to say a word ten years ago when the music of this rare performance had not yet ceased to vibrate in mens ears what a sensation was gathering amongst the educated classes on this particular subject what a tumult of anxiety prevailed to hear mr coleridge or even to talk with a man who had heard him had he lived till this day not paganini would have been so much sought after that sensation is now decaying because a new generation has emerged during the ten years since his death but many still remain whose sympathy whether of curiosity in those who did not know him or of admiration in those who did still reflects as in a mirror the great stir upon this subject which then was moving in the world to these if they should inquire for the great distinguishing principle of coleridges conversation we might say that it was the power of vast combination in linked sweetness long drawn out he gathered into focal concentration the largest body of objects apparently disconnected that any man ever yet by any magic could assemble or having assembled could manage his great fault was that by not opening sufficient spaces for reply or suggestion or collateral notice he not only narrowed his own field but he grievously injured the final impression for when mens minds are purely passive when they are not allowed to react then it is that they collapse most and that their sense of what is said must ever be feeblest doubtless there must have been great conversational masters elsewhere and at many periods but in this lay coleridges characteristic advantage that he was a great natural power and also a great artist he was a power in the art and he carried a new art into the power but now finally having left ourselves little room for more one or two words on coleridge as an opiumeater we have not often read a sentence falling from a wise man with astonishment so profound as that particular one in a letter of coleridges to mr gillman which speaks of the effort to wean ones self from opium as a trivial task there are we believe several such passages but we refer to that one in particular which assumes that a single week will suffice for the whole process of so mighty a revolution is indeed leviathan so tamed in that case the quarantine of the opiumeater might be finished within coleridges time and with coleridges romantic ease but mark the contradictions of this extraordinary man not long ago we were domesticated with a venerable rustic strongheaded but incurably obstinate in his prejudices who treated the whole body of medical men as ignorant pretenders knowing absolutely nothing of the system which they professed to superintend this you will remark is no very singular case no nor as we believe is the antagonist case of ascribing to such men magical powers nor what is worse still the coexistence of both cases in the same mind as in fact happened here for this same obstinate friend of ours who treated all medical pretensions as the mere jest of the universe every third day was exacting from his own medical attendants some exquisite tourdeforce as that they should know or should do something which if they had known or done all men would have suspected them reasonably of magic he rated the whole medical body as infants and yet what he exacted from them every third day as a matter of course virtually presumed them to be the only giants within the whole range of science parallel and equal is the contradiction of coleridge he speaks of opium excess his own excess we mean the excess of twentyfive years as a thing to be laid aside easily and for ever within seven days and yet on the other hand he describes it pathetically sometimes with a frantic pathos as the scourge the curse the one almighty blight which had desolated his life this shocking contradiction we need not press all readers will see that but some will ask was mr coleridge right in either view being so atrociously wrong in the first notion viz that the opium of twentyfive years was a thing easily to be forsworn where a child could know that he was wrong was he even altogether right secondly in believing that his own life root and branch had been withered by opium for it will not follow because with a relation to happiness and tranquillity a man may have found opium his curse that therefore as a creature of energies and great purposes he must have been the wreck which he seems to suppose opium gives and takes away it defeats the steady habit of exertion but it creates spasms of irregular exertion it ruins the natural power of life but it develops preternatural paroxysms of intermitting power let us ask of any man who holds that not coleridge himself but the world as interested in coleridges usefulness has suffered by his addiction to opium whether he is aware of the way in which opium affected coleridge and secondly whether he is aware of the actual contributions to literature how large they were which coleridge made in spite of opium all who were intimate with coleridge must remember the fits of genial animation which were created continually in his manner and in his buoyancy of thought by a recent or by an extra dose of the omnipotent drug a lady who knew nothing experimentally of opium once told us that she could tell when mr coleridge had taken too much opium by his shining countenance she was right we know that mark of opium excesses well and the cause of it or at least we believe the cause to lie in the quickening of the insensible perspiration which accumulates and glistens on the face be that as it may a criterion it was that could not deceive us as to the condition of coleridge and uniformly in that condition he made his most effective intellectual displays it is true that he might not be happy under this fiery animation and we fully believe that he was not nobody is happy under laudanum except for a very short term of years but in what way did that operate upon his exertions as a writer we are of opinion that it killed coleridge as a poet the harp of quantock was silenced for ever by the torment of opium but proportionably it roused and stung by misery his metaphysical instincts into more spasmodic life poetry can flourish only in the atmosphere of happiness but subtle and perplexed investigations of difficult problems are amongst the commonest resources for beguiling the sense of misery and for this we have the direct authority of coleridge himself speculating on his own case in the beautiful though unequal ode entitled dejection stanza six occurs the following passage for not to think of what i needs must feel but to be still and patient all i can and haply by abstruse research to steal from my own nature all the natural man this was my sole resource my only plan till that which suits a part infects the whole and now is almost grown the habit of my soul considering the exquisite quality of some poems which coleridge has composed nobody can grieve or has grieved more than ourselves at seeing so beautiful a fountain choked up with weeds but had coleridge been a happier man it is our fixed belief that we should have had far less of his philosophy and perhaps but not certainly might have had more of his general literature in the estimate of the public doubtless that will seem a bad exchange every man to his taste meantime what we wish to show is that the loss was not absolute but merely relative it is urged however that even on his philosophic speculations opium operated unfavorably in one respect by often causing him to leave them unfinished this is true whenever coleridge being highly charged or saturated with opium had written with distempered vigor upon any question there occurred soon after a recoil of intense disgust not from his own paper only but even from the subject all opiumeaters are tainted with the infirmity of leaving works unfinished and suffering reactions of disgust but coleridge taxed himself with that infirmity in verse before he could at all have commenced opiumeating besides it is too much assumed by coleridge and by his biographer that to leave off opium was of course to regain juvenile health but all opiumeaters make the mistake of supposing every pain or irritation which they suffer to be the product of opium whereas a wise man will say suppose you do leave off opium that will not deliver you from the load of years say sixtythree which you carry on your back charles lamb another man of true genius and another head belonging to the blackwood gallery made that mistake in his confessions of a drunkard i looked back says he to the time when always on waking in the morning i had a song rising to my lips at present it seems being a drunkard he has no such song ay dear lamb but note this that the drunkard was fiftysix years old the songster was twentythree take twentythree from fiftysix and we have some reason to believe that thirtythree will remain which period of thirtythree years is a pretty good reason for not singing in the morning even if brandy has been out of the question it is singular as respects coleridge that mr gillman never says one word upon the event of the great highgate experiment for leaving off laudanum though coleridge came to mr gillmans for no other purpose and in a week this vast creation of new earth sea and all that in them is was to have been accomplished we rayther think as bayley junior observes that the explosion must have hung fire but that is a trifle we have another pleasing hypothesis on the subject mr wordsworth in his exquisite lines written on a flyleaf of his own castle of indolence having described coleridge as a noticeable man with large grey eyes goes on to say he viz coleridge did that other man entice to view his imagery now we are sadly afraid that the noticeable man with large grey eyes did entice that other man viz gillman to commence opiumeating this is droll and it makes us laugh horribly gillman should have reformed him and lo he corrupts gillman s t coleridge visited highgate by way of being converted from the heresy of opium and the issue is that in two months time various grave men amongst whom our friend gillman marches first in great pomp are found to have faces shining and glorious as that of aesculapius a fact of which we have already explained the secret meaning and scandal says but then what will not scandal say that a hogshead of opium goes up daily through highgate tunnel surely one corroboration of our hypothesis may be found in the fact that vol i of gillmans coleridge is for ever to stand unpropped by vol ii for we have already observed that opium eaters though good fellows upon the whole never finish anything what then a man has a right never to finish anything certainly he has and by magna charta but he has no right by magna charta or by parva charta to slander decent men like ourselves and our friend the author of the opium confessions here it is that our complaint arises against mr gillman if he has taken to opiumeating can we help that if his face shines must our faces be blackened he has very improperly published some intemperate passages from coleridges letters which ought to have been considered confidential unless coleridge had left them for publication charging upon the author of the opium confessions a reckless disregard of the temptations which in that work he was scattering abroad amongst men now this author is connected with ourselves and we cannot neglect his defence unless in the case that he undertakes it himself we complain also that coleridge raises and is backed by mr gillman in raising a distinction perfectly perplexing to us between himself and the author of the opium confessions upon the question why they severally began the practice of opiumeating in himself it seems this motive was to relieve pain whereas the confessor was surreptitiously seeking for pleasure ay indeed where did he learn that we have no copy of the confessions here so we cannot quote chapter and verse but we distinctly remember that toothache is recorded in that book as the particular occasion which first introduced the author to the knowledge of opium whether afterwards having been thus initiated by the demon of pain the opium confessor did not apply powers thus discovered to purposes of mere pleasure is a question for himself and the same question applies with the same cogency to coleridge coleridge began in rheumatic pains what then this is no proof that he did not end in voluptuousness for our parts we are slow to believe that ever any man did or could learn the somewhat awful truth that in a certain rubycolored elixir there lurked a divine power to chase away the genius of ennui without subsequently abusing this power to taste but once from the tree of knowledge is fatal to the subsequent power of abstinence true it is that generations have used laudanum as an anodyne for instance hospital patients who have not afterwards courted its powers as a voluptuous stimulant but that be sure has arisen from no abstinence in them there are in fact two classes of temperaments as to this terrific drug those which are and those which are not preconformed to its power those which genially expand to its temptations and those which frostily exclude them not in the energies of the will but in the qualities of the nervous organization lies the dread arbitration of fall or stand doomed thou art to yield or strengthened constitutionally to resist most of those who have but a low sense of the spells lying couchant in opium have practically none at all for the initial fascination is for them effectually defeated by the sickness which nature has associated with the first stages of opiumeating but to that other class whose nervous sensibilities vibrate to their profoundest depths under the first touch of the angelic poison even as a lovers ear thrills on hearing unexpectedly the voice of her whom he loves opium is the amreeta cup of beatitude you know the paradise lost and you remember from the eleventh book in its earlier part that laudanum already existed in eden nay that it was used medicinally by an archangel for after michael had purged with euphrasy and rue the eyes of adam lest he should be unequal to the mere sight of the great visions about to unfold their draperies before him next he fortifies his fleshly spirits against the affliction of these visions of which visions the first was death and how he from the well of life three drops instilld what was their operation so deep the power of these ingredients pierced even to the inmost seat of mental sight that adam now enforced to close his eyes sank down and all his spirits became entranced but him the gentle angel by the hand soon raised the second of these lines it is which betrays the presence of laudanum it is in the faculty of mental vision it is in the increased power of dealing with the shadowy and the dark that the characteristic virtue of opium lies now in the original higher sensibility is found some palliation for the practice of opiumeating in the greater temptation is a greater excuse and in this faculty of selfrevelation is found some palliation for reporting the case to the world which both coleridge and his biographer have overlooked temperance movement the most remarkable instance of a combined movement in society which history perhaps will be summoned to notice is that which in our own days has applied itself to the abatement of intemperance naturally or by any direct process the machinery set in motion would seem irrelevant to the object if one hundred men unite to elevate the standard of temperance they can do this with effect only by improvements in their own separate cases each individual for such an effort of selfconquest can draw upon no resources but his own one member in a combination of one hundred when running a race can hope for no cooperation from his ninetynine associates and yet by a secondary action such combinations are found eminently successful having obtained from every confederate a pledge in some shape or other that he will give them his support thenceforwards they bring the passions of shame and selfesteem to bear upon each members personal perseverance not only they keep alive and continually refresh in his thoughts the general purpose which else might fade but they also point the action of public contempt and of selfcontempt at any defaulter much more potently and with more acknowledged right to do so when they use this influence under a license volunteered and signed and sealed by the mans own hand they first conciliate his countenance through his intellectual perceptions of what is right and next they sustain it through his conscience the strongest of his internal forces and even through the weakest of his human sensibilities that revolution therefore which no combination of men can further by abating the original impulse of temptations they often accomplish happily by maturing the secondary energies of resistance already in their earliest stage these temperance movements had obtained both at home and abroad a national range of grandeur more than ten years ago when m de tocqueville was resident in the united states the principal american society counted two hundred and seventy thousand members and in one single state pennsylvania the annual diminution in the use of spirits had very soon reached half a million of gallons now a machinery must be so far good which accomplishes its end the means are meritorious for so much as they effect even to strengthen a feeble resolution by the aid of other infirmities such as shame or the very servility and cowardice of deference to public opinion becomes prudent and laudable in the service of so great a cause nay sometimes to make public profession of selfdistrust by assuming the coercion of public pledges may become an expression of frank courage or even of noble principle not fearing the shame of confession when it can aid the powers of victorious resistance yet still so far as it is possible every man sighs for a still higher victory over himself a victory not tainted by bribes and won from no impulses but those inspired by his own higher nature and his own mysterious force of will powers that in no man were fully developed this being so it is well that from time to time every man should throw out any hints that have occurred to his experience suggesting such as may be new renewing such as may be old towards the encouragement or the information of persons engaged in so great a struggle my own experience had never travelled in that course which could much instruct me in the miseries from wine or in the resources for struggling with it i had repeatedly been obliged indeed to lay it aside altogether but in this i never found room for more than seven or ten days struggle excesses i had never practised in the use of wine simply the habit of using it and the collateral habits formed by excessive use of opium had produced any difficulty at all in resigning it even on an hours notice from opium i derive my right of offering hints at all upon the subjects of abstinence in other forms but the modes of suffering from the evil and the separate modes of suffering from the effort of selfconquest together with errors of judgment incident to such states of transitional torment are all nearly allied practically analogous as regards the remedies even if characteristically distinguished to the inner consciousness i make no scruple therefore of speaking as from a station of high experience and of most watchful attention which never remitted even under sufferings that were at times absolutely frantic i the first hint is one that has been often offered viz the diminution of the particular liquor used by the introduction into each glass of some inert substance ascertained in bulk and equally increasing in amount from day to day but this plan has often been intercepted by an accident shot or sometimes bullets were the substances nearest at hand an objection arose from too scrupulous a caution of chemistry as to the action upon lead of the vinous acid yet all objection of this kind might be removed at once by using beads in a case where small decrements were wanted and marbles if it were thought advisable to use larger once for all however in cases deeply rooted no advances ought ever to be made but by small stages for the effect which is insensible at first by the tenth twelfth or fifteenth day generally accumulates unendurably under any bolder deductions i must not stop to illustrate this point but certain it is that by an error of this nature at the outset most natural to human impatience under exquisite suffering too generally the trial is abruptly brought to an end through the crisis of a passionate relapse ii another object and one to which the gladiator matched in single duel with intemperance must direct a religious vigilance is the digestibility of his food it must be digestible not only by its original qualities but also by its culinary preparation in this last point we are all of us manichans all of us yield a cordial assent to that manichan proverb which refers the meats and the cooks of this world to two opposite fountains of light and of darkness oromasdes it is or the good principle that sends the food ahrimanes or the evil principle that everywhere sends the cooks man has been repeatedly described or even defined as by differential privilege of his nature a cooking animal brutes it is said have faces man only has a countenance brutes are as well able to eat as man man only is able to cook what he eats such are the romances of selfflattery i on the contrary maintain that six thousand years have not availed in this point to raise our race generally to the level of ingenious savages the natives of the society and the friendly isles or of new zealand and other favored spots had and still have an art of cookery though very limited in its range the french footnote but judge not reader of french skill by the attempts of fourthrate artists and understand me to speak with respect of this skill not as it is the tool of luxury but as it is the handmaid of health have an art and more extensive but we english are about upon a level as regards this science with the ape to whom an instinct whispers that chestnuts may be roasted or with the aboriginal chinese of charles lambs story to whom the experience of many centuries had revealed thus much viz that a dish very much beyond the raw flesh of their ancestors might be had by burning down the family mansion and thus roasting the pigstye rudest of barbarous devices is english cookery and not much in advance of this primitive chinese step a fact which it would not be worth while to lament were it not for the sake of the poor trembling deserter from the banners of intoxication who is thus and by no other cause so often thrown back beneath the yoke which he had abjured past counting are the victims of alcohol that having by vast efforts emancipated themselves for a season are violently forced into relapsing by the nervous irritations of demoniac cookery unhappily for them the horrors of indigestion are relieved for the moment however ultimately strengthened by strong liquors the relief is immediate and cannot fail to be perceived but the aggravation being removed to a distance is not always referred to its proper cause this is the capital rock and stumblingblock in the path of him who is hurrying back to the camps of temperance and many a reader is likely to misapprehend the case through the habit he has acquired of supposing indigestion to lurk chiefly amongst luxurious dishes but on the contrary it is amongst the plainest simplest and commonest dishes that such misery lurks in england let us glance at three articles of diet beyond all comparison of most ordinary occurrence viz potatoes bread and butchers meat the art of preparing potatoes for human use is utterly unknown except in certain provinces of our empire and amongst certain sections of the laboring class in our great cities london edinburgh c the sort of things which you see offered at table under the name and reputation of potatoes are such that if you could suppose the company to be composed of centaurs and lapith or any other quarrelsome people it would become necessary for the police to interfere the potato of cities is a very dangerous missile and if thrown with an accurate aim by an angry hand will fracture any known skull in volume and consistency it is very like a pavingstone only that i should say the pavingstone had the advantage in point of tenderness and upon this horrid basis which youthful ostriches would repent of swallowing the trembling palpitating invalid fresh from the scourging of alcohol is requested to build the superstructure of his dinner the proverb says that three flittings are as bad as a fire and on that model i conceive that three potatoes as they are found at many british dinnertables would be equal in principle of ruin to two glasses of vitriol the same savage ignorance appears and only not so often in the bread of this island myriads of families eat it in that early stage of sponge which bread assumes during the process of baking but less than sixty hours will not fit this dangerous article of human diet to be eaten and those who are acquainted with the works of parmentier or other learned investigators of bread and of the bakers art must be aware that this quality of sponginess though quite equal to the ruin of the digestive organs is but one in a legion of vices to which the article is liable a german of much research wrote a book on the conceivable faults in a pair of shoes which he found to be about six hundred and sixtysix many of them as he observed requiring a very delicate process of study to find out whereas the possible faults in bread which are not less in number require no study at all for the defection they publish themselves through all varieties of misery but the perfection of barbarism as regards our island cookery is reserved for animal food and the two poles of oromasdes and ahrimanes are nowhere so conspicuously exhibited our insular sheep for instance are so far superior to any which the continent produces that the present prussian minister at our court is in the habit of questioning a mans right to talk of mutton as anything beyond a great idea unless he can prove a residence in great britain one sole case he cites of a dinner on the elbe when a particular leg of mutton really struck him as rivalling any which he had known in england the mystery seemed inexplicable but upon inquiry it turned out to be an importation from leith yet this incomparable article to produce which the skill of the feeder must cooperate with the peculiar bounty of nature calls forth the most dangerous refinements of barbarism in its cookery a frenchman requires as the primary qualification of flesh meat that it should be tender we english universally but especially the scots treat that quality with indifference or with bare toleration what we require is that it should be fresh that is recently killed in which state it cannot be digestible except by a crocodile and we present it at table in a transition state of leather demanding the teeth of a tiger to rend it in pieces and the stomach of a tiger to digest it with these habits amongst our countrymen exemplified daily in the articles of widest use it is evident that the sufferer from intemperance has a harder quarantine in this island to support during the effort of restoration than he could have anywhere else in christendom in persia and perhaps there only on this terraqueous planet matters might be even worse for whilst we english neglect the machinery of digestion as a matter entitled to little consideration the people of teheran seem unaware that there is any such machinery so at least one might presume from cases on record and especially from the reckless folly under severe illness from indigestion of the three persian princes who visited this country as stated by their official mehmander mr fraser with us the excess of ignorance upon this subject betrays itself oftenest in that vainglorious answer made by the people who at any time are admonished of the sufferings which they are preparing for themselves by these outrages upon the most delicate of human organs they for their parts know not if they have a stomach they know not what it is that dyspepsy means forgetting that in thus vaunting their strength of stomach they are at the same time proclaiming its coarseness and showing themselves unaware that precisely those whom such coarseness of organization reprieves from immediate and seasonable reaction of suffering are the favorite subjects of that heavier reaction which takes the shape of delirium tremens of palsy and of lunacy it is but a fanciful advantage which they enjoy for whom the immediate impunity avails only to hide the final horrors which are gathering upon them from the gloomy rear better by far that more of immediate discomfort had guaranteed to them less of reversionary anguish it may be safely asserted that few indeed are the suicides amongst us to which the miseries of indigestion have not been a large concurring cause and even where nothing so dreadful as that occurs always these miseries are the chief hinderance of the selfreforming drunkard and the commonest cause of his relapse it is certain also that misanthropic gloom and bad temper besiege that class by preference to whom peculiar coarseness or obtuse sensibility of organization has denied the salutary warnings and early prelibations of punishment which happily for most men besiege the more direct and obvious frailties of the digestive apparatus the whole process and elaborate machinery of digestion are felt to be mean and humiliating when viewed in relation to our mere animal economy but they rise into dignity and assert their own supreme importance when they arc studied from another station viz in relation to the intellect and temper no man dares then to despise them it is then seen that these functions of the human system form the essential basis upon which the strength and health of our higher nature repose and that upon these functions chiefly the general happiness of life is dependent all the rules of prudence or gifts of experience that life can accumulate will never do as much for human comfort and welfare as would be done by a stricter attention and a wiser science directed to the digestive system in this attention lies the key to any perfect restoration for the victim of intemperance and considering the peculiar hostility to the digestive health which exists in the dietetic habits of our own country it may be feared that nowhere upon earth has the reclaimed martyr to intemperance so difficult a combat to sustain nowhere therefore is it so important to direct the attention upon an artificial culture of those resources which naturally and by the established habits of the land are surest to be neglected the sheet anchor for the stormbeaten sufferer who is laboring to recover a haven of rest from the agonies of intemperance and who has had the fortitude to abjure the poison which ruined but which also for brief intervals offered him his only consolation lies beyond all doubt in a most anxious regard to everything connected with this supreme function of our animal economy and as few men that are not regularly trained to medical studies can have the complex knowledge requisite for such a duty some printed guide should be sought of a regular professional order twenty years ago dr wilson philip published a valuable book of this class which united a wide range of practical directions as to the choice of diet and as to the qualities and tendencies of all esculent articles likely to be found at british tables with some ingenious speculations upon the still mysterious theory of digestion these were derived from experiments made upon rabbits and had originally been communicated by him to the royal society of london who judged them worthy of publication in their transactions i notice them chiefly for the sake of remarking that the rationale of digestion as here suggested explains the reason of a fact which merely as a fact had not been known until modern times viz the injuriousness to enfeebled stomachs of all fluid fifty years ago and still lingering inveterately amongst nurses and other ignorant persons there prevailed a notion that slops must be the proper resource of the valetudinarian and the same erroneous notion appears in the common expression of ignorant wonder at the sort of breakfasts usual amongst women of rank in the times of queen elizabeth what robust stomachs they must have had to support such solid meals as to the question of fact whether the stomachs were more or less robust in those days than at the present there is no need to offer an opinion but the question of principle concerned in scientific dietetics points in the very opposite direction by how much the organs of digestion are feebler by so much is it the more indispensable that solid food and animal food should be adopted a robust stomach may be equal to the trying task of supporting a fluid such as tea for breakfast but for a feeble stomach and still more for a stomach enfeebled by bad habits broiled beef or something equally solid and animal but not too much subjected to the action of fire is the only tolerable diet this indeed is the one capital rule for a sufferer from habitual intoxication who must inevitably labor under an impaired digestion that as little as possible he should use of any liquid diet and as little as possible of vegetable diet beef and a little bread at the least sixty hours old compose the privileged bill of fare for his breakfast but precisely it is by the way in relation to this earliest meal that human folly has in one or two instances shown itself most ruinously inventive the less variety there is at that meal the more is the danger from any single luxury and there is one known by the name of muffins which has repeatedly manifested itself to be a plain and direct bounty upon suicide darwin in his zoonomia reports a case where an officer holding the rank of lieutenantcolonel could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article was wanting but as a savage retribution invariably supervened within an hour or two upon this act of insane sensuality he came to a resolution that life was intolerable with muffins but still more intolerable without muffins he would stand the nuisance no longer but yet being a just man he would give nature one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic atrocities muffins therefore being laid at one angle of the breakfasttable and loaded pistols at another with rigid equity the colonel awaited the result this was naturally pretty much as usual and then the poor man incapable of retreating from his word of honor committed suicide having previously left a line for posterity to the effect though i forget the expression that a muffinless world was no world for him better no life at all than a life dismantled of muffins dr darwin was a showy philosopher and fond of producing effect so that some allowance must be made in construing the affair strictly speaking it is probable that not the especial want of muffins but the general torment of indigestion was the curse from which the unhappy sufferer sought relief by suicide and the colonel was not the first by many a million that has fled from the very same form of wretchedness or from its effects upon the genial spirits to the same gloomy refuge it should never be forgotten that although some other more overt vexation is generally assigned as the proximate cause of suicide and often may be so as regards the immediate occasion too generally this vexation borrowed its whole power to annoy from the habitual atmosphere of irritation in which the system had been kept by indigestion so that indirectly and virtually perhaps all suicides may be traced to mismanaged digestion meantime in alluding at all to so dreadful a subject as suicide i do so only by way of giving deeper effect to the opinion expressed above upon the chief cause of relapse into habits of intemperance amongst those who have once accomplished their deliverance errors of digestion either from impaired powers or from powers not so much enfeebled as deranged is the one immeasurable source both of disease and of secret wretchedness to the human race life is laid waste by the eternal fretting of the vital forces emanating from this one cause and it may well be conceived that if cases so endless even of suicide in every generation are virtually traceable to this main root much more must it be able to shake and undermine the yet palpitating frame of the poor fugitive from intemperance since indigestion in every mode and variety of its changes irresistibly upholds the temptation to that form of excitement which though one foremost cause of indigestion is yet unhappily its sole immediate palliation iii next after the most vigorous attention and a scientific attention to the digestive system in power of operation stands exercise here however most people have their own separate habits with respect to the time of exercise the duration and the particular mode on which a stranger cannot venture to intrude with his advice some will not endure the steady patience required for walking exercise many benefit most by riding on horseback and in days when roads were more rugged and the springs of carriages less improved i have known people who found most advantage in the vibrations communicated to the frame by a heavy rumbling carriage for myself under the ravages of opium i have found walking the most beneficial exercise besides that it requires no previous notice or preparation of any kind and this is a capital advantage in a state of drooping energies or of impatient and unresting agitation i may mention as possibly an accident of my individual temperament but possibly also no accident at all that the relief obtained by walking was always most sensibly brought home to my consciousness when some part of it at least a mile and a half has been performed before breakfast in this there soon ceased to be any difficulty for whilst under the full oppression of opium it was impossible for me to rise at any hour that could by the most indulgent courtesy be described as within the pale of morning no sooner had there been established any considerable relief from this oppression than the tendency was in the opposite direction the difficulty became continually greater of sleeping even to a reasonable hour having once accomplished the feat of walking at nine a m i backed in a space of seven or eight months to eight oclock to seven to six five four three until at this point a metaphysical fear fell upon me that i was actually backing into yesterday and should soon have no sleep at all below three however i did not descend and for a couple of years three and a half hours sleep was all that i could obtain in the twentyfour hours from this no particular suffering arose except the nervous impatience of lying in bed for one moment after awaking consequently the habit of walking before breakfast became at length troublesome no longer as a most odious duty but on the contrary as a temptation that could hardly be resisted on the wettest mornings as to the quantity of the exercise i found that six miles a day formed the minimum which would support permanently a particular standard of animal spirits evidenced to myself by certain apparent symptoms i averaged about nine and a half miles a day but ascended on particular days to fifteen or sixteen and more rarely to twentythree or twentyfour a quantity which did not produce fatigue on the contrary it spread a sense of improvement through almost the whole week that followed but usually in the night immediately succeeding to such an exertion i lost much of my sleep a privation that under the circumstances explained deterred me from trying the experiment too often for one or two years i accomplished more than i have here claimed viz from six to seven thousand miles in the twelve months let me add to this slight abstract of my own experience in a point where it is really difficult to offer any useful advice the tastes and habits of men varying so much in this chapter of exercise that one caution seems applicable to the case of all persons suffering from nervous irritability viz that a secluded space should be measured off accurately in some private grounds not liable to the interruption or notice of chance intruders for these annoyances are unendurable to the restless invalid to be questioned upon trivial things is death to him and the perpetual anticipation of such annoyances is little less distressing some plan must also be adopted for registering the number of rounds performed i once walked for eighteen months in a circuit so confined that forty revolutions were needed to complete a mile these i counted at one time by a rosary of beads every tenth round being marked by drawing a blue bead the other nine by drawing white beads but this plan i found in practice more troublesome and inaccurate than that of using ten detached counters stones or anything else that was large enough and solid these were applied to the separate bars of a garden chair the first bar indicating of itself the first decade the second bar the second decade and so on in fact i used the chair in some measure as a roman abacus but on a still simpler plan and as the chair offered sixteen bars it followed that on covering the last bar of the series with the ten markers i perceived without any trouble of calculation the accomplishment of my fourth mile a necessity more painful to me by far than that of taking continued exercise arose out of a cause which applies perhaps with the same intensity only to opium cases but must also apply in some degree to all cases of debilitation from morbid stimulation of the nerves whether by means of wine or opium or distilled liquors in travelling on the outside of mails during my youthful days for i could not endure the inside occasionally during the nighttime i suffered naturally from cold no cloaks c were always sufficient to relieve this and i then made the discovery that opium after an hour or so diffuses a warmth deeper and far more permanent than could be had from any other known source i mention this to explain in some measure the awful passion of cold which for some years haunted the inverse process of laying aside the opium it was a perfect frenzy of misery cold was a sensation which then first as a mode of torment seemed to have been revealed in the months of july and august and not at all the less during the very middle watch of the day i sate in the closest proximity to a blazing fire cloaks blankets counterpanes hearthrugs horsecloths were piled upon my shoulders but with hardly a glimmering of relief at night and after taking coffee i felt a little warmer and could sometimes afford to smile at the resemblance of my own case to that of harry gill footnote harry gill many readers in this generation may not be aware of this ballad as one amongst the early poems of wordsworth thirty or forty years ago it was the object of some insipid ridicule which ought perhaps in another place to be noticed and doubtless this ridicule was heightened by the false impression that the story had been some old womans superstitious fiction meant to illustrate a supernatural judgment on hardheartedness but the story was a physiologic fact and originally it had been brought forward in a philosophic work by darwin who had the reputation of an irreligious man and even of an infidel a bold freethinker he certainly was a deist and by public repute something more but secretly i was struck with awe at the revelation of powers so unsearchably new lurking within old affections so familiarly known as cold upon the analogy of this case it might be thought that nothing whatever had yet been truly and seriously felt by man nothing searched or probed by human sensibilities to a depth below the surface if cold could give out mysteries of suffering so novel all things in the world might be yet unvisited by the truth of human sensations all experience worthy of the name was yet to begin meantime the external phenomenon by which the cold expressed itself was a sense but with little reality of eternal freezing perspiration from this i was never free and at length from finding one general ablution sufficient for one day i was thrown upon the irritating necessity of repeating it more frequently than would seem credible if stated at this time i used always hot water and a thought occurred to me very seriously that it would be best to live constantly and perhaps to sleep in a bath what caused me to renounce this plan was an accident that compelled me for one day to use cold water this first of all communicated any lasting warmth so that ever afterwards i used none but cold water now to live in a cold bath in our climate and in my own state of preternatural sensibility to cold was not an idea to dally with i wish to mention however for the information of other sufferers in the same way one change in the mode of applying the water which led to a considerable and a sudden improvement in the condition of my feelings i had endeavored to procure a childs battledore as an easy means when clothed with sponge of reaching the interspace between the shoulders which interspace by the way is a sort of bokhara so provokingly situated that it will neither suffer itself to be reached from the north in which direction even the czar with his long arms has only singed his own fingers and lost six thousand camels nor at all better from the south upon which line of approach the greatest potentate in southern asia viz no in leadenhall street has found it the best policy to pocket the little khans murderous defiances and persevering insults there is no battledore long enough to reach him in either way in my own difficulty i felt almost as perplexed as the honorable east india company when i found that no battledore was to be had for no town was near at hand in default of a battledore therefore my necessity threw my experiment upon a long hairbrush and this eventually proved of much greater service than any sponge or any battledore for the friction of the brush caused an irritation on the surface of the skin which more than anything else has gradually diminished the once continual misery of unrelenting frost although even yet it renews itself most distressingly at uncertain intervals iv i counsel the patient not to make the mistake of supposing that his amendment will necessarily proceed continuously or by equal increments because this which is a common notion will certainly lead to dangerous disappointments how frequently i have heard people encouraging a selfreformer by such language as this when you have got over the fourth day of abstinence which suppose to be sunday then monday will find you a trifle better tuesday better still though still it should be only by a trifle and so on you may at least rely on never going back you may assure yourself of having seen the worst and the positive improvements if trifles separately must soon gather into a sensible magnitude this may be true in a case of short standing but as a general rule it is perilously delusive on the contrary the line of progress if exhibited in a geometrical construction would describe an ascending path upon the whole but with frequent retrocessions into descending curves which compared with the point of ascent that had been previously gained and so vexatiously interrupted would sometimes seem deeper than the original point of starting this mortifying tendency i can report from experience many times repeated with regard to opium and so unaccountably as regarded all the previous grounds of expectation that i am compelled to suppose it a tendency inherent in the very nature of all selfrestorations for animal systems they move perhaps necessarily per saltum by intermitting spasms and pulsations of unequal energy v i counsel the patient frequently to call back before his thoughts when suffering sorrowful collapses that seem unmerited by anything done or neglected that such and far worse perhaps must have been his experience and with no reversion of hope behind had he persisted in his intemperate indulgencies these also suffer their own collapses and so far as things not copresent can be compared by many degrees more shocking to the genial instincts vi i exhort him to believe that no movement on his own part not the smallest conceivable towards the restoration of his healthy state can by possibility perish nothing in this direction is finally lost but often it disappears and hides itself suddenly however to reappear and in unexpected strength and much more hopefully because such minute elements of improvement by reappearing at a remoter stage show themselves to have combined with other elements of the same kind so that equally by their gathering tendency and their duration through intervals of apparent darkness and below the current of what seemed absolute interruption they argue themselves to be settled in the system there is no good gift that does not come from god almost his greatest is health with the peace which it inherits and man must reap this on the same terms as he was told to reap gods earliest gift the fruits of the earth viz in the sweat of his brow through labor often through sorrow through disappointment but still through imperishable perseverance and hoping under clouds when all hope seems darkened vii it is difficult in selecting from many memoranda of warning and encouragement to know which to prefer when the space disposable is limited but it seems to me important not to omit this particular caution the patient will be naturally anxious as he goes on frequently to test the amount of his advance and its rate if that were possible but this he will see no mode of doing except through tentative balancings of his feelings and generally of the moral atmosphere around him as to pleasure and hope against the corresponding states so far as he can recall them from his periods of intemperance but these comparisons i warn him are fallacious when made in this way the two states are incommensurable on any plan of direct comparison some common measure must be found and out of himself some positive fact that will not bend to his own delusive feeling at the moment as for instance in what degree he finds tolerable what heretofore was not so the effort of writing letters or transacting business or undertaking a journey or overtaking the arrears of labor that had been once thrown off to a distance if in these things he finds himself improved by tests that cannot be disputed he may safely disregard any sceptical whispers from a wayward sensibility which cannot yet perhaps have recovered its normal health however much improved his inner feelings may not yet point steadily to the truth though they may vibrate in that direction besides it is certain that sometimes very manifest advances such as any medical man would perceive at a glance carry a man through stages of agitation and discomfort a far worse condition might happen to be less agitated and so far more bearable now when a man is positively suffering discomfort when he is below the line of pleasurable feeling he is no proper judge of his own condition which he neither will nor can appreciate toothache extorts more groans than dropsy viii another important caution is not to confound with the effects of intemperance any other natural effects of debility from advanced years many a man having begun to be intemperate at thirty enters at sixty or upwards upon a career of selfrestoration and by selfrestoration he understands a renewal of that state in which he was when first swerving from temperance but that state for his memory is coincident with his state of youth the two states are coadunated in his recollections they are intertwisted too closely but life without any intemperance at all would soon have untwisted them charles lamb for instance at fortyfive and coleridge at sixty measured their several conditions by such tests as the loss of all disposition to involuntary murmuring of musical airs or fragments when rising from bed once they had sung when rising in the morning light now they sang no more the vocal utterance of joy for them was silenced for ever but these are amongst the changes that life stern power inflicts at any rate these would have happened and above all to men worn by the unequal irritations of too much thinking and by those modes of care that kill the bloom before its time and blanch without the owners crime the most resplendent hair not at all the less had the one drunk no brandy nor the other any laudanum a man must submit to the conditions of humanity and not quarrel with a cure as incomplete because in his climacteric year of sixtythree he cannot recover entirely the vivacities of thirty five if by dipping seven times in jordan he had cleansed his whole leprosy of intemperance if by going down into bethesda he were able to mount again upon the pinions of his youth even then he might querulously say but after all these marvels in my favor i suppose that one of these fine mornings i like other people shall have to bespeak a coffin why yes undoubtedly he will or somebody for him but privileges so especial were not promised even by the mysterious waters of palestine die he must and counsels tendered to the intemperate do not hope to accomplish what might have been beyond the baths of jordan or bethesda they do enough if being executed by efforts in the spirit of earnest sincerity they make a life of growing misery moderately happy for the patient and through that great change perhaps more than moderately useful for others ix one final remark i will make pointed to the case not of the yet struggling patient but of him who is fully reestablished and the more so because i who am no hypocrite but rather frank to an infirmity acknowledge in myself the trembling tendency at intervals which would if permitted sweep round into currents that might be hard to overrule after the absolute restoration to health a man is very apt to say now then how shall i use my health to what delightful purpose shall i apply it surely it is idle to carry a fine jewel in ones watchpocket and never to astonish the weak minds of this world by wearing it and flashing it in their eyes but how retorts his philosophic friend my good fellow are you not using it at this moment breathing for instance talking to me though rather absurdly and airing your legs at a glowing fire why yes the other confesses that is all true but i am dull and if you will pardon my rudeness even in spite of your too philosophic presence it is painful to say so but sincerely if i had the power at this moment to turn you by magic into a bottle of old port wine so corrupt is my nature that really i fear lest the exchange might for the moment strike me as agreeable such a mood i apprehend is apt to revolve upon many of us at intervals however firmly married to temperance and the propensity to it has a root in certain analogies running through our nature if the reader will permit me for a moment the use of what without such an apology might seem pedantic i would call it the instinct of focalizing which prompts such random desires feeling is diffused over the whole surface of the body but light is focalized in the eye sound in the ear the organization of a sense or a pleasure seems diluted and imperfect unless it is gathered by some machinery into one focus or local centre and thus it is that a general state of pleasurable feeling sometimes seems too superficially diffused and one has a craving to intensify or brighten it by concentration through some sufficient stimulant i for my part have tried every thing in this world except bang which i believe is obtained from hemp there are other preparations of hemp which have been found to give great relief from ennui not ropes but something lately introduced which acts upon the system as the laughing gas nitrous oxide acts at times one farmer in mid lothian was mentioned to me eight months ago as having taken it and ever since annoyed his neighbors by immoderate fits of laughter so that in january it was agreed to present him to the sheriff as a nuisance but for some reason the plan was laid aside and now eight months later i hear that the farmer is laughing more rapturously than ever continues in the happiest frame of mind the kindest of creatures and the general torment of his neighborhood now i confess to having had a lurking interest in this extract of hemp when first i heard of it and at intervals a desire will continue to make itself felt for some deeper compression or centralization of the genial feelings than ordinary life affords but old things will not avail and new things i am now able to resist still as the occasional craving does really arise in most men it is well to notice it and chiefly for the purpose of saying that this dangerous feeling wears off by degrees and oftentimes for long periods it intermits so entirely as to be even displaced by a profound disgust to all modes of artificial stimulation at those times i have remarked that the pleasurable condition of health does not seem weakened by its want of centralization it seems to form a thousand centres this it is well to know because there are many who would resist effectually if they were aware of any natural change going on silently in favor of their own efforts such as would finally ratify the success towards such a result they would gladly contribute by waiting and forbearing whilst under despondency as to this result they might more easily yield to some chance temptation finally there is something to interest us in the time at which this temperance movement has begun to stir let me close with a slight notice of what chiefly impresses myself in the relation between this time and the other circumstances of the case in reviewing history we may see something more than mere convenience in distributing it into three chambers ancient history ending in the space between the western empire falling and mahomet arising modern history from that time to this and a new modern history arising at present or from the french revolution two great races of men our own in a twoheaded form british and american and secondly the russian are those which like rising deluges already reveal their mission to overflow the earth both these races partly through climate or through derivation of blood and partly through the contagion of habits inevitable to brothers of the same nation are tainted carnally with the appetite for brandy for slings for juleps and no fire racing through the forests of nova scotia for three hundred miles in the direction of some doomed city ever moved so fiercely as the infection of habits amongst the dense and fiery populations of republican north america but it is remarkable that the whole ancient system of civilization all the miracles of greece and rome persia and egypt moved by the machinery of races that were not tainted with any such popular marasmus the taste was slightly sowed as an artificial taste amongst luxurious individuals but never ran through the laboring classes through armies through cities the blood and the climate forbade it in this earliest era of history all the great races consequently all the great empires threw themselves by accumulation upon the genial climates of the south having in fact the magnificent lake of the mediterranean for their general centre of evolutions round this lake in a zone of varying depth towered the whole grandeurs of the pagan earth but in such climates man is naturally temperate he is so by physical coercion and for the necessities of rest and coolness the spaniard the moor or the arab has no merit in his temperance the effort for him would be to form the taste for alcohol he has a vast foreground of disgust to traverse before he can reach a taste so remote and alien no need for resistance in his will where nature resists on his behalf sherbet shaddocks grapes these were innocent applications to thirst and the great republic of antiquity said to her legionary sons soldier if you thirst there is the river nile suppose or ebro better drink there cannot be of this you may take at discretion or if you wait till the impedimenta come up you may draw your ration of posca what was posca it was in fact acidulated water three parts of superfine water to one part of the very best vinegar nothing stronger did rome that awful mother allow to her dearest children i e her legions truest of blessings that veiling itself in seeming sternness drove away the wicked phantoms that haunt the couches of yet greater nations the blessings of the evil genii says an eastern proverb these are curses and the stern refusals of wisely loving mothers these are the mightiest of gifts now on the other hand our northern climates have universally the taste latent if not developed for powerful liquors and through their blood as also through the natural tendency of the imitative principle amongst compatriots from these high latitudes the greatest of our modern nations propagate the contagion to their brothers though colonizing warm climates and it is remarkable that our modern preparations of liquors even when harmless in their earliest stages are fitted like steppingstones for making the transition to higher stages that are not harmless the weakest preparations from malt lead by graduated steps to the strongest until we arrive at the intoxicating porter of london which under its local name so insidiously delusive of beer diffuses the most extensive ravages under these marked circumstances of difference between the ruling races of antiquity and of our modern times it now happens that the greatest era by far of human expansion is opening upon us two vast movements are hurrying into action by velocities continually accelerated the great revolutionary movement from political causes concurring with the great physical movement in locomotion and social intercourse from the gigantic though still infant powers of steam no such titan resources for modifying each other were ever before dreamed of by nations and the next hundred years will have changed the face of the world at the opening of such a crisis had no third movement arisen of resistance to intemperate habits there would have been ground for despondency as to the amelioration of the human race but as the case stands the new principle of resistance nationally to bad habits has arisen almost concurrently with the new powers of national intercourse and henceforward by a change equally sudden and unlooked for that new machinery which would else most surely have multiplied the ruins of intoxication has become the strongest agency for hastening its extirpation on war few people need to be told that associations exist up and down christendom having the ambitious object of abolishing war some go so far as to believe that this evil of war so ubiquitous so ancient and apparently so inalienable from mans position upon earth is already doomed that not the private associations only but the prevailing voice of races the most highly civilized may be looked on as tending to confederation against it that sentence of extermination has virtually gone forth and that all which remains is gradually to execute that sentence conscientiously i find myself unable to join in these views the project seems to me the most romantic of all romances in the course of publication consequently when asked to become a member in any such association i have always thought it most respectful because most sincere to decline yet as it is painful to refuse all marks of sympathy with persons whose motives one honors i design at my death to bequeath halfacrown to the chief association for extinguishing war the said halfcrown to be improved in all time coming for the benefit of the association under the trusteeship of europe asia and america but not of africa i really dare not trust africa with money she is not able as yet to take care of herself this halfcrown a fund that will overshadow the earth before it comes to be wanted under the provisions of my will is to be improved at any interest whatever no matter what for the vast period of the accumulations will easily make good any tardiness of advance long before the time comes for its commencing payment a point which will be soon understood from the following explanation by any gentleman that hopes to draw upon it there is in ceylon a granite cippus or monumental pillar of immemorial antiquity and to this pillar a remarkable legend is attached the pillar measures six feet by six i e thirtysix square feet on the flat tablet of its horizontal surface and in height several riyanas which arc ceylonese cubits of eighteen inches each but of these cubits there are either eight or twelve excuse me for having forgotten which at first perhaps you will be angry viz when you hear that this simple difference of four cubits or six feet measures a difference for your expectations whether you count your expectations in kicks or halfpence that absolutely strikes horror into arithmetic the singularity of the case is that the very solemnity of the legend and the wealth of the human race in time depend upon the cubical contents of the monument so that a loss of one granite chip is a loss of a frightful infinity yet again for that very reason the loss of all but a chip leaves behind riches so appallingly too rich that everybody is careless about the four cubits enough is as good as a feast two bottomless abysses take as much time for the diver as ten and five eternities are as frightful to look down as fourandtwenty in the ceylon legend all turns upon the inexhaustible series of ages which this pillar guarantees but as one inexhaustible is quite enough for one race of men and you are sure of more by ineffable excess than you can use in any private consumption of your own you become generous and between friends you say in accepting my apologies for the doubtful error as to the four cubits what signifies an infinity more or less for the ceylonese legend is this that once in every hundred years an angel visits this granite pillar he is dressed in a robe of white muslin muslin of that kind which the romans called aura textilis woven as might seem from zephyrs or from pulses of the air such in its transparency such in its gossamer lightness does the angel touch the pillar with his foot oh no even that would be something but even that is not allowed in his soundless flight across it he suffers the hem of his impalpable robe to sweep the surface as softly as a moonbeam so much and no more of pollution he endures from contact with earthly objects the lowest extremity of his dress but with the delicacy of light grazes the granite surface and that is all the attrition which the sacred granite receives in the course of any one century and this is all the progress which we the poor children of earth in any one century make towards the exhaustion of our earthly imprisonment but argues the subtle legend even that attrition when weighed in metaphysical scales cannot be denied its value it has detached from the pillar an atom no matter that it is an invisible atom of granite dust the ratio of which atom to a grain avoirdupois if expressed as a fraction of unity would by its denominator stretch from the accountantgenerals office in london to the milky way now the total mass of the granite represents on this scheme of payment the total funded debt of mans race to father time and earthly corruption all this intolerable score chalked up to our debit we by ourselves and our representatives have to rub off before the granite will be rubbed away by the muslin robe of the proud flying angel who if he were a good fellow might just as well give a sly kick with his heel to the granite before time will be at an end and the burden of flesh accomplished but you hear it expressed in terms that will astonish baron rothschild what is the progress in liquidation which we make for each particular century a billion of centuries pays off a quantity equal to a pinch of snuff despair seizes a man in contemplating a single coupon no bigger than a visiting card of such a stock as this and behold we have to keep on paying away until the total granite is reduced to a level with a grain of mustardseed but when that is accomplished thank heaven our last generation of descendants will be entitled to leave at master times door a visiting card which the meagre shadow cannot refuse to take though he will sicken at seeing it viz a p p c card upon seeing which the old thief is bound to give receipt in full for all debts and pretended arrears the reader perhaps knows of debts on both sides the atlantic that have no great prospect of being paid off sooner than this in ceylon and naturally to match this order of debts moving off so slowly there are funds that accumulate as slowly my own funded halfcrown is an illustration the halfcrown will travel in the inverse order of the granite pillar the pillar and the halfcrown move upon opposite tacks and there is a point of time which it is for algebra to investigate when they will cross each other in the exact moment of their several bisections my aspiring halfcrown tending gradually towards the fixed stars so that perhaps it might be right to make the man in the moon trustee for that part of the accumulations which rises above the optics of sublunary bankers whilst the ceylon pillar is constantly unweaving its own granite texture and dwindling earthwards it is probable that each of the parties will have reached its consummation about the same time what is to be done with the mustard seed ceylon has forgotten to say but what is to be done with the halfcrown and its surplus nobody can doubt after reading my last will and testament after reciting a few inconsiderable legacies to the three continents and to the man in the moon for any trouble they may have had in managing the hyperbolical accumulations i go on to observe that when war is reported to have taken itself off for ever and no mistake because i foresee many false alarms of a perpetual peace a variety of inconveniences will arise to all branches of the united service including the horse marines clearly there can be no more halfpay and even more clearly there is an end to fullpay pensions are at an end for good service allowances for wounds cannot be thought of when all wounds shall have ceased except those from female eyes for which the horse guards is too little advanced in civilization to make any allowance at all bargains there will be no more amongst auctions of old government stores birmingham will be ruined or so much of it as depended on rifles and the great scotch works on the river carron will be hungering for beef so far as carron depended for beef upon carronades other arrears of evil will stretch after the extinction of war now upon my halfcrown fund which will be equal to anything by the time it is wanted i charge once and for ever the general relief of all these arrears of the poverty the loss the bankruptcy arising by reason of this quietus of final extinction applied to war i charge the fund with a perpetual allowance of halfpay to all the armies of earth or indeed whilst my hand is in i charge it with full pay and i strictly enjoin upon my trustees and executors but especially upon the man in the moon if his unsocial lip has left him one spark of gentlemanly feeling that he and they shall construe all claims liberally nay with that riotous liberality which is safe and becoming when applied to a fund so inexhaustible yes reader my fund will be inexhaustible because the period of its growth will be measured by the concurrent deposition of the ceylon mustardseed from the everlasting pillar yet why or on what principle it is because i see or imagine that i see a twofold necessity for war necessity in two different senses st a physical necessity arising out of mans nature when combined with mans situation a necessity under which war may be regarded if you please as a nuisance but as a nuisance inalienable from circumstances essential to human frailty dly a moral necessity connected with benefits of compensation such as continually lurk in evils acknowledged to be such a necessity under which it becomes lawful to say that war ought to exist as a balance to opposite tendencies of a still more evil character war is the mother of wrong and spoliation war is a scourge of god granted but like other scourges in the divine economy war purifies and redeems itself in its character of a counterforce to greater evils that could not otherwise be intercepted or redressed in two different meanings we say that a thing is necessary either in that case where it is inexorably forced on by some sad overruling principle which it is vain to fight against though all good men mourn over its existence and view it as an unconditional evil or secondly in that case where an instrument of sorrowful consequences to man is nevertheless invoked and postulated by mans highest moral interests is nevertheless clamorously indicated as a blessing when looked at in relation to some antagonist cause of evil for which it offers the one only remedy or principle of palliation the very evil and woe of mans condition upon earth may be oftentimes detected in the necessity of looking to some other woe as the pledge of its purification so that what separately would have been hateful for itself passes mysteriously into an object of toleration of hope or even of prayer as a countervenom to the taint of some more mortal poison poverty for instance is in both senses necessary for man it is necessary in the same sense as thirst is necessary i e inevitable in a fever necessary as one corollary amongst many others from the eternal hollowness of all human efforts for organizing any perfect model of society a corollary which how gladly would all of us unite to cancel but which our hearts suggest which scripture solemnly proclaims to be ineradicable from the land in this sense poverty is a necessity over which we mourn as one of the dark phases that sadden the vision of human life but far differently and with a stern gratitude we recognize another mode of necessity for this gloomy distinction a call for poverty when seen in relation to the manifold agencies by which it developes human energies in relation to the trials by which it searches the power of patience and religion in relation to the struggles by which it evokes the nobilities of fortitude or again amongst those who are not sharers in these trials and struggles but sympathizing spectators in relation to the stimulation by which it quickens wisdom that watches over the causes of this evil or by which it vivifies the spirit of love that labors for its mitigation war stands or seems to stand upon the same double basis of necessity a primary necessity that belongs to our human degradations a secondary one that towers by means of its moral relations into the region of our impassioned exaltations the two propositions on which i take my stand are these first that there are nowhere latent in society any powers by which it can effectually operate on war for its extermination the machinery is not there the game is not within the compass of the cards secondly that this defect of power is though sincerely i grieve in avowing such a sentiment and perhaps if an infirm reader had his eye upon me i might seem in sympathy with his weakness to blush not a curse no not at all but on the whole a blessing from century to century if it is an inconvenience from year to year the abolition committees it is to be feared will be very angry at both propositions yet gentlemen hear me strike but hear me i believe thats a sort of plagiarism from themistocles but never mind i have as good a right to the words until translated back into greek as that most classical of yellow admirals pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt the first proposition is that war cannot be abolished the second and more offensive that war ought not to be abolished first therefore concerning the first one at a time sufficient for the page is the evil thereof how came it into any mans heart first of all to conceive so audacious an idea as that of a conspiracy against war whence could he draw any vapor of hope to sustain his preliminary steps and in framing his plot which way did he set his face to look out for accomplices revolving this question in times past i came to the conclusion that perhaps this colossal project of a war against war had been first put in motion under a misconception natural enough and countenanced by innumerable books as to the true historical origin of wars in many notorious instances if these had arisen on trivial impulses a trivial resistance might have intercepted them if a man has once persuaded himself that long costly and bloody wars had arisen upon a point of ceremony upon a personal pique upon a hasty word upon some explosion of momentary caprice it is a natural inference that strength of national will and public combinations for resistance supposing such forces to have been trained organized and from the circumstances of the particular nation to be permanently disposable for action might prove redundantly effective when pointed against a few personal authors of war so presumably weak and so flexible to any stern countervolition as those must be supposed whose wars argued so much of vicious levity the inference is unexceptionable it is the premises that are unsound anecdotes of war as having emanated from a ladys teatable or toilette would authorize such inference as to the facilities of controlling them but the anecdotes themselves are false or false substantially all anecdotes i fear are false i am sorry to say so but my duty to the reader extorts from me the disagreeable confession as upon a matter specially investigated by myself that all dealers in anecdotes are tainted with mendacity where is the scotchman said dr johnson who does not prefer scotland to truth but however this may be rarer than such a scotchman rarer than the phoenix is that virtuous man a monster he is nay he is an impossible man who will consent to lose a prosperous anecdote on the consideration that it happens to be a lie all history therefore being built partly and some of it altogether upon anecdotage must be a tissue of lies such for the most part is the history of suetonius who may be esteemed the father of anecdotage and being such he and not herodotus should have been honored with the title father of lies such is the augustan history which is all that remains of the roman empire such is the vast series of french memoirs now stretching through more than three entire centuries are these works then to be held cheap because their truths to their falsehoods are in the ratio of one to five hundred on the contrary they are better and more to be esteemed on that account because now they are admirable reading on a winters night whereas written on the principle of sticking to the truth they would have been as dull as ditch water generally therefore the dealers in anecdotage are to be viewed with admiration as patriotic citizens willing to sacrifice their own characters lest their countrymen should find themselves short of amusement i esteem them as equal to codrus timoleon william tell or to milton as regards the liberty of unlicensed printing and i object to them only in the exceptional case of their being cited as authorities for an inference or as vouchers for a fact universally it may be received as a rule of unlimited application that when an anecdote involves a stinging repartee or collision of ideas fancifully and brilliantly related to each other by resemblance or contrast then you may challenge it as false to a certainty one illustration of which is that pretty nearly every memorable propos or pointed repartee or striking mot circulating at this moment in paris or london as the undoubted property of talleyrand that eminent knave was ascribed at vienna ninety years ago to the prince de ligne and thirty years previously to voltaire and so on regressively to many other wits knaves or not until at length if you persist in backing far enough you find yourself amongst pagans with the very same repartee c doing duty in pretty good greek footnote this is literally true more frequently than would be supposed for instance a jest often ascribed to voltaire and of late pointedly reclaimed for him by lord brougham as being one that he lord b could swear to for his so characteristic seemed the impression of voltaires mind upon the tournure of the sarcasm unhappily for this waste of sagacity may be found recorded by fabricius in the bibliotheca grca as the jest of a greek who has been dead for about seventeen centuries the man certainly did utter the jest and years ago but who it was that he stole it from is another question to all appearance and according to lord broughams opinion the party robbed must have been m de voltaire i notice the case however of the greek thefts and frauds committed upon so many of our excellent wits belonging to the th and th centuries chiefly with a view to m de talleyrand that rather middling bishop but very eminent knave he also has been extensively robbed by the greeks of the d and d centuries how else can you account for so many of his sayings being found amongst their pages a thing you may ascertain in a moment at any police office by having the greeks searched for surely you would never think of searching a bishop most of the talleyrand jewels will be found concealed amongst the goods of these unprincipled greeks but one and the most famous in the whole jewelcase sorry am i to confess was nearly stolen from the bishop not by any greek but by an english writer viz goldsmith who must have been dying about the time that his excellency the diplomatist had the goodness to be born that famous mot about language as a gift made to man for the purpose of concealing his thoughts is lurking in goldsmiths essays think of that already in his innocent childhood whilst the bishop was in petticoats and almost before he had begun to curse and to swear plainly in french an irish vagabond had attempted to swindle him out of that famous witticism which has since been as good as a lifeannuity to the venerable knaves literary fame sometimes for instance in hierocles sometimes in diogenes lrtius in plutarch or in athenus now the thing you know claimed by so many people could not belong to all of them all of them could not be the inventors logic and common sense unite in showing us that it must have belonged to the moderns who had clearly been hustled and robbed by the ancients so much more likely to commit a robbery than christians they being all gentiles pagans heathen dogs what do i infer from this why that upon any solution of the case hardly one worthy saying can be mentioned hardly one jest pun or sarcasm which has not been the occasion and subject of many falsehoods as having been auand mendaciously transferred from generation to generation sworn to in every age as this mans property or that mans by people that must have known they were lying until you retire from the investigation with a conviction that under any system of chronology the science of lying is the only one that has never drooped date from anno domini or from the julian era patronize olympiads or patronize as i do from misanthropy because nobody else will the era of nabonassar no matter upon every road thicker than milestones you see records of human mendacity or which is much worse in my opinion of human sympathy with other peoples mendacity this digression now on anecdotes footnote the word anecdotes first i believe came into currency about the middle of the th century from the use made of it by procopius literally it indicated nothing that could interest either public malice or public favor it promised only unpublished notices of the emperor justinian his wife theodora narses belisarius c but why had they been unpublished simply because scandalous and defamatory and hence from the interest which invested the case of an imperial court so remarkable this oblique secondary and purely accidental modification of the word came to influence its general acceptation simply to have been previously unpublished no longer raised any statement into an anecdote it now received a new integration it must be some fresh publication of personal memorabilia and these having reference to human creatures must always be presumed to involve more evil than good much defamation true or false much doubtful insinuation much suggestion of things worse than could be openly affirmed so arose the word but the thing arose with suetonius that dear excellent and hard working father of lies is what the learned call an excursus and i am afraid too long by half not strictly in proportion but dont mind that ill make it all right by being too short upon something else at the next opportunity and then nobody can complain meantime i argue that as all brilliant or epigrammatic anecdotes are probably false a thing that hereafter i shall have much pleasure in making out to the angry readers satisfaction but to a dead certainty those anecdotes in particular which bear marks in their construction that a rhetorical effect of art had been contemplated by the narrator we may take for granted that the current stories ascribing modern wars french and english to accidents the most inconsiderable are false even in a literal sense but at all events they are so when valued philosophically and brought out into their circumstantial relations for instance we have a french anecdote from the latter part of the seventeenth century which ascribes one bloody war to the accident of a little miff arising between the king and his minister upon some such trifle as the situation of a palace window again from the early part of the eighteenth century we have an english anecdote ascribing consequences no less bloody to a sudden feud between two ladies and that feud if i remember tracing itself up to a pair of gloves so that in effect the war and the gloves form the two poles of the transaction harlequin throws a pair of limerick gloves into a cornmill and the spectator is astonished to see the gloves immediately issuing from the hopper well ground into seven armies of one hundred thousand men each and with parks of artillery to correspond in these two anecdotes we recognize at once the able and industrious artist arranging his materials with a pious regard to theatrical effect this man knows how to group his figures well he understands where to plant his masses of light and shade and what impertinence it would be in us spectators the reader suppose and myself to go behind the scenes for critical inquiry into daylight realities all reasonable men see that the less of such realities our artist had to work with the more was his merit i am one of those that detest all insidious attempts to rob men situated as this artist of their fair fame by going about and whispering that perhaps the thing is true far from it i sympathize with the poor trembling artist and agree most cordially that the whole story is a lie and he may rely upon my support at all times to the extent of denying that any vestige of truth probably lay at the foundations of his ingenious apologue and what i say of the english fable i am willing to say of the french one both i dare say were the rankest fictions but next what after all if they were not for in the rear of all discussion upon anecdotes considered simply as true or not true comes finally a valuation of those anecdotes in their moral relation and as to the inferences which they will sustain the story for example of the french minister louvois and the adroitness with which he fastened upon great foreign potentates in the shape of war that irritability of temper in his royal master which threatened to consume himself the diplomatic address with which he transmuted suddenly a task so delicate as that of skirmishing daily in a council chamber with his own sovereign into that far jollier mode of disputation where one replies to all objections of the very keenest logician either with round shot or with grape here is an anecdote which for my own part i am inclined to view as pure gasconade but suppose the story true still it may happen that a better valuation of it may disturb the whole edifice of logical inferences by which it seemed to favor the speculations of the war abolitionists let us see what was the logic through which such a tale as this could lend any countenance to the schemes of these abolitionists that logic travelled in the following channel such a tale or the english tale of the gloves being supposed true it would seem to follow that war and the purposes of war were phenomena of chance growth not attached to any instinct so ancient and apparently so grooved into the dark necessities of our nature as we had all taken for granted usually we rank war with hunger with cold with sorrow with death afflictions of our human state that spring up as inevitably without separate culture and in defiance of all hostile culture as verdure as weeds and as flowers that overspread in spring time a fertile soil without needing to be sown or watered awful is the necessity as it seems of all such afflictions yet again if as these anecdote simply war could by possibility depend frequently on accidents of personal temperament irritability in a sensual king wounded sensibilities of pride between two sensitive ladies there in a moment shone forth a light of hope upon the crusade against war if personal accidents could to any serious extent be amongst the causes of war then it would become a hopeful duty to combine personal influences that should take an opposite direction if casual causes could be supposed chiefly to have promoted war how easy for a nation to arrange permanent and determinate causes against it the logic of these anecdotes seemed to argue that the whole fountains of war were left to the government of chance and the windiest of levities that war was not in reality roused into activity by the evil that resides in the human will but on the contrary by the simple defect of any will energetic enough or steady enough to merit that name multitudes of evils exist in our social system simply because no steadiness of attention nor action of combined will has been converged upon them war by the silent evidence of these anecdotes seemed to lie amongst that class of evils a new era might be expected to commence in new views upon war and the evil would be half conquered from the moment that it should be traced to a trivial or a personal origin all this was plausible but false the anecdotes and all similar anecdotes might be true but were delusive the logical vice in them was that they substituted an occasion for a cause the kings ill temper for instance acting through the levity and impatience of the minister might be the causa occasionalis of the war but not its true causa efficiens what was where do the true permanent causes of war as distinguished from its proximate excitements find their lodgment and abiding ground they lie in the system of national competitions in the common political system to which all individual nations are unavoidably parties in the system of public forces distributed amongst a number of adjacent nations with no internal principle for adjusting the equilibrium of these forces and no supreme areopagus or court of appeal for deciding disputes here lies the matrix of war because an eternal matrix of disputes lies in a system of interests that are continually the same and therefore the parents of rivalships too close that are continually different and so far the parents of alienation too wide all war is an instinctive nisus for redressing the errors of equilibrium in the relative position of nations amongst nations every nations duty first midst and last is to itself no nation can be safe from continual because insensible losses of ground but by continual jealousies watchings and ambitious strivings to mend its own position civilities and highbred courtesies pass and ought to pass between nations that is the graceful drapery which shrouds their natural fierce and tigerlike relations to each other but the glaring eyes which express this deep and inalienable ferocity look out at intervals from below these gorgeous draperies and sad it is to think that at intervals the acts and the temper suitable to those glaring eyes must come forward mr carter was on terms of the most exquisite dissimulation with his lions and tigers but as often as he trusted his person amongst them if in the midst of infinite politeness exchanged on all sides he saw a certain portentous expression of mutiny kindling in the eyeball of any discontented tiger all was lost unless he came down instantly upon that tigers skull with a blow from an iron bar that suggested something like apoplexy on such terms do nations meet in diplomacy high consideration for each other does not conceal the basis of enmity on which they rest not an enmity that belongs to their feelings but to the necessities of their position every nation in negotiating has its right hand upon the hilt of its sword and at intervals playfully unsheaths a little of its gleaming blade as things stand at present war and peace are bound together like the vicissitudes of day and night of castor and pollux it matters little which bucket of the two is going up at the moment which going down both are steadfastly tied by a system of alternations to a revolving wheel and a new war as certainly becomes due during the evolutions of a tedious peace as a new peace may be relied on during the throes of a bloody war to tranquillize its wounds consequently when the arrogant louvois carried a war to the credit of his own little account on the national leger of france this coxcomb well knew that a war was at any rate due about that time really says he i must find out some little war to exhaust the surplus irritability of this person or hell be the death of me but irritable or not irritable with a puppy for his minister or not the french king would naturally have been carried headlong into war by the mere system of europe within a very few months so much had the causes of complaint reciprocally accumulated the account must be cleansed the court roll of grievances must be purged with respect to the two english ladies again it is still more evident that they could not have caused a war by pulling caps with each other since the grounds of every war what had caused it and prolonged it was sure to be angrily reviewed by parliament at each annual exposition of the finance ministers budget these ladies and the french coxcomb could at the utmost have claimed a distinction such as that which belonged to a particular turkish gunner the captain of a gun at navarino viz that he by firing the first shot without orders did as a matter of fact let loose and unmuzzle the whole of that dreadful iron hurricane from four nations which instantly followed but which be it known to the gunner could not have been delayed for fifty minutes longer whether he had fired the unauthorized gun or not but now let me speak to the second proposition of my twoheaded thesis viz that war ought not to be abolished if such an abolition were even possible prima facie it seems a dreadful doctrine to claim a place for war as amongst the evils that are salutary to man but conscientiously i hold it to be such i hold with wordsworth but for reasons which may or may not be the same since he has not stated his that gods most dreaded instrument in working out a pure intent is man arrayd for mutual slaughter yea carnage is his daughter i am obliged to hold that supposing so romantic a condition realized as the cessation of war this change unless other evils were previously abolished or neutralized in a way still more romantic to suppose would not be for the welfare of human nature but would tend to its rapid degradation one in fact of the earliest aspects under which this moral necessity for war forces itself upon our notice is its physical necessity i mean to say that one of the earliest reasons why war ought to exist is because under any mode of suppressing war virtually it will exist banish war as now administered and it will revolve upon us in a worse shape that is in a shape of predatory and ruffian war more and more licentious as it enjoys no privilege or sufferance by the supposition under the national laws will the causes of war die away because war is forbidden certainly not and the only result of the prohibition would be to throw back the exercise of war from national into private and mercenary hands and that is precisely the retrograde or inverse course of civilization for in the natural order of civilization war passes from the hands of knights barons insulated cities into those of the universal community if again it is attempted to put down this lawless guerilla state by national forces then the result will be to have established an interminable warfare of a mixed character private and public civil and foreign infesting the frontiers of all states like a fever and in substitution for the occasional and intermitting wars of high national police administered with the dignified responsibility that belongs to supreme rank with the humanity that belongs to conscious power and with the diminishing havoc that belongs to increasing skill in the arts of destruction even as to this last feature in warfare which in the war of brigands and condottieri would for many reasons instantly decay no reader can fail to be aware of the marvels effected by the forces of inventive science that run along side by side with the advances of civilization look back even to the grandest period of the humane roman warfare listen to the noblest and most merciful of all roman captains saying on the day of pharsalia and saying of necessity strike at their faces cavalry yes absolutely directing his own troopers to plough up with their sabres the blooming faces of the young roman nobility and then pass to a modern field of battle where all is finished by musquetry and artillery amidst clouds of smoke no soldier recognizing his own desolations or the ghastly ruin of his own right arm so that war by losing all its brutality is losing half of its demoralization war so far from ending because war was forbidden and nationally renounced on the contrary would transmigrate into a more fearful shape as things are at present and observe they are always growing better what numbers of nobleminded men in the persons of our officers yes and often of noncommissioned officers do we british for example disperse over battlefields that could not dishonor their glorious uniform by any countenance to an act of cruelty they are eyes delegated from the charities of our domestic life to overlook and curb the license of war i remember in xenophon some passage where he describes a class of persian gentlemen who were called the ophthalmoi or eyes of the king but for a very different purpose these british officers may be called the opthalmoi or eyes of our sovereign lady that into every corner of the battle carry their scrutiny lest any cruelty should be committed on the helpless or any advantage taken of a dying enemy but mark such officers would be rare in the irregular troops succeeding to the official armies and through this channel amongst others war when cried down by act of parliament and precisely because it was cried down would become more perilously effective for the degradation of human nature being itself dishonored war would become the more effective as an instrument for the dishonoring of its agents however at length we will suppose the impossible problem solved war we will assume is at last put down at length there is no more war though by the way let me whisper in your ear supposing you to be a christian this would be a prelibation drawn prematurely from the cup of millennial happiness and strictly speaking there is no great homage to religion even thus far in figuring that to be the purchase of man for himself and through his own efforts which is viewed by scripture as a glory removed to the infinite and starry distance of a millennium and as the teleutaion epigeinaema the last crowning attainment of christian truth no longer militant on earth christianity it is but christianity when triumphant and no longer in conflict with adverse or thwarting or limiting influences which only can be equal to a revolution so mighty but all this for the sake of pursuing the assumption let us agree to waive in reality there are two separate stations taken up by the war denouncers one class hold that an influence derived from political economy is quite equal to the flying leap by which man is to clear this unfathomable gulph of war and to land his race for ever on the opposite shore of a self sustaining peace simply the contemplation of national debts as a burthen which never would have existed without war and a computation of the waste havoc unproductive labor c attached to any single campaign these they imagine might suffice per se for the extinction of war but the other class cannot go along with a speculation so infirm reasons there are in the opposite scale tempting man into war which are far mightier than any motives addressed to his selfinterest even straining her energies to the utmost they regard all policy of the purse as adequate anything short of religion they are satisfied must be incommensurate to a result so vast i myself certainly agree with this last class but upon this arises a delusion which i shall have some trouble in making the reader understand and of this i am confidentthat a majority perhaps in every given amount of readers will share in the delusion will part from me in the persuasion that the error i attempt to expose is no error at all but that it is myself who am in the wrong the delusion which i challenge as such respects the very meaning and value of a sacrifice made to christianity what is it what do we properly mean by a concession or a sacrifice made to a spiritual power such as christianity if a king and his people impressed by the unchristian character of war were to say in some solemn act we the parties undersigned for the reasons stated in the body of this document proclaim to all nations that from and after midsummer eve of the year this being the eve of st john the baptist who was the herald of christ we will no more prosecute any interest of ours unless the one sole interest of national defence by means of war and this sacrifice we make as a concession and act of homage to christianity would that vow i ask sincerely offered and steadily observed really be a sacrifice made to christianity not at all a sacrifice that was truly such to a spiritual religion must be a sacrifice not verbally though sincerely dedicating itself to the religion but a sacrifice wrought and accomplished by that religion through and by its own spirit midsummer eve of could clearly make no spiritual change in the king or his people such they would be on the morning after st johns day as on the morning before it i e filled with all elements though possibly undeveloped of strife feud pernicious ambition the delusion therefore which i charge upon this religious class of war denouncers is that whilst they see and recognize this infinite imperfection of any influence which christianity yet exercises upon the world they nevertheless rely upon that acknowledged shadow for the accomplishment of what would in such circumstances be a real miracle they rely upon that shadow as truly and entirely as if it were already that substance which in a vast revolution of ages it will finally become and they rely upon this mockery in two senses first for the endurance of the frail human resolution that would thaw in an hour before a great outrage or provocation suited to the nobler infirmities of man secondly which is the point i mainly aim at assuming for a moment that the resolution could endure amongst all mankind we are all equally convinced that an evil so vast is not likely to be checked or controlled except by some very extraordinary power well where is it show me that power i know of none but christianity there undoubtedly is hope but in order that the hope may become rational the power must become practical and practical it is not in the extent required until this christianity from being dimly appreciated by a section footnote what section if you please i for my part do not agree with those that geographically degrade christianity as occupying but a trifle on the area of our earth mark this all eastern populations have dwindled upon better acquaintance persia that ought to have at least two hundred and fifty millions of people and would have them under english government and once was supposed to have at least one hundred millions how many millions has she eight this was ascertained by napoleons emissary in general gardanne afghanistan has very little more though some falsely count fourteen millions there go two vast chambers of mahometanism not twenty millions between them hindostan may really have one hundred and twenty millions claimed for her as to the burman empire i nor anybody else knows the truth but as to china i have never for a moment been moved by those ridiculous estimates of the flowery people which our simple countrymen copy instead of three hundred and fifty millions a third of the human race upon the most exaggerated estimate read eighty or one hundred millions at most africa as it regards religion counts for a cipher europe america and the half of asia as to space are christian consequently the total facit as regards christianity is not what many amiable infidels make it to be my dears your wish was father to that thought of this world shall have been the law that overrides the whole that consummation is not immeasurably distant even now from considerations connected with china with new zealand borneo australia we may say that already the fields are white for harvest but alas the interval is brief between christianity small and christianity great as regards space or terraqueous importance compared with that interval which separates christianity formally professed from christianity thankfully acknowledged by universal man in beauty and power here therefore is one spoke in the wheel for so vast a change as war dethroned viz that you see no cause though you should travel round the whole horizon adequate to so prodigious an effect what could do it why christianity could do it aye true but man disarms christianity and no mock christianity no lip homage to christianity will answer but is war then to go on for ever are we never to improve are nations to conduct their intercourse eternally under the secret understanding that an unchristian solution of all irreconcileable feuds stands in the rear as the ultimate appeal i answer that war going on even for ever may still be for ever amending its modes and its results upon human happiness secondly that we not only are under no fatal arrest in our process of improvement but that as regards war history shows how steadily we have been improving and thirdly that although war may be irreversible as the last resource this last resource may constantly be retiring further into the rear let us speak to this last point war is the last resource only because other and more intellectual resources for solving disputes are not available and why are they not simply because the knowledge and the logic which ultimately will govern the case and the very circumstances of the case itself in its details as the basis on which this knowledge and logic are to operate happen not to have been sufficiently developed a code of law is not a spasmodic effort of gigantic talent in any one man or any one generation it is a slow growth of accidents and occasions expanding with civilization dependent upon time as a multiform element in its development and presupposing often a concurrent growth of analogous cases towards the completion of its system for instance the law which regulates the rights of shipping seafaring men and maritime commerce how slow was its development before such works as the consolato del mare had been matured how wide must have been the experience and how slow its accumulation during that long period of infancy for law how many must have been the openings for ignorant and unintentional injustice how differently again will the several parties to any transaction construe the rights of the case discussion without rules for guiding it will but embitter the dispute and in the absence of all guidance from the intellect gradually weaving a common standard of international appeal it is clear that nations must fight and ought to fight not being convinced it is base to pretend that you are convinced and failing to be convinced by your neighbors arguments you confess yourself a poltroon and moreover you invite injuries from every neighbor if you pocket your wrongs the only course in such a case is to thump your neighbor and to thump him soundly for the present this treatment is very serviceable to your neighbors optics he sees things in a new light after a sufficient course of so distressing a regimen but mark even in this case war has no tendency to propagate war but tends to the very opposite result to thump is as costly and in other ways as painful as to be thumped the evil to both sides arises in an undeveloped state of law if rights were defined by a well considered code growing out of long experience each party sees that this scourge of war would continually tend to limit itself consequently the very necessity of war becomes the strongest invitation to that system of judicial logic which forms its sole limitation but all war whatsoever stands in these circumstances it follows that all war whatever unless on the brutal principle of a spartan warfare that made war its own sufficient object and selfjustification operates as a perpetual bounty offered to men upon the investigation and final adjudication of those disputed cases through which war prospers hence it is viz because the true boundaries of reciprocal rights are for ever ascertaining themselves more clearly that war is growing less frequent the fields open to injustice which originally from pure ignorance are so vast continually through deeper and more expansive surveys by mans intellect searching reflecting comparing are narrowing themselves narrowing themselves in this sense that all nations under a common centre of religious civilization as christendom suppose or islamism would not fight no and would not by the national sense of wrong and right be permitted to fight in a cause confessedly condemned by equity as now developed the causes of war that still remain are causes on which international law is silent that large arrear of cases as yet unsettled or else they are cases in which though law speaks with an authentic voice it speaks in vain because the circumstances are doubtful so that if the law is fixed as a lamp nailed to a wall yet the incidence of the law on the particular circumstances becomes as doubtful as the light of the lamp upon objects that are capriciously moving we see all this illustrated in a class of cases that powerfully illustrate the good and the bad in war the why and the wherefore as likewise the why not and therefore i presume the wherefore not and this class of cases belongs to the lex vicinitatis in the roman law this section makes a great figure and speaking accurately it makes a greater in our own but the reason why this law of neighborhood seems to fill so much smaller a section in ours is because in english law being positively a longer section negatively to the whole compass of our law it is less the roman law would have paved a road to the moon and what is that expressed in time let us see a railway train worked at the speed of the great western express accomplishes easily a thousand miles in twentyfour hours consequently in two hundred and forty days or eight months it would run into the moon with its buffers and break up the quarters of that robinson crusoe who and without any friday is the only policeman that parades that little pensive appendage or tender to our fuming engine of an earth but the english law oh frightful reader dont even think of such a question as its relation in space and time to the roman law that it would stretch to the fixed stars is plain but to which of them dont now dear persecuting reader unsettle our brains by asking enough it is that both in roman and english law the rights of neighborhood are past measuring has a man a right to play the german flute where the partitions are slender all day long in the house adjoining to yours or supposing a beneficent jury beneficent to him finds this to be no legal nuisance has he a right to play it ill or because juries when tipsy will wink at anything does the privilege extend to the jewsharp to the poker and tongs to the marrowbones and cleavers or without ranging through the whole of the spectators culinary music will the bagpipes be found within benefit of jury law war to the knife i say before well submit to that and if the law wont protect us against it then well turn rebels now this law of neighborhood this lex vicinitatis amongst the romans righted itself and settled itself as amongst ourselves it continues to do by means of actions or legal suits if a man poisons us with smoke we compel him by an action to eat his own smoke or if he chooses to make his chimneys eat it here you see is a transmuted war in a barbarous state fire and sword would have avenged this invasion of smoke but amongst civilized men paper bullets in the form of qui tam and scire facias beat off the enemy and on the same principle exactly as the law of international rights clears up its dark places war gradually narrows its grounds and the jus gentium defines itself through national attorneys i e diplomatists for instance now i have myself seen a case where a man cultivating a flowergarden and distressed for some deliverance from his rubbish of dead leaves litter straw stones took the desperate resolution of projecting the whole upon his neighbors flowergarden i a chance spectator of the outrage knew too much of this world to lodge any protest against it on the principle of mere abstract justice so it would have passed unnoticed but for the accident that his injured neighbor unexpectedly raised up his head above the dividing wall and reproached the aggressor with his unprincipled conduct this aggressor adding evil to evil suggested as the natural remedy for his own wrong that the sufferer should pass the nuisance onwards to the garden next beyond him from which it might be posted forward on the same principle the aggrieved man however preferred passing it back without any discount to the original proprietor here now is a ripe case a causa teterrima for war between the parties and for a national war had the parties been nations in fact the very same injury in a more aggravated shape is perpetrated from time to time by jersey upon ourselves and would upon a larger scale right itself by war convicts are costly to maintain and jersey whose national revenue is limited being too well aware of this does us the favor to land upon the coasts of hampshire dorset c all the criminals whom she cannot summarily send back to selfsupport at each jaildelivery what are we to do in england is the natural question propounded by the injured scoundrels when taking leave of their jersey escort anything you please is the answer rise if you can to be dukes only never come back hither since dukes or no dukes to the rest of christendom to us of the channel islands you will always be transported felons there is therefore a good right of action ie a good ground of war against jersey on the part of great britain since besides the atrocious injury inflicted this unprincipled little island has the audacity to regard our england all europe looking on as existing only for the purposes of a sewer or cesspool to receive her impurities some time back i remember a scottish newspaper holding up the case as a newly discovered horror in the social system but in a quiet way jersey has always been engaged in this branch of exportation and rarely fails to run a cargo of rogues upon our shore once or so in the season what amuses one besides in this scottish denunciation of the villany is that scotland footnote to banish them forth of the kingdom was the euphuismus but the reality understood was to carry the knaves like foxes in a bag to the english soil and there unbag them for english use of old pursued the very same mode of jaildelivery as to knaves that were not thought ripe enough for hanging she carted them to the english border unchained them and hurried them adrift into the wilderness saying now boys shift for yourselves and henceforth plunder none but englishmen what i deduce from all this is that as the feuds arising between individuals under the relation of neighbors are so far from tending to a hostile result that on the contrary as coming under a rule of law already ascertained or furnishing the basis for a new rule they gradually tighten the cords which exclude all opening for quarrel not otherwise is the result and therefore the usefulness of war amongst nations all the causes of war the occasions upon which it is likely to arise the true and the ostensible motives are gradually evolved are examined searched valued by publicists and by such means in the further progress of men a comprehensive law of nations will finally be accumulated not such as now passes for international law a worthless code that has no weight in the practice of nations nor deserves any but one which will exhaust the great body of cases under which wars have arisen under the christian era and gradually collect a public opinion of christendom upon the nature of each particular case the causes that have existed for war are the causes that will exist or at least they are the same under modifications that will simply vary the rule as our law cases in the courts are every day circumstantiating the particular statute concerned at this stage of advance and when a true european opinion has been created a sensus communis or community of feeling on the main classifications of wars it will become possible to erect a real areopagus or central congress for all christendom not with any commission to suppress wars a policy which would neutralize itself by reacting as a fresh cause of war since highspirited nations would arm for the purpose of resisting such decrees but with the purpose and the effect of oftentimes healing local or momentary animosities and also by publishing the opinion of europe assembled in council with the effect of taking away the shadow of dishonor from the act of retiring from war not to mention that the mere delay involved in the waiting for the solemn opinion of congress would always be friendly to pacific councils but would the belligerents wait that concession might be secured by general exchange of treaties in the same way that the cooperation of so many nations has been secured to the suppression of the trade in slaves and one thing is clear that when all the causes of war involving manifest injustice are banished by the force of european opinion focally converged upon the subject the range of war will be prodigiously circumscribed the costliness of war which for various reasons has been continually increasing since the feudal period will operate as another limitation upon its field concurring powerfully with the public declaration from a council of collective christendom there is besides a distinct and separate cause of war more fatal to the possibilities of peace in europe than open injustice and this cause being certainly in the hands of nations to deal with as they please there is a tolerable certainty that a congress sincerely pacific would cut it up by the roots it is a cause noticed by kant in his essay on perpetual peace and with great sagacity though otherwise that little work is not free from visionary selfdelusions and this cause lies in the diplomacy of europe treaties of peace are so constructed as almost always to sow the seeds of future wars this seems to the inexperienced reader a matter of carelessness or laxity in the choice of expression and sometimes it may have been so but more often it has been done under the secret dictation of powerful courts making peaces only as truces anxious only for time to nurse their energies and to keep open some plausible call for war this is not only amongst the most extensive causes of war but the very worst because it gives a colorable air of justice and almost of necessity to a war which is in fact the most outrageously unjust as being derived from a pretext silently prepared in former years with mere subtlety of malice it is a war growing out of occasions forged beforehand lest no occasions should spontaneously arise now this cause of war could and would be healed by a congress and through an easy reform in european diplomacyfootnote one great nidus of this insidious preparation for war under the very masque of peace which kant from brevity has failed to particularize lies in the neglecting to make any provision for cases that are likely enough to arise a b c d are all equally possible but the treaty provides a specific course of action only for a suppose then upon b or c arising the high contracting parties though desperately and equally pacific find themselves committed to war actually by a treaty of lasting peace their pacific majesties sigh and say alas that it should be so but really fight we must for what says the treaty it is the strongest confirmation of the power inherent in growing civilization to amend war and to narrow the field of war if we look back for the records of the changes in this direction which have already arisen in generations before our own the most careless reviewer of history can hardly fail to read a rude outline of progress made by men in the rights and consequently in the duties of war through the last twentyfive centuries it is a happy circumstance for man that oftentimes he is led by pure selfishness into reforms the very same as high principle would have prompted and in the next stage of his advance when once habituated to an improved code of usages he begins to find a gratification to his sensibilities partly luxurious sensibilities but partly moral in what originally had been a mere movement of selfinterest then comes a third stage in which having thoroughly reconciled himself to a better order of things and made it even necessary to his own comfort at length he begins in his reflecting moments to perceive a moral beauty and a fitness in arrangements that had emanated from accidents of convenience so that finally he generates a sublime pleasure of conscientiousness out of that which originally commenced in the meanest forms of mercenary convenience a roman lady of rank out of mere voluptuous regard to her own comfort revolted from the harsh clamors of eternal chastisements inflicted on her numerous slaves she forbade them the grateful slaves showed their love for her gradually and unintentionally she trained her feelings when thus liberated from a continual temptation to the sympathies with cruelty into a demand for gentler and purer excitement her purpose had been one of luxury but by the benignity of nature still watching for ennobling opportunities the actual result was a development given to the higher capacities of her heart in the same way when the brutal right and in many circumstances the brutal duty of inflicting death upon prisoners taken in battle had exchanged itself for the profits of ransom or slavery this relaxation of ferocity though commencing in selfishness gradually exalted itself into a habit of mildness and some dim perception of a sanctity in human life the very vice of avarice ministered to the purification of barbarism and the very evil of slavery in its earliest form was applied to the mitigation of another evil war conducted in the spirit of piratical outrage the commercial instincts of men having worked one set of changes in war a second set of changes was prompted by instincts derived from the arts of ornament and pomp splendor of arms of banners of equipages of ceremonies and the elaborate forms of intercourse with enemies through conferences armistices treaties of peace c having tamed the savagery of war into connection with modes of intellectual grandeur and with the endless restraints of superstition or scrupulous religion a permanent light of civilization began to steal over the bloody shambles of buccaneering warfare other modes of harmonizing influences arose more directly from the bosom of war itself gradually the mere practice of war and the culture of war though merely viewed as a rude trade of bloodshed ripened into an intellectual art were it merely with a view to more effectual carnage this art however simple and gross at first opened at length into wide scientific arts into strategies into tactics into castrametation into poliorcetics and all the processes through which the first rude efforts of martial cunning finally connect themselves with the exquisite resources of science war being a game in which each side forces the other into the instant adoption of all improvements through the mere necessities of selfpreservation became continually more intellectual it is interesting to observe the steps by which were it only through impulses of selfconservation and when searching with a view to more effectual destructiveness war did and must refine itself from a horrid trade of butchery into a magnificent and enlightened science starting from no higher impulse or question than how to cut throats most rapidly most safely and on the largest scale it has issued even at our own stage of advance into a science magnificent oftentimes ennobling and cleansed from all horrors except those which not being within mans power utterly to divorce from it no longer stand out as reproaches to his humanity meantime a more circumstantial review of war in relation to its motives and the causes assigned for its justification would expose a series of changes greater perhaps than the reader is aware of such a review which would too much lengthen a single paper may or may not form the subject of a second and i will content myself with saying as a closing remark that this review will detect a principle of steady advance in the purification and elevation of war such as must offer hope to those who believe in the possibility of its absolute extermination and must offer consolation to those who like myself deny it the last days of immanuel kant i take it for granted that every person of education will acknowledge some interest in the personal history of immanuel kant a great man though in an unpopular path must always be an object of liberal curiosity to suppose a reader thoroughly indifferent to kant is to suppose him thoroughly unintellectual and therefore though in reality he should happen not to regard him with interest it is one of the fictions of courtesy to presume that he does on this principle i make no apology to the reader for detaining him upon a short sketch of kants life and domestic habits drawn from the authentic records of his friends and pupils it is true that without any illiberality on the part of the public in this country the works of kant are not regarded with the same interest which has gathered about his name and this may be attributed to three causes first to the language in which they are written secondly to the supposed obscurity of the philosophy which they teach whether intrinsic or due to kants particular mode of expounding it thirdly to the unpopularity of all speculative philosophy no matter how treated in a country where the structure and tendency of society impress upon the whole activities of the nation a direction exclusively practical but whatever may be the immediate fortunes of his writings no man of enlightened curiosity will regard the author himself without something of a profounder interest measured by one test of power viz by the number of books written directly for or against himself to say nothing of those which he has indirectly modified there is no philosophic writer whatsoever if we except aristotle who can pretend to approach kant in the extent of the influence which he has exercised over the minds of men such being his claims upon our notice i repeat that it is no more than a reasonable act of respect to the reader to presume in him so much interest about kant as will justify a sketch of his life immanuel kant footnote by the paternal side the family of kant was of scotch derivation and hence it is that the name was written by kant the father cant that being a scotch name and still to be found in scotland but immanuel though he always cherished his scotch descent substituted a k for a c in order to adapt it better to the analogies of the german language the second of six children was born at knigsberg in prussia a city at that time containing about fifty thousand inhabitants on the d of april his parents were people of humble rank and not rich even for their own station but able with some assistance from a near relative and a trifle in addition from a gentleman who esteemed them for their piety and domestic virtues to give their son immanuel a liberal education he was sent when a child to a charity school and in the year removed to the royal or frederician academy here he studied the greek and latin classics and formed an intimacy with one of his schoolfellows david ruhnken afterwards so well known to scholars under his latin name of ruhnkenius which lasted until the death of the latter in kant lost his mother a woman of excellent character and of accomplishments and knowledge beyond her rank who contributed to the future eminence of her illustrious son by the direction which she gave to his youthful thoughts and by the elevated morals to which she trained him kant never spoke of her to the end of his life without the utmost tenderness and acknowledgment of his great obligations to her maternal care in at michlmas he entered the university of knigsberg in when about twentytwo years old he printed his first work upon a question partly mathematical and partly philosophic viz the valuation of living forces the question had been first moved by leibnitz in opposition to the cartesians and was here finally settled after having occupied most of the great mathematicians of europe for more than half a century it was dedicated to the king of prussia but never reached him having in fact never been published footnote to this circumstance we must attribute its being so little known amongst the philosophers and mathematicians of foreign countries and also the fact that dalembert whose philosophy was miserably below his mathematics many years afterwards still continued to represent the dispute as a verbal one from this time until he supported himself as a private tutor in different families or by giving private lectures in knigsberg especially to military men on the art of fortification in he was appointed to the chair of mathematics which he exchanged soon after for that of logic and metaphysics on this occasion he delivered an inaugural disputation de mundi sensibilis atque intelligibilis forma et principiis which is remarkable for containing the first germs of the transcendental philosophy in he published his great work the critik der reinen vernunft or investigation of the pure reason on february he died these are the great epochs of kants life but his was a life remarkable not so much for its incidents as for the purity and philosophic dignity of its daily tenor and of this the best impression will be obtained from wasianskis account of his last years checked and supported by the collateral testimonies of jachmann rink borowski and other biographers we see him here struggling with the misery of decaying faculties and with the pain depression and agitation of two different complaints one affecting his stomach and the other his head over all which the benignity and nobility of his mind are seen victoriously eminent to the last the principal defect of this and all other memoirs of kant is that they report too little of his conversation and opinions and perhaps the reader will be disposed to complain that some of the notices are too minute and circumstantial so as to be at one time undignified and at another unfeeling as to the first objection it may be answered that biographical gossip of this sort and ungentlemanly scrutiny into a mans private life though not what a man of honor would choose to write may be read without blame and where a great man is the subject sometimes with advantage with respect to the other objection i know not how to excuse mr wasianski for kneeling at the bedside of his dying friend to record with the accuracy of a shorthand reporter the last flutter of his pulse and the struggles of expiring nature except by supposing that the idea of kant as a person belonging to all ages in his mind transcended and extinguished the ordinary restraints of human sensibility and that under this impression he gave that to his sense of a public duty which it may be hoped he would willingly have declined on the impulse of his private affections the following paper on the last days of kant is gathered from the german of wasianski jachmann borowski and others my knowledge of professor kant began long before the period to which this little memorial of him chiefly refers in the year or i cannot exactly remember which i attended his lectures afterwards i acted as his amanuensis and in that office was naturally brought into a closer connection with him than any other of his pupils so that without any request on my part he granted me a general privilege of free admission to his classroom in i took orders and withdrew myself from all connection with the university i still continued however to reside in knigsberg but wholly forgotten or wholly unnoticed at least by kant ten years afterwards that is to say in i met him by accident at a party given on occasion of the marriage of one of the professors at table kant distributed his conversation and attentions pretty generally but after the entertainment when the company broke up into parties he came and seated himself very obligingly by my side i was at that time a florist an amateur i mean from the passion i had for flowers upon learning which he talked of my favorite pursuit and with very extensive information in the course of our conversation i was surprised to find that he was perfectly acquainted with all the circumstances of my situation he reminded me of our previous connection expressed his satisfaction at finding that i was happy and was so good as to desire that if my engagements allowed me i would now and then come and dine with him soon after this he rose to take his leave and as our road lay the same way he proposed to me that i should accompany him home i did so and received an invitation for the next week with a general invitation for every week after and permission to name my own day at first i was unable to explain the distinction with which kant had treated me and i conjectured that some obliging friend had spoken of me in his hearing somewhat more advantageously than i could pretend to deserve but more intimate experience has convinced me that he was in the habit of making continual inquiries after the welfare of his former pupils and was heartily rejoiced to hear of their prosperity so that it appeared i was wrong in thinking he had forgotten me this revival of my intimacy with professor kant coincided pretty nearly in point of time with a complete change in his domestic arrangements up to this period it had been his custom to eat at a table dhte but he now began to keep house himself and every day invited two friends to dine with him and upon any little festival from five to eight for he was a punctual observer of lord chesterfields rule that his dinner party himself included should not fall below the number of the graces nor exceed that of the muses in the whole economy of his household arrangements and especially of his dinner parties there was something peculiar and amusingly opposed to the usual conventional restraints of society not however that there was any neglect of decorum such as sometimes occurs in houses where there are no ladies to impress a better tone upon the manners the invariable routine was this the moment that dinner was ready lampe the professors old footman stepped into the study with a certain measured air and announced it this summons was obeyed at the pace of double quick time kant talking all the way to the eatingroom about the state of the weather footnote his reason for which was that he considered the weather one of the principal forces which act upon the health and his own frame was exquisitely sensible to all atmospheric influences a subject which he usually pursued during the earlier part of the dinner graver themes such as the political events of the day were never introduced before dinner or at all in his study the moment that kant had taken his seat and unfolded his napkin he opened the business of dinner with a particular formula now then gentlemen and the tone and air with which he uttered these words proclaimed in a way which nobody could mistake relaxation from the toils of the morning and determinate abandonment of himself to social enjoyment the table was hospitably spread three dishes wine c with a small second course composed the dinner every person helped himself and all delays of ceremony were so disagreeable to kant that he seldom failed to express his displeasure with anything of that sort though not angrily he was displeased also if people ate little and treated it as affectation the first man to help himself was in his eyes the politest guest for so much the sooner came his own turn for this hatred of delay kant had a special excuse having always worked hard from an early hour in the morning and eaten nothing until dinner hence it was that in the latter period of his life though less perhaps from actual hunger than from some uneasy sensation of habit or periodical irritation of stomach he could hardly wait with patience for the arrival of the last person invited there was no friend of kants but considered the day on which he was to dine with him as a day of pleasure without giving himself the air of an instructor kant really was so in the very highest degree the whole entertainment was seasoned with the overflow of his enlightened mind poured out naturally and unaffectedly upon every topic as the chances of conversation suggested it and the time flew rapidly away from one oclock to four five or even later profitably and delightfully kant tolerated no calms which was the name he gave to the momentary pauses in conversation or periods when its animation languished some means or other he always devised for restoring its tone of interest in which he was much assisted by the tact with which he drew from every guest his peculiar tastes or the particular direction of his pursuits and on these be they what they might he was never unprepared to speak with knowledge and the interest of an original observer the local affairs of knigsberg must have been interesting indeed before they could be allowed to occupy the attention at his table and what may seem still more singular it was rarely or never that he directed the conversation to any branch of the philosophy founded by himself indeed he was perfectly free from the fault which besets so many savans and literati of intolerance towards those whose pursuits had disqualified them for any particular sympathy with his own his style of conversation was popular in the highest degree and unscholastic so much so that any stranger who should have studied his works and been unacquainted with his person would have found it difficult to believe that in this delightful companion he saw the profound author of the transcendental philosophy the subjects of conversation at kants table were drawn chiefly from natural philosophy chemistry meteorology natural history and above all from politics the news of the day as reported in the public journals was discussed with a peculiar vigilance of examination with regard to any narrative that wanted dates of time and place however otherwise plausible he was uniformly an inexorable sceptic and held it unworthy of repetition so keen was his penetration into the interior of political events and the secret policy under which they moved that he talked rather with the authority of a diplomatic person who had access to cabinet intelligence than as a simple spectator of the great scenes which were unfolding in europe at the time of the french revolution he threw out many conjectures and what were then accounted paradoxical anticipations especially in regard to military operations which were as punctually fulfilled as his own memorable conjecture in regard to the hiatus in the planetary system between mars and jupiter footnote to which the author should have added and in regard to the hiatus between the planetary and cometary systems which was pointed out by kant several years before his conjecture was established by the good telescope of dr herschel vesta and juno further confirmations of kants conjecture were discovered in june when wasianski wrote the entire confirmation of which he lived to witness on the discovery of ceres by piazzi in palermo and of pallas by dr olbers at bremen these two discoveries by the way impressed him much and they furnished a topic on which he always talked with pleasure though according to his usual modesty he never said a word of his own sagacity in having upon priori grounds shown the probability of such discoveries many years before it was not only in the character of a companion that kant shone but also as a most courteous and liberal host who had no greater pleasure than in seeing his guests happy and jovial and rising with exhilarated spirits from the mixed pleasures intellectual and liberally sensual of his platonic banquets chiefly perhaps with a view to the sustaining of this tone of genial hilarity he showed himself somewhat of an artist in the composition of his dinner parties two rules there were which he obviously observed and i may say invariably the first was that the company should be miscellaneous this for the sake of securing sufficient variety to the conversation and accordingly his parties presented as much variety as the world of knigsberg afforded being drawn from all the modes of life men in office professors physicians clergymen and enlightened merchants his second rule was to have a due balance of young men frequently of very young men selected from the students of the university in order to impress a movement of gaiety and juvenile playfulness on the conversation an additional motive for which as i have reason to believe was that in this way he withdrew his mind from the sadness which sometimes overshadowed it for the early deaths of some young friends whom he loved and this leads me to mention a singular feature in kants way of expressing his sympathy with his friends in sickness so long as the danger was imminent he testified a restless anxiety made perpetual inquiries waited with patience for the crisis and sometimes could not pursue his customary labors from agitation of mind but no sooner was the patients death announced than he recovered his composure and assumed an air of stern tranquillity almost of indifference the reason was that he viewed life in general and therefore that particular affection of life which we call sickness as a state of oscillation and perpetual change between which and the fluctuating sympathies of hope and fear there was a natural proportion that justified them to the reason whereas death as a permanent state that admitted of no more or less that terminated all anxiety and for ever extinguished the agitation of suspense he would not allow to be fitted to any state of feeling but one of the same enduring and unchanging character however all this philosophic heroism gave way on one occasion for many persons will remember the tumultuous grief which he manifested upon the death of mr ehrenboth a young man of very fine understanding and extensive attainments for whom he had the greatest affection and naturally it happened in so long a life as his in spite of his provident rule for selecting his social companions as much as possible amongst the young that he had to mourn for many a heavy loss that could never be supplied to him to return however to the course of his day immediately after the termination of his dinner party kant walked out for exercise but on this occasion he never took any companion partly perhaps because he thought it right after so much convivial and colloquial relaxation to pursue his meditations footnote mr wasianski is wrong to pursue his meditations under these circumstances might perhaps be an inclination of kants to which he yielded but not one which he would justify or erect into a maxim he disapproved of eating alone or solipsismus convictorii as he calls it on the principle that a man would be apt if not called off by the business and pleasure of a social party to think too much or too closely an exercise which he considered very injurious to the stomach during the first process of digestion on the same principle he disapproved of walking or riding alone the double exercise of thinking and bodily agitation carried on at the same time being likely as he conceived to press too hard upon the stomach and partly as i happen to know for a very peculiar reason viz that he wished to breathe exclusively through his nostrils which he could not do if he were obliged continually to open his mouth in conversation his reason for this was that the atmospheric air being thus carried round by a longer circuit and reaching the lungs therefore in a state of less rawness and at a temperature somewhat higher would be less apt to irritate them by a steady perseverance in this practice which he constantly recommended to his friends he flattered himself with a long immunity from coughs colds hoarseness and every mode of defluxion and the fact really was that these troublesome affections attacked him very rarely indeed i myself by only occasionally adopting his rule have found my chest not so liable as formerly to such attacks at six oclock he sat down to his library table which was a plain ordinary piece of furniture and read till dusk during this period of dubious light so friendly to thought he rested in tranquil meditation on what he had been reading provided the book were worth it if not he sketched his lecture for the next day or some part of any book he might then be composing during this state of repose he took his station winter and summer by the stove looking through the window at the old tower of lobenicht not that he could be said properly to see it but the tower rested upon his eye obscurely or but half revealed to his consciousness no words seemed forcible enough to express his sense of the gratification which he derived from this old tower when seen under these circumstances of twilight and quiet reverie the sequel indeed showed how important it was to his comfort for at length some poplars in a neighboring garden shot up to such a height as to obscure the tower upon which kant became very uneasy and restless and at length found himself positively unable to pursue his evening meditations fortunately the proprietor of the garden was a very considerate and obliging person who had besides a high regard for kant and accordingly upon a representation of the case being made to him he gave orders that the poplars should be cropped this was done the old tower of lobenicht was again unveiled and kant recovered his equanimity and pursued his twilight meditations as before after the candles were brought kant prosecuted his studies till nearly ten oclock a quarter of an hour before retiring for the night he withdrew his mind as much as possible from every class of thoughts which demanded any exertion or energy of attention on the principle that by stimulating and exciting him too much such thoughts would be apt to cause wakefulness and the slightest interference with his customary hour of falling asleep was in the highest degree unpleasant to him happily this was with him a very rare occurrence he undressed himself without his servants assistance but in such an order and with such a roman regard to decorum and the to prepon that he was always ready at a moments warning to make his appearance without embarrassment to himself or to others this done he lay down on a mattress and wrapped himself up in a quilt which in summer was always of cotton in autumn of wool at the settingin of winter he used both and against very severe cold he protected himself by one of eiderdown of which the part which covered his shoulders was not stuffed with feathers but padded or rather wadded closely with layers of wool long practice had taught him a very dexterous mode of nesting himself as it were in the bedclothes first of all he sat down on the bedside then with an agile motion he vaulted obliquely into his lair next he drew one corner of the bedclothes under his left shoulder and passing it below his back brought it round so as to rest under his right shoulder fourthly by a particular tour dadresse he treated the other corner in the same way and finally contrived to roll it round his whole person thus swathed like a mummy or as i used to tell him selfinvolved like the silkworm in its cocoon he awaited the approach of sleep which generally came on immediately for kants health was exquisite not mere negative health or the absence of pain but a state of positive pleasurable sensation and a genial sense of the entire possession of all his activities accordingly when packed up for the night in the way i have described he would often ejaculate to himself as he used to tell us at dinner is it possible to conceive a human being with more perfect health than myself in fact such was the innocence of his life and such the happy condition of his situation that no uneasy passion ever arose to excite him nor care to harass nor pain to awake him even in the severest winter his sleepingroom was without a fire only in his latter years he yielded so far to the entreaties of his friends as to allow of a very small one all nursing or selfindulgence found no quarter with kant in fact five minutes in the coldest weather sufficed to supersede the first chill of the bed by the diffusion of a general glow over his person if he had any occasion to leave his room in the nighttime for it was always kept dark day and night summer and winter he guided himself by a rope which was duly attached to his bedpost every night and carried into the adjoining apartment kant never perspired footnote this appears less extraordinary considering the description of kants person given originally by reichardt about eight years after his death kant says this writer was drier than dust both in body and mind his person was small and possibly a more meagre arid parched anatomy of a man has not appeared upon this earth the upper part of his face was grand forehead lofty and serene nose elegantly turned eyes brilliant and penetrating but below it expressed powerfully the coarsest sensuality which in him displayed itself by immoderate addiction to eating and drinking this last feature of his temperament is here expressed much too harshly night or day yet it was astonishing how much heat he supported habitually in his study and in fact was not easy if it wanted but one degree of this heat seventyfive degrees of fahrenheit was the invariable temperature of this room in which he chiefly lived and if it fell below that point no matter at what season of the year he had it raised artificially to the usual standard in the heats of summer he went thinly dressed and invariably in silk stockings yet as even this dress could not always secure him against perspiring when engaged in active exercise he had a singular remedy in reserve retiring to some shady place he stood still and motionless with the air and attitude of a person listening or in suspense until his usual aridity was restored even in the most sultry summer night if the slightest trace of perspiration had sullied his nightdress he spoke of it with emphasis as of an accident that perfectly shocked him on this occasion whilst illustrating kants notions of the animal economy it may be as well to add one other particular which is that for fear of obstructing the circulation of the blood he never would wear garters yet as he found it difficult to keep up his stockings without them he had invented for himself a most elaborate substitute which i shall describe in a little pocket somewhat smaller than a watchpocket but occupying pretty nearly the same situation as a watchpocket on each thigh there was placed a small box something like a watchcase but smaller into this box was introduced a watch spring in a wheel round about which wheel was wound an elastic cord for regulating the force of which there was a separate contrivance to the two ends of this cord were attached hooks which hooks were carried through a small aperture in the pockets and so passing down the inner and the outer side of the thigh caught hold of two loops which were fixed on the off side and the near side of each stocking as might be expected so complex an apparatus was liable like the ptolemaic system of the heavens to occasional derangements however by good luck i was able to apply an easy remedy to these disorders which sometimes threatened to disturb the comfort and even the serenity of the great man precisely at five minutes before five oclock winter or summer lampe kants servant who had formerly served in the army marched into his masters room with the air of a sentinel on duty and cried aloud in a military tone mr professor the time is come this summons kant invariably obeyed without one moments delay as a soldier does the word of command never under any circumstances allowing himself a respite not even under the rare accident of having passed a sleepless night as the clock struck five kant was seated at the breakfast table where he drank what he called one cup of tea and no doubt he thought it such but the fact was that in part from his habit of reverie and in part also for the purpose of refreshing its warmth he filled up his cup so often that in general he is supposed to have drunk two three or some unknown number immediately after he smoked a pipe of tobacco the only one which he allowed himself through the entire day but so rapidly that a pile of glowing embers remained unsmoked during this operation he thought over his arrangements for the day as he had done the evening before during the twilight about seven he usually went to his lectureroom and from that he returned to his writingtable precisely at three quarters before one he rose from his chair and called aloud to the cook it has struck three quarters the meaning of which summons was this immediately after taking soup it was his constant practice to swallow what he called a dram which consisted either of hungarian wine of rhenish of a cordial or in default of these of bishop a flask of this was brought up by the cook on the proclamation of the three quarters kant hurried with it to the eatingroom poured out his quantum left it standing in readiness covered however with paper to prevent its becoming vapid and then went back to his study and awaited the arrival of his guests whom to the latest period of his life he never received but in full dress thus we come round again to dinner and the reader has now an accurate picture of the course of kants day the rigid monotony of which was not burthensome to him and probably contributed with the uniformity of his diet and other habits of the same regularity to lengthen his life on this consideration indeed he had come to regard his health and his old age as in a great measure the product of his own exertions he spoke of himself often under the figure of a gymnastic artist who had continued for nearly fourscore years to support his balance upon the slackrope of life without once swerving to the right or to the left in spite of every illness to which his constitutional tendencies had exposed him he still kept his position in life triumphantly however he would sometimes observe sportively that it was really absurd and a sort of insult to the next generation for a man to live so long because he thus interfered with the prospects of younger people this anxious attention to his health accounts for the great interest which he attached to all new discoveries in medicine or to new ways of theorizing on the old ones as a work of great pretension in both classes he set the highest value upon the theory of the scotch physician brown or as it is usually called from the latin name of its author the brunonian theory no sooner had weikard adopted footnote this theory was afterwards greatly modified in germany and judging from the random glances which i throw on these subjects i believe that in this recast it still keeps its ground in that country and made it known in germany than kant became familiar with it he considered it not only as a great step taken for medicine but even for the general interests of man and fancied that in this he saw something analogous to the course which human nature has held in still more important inquiries viz first of all a continual ascent towards the more and more elaborately complex and then a treading back on its own steps towards the simple and elementary dr beddoess essays also for producing by art and curing pulmonary consumption and the method of reich for curing fevers made a powerful impression upon him which however declined as those novelties especially the last began to sink in credit as to dr jenners discovery of vaccination he was less favorably disposed to it he apprehended dangerous consequences from the absorption of a brutal miasma into the human blood or at least into the lymph and at any rate he thought that as a guarantee against the variolous infection it required a much longer probation groundless as all these views were it was exceedingly entertaining to hear the fertility of argument and analogy which he brought forward to support them one of the subjects which occupied him at the latter end of his life was the theory and phenomena of galvanism which however he never satisfactorily mastered augustins book upon this subject was about the last that he read and his copy still retains on the margin his pencilmarks of doubts queries and suggestions the infirmities of age now began to steal upon kant and betrayed themselves in more shapes than one connected with kants prodigious memory for all things that had any intellectual bearings he had from youth labored under an unusual weakness of this faculty in relation to the common affairs of daily life some remarkable instances of this are on record from the period of his childish days and now when his second childhood was commencing this infirmity increased upon him very sensibly one of the first signs was that he began to repeat the same stories more than once on the same day indeed the decay of his memory was too palpable to escape his own notice and to provide against it and secure himself from all apprehension of inflicting tedium upon his guests he began to write a syllabus or list of themes for each days conversation on cards or the covers of letters or any chance scrap of paper but these memoranda accumulated so fast upon him and were so easily lost or not forthcoming at the proper moment that i prevailed on him to substitute a blankpaper book which i had directed to be made and which still remains with some affecting memorials of his own conscious weakness as often happens however in such cases he had a perfect memory for the remote events of his life and could repeat with great readiness and without once stumbling very long passages from german or latin poems especially from the aeneid whilst the very words that had been uttered but a moment before dropped away from his remembrance the past came forward with the distinctness and liveliness of an immediate existence whilst the present faded away into the obscurity of infinite distance another sign of his mental decay was the weakness with which he now began to theorize he accounted for everything by electricity a singular mortality at this time prevailed amongst the cats of vienna basle copenhagen and other places cats being so eminently an electric animal of course he attributed this epizootic to electricity during the same period he persuaded himself that a peculiar configuration of clouds prevailed this he took as a collateral proof of his electrical hypothesis his own headaches too which in all probability were a mere remote effect of old age and a direct one of an inability footnote mr wasianski is quite in the wrong here if the hindrances which nature presented to the act of thinking were now on the increase on the other hand the disposition to think by his own acknowledgment was on the wane the power and the habit altering in proportion there is no case made out of that disturbed equilibrium to which apparently he would attribute the headaches but the fact is that if he had been as well acquainted with kants writings as with kant personally he would have known that some affection of the head of a spasmodic kind was complained of by kant at a time when nobody could suspect him of being in a decaying state to think as easily and as severely as formerly he explained upon the same principle and this was a notion of which his friends were not anxious to disabuse him because as something of the same character of weather and therefore probably the same general tendency of the electric power is found to prevail for whole cycles of years entrance upon another cycle held out to him some prospect of relief a delusion which secured the comforts of hope was the next best thing to an actual remedy and a man who in such circumstances is cured of his delusion cui demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error might reasonably have exclaimed pol me occidistis amici possibly the reader may suppose that in this particular instance of charging his own decays upon the state of the atmosphere kant was actuated by the weakness of vanity or some unwillingness to face the real fact that his powers were decaying but this was not the case he was perfectly aware of his own condition and as early as he said in my presence to a party of his friends gentlemen i am old and weak and childish and you must treat me as a child or perhaps it may be thought that he shrank from the contemplation of death which as apoplexy seemed to be threatened by the pains in his head might have happened any day but neither was this the case he now lived in a continual state of resignation and prepared to meet any dispensation of providence gentlemen said he one day to his guests i do not fear to die i assure you as in the presence of god that if i were this night to be made suddenly aware that i was on the point of being summoned i would raise my hands to heaven fold them and say blessed be god if indeed it were possible that a whisper such as this could reach my ear fourscore years thou hast lived in which time thou hast inflicted much evil upon thy fellowmen the case would be otherwise whosoever has heard kant speak of his own death will bear witness to the tone of earnest sincerity which on such occasions marked his manner and utterance a third sign of his decaying faculties was that he now lost all accurate measure of time one minute nay without exaggeration a much less space of time stretched out in his apprehension of things to a wearisome duration of this i can give one rather amusing instance which was of constant recurrence at the beginning of the last year of his life he fell into a custom of taking immediately after dinner a cup of coffee especially on those days when it happened that i was of his party and such was the importance he attached to this little pleasure that he would even make a memorandum beforehand in the blankpaper book i had given him that on the next day i was to dine with him and consequently that there was to be coffee sometimes it would happen that the interest of conversation carried him past the time at which he felt the craving for it and this i was not sorry to observe as i feared that coffee which he had never been accustomed to footnote how this happened to be the case in germany mr wasianski has not explained perhaps the english merchants at knigsberg being amongst kants oldest and most intimate friends had early familiarized him to the practice of drinking tea and to other english tastes however jachmann tells us p that kant was extravagantly fond of coffee but forced himself to abstain from it under a notion that it was very unwholesome might disturb his rest at night but if this did not happen then commenced a scene of some interest coffee must be brought upon the spot a word he had constantly in his mouth during his latter days in a moment and the expressions of his impatience though from old habit still gentle were so lively and had so much of infantine navet about them that none of us could forbear smiling knowing what would happen i had taken care that all the preparations should be made beforehand the coffee was ground the water was boiling and the very moment the word was given his servant shot in like an arrow and plunged the coffee into the water all that remained therefore was to give it time to boil up but this trifling delay seemed unendurable to kant all consolations were thrown away upon him vary the formula as we might he was never at a loss for a reply if it was said dear professor the coffee will be brought up in a moment will be he would say but theres the rub that it only will be man never is but always to be blest if another cried out the coffee is coming immediately yes he would retort and so is the next hour and by the way its about that length of time that i have waited for it then he would collect himself with a stoical air and say well one can die after all it is but dying and in the next world thank god there is no drinking of coffee and consequently no waiting for it sometimes he would rise from his chair open the door and cry out with a feeble querulousness coffee coffee and when at length he heard the servants step upon the stairs he would turn round to us and as joyfully as ever sailor from the masthead he would call out land land my dear friends i see land this general decline in kants powers active and passive gradually brought about a revolution in his habits of life heretofore as i have already mentioned he went to bed at ten and rose a little before five the latter practice he still observed but not the other in he retired as early as nine and afterwards still earlier he found himself so much refreshed by this addition to his rest that at first he was disposed to utter a euraeka as over some great discovery in the art of restoring exhausted nature but afterwards on pushing it still farther he did not find the success answer his expectations his walks he now limited to a few turns in the kings gardens which were at no great distance from his own house in order to walk more firmly he adopted a peculiar method of stepping he carried his foot to the ground not forward and obliquely but perpendicularly and with a kind of stamp so as to secure a larger basis by setting down the entire sole at once notwithstanding this precaution upon one occasion he fell in the street he was quite unable to raise himself and two young ladies who saw the accident ran to his assistance with his usual graciousness of manner he thanked them fervently for their assistance and presented one of them with a rose which he happened to have in his hand this lady was not personally known to kant but she was greatly delighted with his little present and still keeps the rose as a frail memorial of her transitory interview with the great philosopher this accident as i have reason to think was the cause of his henceforth renouncing exercise altogether all labors even that of reading were now performed slowly and with manifest effort and those which cost him any bodily exertion became very exhausting to him his feet refused to do their office more and more he fell continually both when moving across the room and even when standing still yet he seldom suffered from these falls and he constantly laughed at them maintaining that it was impossible he could hurt himself from the extreme lightness of his person which was indeed by this time the merest skeleton very often especially in the morning he dropped asleep in his chair from pure weariness on these occasions he fell forward upon the floor and lay there unable to raise himself up until accident brought one of his servants or his friends into the room afterwards these falls were prevented by substituting a chair with circular supports that met and clasped in front these unseasonable dozings exposed him to another danger he fell repeatedly whilst reading with his head into the candles a cotton nightcap which he wore was instantly in a blaze and flaming about his head whenever this happened kant behaved with great presence of mind disregarding the pain he seized the blazing cap drew it from his head laid it quietly on the floor and trod out the flames with his feet yet as this last act brought his dressinggown into a dangerous neighborhood to the flames i changed the form of his cap persuaded him to arrange the candles differently and had a decanter of water placed constantly by his side and in this way i applied a remedy to a danger which would else probably have been fatal to him from the sallies of impatience which i have described in the case of the coffee there was reason to fear that with the increasing infirmities of kant would grow up a general waywardness and obstinacy of temper for my own sake therefore and not less for his i now laid down one rule for my future conduct in his house which was that i would on no occasion allow my reverence for him to interfere with the firmest expression of my opinion on subjects relating to his own health and in cases of great importance that i would make no compromise with his particular humors but insist not only on my view of the case but also on the practical adoption of my views or if this were refused me that i would take my departure at once and not be made responsible for the comfort of a person whom i had no power to influence and this behavior on my part it was that won kants confidence for there was nothing which disgusted him so much as any approach to fawning or sycophancy as his imbecility increased he became daily more liable to mental delusions and in particular he fell into many fantastic notions about the conduct of his servants and in consequence into a peevish mode of treating them upon these occasions i generally observed a deep silence but sometimes he would ask me for my opinion and when this happened i did not scruple to say ingenuously then mr professor i think that you are in the wrong you think so he would reply calmly at the same time asking for my reasons which he would listen to with great patience and openness to conviction indeed it was evident that the firmest opposition so long as it rested upon assignable grounds and principles won upon his regard whilst his own nobleness of character still moved him to habitual contempt for timorous and partial acquiescence in his opinions even when his infirmities made him most anxious for such acquiescence earlier in life kant had been little used to contradiction his superb understanding his brilliancy in conversation founded in part upon his ready and sometimes rather caustic wit and in part upon his prodigious command of knowledge the air of noble selfconfidence which the consciousness of these advantages impressed upon his manners and the general knowledge of the severe innocence of his life all combined to give him a station of superiority to others which generally secured him from open contradiction and if it sometimes happened that he met a noisy and intemperate opposition supported by any pretences to wit he usually withdrew himself from that sort of unprofitable altercation with dignity by contriving to give such a turn to the conversation as won the general favor of the company to himself and impressed silence or modesty at least upon the boldest disputant from a person so little familiar with opposition it could scarcely have been anticipated that he should daily surrender his wishes to mine if not without discussion yet always without displeasure so however it was no habit of whatever long standing could be objected to as injurious to his health but he would generally renounce it and he had this excellent custom in such cases that either he would resolutely and at once decide for his own opinion or if he professed to follow his friends he would follow it sincerely and not try it unfairly by trying it imperfectly any plan however trifling which he had once consented to adopt on the suggestion of another was never afterwards defeated or embarrassed by unseasonable interposition from his own humors and thus the very period of his decay drew forth so many fresh expressions of his character in its amiable or noble features as daily increased my affection and reverence for his person having mentioned his servants i shall here take occasion to give some account of his manservant lampe it was a great misfortune for kant in his old age and infirmities that this man also became old and subject to a different sort of infirmities this lampe had originally served in the prussian army on quitting which he entered the service of kant in this situation he had lived about forty years and though always dull and stupid had in the early part of this period discharged his duties with tolerable fidelity but latterly presuming upon his own indispensableness from his perfect knowledge of all the domestic arrangements and upon his masters weakness he had fallen into great irregularities and neglect of his duties kant had been obliged therefore of late to threaten repeatedly that he would discharge him i who knew that kant though one of the kindesthearted men was also one of the firmest foresaw that this discharge once given would be irrevocable for the word of kant was as sacred as other mens oaths consequently upon every opportunity i remonstrated with lampe on the folly of his conduct and his wife joined me on these occasions indeed it was high time that a change should be made in some quarter for it now became dangerous to leave kant who was constantly falling from weakness to the care of an old ruffian who was himself apt to fall from intoxication the fact was that from the moment i undertook the management of kants affairs lampe saw there was an end to his old system of abusing his masters confidence in pecuniary affairs and the other advantages which he took of his helpless situation this made him desperate and he behaved worse and worse until one morning in january kant told me that humiliating as he felt such a confession the fact was that lampe had just treated him in a way which he was ashamed to repeat i was too much shocked to distress him by inquiring into the particulars but the result was that kant now insisted temperately but firmly on lampes dismissal accordingly a new servant of the name of kaufmann was immediately engaged and on the next day lampe was discharged with a handsome pension for life here i must mention a little circumstance which does honor to kants benevolence in his last will on the assumption that lampe would continue with him to his death he had made a very liberal provision for him but upon this new arrangement of the pension which was to take effect immediately it became necessary to revoke that part of his will which he did in a separate codicil that began thus in consequence of the ill behavior of my servant lampe i think fit c but soon after considering that such a record of lampes misconduct might be seriously injurious to his interests he cancelled the passage and expressed it in such a way that no trace remained behind of his just displeasure and his benign nature was gratified with knowing that this one sentence blotted out there remained no other in all his numerous writings published or confidential which spoke the language of anger or could leave any ground for doubting that he died in charity with all the world upon lampes calling to demand a written character he was however a good deal embarrassed his stern reverence for truth being in this instance armed against the first impulses of his kindness long and anxiously he sat with the certificate lying before him debating how he should fill up the blanks i was present but in such a matter i did not take the liberty of suggesting any advice at last he took his pen and filled up the blank as follows has served me long and faithfully for kant was not aware that he had robbed him but did not display those particular qualifications which fitted him for waiting on an old and infirm man like myself this scene of disturbance over which to kant a lover of peace and tranquillity caused a shock that he would gladly have been spared it was fortunate that no other of that nature occurred during the rest of his life kaufmann the successor of lampe turned out to be a respectable and upright man and soon conceived a great attachment to his masters person things now put on a new face in kants family by the removal of one of the belligerents peace was once more restored amongst his servants for hitherto there had been eternal wars between lampe and the cook sometimes it was lampe that carried a war of aggression into the cooks territory of the kitchen sometimes it was the cook that revenged these insults by sallying out upon lampe in the neutral ground of the hall or invaded him even in his own sanctuary of the butlers pantry the uproars were everlasting and thus far it was fortunate for the peace of the philosopher that his hearing had begun to fail by which means he was spared many an exhibition of hateful passions and ruffian violence which annoyed his guests and friends but now all things had changed deep silence reigned in the pantry the kitchen rang no more with martial alarums and the hall was unvexed with skirmish or pursuit yet it may be readily supposed that to kant at the age of seventyeight changes even for the better were not welcome so intense had been the uniformity of his life and habits that the least innovation in the arrangement of articles as trifling as a penknife or a pair of scissors disturbed him and not merely if they were pushed two or three inches out of their customary position but even if they were laid a little awry and as to larger objects such as chairs c any dislocation of their usual arrangement any trans position or addition to their number perfectly confounded him and his eye appeared restlessly to haunt the seat of the mal arrangement until the ancient order was restored with such habits the reader may conceive how distressing it must have been to him at this period of decaying powers to adapt himself to a new servant a new voice a new step c aware of this i had on the day before he entered upon his duties written down for the new servant upon a sheet of paper the entire routine of kants daily life down to the minutest and most trivial circumstances all which he mastered with the greatest rapidity to make sure however we went through a rehearsal of the whole ritual he performing the manoeuvres i looking on and giving the word still i felt uneasy at the idea of his being left entirely to his own discretion on his first debut in good earnest and therefore i made a point of attending on this important day and in the few instances where the new recruit missed the accurate manoeuvre a glance or a nod from me easily made him comprehend his failure one part only there was of the daily ceremonial where all of us were at a loss as it was a part which no mortal eyes had ever witnessed but those of lampe this was breakfast however that we might do all in our power i myself attended at four oclock in the morning the day happened as i remember to be the st of february precisely at five kant made his appearance and nothing could equal his astonishment on finding me in the room fresh from the confusion of dreaming and bewildered alike by the sight of his new servant by lampes absence and by my presence he could with difficulty be made to comprehend the purpose of my visit a friend in need is a friend indeed and we would now have given any money to that learned person who could have instructed us in the arrangement of the breakfast table but this was a mystery revealed to none but lampe at length kant took this task upon himself and apparently all was now settled to his satisfaction yet still it struck me that he was under some embarrassment or constraint upon this i said that with his permission i would take a cup of tea and afterwards smoke a pipe with him he accepted my offer with his usual courteous demeanor but seemed unable to familiarize himself with the novelty of his situation i was at this time sitting directly opposite to him and at last he frankly told me but with the kindest and most apologetic air that he was really under the necessity of begging that i would sit out of his sight for that having sat alone at the breakfast table for considerably more than half a century he could not abruptly adapt his mind to a change in this respect and he found his thoughts very sensibly disturbed i did as he desired the servant retired into an antiroom where he waited within call and kant recovered his wonted composure just the same scene passed over again when i called at the same hour on a fine summer morning some months after henceforth all went right or if occasionally some little mistake occurred kant showed himself very considerate and indulgent and would remark of his own accord that a new servant could not be expected to know all his peculiar ways and humors in one respect indeed this man adapted himself to kants scholarlike taste in a way which lampe was incapable of doing kant was somewhat fastidious in matters of pronunciation and this man had a great facility in catching the true sound of latin words the titles of books and the names or designations of kants friends not one of which accomplishments could lampe the most insufferable of blockheads ever attain to in particular i have been told by kants old friends that for the space of more than thirty years during which he had been in the habit of reading the newspaper published by hartung lampe delivered it with the same identical blunder on every day of publication mr professor here is hartmanns journal upon which kant would reply eh what whats that you say hartmanns journal i tell you it is not hartmann but hartung now repeat it after me not hartmann but hartung then lampe looking sulky and drawing himself up with the stiff air of a soldier on guard and in the very same monotonous tone with which he had been used to sing out his challenge of who goes there would roar not hartmann but hartung now again kant would say on which again lampe roared not hartmann but hartung now a third time cried kant on which for a third time the unhappy lampe would howl out not hartmann but hartung and this whimsical scene of parade duty was continually repeated duly as the day of publication came the irreclaimable old dunce was put through the same manoeuvres which were as invariably followed by the same blunder on the next in spite however of this advantage in the new servant and his general superiority to his predecessor kants nature was too kind and good and too indulgent to all peoples infirmities but his own not to miss the voice and the old familiar face that he had been accustomed to for forty years and i met with what struck me as an affecting instance of kants yearning after his old goodfornothing servant in his memorandumbook other people record what they wish to remember but kant had here recorded what he was to forget mem february the name of lampe must now be remembered no more in the spring of this year i advised kant to take the air it was very long since he had been out of doors footnote wasianski here returns thanks to some unknown person who having observed that kant in his latter walks took pleasure in leaning against a particular wall to view the prospect had caused a seat to be fixed at that point for his use and walking was now out of the question but i thought the motion of a carriage and the air would be likely to revive him on the power of vernal sights and sounds i did not much rely for these had long ceased to affect him of all the changes that spring brings with it there was one only that now interested kant and he longed for it with an eagerness and intensity of expectation that it was almost painful to witness this was the return of a hedge sparrow that sang in his garden and before his window this bird either the same or one of the next generation had sung for years in the same situation and kant grew uneasy when the cold weather lasting longer than usual retarded its return like lord bacon indeed he had a childlike love for birds in general and in particular took pains to encourage the sparrows to build above the windows of his study and when this happened as it often did from the silence which prevailed in his study he watched their proceedings with the delight and the tenderness which others give to a human interest to return to the point i was speaking of kant was at first very unwilling to accede to my proposal of going abroad i shall sink down in the carriage said he and fall together like a heap of old rags but i persisted with a gentle importunity in urging him to the attempt assuring him that we would return immediately if he found the effort too much for him accordingly upon a tolerably warm day of early footnote mr wasianski says late in summer but as he elsewhere describes by the same expression of late in summer a day which was confessedly before the longest day and as the multitude of birds which continued to sing will not allow us to suppose that the summer could be very far advanced i have translated accordingly summer i and an old friend of kants accompanied him to a little place which i rented in the country as we drove through the streets kant was delighted to find that he could sit upright and bear the motion of the carriage and seemed to draw youthful pleasure from the sight of the towers and other public buildings which he had not seen for years we reached the place of our destination in high spirits kant drank a cup of coffee and attempted to smoke a little after this he sat and sunned himself listening with delight to the warbling of birds which congregated in great numbers about this spot he distinguished every bird by its song and called it by its right name after staying about half an hour we set off on our homeward journey kant still cheerful but apparently satiated with his days enjoyment i had on this occasion purposely avoided taking him to any public gardens that i might not disturb his pleasure by exposing him to the distressing gaze of public curiosity however it was known in knigsberg that kant had gone out and accordingly as the carriage moved through the streets which led to his residence there was a general rush from all quarters in that direction and when we turned into the street where the house stood we found it already choked up with people as we slowly drew up to the door a lane was formed in the crowd through which kant was led i and my friend supporting him on our arms looking at the crowd i observed the faces of many persons of rank and distinguished strangers some of whom now saw kant for the first time and many of them for the last as the winter of approached he complained more than ever of an affection of the stomach which no medical man had been able to mitigate or even to explain the winter passed over in a complaining way he was weary of life and longed for the hour of dismission i can be of service to the world no more said he and am a burden to myself often i endeavored to cheer him by the anticipation of excursions that we would make together when summer came again on these he calculated with so much earnestness that he had made a regular scale or classification of them l airings journeys travels and nothing could equal the yearning impatience expressed for the coming of spring and summer not so much for their own peculiar attractions as because they were the seasons for travelling in his memorandumbook he made this note the three summer months are june july and august meaning that they were the three months for travelling and in conversation he expressed the feverish strength of his wishes so plaintively and affectingly that everybody was drawn into powerful sympathy with him and wished for some magical means of antedating the course of the seasons in this winter his bedroom was often warmed this was the room in which he kept his little collection of books of about four hundred and fifty volumes chiefly presentationcopies from the authors it may seem singular that kant who read so extensively should have no larger library but he had less need of one than most scholars having in his earlier years been librarian at the royal library of the castle and since then having enjoyed from the liberality of hartknoch his publisher who in his turn had profited by the liberal terms on which kant had made over to him the copyright of his own works the first sight of every new book that appeared at the close of this winter that is in kant first began to complain of unpleasant dreams sometimes of very terrific ones which awakened him in great agitation oftentimes melodies which he had heard in earliest youth sung in the streets of knigsberg resounded painfully in his ears and dwelt upon them in a way from which no efforts of abstraction could release him these kept him awake to unseasonable hours and often when after long watching he had fallen asleep however deep his sleep might be it was suddenly broken up by terrific dreams which alarmed him beyond description almost every night the bellrope which communicated with a bell in the room above his own where his servant slept was pulled violently and with the utmost agitation no matter how fast the servant might hurry down he was almost always too late and was pretty sure to find his master out of bed and often making his way in terror to some other part of the house the weakness of his feet exposed him to such dreadful falls on these occasions that at length but with much difficulty i persuaded him to let his servant sleep in the same room with himself the morbid affection of the stomach began now to be more and more distressing and he tried various applications which he had formerly been loud in condemning such as a few drops of rum upon a piece of sugar naphtha footnote for kants particular complaint as described by other biographers a quarter of a grain of opium every twelve hours would have been the best remedy perhaps a perfect remedy c but all these were only palliatives for his advanced age precluded the hope of a radical cure his dreadful dreams became continually more appalling single scenes or passages in these dreams were sufficient to compose the whole course of mighty tragedies the impression from which was so profound as to stretch far into his waking hours amongst other phantasmata more shocking and indescribable his dreams constantly represented to him the forms of murderers advancing to his bedside and so agitated was he by the awful trains of phantoms that swept past him nightly that in the first confusion of awaking he generally mistook his servant who was hastening to his assistance for a murderer in the daytime we often conversed upon these shadowy illusions and kant with his usual spirit of stoical contempt for nervous weakness of every sort laughed at them and to fortify his own resolution to contend against them he wrote down in his memorandumbook there must be no yielding to panics of darkness at my suggestion however he now burned a light in his chamber so placed as that the rays might be shaded from his face at first he was very averse to this though gradually he became reconciled to it but that he could bear it at all was to me an expression of the great revolution accomplished by the terrific agency of his dreams heretofore darkness and utter silence were the two pillars on which his sleep rested no step must approach his room and as to light if he saw but a moonbeam penetrating a crevice of the shutters it made him unhappy and in fact the windows of his bedchamber were barricadoed night and day but now darkness was a terror to him and silence an oppression in addition to his lamp therefore he had now a repeater in his room the sound was at first too loud but after muffling the hammer with cloth both the ticking and the striking became companionable sounds to him at this time spring of his appetite began to fail which i thought no good sign many persons insist that kant was in the habit of eating too much for health footnote who these worthy people were that criticised kants eating is not mentioned they could have had no opportunity of exercising their abilities on this question except as hosts guests or fellowguests and in any of those characters a gentleman one would suppose must feel himself degraded by directing his attention to a point of that nature however the merits of the case stand thus between the parlies kant it is agreed by all his biographers ate only once a day for as to his breakfast it was nothing more than a very weak infusion of tea vide jachmanns letters p with no bread or eatable of any kind now his critics by general confession ate their way from morn to dewy eve through the following course of meals breakfast early in the morning breakfast la fourchette about ten am dinner at one or two vesper brod abend brod all which does really seem a very fair allowance for a man who means to lecture upon abstinence at night but i shall cut this matter short by stating one plain fact there were two things and no more for which kant had an inordinate craving during his whole life these were tobacco and coffee and from both these he abstained almost altogether merely under a sense of duty resting probably upon erroneous grounds of the first he allowed himself a very small quantity and everybody knows that temperance is a more difficult virtue than abstinence of the other none at all until the labors of his life were accomplished i however cannot assent to this opinion for he ate but once a day and drank no beer of this liquor i mean the strong black beer he was indeed the most determined enemy if ever a man died prematurely kant would say he has been drinking beer i presume or if another were indisposed you might be sure he would ask but does he drink beer and according to the answer on this point he regulated his anticipations for the patient strong beer in short he uniformly maintained to be a slow poison voltaire by the way had said to a young physician who denounced coffee under the same bad name of a slow poison youre right there my friend however slow it is and horribly slow for i have been drinking it these seventy years and it has not killed me yet but this was an answer which in the case of beer kant would not allow of on the d of april his birthday the last which he lived to see was celebrated in a full assembly of his friends this festival he had long looked forward to with great expectation and delighted even to hear the progress made in the preparations for it but when the day came the overexcitement and tension of expectation seemed to have defeated itself he tried to appear happy but the bustle of a numerous company confounded and distressed him and his spirits were manifestly forced he seemed first to revive to any real sense of pleasure at night when the company had departed and he was undressing in his study he then talked with much pleasure about the presents which as usual would be made to his servants on this occasion for kant was never happy himself unless he saw all around him happy he was a great maker of presents but at the same time he had no toleration for the studied theatrical effect the accompaniment of formal congratulations and the sentimental pathos with which birthday presents are made in germany footnote in this as in many other things the taste of kant was entirely english and roman as on the other hand some eminent englishmen i am sorry to say have on this very point shown the effeminacy and falsetto taste of the germans in particular mr coleridge describing in the friend the custom amongst german children of making presents to their parents on christmas eve a custom which he unaccountably supposes to be peculiar to ratzeburg represents the mother as weeping aloud for joy the old idiot of a father with tears running down his face c c and all for what for a snuffbox a pencilcase or some article of jewellery now we english agree with kant on such maudlin display of stage sentimentality and are prone to suspect that papas tears are the product of rumpunch tenderness let us have by all means and the deepest you can imagine but upon proportionate occasions and with causes fitted to justify it and sustain its dignity in all this his masculine taste gave him a sense of something fade and ludicrous the summer of was now come and visiting kant one day i was thunderstruck to hear him direct me in the most serious tone to provide the funds necessary for an extensive foreign tour i made no opposition but asked his reasons for such a plan he alleged the miserable sensations he had in his stomach which were no longer endurable knowing what power over kant a quotation from a roman poet had always had i simply replied post equitem sedet atra cura and for the present he said no more but the touching and pathetic earnestness with which he was continually ejaculating prayers for warmer weather made it doubtful to me whether his wishes on this point ought not partially at least to be gratified and i therefore proposed to him a little excursion to the cottage we had visited the year before anywhere said he no matter whither provided it be far enough towards the latter end of june therefore we executed this scheme on getting into the carriage the order of the day with kant was distance distance only let us go far enough said he but scarcely had we reached the citygates before the journey seemed already to have lasted too long on reaching the cottage we found coffee waiting for us but he would scarcely allow himself time for drinking it before he ordered the carriage to the door and the journey back seemed insupportably long to him though it was performed in something less than twenty minutes is this never to have an end was his continual exclamation and great was his joy when he found himself once more in his study undressed and in bed and for this night he slept in peace and once again was liberated from the persecution of dreams soon after he began again to talk of journeys of travels in remote countries c and in consequence we repeated our former excursion several times and though the circumstances were pretty nearly the same on every occasion and always terminating in disappointment as to the immediate pleasure anticipated yet undoubtedly they were on the whole salutary to his spirits in particular the cottage itself standing under the shelter of tall alders with a valley stretched beneath it through which a little brook meandered broken by a water fall whose pealing sound dwelt pleasantly on the ear sometimes on a quiet sunny day gave a lively delight to kant and once under accidental circumstances of summer clouds and sunlights the little pastoral landscape suddenly awakened a lively remembrance which had been long laid asleep of a heavenly summer morning in youth which he had passed in a bower upon the banks of a rivulet that ran through the grounds of a dear and early friend gen von lossow the strength of the impression was such that he seemed actually to be living over that morning again thinking as he then thought and conversing with those that were no more his very last excursion was in august of this year not to my cottage but to the garden of a friend but on this day he manifested great impatience it had been arranged that he was to meet an old friend at the gardens and i with two other gentlemen attended him it happened that out party arrived first and such was kants weakness and total loss of power to estimate the duration of time that after waiting a few moments he insisted that some hours had elapsed that his friend could not be expected and went away in great discomposure of mind and so ended kants travelling in this world in the beginning of autumn the sight of his right eye began to fail him the left he had long lost the use of this earliest of his losses by the way he discovered by mere accident and without any previous warning sitting down one day to rest himself in the course of a walk it occurred to him that he would try the comparative strength of his eyes but on taking out a newspaper which he had in his pocket he was surprised to find that with his left eye he could not distinguish a letter in earlier life he had two remarkable affections of the eyes once on returning from a walk he saw objects double for a long space of time and twice he became stoneblind whether these accidents are to be considered as uncommon i leave to the decision of oculists certain it is they gave very little disturbance to kant who until old age had reduced his powers lived in a constant state of stoical preparation for the worst that could befall him i was now shocked to think of the degree in which his burthensome sense of dependence would be aggravated if he should totally lose the power of sight as it was he read and wrote with great difficulty in fact his writing was little better than that which most people can produce as a trial of skill with their eyes shut from old habits of solitary study he had no pleasure in hearing others read to him and he daily distressed me by the pathetic earnestness of his entreaties that i would have a readingglass devised for him whatever my own optical skill could suggest i tried and the best opticians were sent for to bring their glasses and take his directions for altering them but all was to no purpose in this last year of his life kant very unwillingly received the visits of strangers and unless under particular circumstances wholly declined them yet when travellers had come a very great way out of their road to see him i confess that i was at a loss how to conduct myself to have refused too pertinaciously could not but give me the air of wishing to make myself of importance and i must acknowledge that amongst some instances of importunity and coarse expressions of lowbred curiosity i witnessed on the part of many people of rank a most delicate sensibility to the condition of the aged recluse on sending in their cards they would generally accompany them by some message expressive of their unwillingness to gratify their wish to see him at any risk of distressing him the fact was that such visits did distress him much for he felt it a degradation to be exhibited in his helpless state when he was aware of his own incapacity to meet properly the attention that was paid to him some however were admitted footnote to whom it appears that kant would generally reply upon their expressing the pleasure it gave them to see him in me you behold a poor superannuated weak old man according to the circumstances of the case and the state of kants spirits at the moment amongst these i remember that we were particularly pleased with m otto the same who signed the treaty of peace between france and england with the present lord liverpool then lord hawkesbury a young russian also rises to my recollection at this moment from the excessive and i think unaffected enthusiasm which he displayed on being introduced to kant he advanced hastily took both his hands and kissed them kant who from living so much amongst his english friends had a good deal of the english dignified reserve about him and hated anything like scenes appeared to shrink a little from this mode of salutation and was rather embarrassed however the young mans manner i believe was not at all beyond his genuine feelings for next day he called again made some inquiries about kants health was very anxious to know whether his old age were burthensome to him and above all things entreated for some little memorial of the great man to carry away with him by accident the servant had found a small cancelled fragment of the original ms of kants anthropologie this with my sanction he gave to the russian who received it with rapture kissed it and then gave him in return the only dollar he had about him and thinking that not enough actually pulled off his coat and waistcoat and forced them upon the man kant whose native simplicity of character very much indisposed him to sympathy with any extravagances of feeling could not however forbear smiling good humoredly on being made acquainted with this instance of navet and enthusiasm in his young admirer i now come to an event in kants life which ushered in its closing stage on the th of october for the first time since his youth he was seriously ill when a student at the university he had once suffered from an ague which however gave way to pedestrian exercise and in later years he had endured some pain from a contusion on his head but with these two exceptions if they can be considered such he had never properly speaking been ill the cause of his illness was this his appetite had latterly been irregular or rather i should say depraved and he no longer took pleasure in anything but bread and butter and english cheesefootnote mr w here falls into the ordinary mistake of confounding the cause and the occasion and would leave the impression that kant who from his youth up had been a model of temperance died of sensual indulgence the cause of kants death was clearly the general decay of the vital powers and in particular the atony of the digestive organs which must soon have destroyed him under any care or abstinence whatever this was the cause the accidental occasion which made that cause operative on the th of october might or might not be what mr w says but in kants burthensome state of existence it could not be a question of much importance whether his illness were to commence in an october or a november on the th of october at dinner he ate little else in spite of everything that i and another friend then dining with him could urge to dissuade him and for the first time i fancied that he seemed displeased with my importunity as though i were overstepping the just line of my duties he insisted that the cheese never had done him any harm nor would now i had no course left me but to hold my tongue and he did as he pleased the consequence was what might have been anticipated a restless night succeeded by a day of memorable illness the next morning all went on as usual till nine oclock when kant who was then leaning on his sisters arm suddenly fell senseless to the ground a messenger was immediately despatched for me and i hurried down to his house where i found him lying in his bed which had now been removed into his study speechless and insensible i had already summoned his physician but before he arrived nature put forth efforts which brought kant a little to himself in about an hour he opened his eyes and continued to mutter unintelligibly till towards the evening when he rallied a little and began to talk rationally for the first time in his life he was now for a few days confined to his bed and ate nothing on the th october he again took some refreshment and would have had his favorite food but i was now resolved at any risk of his displeasure to oppose him firmly i therefore stated to him the whole consequences of his last indulgence of all which he manifestly had no recollection he listened to what i said very attentively and calmly expressed his conviction that i was perfectly in the wrong but for the present he submitted however some days after i found that he had offered a florin for a little bread and cheese and then a dollar and even more being again refused he complained heavily but gradually he weaned himself from asking for it though at times he betrayed involuntarily how much he desired it on the th of october his usual dinner parties were resumed and he was considered convalescent but it was seldom indeed that he recovered the tone of tranquil spirits which he had preserved until his late attack hitherto he had always loved to prolong this meal the only one he took or as he expressed it in classical phrase coenam ducere but now it was difficult to hurry it over fast enough for his wishes from dinner which terminated about two oclock he went straight to bed and at intervals fell into slumbers from which however he was regularly awoke by phantasmata or terrific dreams at seven in the evening came on duly a period of great agitation which lasted till five or six in the morning sometimes later and he continued through the night alternately to walk about and lie down occasionally tranquil but more often in great distress it now became necessary that somebody should sit up with him his manservant being wearied out with the toils of the day no person seemed to be so proper for this office as his sister both as having long received a very liberal pension from him and also as his nearest relative who would be the best witness to the fact that her illustrious brother had wanted no comforts or attention in his last hours which his situation admitted of accordingly she was applied to and undertook to watch him alternately with his footman a separate table being kept for her and a very handsome addition made to her allowance she turned out to be a quiet gentleminded woman who raised no disturbances amongst the servants and soon won her brothers regard by the modest and retiring style of her manners i may add also by the truly sisterly affection which she displayed towards him to the last the th of october had grievously affected kants faculties but had not wholly destroyed them for short intervals the clouds seemed to roll away that had settled upon his majestic intellect and it shone forth as heretofore during these moments of brief selfpossession his wonted benignity returned to him and he expressed his gratitude for the exertions of those about him and his sense of the trouble they underwent in a very affecting way with regard to his manservant in particular he was very anxious that he should be rewarded by liberal presents and he pressed me earnestly on no account to be parsimonious indeed kant was nothing less than princely in his use of money and there was no occasion on which he was known to express the passion of scorn very powerfully but when he was commenting on mean and penurious acts or habits those who knew him only in the streets fancied that he was not liberal for he steadily refused upon principle to relieve all common beggars but on the other hand he was liberal to the public charitable institutions he secretly assisted his own poor relations in a much ampler way than could reasonably have been expected of him and it now appeared that he had many other deserving pensioners upon his bounty a fact that was utterly unknown to any of us until his increasing blindness and other infirmities devolved the duty of paying these pensions upon myself it must be recollected also that kants whole fortune which amounted to about twenty thousand dollars was the product of his own honorable toils for nearly threescore years and that he had himself suffered all the hardships of poverty in his youth though he never once ran into any mans debt circumstances in his history which as they express how fully he must have been acquainted with the value of money greatly enhance the merit of his munificence in december he became incapable of signing his name his sight indeed had for some time failed him so much that at dinner he could not find his spoon without assistance and when i happened to dine with him i first cut in pieces whatever was on his plate next put it into a spoon and then guided his hand to find the spoon but his inability to sign his name did not arise merely from blindness the fact was that from irretention of memory he could not recollect the letters which composed his name and when they were repeated to him he could not represent the figure of the letters in his imagination at the latter end of november i had remarked that these incapacities were rapidly growing upon him and in consequence i prevailed on him to sign beforehand all the receipts c which would be wanted at the end of the year and afterwards on my representation to prevent all disputes he gave me a regular legal power to sign on his behalf much as kant was now reduced yet he had occasionally moods of social hilarity his birthday was always an agreeable subject to him some weeks before his death i was calculating the time which it still wanted of that anniversary and cheering him with the prospect of the rejoicings which would then take place all your old friends said i will meet together and drink a glass of champagne to your health that said he must be done upon the spot and he was not satisfied till the party was actually assembled he drank a glass of wine with them and with great elevation of spirits celebrated this birthday which he was destined never to see in the latter weeks of his life however a great change took place in the tone of his spirits at his dinnertable where heretofore such a cloudless spirit of joviality had reigned there was now a melancholy silence it disturbed him to see his two dinner companions conversing privately together whilst he himself sat like a mute on the stage with no part to perform yet to have engaged him in the conversation would have been still more distressing for his hearing was now very imperfect the effort to hear was itself painful to him and his expressions even when his thoughts were accurate enough became nearly unintelligible it is remarkable however that at the very lowest point of his depression when he became perfectly incapable of conversing with any rational meaning on the ordinary affairs of life he was still able to answer correctly and distinctly in a degree that was perfectly astonishing upon any question of philosophy or of science especially of physical geography footnote physical geography in opposition to political chemistry or natural history he talked satisfactorily in his very worst state of the gases and stated very accurately different propositions of keplers especially the law of the planetary motions and i remember in particular that upon the very last monday of his life when the extremity of his weakness moved a circle of his friends to tears and he sat amongst us insensible to all we could say to him cowering down or rather i might say collapsing into a shapeless heap upon his chair deaf blind torpid motionless even then i whispered to the others that i would engage that kant should take his part in conversation with propriety and animation this they found it difficult to believe upon which i drew close to his ear and put a question to him about the moors of barbary to the surprise of everybody but myself he immediately gave us a summary account of their habits and customs and told us by the way that in the word algiers the g ought to be pronounced hard as in the english word gear during the last fortnight of kants life he busied himself unceasingly in a way that seemed not merely purposeless but selfcontradictory twenty times in a minute he would unloose and tie his neck handkerchief so also with a sort of belt which he wore about his dressinggown the moment it was clasped he unclasped it with impatience and was then equally impatient to have it clasped again but no description can convey an adequate impression of the weary restlessness with which from morning to night he pursued these labors of sisyphus doing and undoing fretting that he could not do it fretting that he had done it by this time he seldom knew any of us who were about him but took us all for strangers this happened first with his sister then with me and finally with his servant such an alienation distressed me more than any other instance of his decay though i knew that he had not really withdrawn his affection from me yet his air and mode of addressing me gave me constantly that feeling so much the more affecting was it when the sanity of his perceptions and his remembrances returned but these intervals were of slower and slower occurrence in this condition silent or babbling childishly self involved and torpidly abstracted or else busy with selfcreated phantoms and delusions what a contrast did he offer to that kant who had once been the brilliant centre of the most brilliant circles for rank wit or knowledge that prussia afforded a distinguished person from berlin who had called upon him during the preceding summer was greatly shocked at his appearance and said this is not kant that i have seen but the shell of kant how much more would he have said this if he had seen him now now came february which was the last month that kant was destined to see it is remarkable that in the memorandum book which i have before mentioned i found a fragment of an old song inserted by kant and dated in the summer about six months before the time of his death which expressed that february was the month in which people had the least weight to carry for the obvious reason that it was shorter by two and by three days than the others and the concluding sentiment was in a tone of fanciful pathos to this effect oh happy february in which man has least to bear least pain least sorrow least self reproach even of this short month however kant had not twelve entire days to bear for it was on the th that he died and in fact he may be said to have been dying from the st he now barely vegetated though there were still transitory gleams flashing by fits from the embers of his ancient intellect on the d of february the springs of life seemed to be ceasing from their play for from this day strictly speaking he ate nothing more his existence henceforward seemed to be the mere prolongation of an impetus derived from an eighty years life after the moving power of the mechanism was withdrawn his physician visited him every day at a particular hour and it was settled that i should always be there to meet him nine days before his death on paying his usual visit the following little circumstance occurred which affected us both by recalling forcibly to our minds the ineradicable courtesy and goodness of kants nature when the physician was announced i went up to kant and said to him here is dr a kant rose from his chair and offering his hand to the doctor murmured something in which the word posts was frequently repeated but with an air as though he wished to be helped out with the rest of the sentence dr a who thought that by posts he meant the stations for relays of posthorses and therefore that his mind was wandering replied that all the horses were engaged and begged him to compose himself but kant went on with great effort to himself and added many posts heavy posts then much goodness then much gratitude all this he said with apparent incoherence but with great warmth and increasing selfpossession i meantime perfectly divined what it was that kant under his cloud of imbecility wished to say and i interpreted accordingly what the professor wishes to say dr a is this that considering the many and weighty offices which you fill in the city and in the university it argues great goodness on your part to give up so much of your time to him for dr a would never take any fees from kant and that he has the deepest sense of this goodness right said kant earnestly right but he still continued to stand and was nearly sinking to the ground upon which i remarked to the physician that i was so well acquainted with kant that i was satisfied he would not sit down however much he suffered from standing until he knew that his visitors were seated the doctor seemed to doubt this but kant who heard what i said by a prodigious effort confirmed my construction of his conduct and spoke distinctly these words god forbid i should be sunk so low as to forget the offices of humanity when dinner was announced dr a took his leave another guest had now arrived and i was in hopes from the animation which kant had so recently displayed that we should today have a pleasant party but my hopes were vain kant was more than usually exhausted and though he raised a spoon to his mouth he swallowed nothing for some time everything had been tasteless to him and i had endeavored but with little success to stimulate the organs of taste by nutmeg cinnamon c today all failed and i could not even prevail upon him to taste a biscuit rusk or anything of that sort i had once heard him say that several of his friends who had died of marasmus had closed their illness by four or five days of entire freedom from pain but totally without appetite and then slumbered tranquilly away through this state i apprehended that he was himself now passing saturday the th of february i heard his guests loudly expressing their fears that they should never meet him again and i could not but share these fears myself however on sunday the th i dined at his table in company with his particular friend mr r r v kant was still present but so weak that his head drooped upon his knees and he sank down against the right side of the chair i went and arranged his pillows so as to raise and support his head and having done this i said now my dear sir you are again in right order great was our astonishment when he answered clearly and audibly in the roman military phrase yes testudine et facie and immediately after added ready for the enemy and in battle array his powers of mind were if i may be allowed that expression smouldering away in their ashes but every now and then some lambent flame or grand emanation of light shot forth to make it evident that the ancient fire still slumbered below monday the th he was much weaker and more torpid he spoke not a word except on the occasion of my question about the moors as previously stated and sate with sightless eyes lost in himself and manifesting no sense of our presence so that we had the feeling of some mighty shade or phantom from some forgotten century being seated amongst us about this time kant had become much more tranquil and composed in the earlier periods of his illness when his yet unbroken strength was brought into active contest with the first attacks of decay he was apt to be peevish and sometimes spoke roughly or even harshly to his servants this though very opposite to his natural disposition was altogether excusable under the circumstances he could not make himself understood things were therefore brought to him continually which he had not asked for and often it happened that what he really wanted he could not obtain because all his efforts to name it were unintelligible a violent nervous irritation besides affected him from the unsettling of the equilibrium in the different functions of his nature weakness in one organ being made more palpable to him by disproportionate strength in another but now the strife was over the whole system was at length undermined and in rapid and harmonious progress to dissolution and from this time forward no movement of impatience or expression of fretfulness ever escaped him i now visited him three times aday and on tuesday feb th going about dinnertime i found the usual party of friends sitting down alone for kant was in bed this was a new scene in his house and increased our fears that his end was now at hand however having seen him rally so often i would not run the risk of leaving him without a dinnerparty for the next day and accordingly at the customary hour of one we assembled in his house on wednesday feb th i paid my respects to him as cheerfully as possible and ordered dinner to be served up kant sat at the table with us and taking a spoon with a little soup in it put it to his lips but immediately put it down again and retired to bed from which he never rose again except during the few minutes when it was re arranged thursday the th he had sunk into the weakness of a dying person and the corpselike appearance had already taken possession of him i visited him frequently through the day and going at ten oclock at night i found him in a state of insensibility i could not draw any sign from him that he knew me and i left him to the care of his sister and his servant friday the th i went to see him at six oclock in the morning it was very stormy and a deep snow had fallen in the nighttime and by the way i remember that a gang of housebreakers had forced their way through the premises in order to reach kants next neighbor who was a goldsmith as i drew near to his bedside i said good morning he returned my salutation by saying good morning but in so feeble and faltering a voice that it was hardly articulate i was rejoiced to find him sensible and i asked him if he knew me yes he replied and stretching out his hand touched me gently upon the cheek through the rest of the day whenever i visited him he seemed to have relapsed into a state of insensibility saturday the th he lay with fixed and rayless eyes but to all appearance in perfect peace i asked him again on this day if he knew me he was speechless but he turned his face towards me and made signs that i should kiss him deep emotion thrilled me as i stooped down to kiss his pallid lips for i knew that in this solemn act of tenderness he meant to express his thankfulness for our long friendship and to signify his affection and his last farewell i had never seen him confer this mark of his love upon anybody except once and that was a few weeks before his death when he drew his sister to him and kissed her the kiss which he now gave to me was the last memorial that he knew me whatever fluid was now offered to him passed the oesophagus with a rattling sound as often happens with dying people and there were all the signs of death being close at hand i wished to stay with him till all was over and as i had been witness of his life to be witness also of his departure and therefore i never quitted him except when i was called off for a few minutes to attend some private business the whole of this night i spent at his bedside though he had passed the day in a state of insensibility yet in the evening he made intelligible signs that he wished to have his bed put in order he was therefore lifted out in our arms and the bedclothes and pillows being hastily arranged he was carried back again he did not sleep and a spoonful of liquid which was sometimes put to his lips he usually pushed aside but about one oclock in the night he himself made a motion towards the spoon from which i collected that he was thirsty and i gave him a small quantity of wine and water sweetened but the muscles of his mouth had not strength enough to retain it so that to prevent its flowing back he raised his hand to his lips until with a rattling sound it was swallowed he seemed to wish for more and i continued to give him more until he said in a way that i was just able to understand it is enough and these were his last words at intervals he pushed away the bedclothes and exposed his person i constantly restored the clothes to their situation and on one of these occasions i found that the whole body and extremities were already growing cold and the pulse intermitting at a quarter after three oclock on sunday morning february kant stretched himself out as if taking a position for his final act and settled into the precise posture which he preserved to the moment of death the pulse was now no longer perceptible to the touch in his hands feet or neck i tried every part where a pulse beats and found none anywhere but in the left hip where it beat with violence but often intermitted about ten oclock in the forenoon he suffered a remarkable change his eye was rigid and his face and lips became discolored by a cadaverous pallor still such was the effect of his previous habits that no trace appeared of the cold sweat which naturally accompanies the last mortal agony it was near eleven oclock when the moment of dissolution approached his sister was standing at the foot of the bed his sisters son at the head i for the purpose of still observing the fluctuations of the pulse in his hip was kneeling at the bedside and i called his servant to come and witness the death of his good master now began the last agony if to him it could be called an agony where there seemed to be no struggle and precisely at this moment his distinguished friend mr r r v whom i had summoned by a messenger entered the room first of all the breath grew feebler then it missed its regularity of return then it wholly intermitted and the upper lip was slightly convulsed after this there followed one slight respiration or sigh and after that no more but the pulse still beat for a few seconds slower and fainter till it ceased altogether the mechanism stopped the last motion was at an end and exactly at that moment the clock struck eleven soon after his death the head of kant was shaved and under the direction of professor knorr a plaster cast was taken not a masque merely but a cast of the whole bead designed i believe to enrich the craniological collection of dr gall the corpse being laid out and properly attired immense numbers of people of every rank from the highest to the lowest flocked to see it everybody was anxious to make use of the last opportunity he would have for entitling himself to say i too have seen kant this went on for many days during which from morning to night the house was thronged with the public great was the astonishment of all people at the meagreness of kants appearance and it was universally agreed that a corpse so wasted and fleshless had never been beheld his head rested upon the same cushion on which once the gentlemen of the university had presented an address to him and i thought that i could not apply it to a more honorable purpose than by placing it in the coffin as the final pillow of that immortal head upon the style and mode of his funeral kant had expressed his wishes in earlier years in a separate memorandum he there desired that it should take place early in the morning with as little noise and disturbance as possible and attended only by a few of his most intimate friends happening to meet with this memorandum whilst i was engaged at his request in arranging his papers i very frankly gave him my opinion that such an injunction would lay me as the executor of his will under great embarrassments for that circumstances might very probably arise under which it would be next to impossible to carry it into effect upon this kant tore the paper and left the whole to my own discretion the fact was i foresaw that the students of the university would never allow themselves to be robbed of this occasion for expressing their veneration by a public funeral the event showed that i was right for a funeral such as kants one so solemn and so magnificent the city of knigsberg has never witnessed before or since the public journals and separate accounts in pamphlets etc have given so minute an account of its details that i shall here notice only the heads of the ceremony on the th of february at two oclock in the afternoon all the dignitaries of church and state not only those resident in knigsberg but from the remotest parts of prussia assembled in the church of the castle hence they were escorted by the whole body of the university splendidly dressed for the occasion and by many military officers of rank with whom kant had always been a great favorite to the house of the deceased professor from which the corpse was carried by torch light the bells of every church in knigsberg tolling to the cathedral which was lit up by innumerable waxlights a neverending train of many thousand persons followed it on foot in the cathedral after the usual burial rites accompanied with every possible expression of national veneration to the deceased there was a grand musical service most admirably performed at the close of which kants mortal remains were lowered into the academic vault where he now rests among the ancient patriarchs of the university peace be to his dust and everlasting honor end of volume
