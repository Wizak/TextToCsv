 do and dare or a brave boys fight for fortune by horatio alger jr new york chapter i the post office at wayneboro if we could only keep the post office mother we should be all right said herbert carr as he and his mother sat together in the little sitting room of the plain cottage which the two had occupied ever since he was a boy of five yes herbert but i am afraid there wont be much chance of it who would want to take it from you mother men are selfish herbert and there is no office however small that is not sought after what was the income last year inquired herbert mrs carr referred to a blank book lying on the table in which the postoffice accounts were kept and answered three hundred and ninetyeight dollars and fifty cents i shouldnt think that would be much of an inducement to an ablebodied man who could work at any business your father was glad to have it yes mother but he had lost an arm in the war and could not engage in any business that required both hands that is true herbert but i am afraid there will be more than one who will be willing to relieve me of the duties old mrs allen called at the office today and told me she understood that there was a movement on foot to have ebenezer graham appointed squire walsinghams nephew yes it is understood that the squire will throw his influence into the scale and that will probably decide the matter then its very mean of squire walsingham said herbert indignantly he knows that you depend on the office for a living most men are selfish my dear herbert but he was an old schoolfellow of fathers and it was as his substitute that father went to the war where he was wounded true herbert but i am afraid that consideration wont weigh much with john walsingham i have a great mind to go and see him mother have you any objections i have no objections but i am afraid it will do no good mr graham ought to be ashamed with the profits of his store to want the post office also his store alone pays him handsomely mr graham is fond of money he means to be a rich man that is true enough he is about the meanest man in town a few words are needed in explanation though the conversation explains itself pretty well herberts father returning from the war with the loss of an arm was fortunate enough to receive the appointment of postmaster and thus earn a small but with strict economy adequate income until a fever terminated his earthly career at middle age mr graham was a rival applicant for the office but mr carrs services in the war were thought to give him superior claims and he secured it during the month that had elapsed since his death mrs carr had carried on the post office under a temporary appointment she was a woman of good business capacity and already familiar with the duties of the office having assisted her husband especially during his sickness when nearly the whole work devolved upon her most of the village people were in favor of having her retained but the local influence of squire walsingham and his nephew was so great that a petition in favor of the latter secured numerous signatures and was already on file at the department in washington and backed by the congressman of the district who was a political friend of the squire mrs carr was not aware that the movement for her displacement had gone so far it was already nine oclock when herberts conversation with his mother ended and he resolved to defer his call upon squire walsingham till the next morning about nine oclock in the forenoon our young hero rang the bell of the village magnate and with but little delay was ushered into his presence squire walsingham was a tall portly man of fifty sleek and evidently on excellent terms with himself indeed he was but five years older than his nephew ebenezer graham and looked the younger of the two despite the relationship if he had been a united states senator he could not have been more dignified in his deportment or esteemed himself of greater consequence he was a selfish man but he was free from the mean traits that characterized his nephew you are the carr boy said the squire pompously looking over his spectacles at herbert as he entered the door my name is herbert carr said herbert shortly you have known me all my life certainly said the squire a little ruffled at the failure of his grand manner to impose upon his young visitor did i not call you the carr boy herbert did not fancy being called the carr boy but he was there to ask a favor and he thought it prudent not to show his dissatisfaction he resolved to come to the point at once i have called squire walsingham he commenced to ask if you will use your influence to have my mother retained in charge of the post office ahem said the squire somewhat embarrassed i am not in charge of the postoffice department no sir i am aware of that but the postmaster general will be influenced by the recommendations of people in the village very true said the squire complacently very true and very proper i do not pretend to say that my recommendation would not weigh with the authorities at washington indeed the member from our district is a personal friend of mine you know how we are situated continued herbert who thought it best to state his case as briefly as possible father was unable to save anything and we have no money ahead if mother can keep the post office we shall get along nicely but if she loses it we shall have a hard time i am surprised that in your fathers long tenure of office he did not save something said the squire in a tone which indicated not only surprise but reproof there was not much chance to save on a salary of four hundred dollars a year said herbert soberly after supporting a family of three ahem said the squire sagely where theres a will theres a way improvidence is the great fault of the lower classes we dont belong to the lower classes said herbert flushing with indignation squire walmsgham was secretly ambitious of representing his district some day in congress and he felt that he had made a mistake it wont do for an aspirant to office to speak of the lower classes and the squire hastened to repair his error that was not the term i intended to imply he condescended to explain i meant to say that improvidence is the prevailing fault of those whose income is small we havent had much chance to be improvident said herbert we have had to spend all our income but we are not in debt that is we have no debts that we are unable to pay that is well said squire walsingham but my young constituent i mean my young friend i apprehend that you do not take a right view of public office it is not designed to support a privileged class in luxury luxury on four hundred a year replied herbert i am speaking in general terms said the squire hastily i mean to say that i cannot recommend a person to office simply because he or she needs the income no sir i know that but my mother understands the duties of the office and no complaint has been made that she does not make a good postmaster possibly said the squire noncommittally but i am opposed upon principle to conferring offices upon women men are more efficient and better qualified to discharge responsible duties then sir said herbert his heart sinking i am to understand that you do not favor the appointment of my mother i should be glad to hear that your mother was doing well said the squire but i cannot conscientiously favor the appointment of a woman to be postmaster of wayneboro that means that he prefers the appointment should go to his nephew thought herbert if my mother were not competent to discharge the duties he said his face showing his disappointment in spite of himself i would not ask your influence notwithstanding you were a schoolmate of fathers and he lost his arm while acting as your substitute i have already said that i wish your mother well said the squire coloring and in any other way i am ready to help her and you indeed i may be able to secure you a situation where sir mr graham needs a boy in his store and i think he will take you on my recommendation is tom tripp going away asked herbert the tripp boy is unsatisfactory so mr graham tells me herbert knew something of what it would be to be employed by mr graham tom tripp worked early and late for a dollar and a half per week without board for a hard and suspicious taskmaster who was continually finding fault with him but for sheer necessity he would have left mr grahams store long ago he had confided the unpleasantness of his position to herbert more than once and enlisted his sympathy and indignation herbert felt that he would not like to work for mr graham at any price more especially as it seemed likely that the storekeeper was likely to deprive his mother of her office and income i should not like to work for mr graham sir he said it appears to me that you are very particular young man said squire walsingham i would be willing to work for you sir but not for him ahem said the squire somewhat mollified i will think of your case herbert left the house feeling that his mothers removal was only a matter of time chapter ii herberts chance herbert left the house of squire walsingham in a sober frame of mind he saw clearly that his mother would not long remain in office and without her official income they would find it hard to get along to be sure she received a pension of eight dollars a month in consideration of her husbands services in the war but eight dollars would not go far towards supporting their family small as it was there were other means of earning a living to be sure but wayneboro was an agricultural town mainly and unless he hired out on a farm there seemed no way open to him while the little sewing his mother might be able to procure would probably pay her less than a dollar a week the blow fell sooner than he expected in the course of the next week mrs carr was notified that ebenezer graham had been appointed her successor and she was directed to turn over the papers and property of the office to him she received the official notification by the afternoon mail and in the evening she was favored by a call from her successor ebenezer graham was a small man with insignificant meanlooking features including a pair of weazellike eyes and a turnup nose it did not require a skillful physiognomist to read his character in his face meanness was stamped upon it in unmistakable characters goodevening mr graham said the widow gravely goodevening maam said the storekeeper ive called to see you mrs carr about the post office i presume you have heard i have heard that you are to be my successor just so as long as your husband was alive i didnt want to step into his shoes but you are willing to step into mine said mrs carr smiling faintly just so that is the govment appear to think a man ought to be in charge of so responsible a position i shall be glad if you manage the office better than i have done you see maam it stands to reason that a man is better fitted for business than a woman said ebenezer graham in a smooth tone for he wanted to get over this rather awkward business as easily as possible women you know was made to adorn the domestic circles et cetery adorning the domestic circle wont give me a living said mrs carr with some bitterness for she knew that but for the grasping spirit of the man before her she would have been allowed to retain her office i was comin to that said the new postmaster of course i appreciate your position as a widder without much means and im going to make you an offer that is your boy herbert herbert looked up from a book he was reading and listened with interest to hear the benevolent intentions of the new postmaster i am ready to give him a place in my store proceeded ebenezer i always keep a boy and thinks i to myself the wages i give will help along the widder carr you see i like to combine business with consideration for my feller creeters mrs carr smiled faintly for in spite of her serious strait she could not help being amused at the notion of ebenezer grahams philanthropy whats going to become of tom tripp asked herbert abruptly thomas tripp isnt exactly the kind of boy i want in my store said mr graham hes a harumscarum sort of boy and likes to shirk his work then i suspect he stops to play on the way when i send him on errands yesterday he was five minutes longer than he need to have been in goin to sam dunnings to carry some groceries thomas doesnt seem to appreciate his privileges in bein connected with a business like mine tom tripp was hardly to blame for not recognizing his good luck in occupying a position where he received a dollar and a half a week for fourteen hours daily work with half a dozen scoldings thrown in how do you know i will suit you any better than tom asked herbert who did not think it necessary to thank mr graham for the proffered engagement until he learned just what was expected of him and what his pay was to be youre a different sort of a boy said ebenezer with an attempt at a pleasant smile youve been brought up different ive heard youre a smart capable boy that isnt afraid of work no sir i am not if i am fairly paid for my work the new postmasters jaw fell and he looked uneasy for he always grudged the money he paid out even the paltry dollar and a half which went to poor tom i always calkerlate to pay fair wages he said but i aint rich and i cant afford to fling away money how much do you pay tom tripp asked herbert he knew but he wanted to draw mr graham out i pay thomas a dollar and fifty cents a week answered the storekeeper in a tone which indicated that he regarded this on the whole as rather a munificent sum and he works from seven in the morning till nine oclock at night proceeded herbert them are the hours said ebenezer who knew better how to make money than to speak grammatically it makes a pretty long day observed mrs carr so it does maam but its no longer than i work myself you get paid rather better i presume of course maam as i am the proprietor i couldnt think of working for any such sum said herbert decidedly mr graham looked disturbed for he had reasons for desiring to secure herbert who was familiar with the routine of postoffice work well he said i might be able to offer you a leetle more as you know how to tend the post office thats worth somethin ill give you lemme see twentyfive cents more that is a dollar and seventyfive cents a week herbert and his mother exchanged glances they hardly knew whether to feel more amused or disgusted at their visitors meanness mr graham said herbert if you wish to secure my services you will have to pay me three dollars a week the storekeeper held up both hands in dismay three dollars a week for a boy he exclaimed yes sir i will come for a short time for that sum till you get used to the management of the post office but i shall feel justified in leaving you when i can do better you must think i am made of money said ebenezer hastily i think you can afford to pay me that salary for twenty minutes the new postmaster tried to beat down his prospective clerk but herbert was obstinate and ebenezer rather ruefully promised to give him his price chiefly because it was absolutely necessary that he should engage some one who was more familiar with the postoffice work than he was herbert agreed to go to work the next morning chapter iii a prodigal son herbert did not look forward with very joyful anticipations to the new engagement he had formed he knew very well that he should not like ebenezer graham as an employer but it was necessary that he should earn something for the income was now but two dollars a week he was sorry too to displace tom tripp but upon this point his uneasiness was soon removed for tom dropped in just after mr graham had left the house and informed herbert that he was to go to work the next day for a farmer in the neighborhood at a dollar and a half per week and board besides i am glad to hear it tom said herbert heartily i didnt want to feel that i was depriving you of employment you are welcome to my place in the store said tom im glad to give it up mr graham seemed to think i was made of iron and i could work like a machine without getting tired i hope he pays you more than a dollar and a half a week he has agreed to pay me three dollars said herbert tom whistled in genuine amazement what has the old man lost his senses he exclaimed he must be crazy to offer such wages as that he didnt offer them i told him i wouldnt come for less i dont see how he came to pay such a price because he wanted me to take care of the post office i know all about it and he doesnt as soon as he learns he will reduce your wages then i shall leave him well i hope youll like store work better than i do the next two or three days were spent in removing the post office to one corner of ebenezer grahams store the removal was superintended by herbert who was not interfered with to any extent by his employer nor required to do much work in the store our hero was agreeably surprised and began to think he should get along better than he anticipated at the end of the first week the storekeeper while they were closing the shutters said i expect herbert youd just as lieves take your pay in groceries and goods from the store no sir answered herbert i prefer to be paid in money and to pay for such goods as we buy i dont see what odds it makes to you said ebenezer it comes to the same thing doesnt it then if it comes to the same thing retorted herbert why do you want to pay me in goods ahem it saves trouble ill just charge everything you buy and give you the balance saturday night i should prefer the money mr graham said herbert firmly so the storekeeper considerably against his will drew three dollars in bills from the drawer and handed them to his young clerk its a good deal of money herbert he said for a boy there aint many men would pay you such a good salary i earn every cent of it mr graham said herbert whose views on the salary question differed essentially from those of his employer the next morning mr graham received a letter which evidently disturbed him before referring to its contents it is necessary to explain that he had one son nineteen years of age who had gone to boston two years previous to take a place in a drygoods store on washington street ebenezer graham jr or eben as he was generally called was in some respects like his father he had the same features and was quite as mean so far as others were concerned but willing to spend money for his own selfish pleasures he was fond of playing pool and cards and had contracted a dangerous fondness for whisky which consumed all the money he could spare from necessary expenses and even more so that as will presently appear he failed to meet his board bills regularly eben had served an apprenticeship in his fathers store having been in fact tom tripps predecessor he tired of his fathers strict discipline and the small pay out of which he was required to purchase his clothes and went to boston to seek a wider sphere to do eben justice it must be admitted that he had good business capacity and if he had been able like his father to exercise selfdenial and make moneygetting his chief enjoyment he would no doubt have become a rich man in time as it was whenever he could make his companions pay for his pleasures he did so i now come to the letter which had brought disquietude to the storekeeper it ran thus dear sir i understand that you are the father of mr eben graham who has been a boarder at my house for the last six months i regret to trouble you but he is now owing me six weeks board and i cannot get a cent out of him though he knows i am a poor widow dependent on my board money for my rent and house expenses as he is a minor the law makes you responsible for his bills and though i dislike to trouble you i am obliged in justice to myself to ask you to settle his board bill which i inclose you will do me a great favor if you will send me the amount thirty dollars within a week as my rent is coming due yours respectfully susan jones the feelings of a man like ebenezer graham can be imagined when he read this unpleasant missive thirty dollars he groaned what can the graceless boy be thinking of to fool away his money and leave his bills to be settled by me if this keeps on i shall be ruined its too bad when i am slaving here for eben to waste my substance on riotous living ive a great mind to disown him let him go his own way and fetch up in the poorhouse if he chooses but it is not easy for a man to cast off an only son even though he is as poorly supplied with natural affections as ebenezer graham besides ebens mother interceded for him and the father in bitterness of spirit was about to mail a registered letter to mrs jones when the cause of his anguish suddenly made his appearance in the store how are you father he said nonchalantly taking a cigar from his mouth didnt expect to see me did you what brings you here eben asked mr graham uneasily well the cars brought me to stockton and ive walked the rest of the way ive heard of you said his father frowning i got a letter last night from mrs jones she said she was going to write said eben shrugging his shoulders how came it said his father his voice trembling with anger that you havent paid your board bill for six weeks i didnt have the money said eben with a composure which was positively aggravating to his father and why didnt you have the money your wages are ample to pay all your expenses it costs more money to live in boston than you think for father dont you get ten dollars a week sir at your age i got only seven and saved two dollars a week you didnt live in boston father i didnt smoke cigars said his father angrily as he fixed his eye on the one his son was smoking how much did you pay for that miserable weed youre mistaken father its a very good article i paid eight dollars a hundred eight dollars a hundred gasped mr graham no wonder you cant pay your board bill i cant afford to spend my money on cigars oh yes you can father if you choose why youre a rich man a rich man repeated mr graham nervously it would take a rich man to pay your bills but you havent told me why you have come home i lost my situation father some meddlesome fellow told my employer that i occasionally played a game of pool and my tailor came to the store and dunned me so old boggs gave me a long lecture and my walking papers and here i am ebenezer graham was sorely troubled and though he isnt a favorite of mine i confess that in this matter he has my sincere sympathy chapter iv herbert loses his place ebenezer graham with some difficulty ascertained from eben that he had other bills amounting in the aggregate to fortyseven dollars this added to the board bill made a total of seventyseven dollars mr grahams face elongated perceptibly that is bad enough he said but you have lost your income also and that makes matters worse isnt there a chance of the firm taking you back no sir replied the prodigal you see we had a flare up and i expressed my opinion of them pretty plainly they wouldnt take me back if id come for nothing and they wont give you a recommendation either said ebenezer with a half groan no sir i should say not so you have ruined your prospects so far as boston is concerned said his father bitterly may i ask how you expect to get along i have a plan said eben with cheerful confidence what is it i would like to go to california if i cant get any situation in san francisco i can go to the mines very fine upon my word said his father sarcastically and how do you propose to get to california i can go either by steamer across the isthmus or over the union pacific road that isnt what i mean where are you to get the money to pay your fare with i suppose you will supply that said eben you do well it strikes me you have some assurance ejaculated mr graham you expect me to advance hundreds of dollars made by working early and late to support a spendthrift son ill pay you back as soon as i am able said eben a little abashed no doubt youd pay me in the same way you pay your board bills said ebenezer who may be excused for the sneer i can invest my money to better advantage than upon you then if you will not do that said eben sullenly i will leave you to suggest a plan there is only one plan i can think of eben go back to your old place in the store i will dismiss the carr boy and you can attend to the post office and do the store work what go back to tending a country grocery after being a salesman in a city store exclaimed eben disdainfully yes it seems the only thing you have left its your own fault that you are not still a salesman in the city eben took the cigar from his mouth and thought rapidly well he said after a pause if i agree to do this what will you pay me what will i pay you yes will you pay me ten dollars a week the same as i got at hanbury deanes ten dollars a week ejaculated ebenezer i dont get any more than that myself i guess theres a little mistake in your calculations father said eben significantly if you dont make at least forty dollars a week including the post office then i am mistaken so you are ridiculously mistaken said his father sharply what you presume is entirely out of the question you forget that you will be getting your board and tom tripp only received a dollar and a half a week without board is that all you pay to herbert carr i pay him a leetle more admitted ebenezer what will you give me ill give you your board and clothes said ebenezer and that seems to be more than you made in boston are you in earnest asked eben in genuine dismay certainly it isnt a bad offer either do you suppose a young man like me can get along without money you ought to get along without money for the next two years after the sums youve wasted in boston it will cripple me to pay your bills and the storekeeper groaned at the thought of the inroads the payment would make on his bank account youre poorer than i thought if seventyfive dollars will cripple you said eben who knew his fathers circumstances too well to be moved by this representation i shall be in the poorhouse before many years if i undertake to pay all your bills eben after all this was not perhaps an exaggeration for a spendthrift son can get through a great deal of money i cant get along without money father said eben decidedly how can i buy cigars let alone other things i dont want you to smoke cigars youll be a great deal better off without them said his father sharply i understand its necessary to my health said eben rather absurdly you wont smoke at my expense said ebenezer decidedly i dont smoke myself and i never knew any good come of it all the same i must have some money what will people say about a young man of my age not having a cent in his pocket they think my father is very mean ill allow you fifty cents a week said mr graham after a pause that wont do you seem to think i am only six or seven years old finally after considerable haggling mr graham agreed to pay his son a dollar and a half a week in cash besides board and clothes he reflected that he should be obliged to board and clothe his son at any rate and should save a dollar and a half from herberts wages well he said when will you be ready to go to work i must have a few days to loaf father i have been hard at work for a long time and need some rest then you can begin next monday morning ill get herbert to show you how to prepare the mail so that you wont have any trouble about the postoffice work by the way father how do you happen to have the post office i thought mrs carr was to carry it on so she did for a time but a woman aint fit for a public position of that kind so i applied for the position and got it whats mrs carr going to do shes got her pension said ebenezer shortly eight dollars a month isnt it yes that aint much to support a family shell have to do something else then i suppose there isnt much to do in wayneboro that isnt my lookout she can take in sewing or washing suggested ebenezer who did not trouble himself much about the care of his neighbors besides theres herbert he can earn something but im to take his place oh well i aint under any obligations to provide them a livin ive got enough to take care of myself and my family youd better have let her keep the post office said eben he was not less selfish than his father but then his own interests were not concerned he would not have scrupled in his fathers case to do precisely the same its lucky ive got a little extra income said ebenezer bitterly now ive got your bills to pay i suppose i shall have to accept your offer father said eben for the present but i hope youll think better of my california plan after a while why theres a fellow i know went out there last year went up to the mines and now hes worth five thousand dollars then he must be a very different sort of a person from you retorted his father sagaciously you would never succeed there if you cant in boston ive never had a chance to try grumbled eben there was sound sense in what his father said failure at home is very likely to be followed by failure away from home there have been cases that seemed to disprove my assertion but in such cases failure has only been changed into success by earnest work i say to my young readers therefore never give up a certainty at home to tempt the chances of success in a distant state unless you are prepared for disappointment when the engagement had been made with eben mr graham called herbert to his presence herbert said he i wont need you after saturday night my son is going into the store and will do all i require you can tell him how to prepare the mails et cetery very well sir answered herbert it was not wholly a surprise but it was a disappointment for he did not know how he could make three dollars a week in any other way unless he left wayneboro chapter v ebens scheme saturday night came and with it the end of herberts engagement in the post office he pocketed the three dollars which his employer grudgingly gave him and set out on his way home wait a minute herbert said eben ill walk with you herbert didnt care much for ebens company but he was too polite to say so he waited therefore till eben appeared with hat and cane im sorry to cut you out of your place herbert said the young man thank you answered herbert it isnt my fault for i dont want to go into the store proceeded eben a fellow thats stood behind the counter in a city store is fit for something better but its the old mans fault herbert made no comment and eben proceeded yes said he its the old mans fault hes awfully stingy you know that yourself herbert did know it but thought it would not be in good taste to say so i suppose wayneboro is rather dull for you after living in the city he remarked i should say so this village is a dull hole and yet father expects me to stay here cooped up in a little country store i wont stay here long you may be sure of that where will you go i dont know yet i want to go to california but i cant unless the old man comes down with the requisite amount of tin youll soon have your situation back again i wont stand in your way im not very particular about going back said herbert but i must find something to do just so said eben the place will do well enough for a boy like you but i am a young man and entitled to look higher by the way ive got something in view that may bring me in five thousand dollars within a month herbert stared at his companion in surprise not knowing any short cut to wealth do you mean it he asked incredulously yes said eben i suppose you dont care to tell what it is oh i dont mind its a lottery oh said herbert in a tone of disappointment yes answered eben you may think lotteries are a fraud and all that but i know a man in boston who drew last month a prize of fifteen thousand dollars the ticket only cost him a dollar what do you say to that such cases cant be very common said herbert who had a good share of common sense not so uncommon as you think returned eben nodding i dont mean to say that many draw prizes as large as that but there are other prizes of five thousand dollars and one thousand and so on it would be very comfortable to draw a prize of even five hundred wouldnt it now herbert admitted that it would id send for a ticket by monday mornings mail continued eben if i wasnt so hard up the old mans mad because i ran into debt and he wont give me a cent will you do me a favor what is it asked herbert cautiously lend me two dollars youve got it i know because you were paid off tonight i would send for two tickets and agree to give you quarter of what i draw isnt that fair it may be said herbert but i havent any money to lend you have three dollars in your pocket at this moment yes but it isnt mine i must hand it to mother and give up the chance of winning a prize ill promise to give you half of whatever i draw besides paying back the money thank you but i cant spare the money you are getting as miserly as the old man said eben with a forced laugh eben said herbert seriously you dont seem to understand our position mother has lost the post office and has but eight dollars a month income ive earned three dollars this week but next week i may earn nothing you see i cant afford to spend money for lottery tickets suppose by your caution you lose five hundred dollars nothing risk nothing gain i have no money to risk said herbert firmly oh well do as you please said eben evidently disappointed i thought id make you the offer because i should like to see you win a big prize thank you for your friendly intention said herbert but i am afraid there are a good many more blanks than prizes if there were not it wouldnt pay the lottery men to carry on the business this was common sense and i cannot forbear at this point to press it upon the attention of my young reader of all schemes of gaining wealth about the most foolish is spending money for lottery tickets it has been estimated by a sagacious writer that there is about as much likelihood of drawing a large prize in a lottery as of being struck by lightning and that let us hope is very small i guess i wont go any farther said eben abruptly having become convinced that herbert could not be prevailed upon to lend him money goodnight then said herbert goodnight well mother im out of work said herbert as he entered the little sitting room and threw down his weeks wages our young hero was of a cheerful temperament but he looked and felt sober when he said this but for the grahams we should have a comfortable living the boy proceeded first the father took away the post office from you and now the son has robbed me of my place dont be discouraged herbert said his mother god will find us a way out of our troubles herbert had been trained to have a reverence for religion and had faith in the providential care of his heavenly father and his mothers words recalled his cheerfulness you are right mother he said more hopefully i was feeling lowspirited tonight but i wont feel so any more i dont see how we are to live but i wont let it trouble me tonight let us do our part and leave the rest to god said mrs carr he wont support us in idleness but i am sure that in some way relief will come if we are ready to help ourselves god helps them that help themselves repeated herbert exactly so tomorrow is sunday and we wont let any worldly anxieties spoil that day for us when monday comes we will think over what is best to be done the next day herbert and his mother attended church in neat apparel and those who saw their cheerful faces were not likely to guess the serious condition of their affairs they were not in debt to be sure but unless employment came soon they were likely to be ere long for they had barely enough money ahead to last them two weeks monday morning came and brought its burden of care i wish there was a factory in wayneboro said herbert i am told that boys of my age sometimes earn six or seven dollars a week i have heard so here there seems nothing except working on a farm and the farmers expect boys to take their pay principally in board that is a consideration but if possible i hope we shall not be separated at meals i will try other things first said herbert how would you like some fish for dinner mother my time isnt of any particular value and i might as well go fishing do so herbert it will save our buying meat which indeed we can hardly afford to do herbert felt that anything was better than idleness so he took his pole from the shed and after digging a supply of bait set out for the banks of the river half a mile away through a grassy lane leading from the main street he walked down to the river with the pole on his shoulder he was not destined to solitude for under a tree whose branches hung over the river sat a young man perhaps twentyfive years of age with a book in his hand chapter vi herberts good luck goodmorning said the young man pleasantly goodmorning answered herbert politely he recognized the young man though he had never seen him before as a visitor from the city who was boarding at the hotel if the village tavern could be so designated he seemed to be a studious young man for he always had a book in his hand he had a pleasant face but was pale and slender and was evidently in poor health i see you are going to try your luck at fishing said the young man yes sir i have nothing else to do and that brings me here i too have nothing else to do but i judge from your appearance that you have not the same reason for being idle what is that sir poor health no sir i have never been troubled in that way you are fortunate health is a blessing not to be overestimated it is better than money i suppose it is sir but at present i think i should value a little money are you in want of it asked the young man earnestly yes sir i have just lost my place in the post office i think i have seen you in the post office yes sir my mother had charge of the office till two weeks since when it was transferred to mr graham he employed me to attend to the duties and serve the customers in the store till saturday night when i was succeeded by his son who had just returned from the city your mother is a widow is she not yes sir i know where you live i have had it pointed out to me your father served in the war did he not yes sir and the injuries he received hastened his death the young man looked thoughtful then he said how much did mr graham pay you for your services three dollars a week that was not excuse the question all you and your mother had to depend upon was it not quite mother receives a pension of eight dollars per month five dollars a week altogether that is very little it is only two dollars now sir true but you have health and strength and those will bring money in one respect you are more fortunate than i you have a mother i have neither father nor mother im sorry for you sir thank you anyone is to be pitied who has lost his parents now as i have asked about your affairs it is only fair that i should tell you about myself to begin with i am rich dont look envious for there is something to counterbalance i am of feeble constitution and the doctors say that my lungs are affected i have studied law but the state of my health has obliged me to give up for the present at least the practice of my profession but if you are rich you do not need to practice said herbert who may be excused for still thinking his companions lot a happy one no i do not need to practice my profession so far as the earning of money is concerned but i want something to occupy my mind the doctors say i ought to take considerable outdoor exercise but i suppose my physical condition makes me indolent for my chief exercise has been thus far to wander to the banks of the river and read under the trees that isnt very severe exercise said herbert smiling no still it keeps me out in the open air and that is something now tell me what are your plans my hope is to find something to do that will enable me to help mother but there doesnt seem much chance of finding anything in wayneboro do you think i could get a place in the city you might but even if you did you would find it difficult to earn your own living and there would be no chance of your helping your mother herbert though naturally sanguine and hopeful looked sober just then he had a bite and drew out a goodsized pickerel this gave a new direction to his thoughts and he exclaimed triumphantly look at this pickerel he must weigh over two pounds all of that said the young man rising and examining the fish with interest let me use your pole and see what luck i have certainly the young man some ten minutes later succeeded in catching a smaller pickerel perhaps half the size of herberts that will do for me he said though it doesnt come up to your catch for two hours herbert and his friend alternately used the pole and the result was quite a handsome lot of fish you have more fish than you want said the young man you had better bring what you dont want to the hotel i heard the landlord say he would like to buy some that would suit me said herbert if he wants fish i want money come along with me then really i dont know when i have passed a forenoon so pleasantly usually i get tired of my own company and the day seems long to me i believe i see my way clear to a better way of spending my time you say you want a place how would you like me for an employer i am sure i should like you but you are not in any business no said the young man smiling or rather my business is the pursuit of health and pleasure just now in that i think you can help me i shall be very glad to if i can mr my name is george melville let me explain my idea to you i want your company to relieve my solitude in your company i shall have enterprise enough to go hunting and fishing and follow out in good faith my doctors directions what do you say herbert smiled i would like that better than being in the post office he said it would seem like being paid for having a good time how much would you consider your services worth asked mr melville i am content to leave that to you said herbert suppose we say six dollars a week then six dollars a week exclaimed herbert amazed isnt that enough asked melville smiling it is more than i can earn mr graham thought he was overpaying me with three dollars a week you will find me a different man from mr graham herbert i am aware that six dollars is larger pay than is generally given to boys of your age but i can afford to pay it and i have no doubt you will find the money useful it will quite set us on our feet again mr melville said herbert earnestly you are very generous oh you dont know what a hard taskmaster you may find me said the young man playfully by the way i consider that you have already entered upon your duties today is the first day now come to the hotel with me and see what you can get for the fish i happen to know that two of the guests a lady and her daughter are anxious for a good fish dinner and as there is no market here i think the landlord will be glad to buy from you mr melville was right mr barton the landlord purchased the fish that herbert had to sell for sixty cents which he promptly paid dont that pay you for your mornings work asked melville i dont know but the money ought to go to you mr melville said herbert as i am now in your employ besides you caught a part of them i waive all claim to compensation said the young man though it would be a novel sensation to receive money for services rendered what will you say herbert when i tell you that i never earned a dollar in my life herbert looked incredulous it is really true said george melville my life has been passed at school and college and i have never had occasion to work for money you are in luck then i dont know that i think those who work for the money they receive are happy tell me now dont you feel more satisfaction in the sixty cents you have just been paid because you have earned it yes sir i thought so the happiest men are those who are usefully employed dont forget that and never sigh for the opportunity to lead an idle life but i suppose your dinner is ready you may go home and come back at three oclock very well sir herbert made good time going home he was eager to tell his mother the good news of his engagement chapter vii eben grows envious well mother said herbert as he entered the house i have brought you enough fish for dinner i waited to see what luck you would have herbert and therefore have not got dinner ready you will have to wait a little while i shall be all the hungrier mother said herbert mrs carr could not help noticing the beaming look on her soms face you look as if you had received a legacy herbert she said herbert laughed there it is he said displaying the sixty cents he had received from the landlord there are ten cents more than i should have received for a whole days work at the store he said where did you get it herbert i sold a mess of fish to mr barton of the hotel you must have had good luck in fishing said his mother looking pleased i had help mother mr melville the young man from the city who boards at the hotel helped me fish well herbert you have made a good beginning i couldnt help feeling a little depressed when you left me this morning reflecting that we had but my pension to depend upon it seemed so unlucky that eben graham should have come home just at this time to deprive you of your place in the store it was a piece of good luck for me mother i dont see how said mrs carr naturally puzzled because i have a better situation already then herbert who had been saving the best news for the last told his mother of his engagement as mr melvilles companion and the handsome compensation he was to receive six dollars a week repeated his mother that is indeed generous herbert we did well to trust in providence yes mother and we have not trusted in vain after dinner herbert did some chores for his mother and then went to the hotel to meet his new employer he found him occupying a large and pleasant room on the second floor the table near the window was covered with books and there were some thirty or forty volumes arranged on shelves i always bring books with me herbert said the young man i am very fond of reading and hitherto i have occupied too much time perhaps in that way too much because it has interfered with necessary exercise hereafter i shall devote my forenoon to some kind of outdoor exercise in your company and in the afternoon you can read to me or we can converse shall i read to you now mr melville asked herbert yes here is a recent magazine i will select an article for you to read it will rest my eyes and besides it is pleasanter to have a companion than to read ones self the article was one that interested herbert as well as mr melville and he was surprised when he had finished to find that it was nearly five oclock didnt the reading tire you herbert asked melville no sir not at all it is evident that your lungs are stronger than mine at five oclock melville dismissed his young companion do you wish me to come this evening asked herbert oh no i wouldnt think of taking up your evenings at the post office i had to stay till eight oclock probably it was necessary there i wont task you so much when shall i come tomorrow at nine oclock that isnt very early said herbert smiling no i dont get up very early my health wont allow me to cultivate early rising i shall not be through breakfast much before nine i see you dont mean to overwork me mr melville no for it would involve overworking myself i shall certainly have an easy time thought herbert as he walked homeward he reflected with satisfaction that he was being paid at the rate of a dollar a day which was quite beyond anything he had ever before earned indeed today he had earned sixty cents besides the sum received for the fish after supper herbert went to the store to purchase some articles for his mother he was waited on by mr graham in person as the articles called for would amount to nearly one dollar the storekeeper said cautiously of course you are prepared to pay cash certainly sir returned herbert i mentioned it because i knew your income was small said ebenezer apologetically it is more than it was last week said herbert rather enjoying the prospect of surprising the storekeeper why you aint found anything to do have you asked mr graham his face indicating curiosity yes sir i am engaged as companion by mr melville who is staying at the hotel i dont know what he wants of a companion said the storekeeper with that disposition to criticise the affairs of his neighbors often found in country places he thinks he needs one answered herbert and how much does he pay you now queried ebenezer six dollars a week you dont mean it ejaculated the storekeeper why the man must be crazy i dont think he is said herbert smiling got plenty of money i take it continued ebenezer who had a good share of curiosity yes he tells me he is rich how much money has he got he didnt tell me that well i declare youre lucky thats a fact there was an interested listener to this conversation in the person of eben who had been in the store all day taking herberts place as we know the position by no means suited the young man he had been employed in a store in boston and to come back to a small country grocery might certainly be considered a descent besides the small compensation allowed him was far from satisfying eben he was even more dissatisfied when he learned how fortunate herbert was to be selected as a companion by a rich young man was just what he would have liked himself and he flattered himself that he should make a more desirable companion than a mere boy like herbert as our hero was leaving the store eben called him back what was that you were telling father about going round with a young man from the city he asked herbert repeated it and he pays you six dollars a week asked eben enviously yes of course i shouldnt have asked so much but he fixed the price himself you think he is very rich said eben thoughtfully yes i think so what a splendid chance it would be for me thought eben if i could get intimate with a man like that he might set me up in business some day perhaps take me to europe or round the world how much of the time do you expect to be with this mr melville he asked herbert answered the question does he seem like a man easy to get along with very much so eben inwardly decided that if he could he would oust herbert from his desirable place and substitute himself it was a very mean thought but eben inherited meanness from his father herbert he said will you do me a favor what is it asked our hero will you take my place in the store this evening i am not feeling well and want to take a walk yes answered herbert as soon as i have run home to tell mother where i am thats a good fellow you shant lose anything by it ill give you ten cents you neednt pay me anything eben ill do it as a favor youre a trump herbert come back as soon as you can when eben was released from the store he went over to the hotel and inquired for mr melville leaving his unsuspecting young substitute in the post office chapter viii ebens assurance a young man wishes to see you mr melville said the servant george melville looked up in some surprise from his book and said you may show him up it must be herbert he thought but when the door was opened and the visitor shown in mr melville found it was an older person than herbert eben for it was he distorted his mean features into what he regarded as a pleasant smile and without waiting to receive a welcome came forward with extended hand i believe you are mr melville he said inquiringly yes that is my name said melville looking puzzled i dont remember you have i met you before you saw me in fathers store very likely said eben i am eben graham son of ebenezer graham the postmaster indeed that accounts for your face looking familiar you resemble your father very closely im a chip off the old block with modern improvements said eben smirking fathers always lived in the country and he aint very stylish ive been employed in boston for a couple of years past and got a little city polish you dont show much of it thought melville but he refrained from saying so so you have come home to assist your father he said politely well no not exactly answered eben i feel that a country store isnt my sphere then you propose to go back to the city probably i shall do so eventually but i may stay here in wayneboro a while if i can make satisfactory arrangements i assure you that it was not my wish to take herbert carrs place herbert told me that you had assumed his duties it is only ad interim i assure you it is only ad interim i am quite ready to give back the place to herbert who is better suited to it than i i wonder what the fellow is driving at thought melville eben did not long leave him in doubt herbert tells me that he has made an engagement with you continued eben desiring to come to his business as soon as possible yes we have made a mutual arrangement of course it is very nice for him and so i told him i think i am quite as much a gainer by it as he is said melville herbert was right he is easily suited said eben to himself of course eben added clearing his throat herbert isnt so much of a companion to you as if he were a few years older i dont know that it seems to me that he is a very pleasant companion young as he is to be sure herbert is a nice boy and father was glad to help him along by giving him a place with a larger salary than he ever paid before what is he driving at thought melville to come to the point mr melville said eben i have made bold to call upon you to suggest a little difference in your arrangements indeed said melville coldly though he had no idea what his singular visitor was about to propose it struck him emphatically that eben was interfering in an unwarrantable manner with his affairs you see continued eben im a good deal nearer your age than herbert and ive had the advantage of residing in the city which herbert hasnt and naturally should be more company to you then again herbert could do the work in the post office and store which i am doing nearly as well as i can ill undertake to get father to give him back his place and then i shall be happy to make an arrangement with you to go hunting and fishing or anything else that you choose i am sure i should enjoy your company mr melville concluded eben rubbing his hands complacently and surveying george melville with an insinuating smile you have certainly taken considerable trouble to arrange this matter for me said melville with a sarcasm which eben did not detect oh no trouble at all said eben cheerfully you see the idea came into my head when herbert told me of his arrangements with you and i thought id come and see you about it did you mention it to herbert asked george melville with some curiosity well no i didnt i didnt know how herbert would look at it i got herbert to take my place in the store while i ran over to see you about the matter by the way though i am some years older than herbert i shant ask more than you pay him in fact i am willing to leave the pay to your liberality you are very considerate said melville hardly knowing whether to be amused or provoked by the cool assurance of his visitor oh not at all returned eben complacently i guess ive fetched him he reflected looking at mr melville through his small halfclosed eyes you have certainly surprised me very much mr graham said melville by the nature of your suggestion i wont take into consideration the question whether you have thought more of your own pleasure or mine so far as the latter is concerned you have made a mistake in supposing that herberts youth is any drawback to his qualification as a companion indeed his youth and cheerful temperament make him more attractive in my eyes i hope mr graham you will excuse me for saying that he suits me better than you possibly could ebens countenance fell and he looked quite discomfited and mortified i didnt suppose a raw country boy would be likely to suit a gentleman of taste who has resided in the city he said with asperity then you will have a chance to correct your impression said melville with a slight smile then you dont care to accept my offer said eben regretfully thank you no if you will excuse me for suggesting it mr graham it would have been more considerate for you to have apprised herbert of your object in asking him to take your place this evening probably he had no idea that you meant to supersede him with me eben tossed his head you mustnt think mr melville he said that i was after the extra pay six dollars doesnt seem much to me i was earning ten dollars a week in boston and if i had stayed should probably have been raised to twelve so that you were really consenting to a sacrifice in offering to enter my employment at six dollars a week just so then i am all the more convinced that i have decided for the best in retaining herbert i do not wish to interfere with your prospects in the city oh as for that said eben judging that he had gone too far i dont care to go back to the city just yet ive been confined pretty steadily and a few weeks in the country hunting and fishing will do me good george melville bowed but said nothing eben felt that he had no excuse for staying longer and reluctantly rose if you should think better of what ive proposed he said you can let me know i will do so said melville hes rather a queer young man muttered eben as he descended the stairs its funny that he should prefer a country boy like herbert to a young man like me whos seen life and got some city polish at the same price too he dont seem to see his own interest im sorry for it would have been a good deal more interesting to me going round with him a few hours a day than tending store for father theres one thing sure i wont do it long im fitted for a higher position than that i hope for downright impudence and cool assurance i think that young man will bear off the palm thought george melville as his unwelcome visitor left the room herbert is in no danger from him it would probably surprise him if he knew that i should consider his company as an intolerable bore i will tell herbert tomorrow the good turn his friend has tried to do him chapter ix the solitary farmhouse if eben had been sensitive the cool reception which he met with at the hands of mr melville would have disturbed him as it was he felt angry and disappointed and desirous of coming up with herbert as he expressed it though it was hard to see in what way the boy had injured him it did not seem quite clear at present how he was to punish herbert but he only waited for an occasion when herbert learned the next morning from mr melville in what manner eben had tried to undermine him and deprive him of his situation he was naturally indignant i didnt think eben graham could be so mean he exclaimed it was certainly a mean thing to do herbert said george melville but you can afford to treat young graham with contempt as he has been unable to do you any injury what shall we do this morning mr melville asked herbert i should like a row on the river said melville do you know of any boat we can have walter ingalls has a boat i think we can hire that do you know him yes sir then you may go and ascertain whether we can have it or i will go with you to avoid loss of time the boat was readily loaned and the two were soon on the river mr melville first took the oars but he was quickly fatigued and resigned them to herbert who was strong and muscular for his age as his companion observed his strong and steady strokes he said herbert i am disposed to envy you your strength and endurance i get tired very easily were you not strong when a boy asked herbert i never had much endurance my mother had a feeble constitution and was consumptive and i inherit something of her weakness it is fortunate that you have money mr melville so that you are not obliged to work true but i would give half my fortune to be strong and well herbert noticed the hectic flush upon mr melvilles cheeks and his white transparent hands and his sympathy was aroused i see he said thoughtfully that i am more fortunate than i thought in my health and strength they are blessings not to be overestimated herbert however my lot is on the whole a happy one even though my life will probably be brief and i have still many sources of satisfaction and enjoyment the river led away from the village flowing between wooded banks with here and there a cottage set in the midst of the fields lying back in the stern melville enjoyed their tranquil passage when their attention was suddenly attracted by a boy who stood on the bank frantically waving his hat melville was the first to see him what can that boy want he asked herbert immediately looked around and exclaimed in surprise its tom tripp row to shore and see what he wants said melville quickly they were already near and in a brief space of time they touched the bank whats the matter tom theres a tramp in the house stealing all he can lay hands on answered tom in excitement what house farmer coles mr cole was the farmer for whom tom tripp was working tom explained that the farmer was gone to the village leaving his wife alone a tramp had come to the door and asked for a meal while mrs cole was getting something for him the visitor looked about him and finding that there was no man about boldly demanded money after unceremoniously possessing himself of the silver spoons is he armed asked melville i dont know i dont think so does he know that you have gone for help no he did not see me i came from the fields and saw him through the window mrs cole thinks i am in the field and there is no help near physical courage and physical strength do not always go together and a weak man often excels a strong man in bravery george melville was thoroughly roused for injustice or brutality he had a hearty contempt and he was not one to stand by and see a ruffian triumph come herbert he said let us go to the help of this poor woman with all my heart answered herbert his eyes flashing before describing the appearance of herbert and george melville upon the scene i will go back a few minutes and relate what happened at the farmhouse mrs cole was engaged in ironing when she heard a knock at the door answering the summons she found herself confronted by an illlooking fellow whose dusty and travelsoiled garments revealed the character of the wearer what is it you wish asked the farmers wife im hungry said the tramp can you give me something to eat yes answered mrs cole cheerfully for the good woman could not find it in her heart to turn away a fellow creature suffering from hunger we have enough and to spare come in and sit down at the table the visitor followed her into the kitchen and took a seat at the table while the farmers wife went to the pantry and brought out half a loaf of bread and a plate of cold meat the tramp was not long in attacking it but after a few mouthfuls laid down his knife and fork wheres the coffee he asked i have no warm coffee she answered dont you drink coffee in the morning yes but breakfast was over two or three hours since shall i get you a glass of water havent you any cider it seems to me you are particular said mrs cole growing indignant all the same i want some cider said the tramp impudently i have no cider answered mrs cole shortly a pretty farmhouse this is without cider growled the tramp you can make me some coffee then who are you to order me round in my own house demanded mrs cole angrily one would think you took this for a hotel i take it for what i please said the tramp if my husband were here you wouldnt dare to talk to me like this it was an unguarded admission made on the impulse of the moment and mrs cole felt its imprudence as soon as she had uttered the words but it was too late to recall them where is your husband asked the tramp his face lighting up with a gleam of exultation near by answered mrs cole evasively but her visitor saw that this was not correct how much money have you in the house he demanded abruptly money gasped the farmers wife turning pale yes money didnt i speak plain enough asked the tramp angrily are you a thief then dont you dare to call me a thief said the tramp menacingly then if you are an honest man why do you ask that question because i am going to borrow what money you have borrow yes said the man with a grin ill hand it back when i come around again under ordinary circumstances there would not have been money enough in the farmhouse to be anxious about but it so happened that farmer cole had sold a yoke of oxen and the money received a hundred dollars was upstairs in a bureau drawer the thought of this though she didnt suppose the tramp to be aware of it was enough to terrify mrs cole and she sank back in the chair in a panic of course the tramp inferred that there was a considerable sum in the house come hurry up he said roughly i cant wait here all day where do you keep the money it is my husbands said mrs cole terrified out of all prudence all right ill pay it back to him while youre about it you may collect all the spoons too im going to open a boarding house he continued with a chuckle and i shall need them oh heavens what shall i do ejaculated the frightened woman chapter x an exciting scene youd better go upstairs and get that money or i will go up myself said the tramp boldly i will go said mrs cole terrified it was at this time that tom tripp looking in at the window got an idea of the situation but he was unobserved the river bank was near and he ran down to it hoping but not expecting to see some one who could interfere with the impudent robber we have already seen that he was luckier than he anticipated meanwhile mrs cole went upstairs not knowing how to save the money from being carried away she wished heartily that her husband had taken it with him one hundred dollars as she well knew would be a serious loss to her husband who was only moderately well to do she thought it possible that the tramp might know how large a sum there was in the house but could not be sure she resolved however to make an effort to save the larger part of the money from the wallet she took two fivedollar bills and then removing it from the drawer put it between the beds she lingered as long as she dared and then went downstairs with the two bills in her hand well have you got the money growled the tramp dont take it she said be satisfied with the breakfast i have given you youre a fool said the tramp rudely how much have you got there ten dollars ten dollars said the tramp disdainfully what do you take me for it is a large sum of money to me and my husband sir said the poor woman nervously it isnt enough for me you have got more money in the house dont lie to me you know you have i am not used to be talked to in that way said mrs cole forgetting her timidity for the moment i cant help what you are used to youd better not trifle with me go upstairs and bring down the rest of the money do you hear oh sir oh sir repeated the tramp impatiently i cant stay here all day are you going to do as i tell you i suppose i must said the poor woman thats sensible youll find out after a while that nothing is to be gained by trying to fool me ill give you just three minutes to find that money and bring it down youll leave the spoons then no i want them as ive already told you come two minutes are passed i dont want to kill you but mrs cole uttered a shriek of dismay and turned to obey the command of her unwelcome visitor when a loud clear voice was heard from just outside the window stay where you are mrs cole there is help at hand this ruffian shall not harm you it was the voice of george melville the tramp turned swiftly and stared in illdisguised dismay at melville and herbert what business is it of yours he demanded in a blustering tone we make it our business to defend this lady from your thievish designs said melville you exclaimed the tramp contemptuously why i could twist either of you round my little finger youd better not try it said melville not showing the least trepidation mrs cole has this man anything of yours in his possession he has my spoons and i have just handed him ten dollars george melville turned to the tramp be kind enough to lay the spoons on the table he said and give back the ten dollars mrs cole handed you you must think im a fool said the tramp no but i think you are a prudent man if you do as i say we will let you go if not well if not blustered the tramp if not you may regret it all this time george melville had spoken in his usual tone of voice and the tramp was puzzled to know whether he had any weapon with him for himself he was unarmed and this made him feel rather ill at ease notwithstanding his superiority in physical strength he was rather disposed to think that george melville had a pistol for he could not understand how otherwise he should dare to confront a man of twice his size and strength i dont care for the spoons he said but i will take the money no you will return the money said melville calmly who will make me demanded the tramp defiantly i will well see about that said the tramp desperately and he sprang towards melville who had in the meantime entered the house and stood only six feet distant stay where you are exclaimed melville resolutely and he drew a pistol which he leveled at his formidable antagonist that settles it stranger said the tramp youve got the advantage of me this time just wait till we meet again i am willing to wait for some time said melville shrugging his shoulders i have no desire to cultivate your acquaintance my friend there are the spoons said the tramp throwing them down on the table now for the money the tramp looked at george melville melville still held the pistol in his hand leveled at his breast the thief was a large man but he was not a brave one he cowered before the resolute glance of his small opponent wont you interfere with me if i give back the money he asked no will you let me go without firing at me yes perhaps you wont keep your agreement suggested the tramp nervously i am a man of my word said melville calmly his calm resolute tone free from all excitement impressed the tramp with confidence he drew the notes from his vest pocket where he had thrust them and threw them on the table now may i go he said in answer george melville who stood between him and the door drew aside still however holding the pistol in position and the tramp passed out not sorry it may be said to get out of range of the weapon they watched him striding through the yard and when he was fairly gone mrs cole said oh how can i thank you for saving me from this wretch i am glad to have been the instrument of deliverance said melville politely it was fortunate you had the pistol with you mr melville said herbert well yes perhaps it was said melville smiling pray put it up mr melville said the farmers wife it always makes me nervous to see a loaded pistol melville bowed and put back the pistol in his pocket as your unpleasant visitor has gone he said i may as well relieve your fears by saying that the pistol is not loaded not loaded exclaimed herbert and tom tripp in concert no it has not been loaded to my knowledge for a year then how could you stand up against that man asked the farmers wife in wonder he thought it was loaded replied melville and that answered the purpose i should be very reluctant to use a loaded pistol for i have a high idea of the sacredness of human life but i have no objection to playing upon the fears of a man like that melville and herbert remained at the farmhouse for half an hour till the return of the farmer when they resumed their river trip they returned about noon when they were walking through the main street herbert saw the town constable approaching with the air of a man who had business with him did you wish to speak to me mr bruce he asked yes herbert i have a warrant for your arrest for my arrest exclaimed herbert in amazement what for on complaint of eben graham for abstracting postage stamps and money from the post office last evening chapter xi tried for theft herbert stared at the constable in blank amazement i am charged with stealing stamps and money from the post office he said yes who makes the charge demanded herbert in great excitement eben graham i dont know what it means said our hero turning to george melville it means said melville that the fellow is envious of you and angry because he cannot supersede you with me he evidently wants to do you an injury it must be so but i did not imagine that eben could be so mean mr bruce do you believe that i am a thief no i dont herbert said the constable and it was very much against my will that i started out to arrest you you may be sure when do you want me to go with you asked herbert you will go before justice slocum at two oclock is it necessary for me to go to the lockup asked herbert shrinking with natural repugnance from entering the temporary house of tramps and law breakers no herbert answered the constable in a friendly tone ill take it upon myself to let you go home to dinner i will call for you at quarter of two of course i shall find you ready to accompany me yes mr bruce i am impatient to meet eben graham and tell him to his face that he has been guilty of a mean and contemptible falsehood in charging me with theft not a person in the village who knows me will believe it i will also call at your house herbert said george melville and accompany you to the office of the justice i shall ask leave to give the details of eben grahams visit to me last evening thank you mr melville said herbert i am glad you do not believe a word of this story i am not so easily deceived herbert it is quite possible that stamps and money have been stolen but if so it is your false friend and accuser who is guilty of course herbert had to tell his mother what had happened she was agitated and alarmed but became calmer when herbert told her what was ebens probable motive in making the charge how can he behave so shamefully exclaimed the indignant parent i didnt think him capable of it myself mother although i had a poor opinion of him suppose that you cant prove that you are innocent herbert said mrs carr anxiously it is for him to prove that i am guilty mother answered herbert who knew this much of law at a quarter of two constable bruce and mr melville walked to the house together the door was opened for them by herbert himself so you havent taken leg bail herbert said the constable jocosely no mr bruce i am on hand i am in a hurry to meet mr eben graham and see whether he can look me in the face after his shameful behavior oh mr bruce i never thought you would call at my home on such an errand said mrs carr on the point of breaking down dont worry mrs carr said the constable anybody may be charged with theft however innocent your son has good friends who wont see him treated with injustice herberts mother was desirous of accompanying them to the office of the justice but was persuaded to remain behind herbert knew that in her indignation she would not be able to be silent when she saw eben graham justice slocum was an elderly man with a mild face and gray hair when herbert entered he greeted him in a friendly way i am sorry to see you here my boy he said but i am sure there is some mistake i have known you ever since you were a baby and i dont believe you are guilty of theft now i submit judge slocum said eben graham who sat in a corner his mean features looking meaner and more insignificant than usual i submit that you are prejudging the case silence sir said judge slocum warmly how dare you impugn my conduct though herbert were my own son i would give you a chance to prove him guilty i hope youll excuse me judge said eben cringing i am as sorry as you are to believe the boy guilty of stealing do your worst and say your worst eben graham said herbert contemptuously but be very careful that you do not swear falsely i dont need any instructions from you herbert carr considering that you are a criminal on trial said eben maliciously you are mistaken sir said george melville to be under arrest does not make a man or boy a criminal i am sure i am much obliged for the information mr melville said eben spitefully youve chosen a nice companion there you are right said melville gravely i have done much better than if i had hired you eben winced but did not reply george melville whispered to herbert are you willing to accept me as your lawyer i am not much of one to be sure but this case is very simple i am very grateful for your offer and accept it said herbert i do not propose to record the whole scene in detail but only to give a general idea of the proceedings eben graham was sworn as a witness and deposed that he had left herbert in charge of the post office the previous evening on his return he examined the stamps and contents of the money drawer and found to his surprise that five dollars in money and six dollars worth of stamps were missing how did you know they were missing asked melville because i knew precisely how much money was in the drawer and how many stamps were there then you counted them just before you went out yes sir that was rather a singular time to make the count was it not i dont know that it was sir i should suppose the end of the day would be a more appropriate time i dont think so answered eben shortly were you led to make the count because you suspected herberts honesty asked mr melville that was the very reason i did it said eben with a malicious glance at herbert isnt it a little curious that you should have selected a boy whose honesty you doubted to fill your place asked george melville carelessly there wasnt anybody else he knew all about postoffice work answered eben very good now mr graham if you have no objection will you tell why you wanted to get away from the post office last evening eben fidgeted for he saw what was coming and it made him nervous i wanted a little rest he answered after a pause where did you go why do you ask me that question asked eben moving about uneasily because i desire an answer you know where i went returned eben sullenly yes but i wish you to tell me answer the question witness said the judge briefly i went to the hotel replied eben evasively on whom did you call on you answered eben reluctantly we have come to it at last now what was your business with me to tell you that herbert would not suit you as a companion said the witness who thought this answer rather a clever one whom did you recommend in his place pursued the questioner relentlessly eben hesitated but his cleverness came again to his aid i told you that i would be willing to come just to oblige you he said did herbert know that you were going to make this proposal no you asked him then to remain in the post office while you absented yourself with a view of depriving him of the position he had just secured in my employ i would have got father to take him again in the store and post office said eben defending himself from the implied charge of treachery yes you told me so eben nodded triumphantly even melville had to admit that he was not treating herbert meanly by the way said melville isnt it rather strange that you should have been ready to recommend in your place a boy whose honesty you doubted i didnt know he was a thief said eben somewhat abashed no but you suspected his honesty that was your reason for counting the money and stamps before you left the office at least that is the reason you have given he had been in the office before i was there said eben uneasily while he was there were any stamps missing was he suspected of taking any stamps or money not that i know of now mr graham what answer did i make to your application what application to take you into my employ instead of herbert you wanted to keep him said the witness sullenly precisely having failed then in your application you went home and discovered that some money and stamps had been stolen yes sir i was very much surprised that will do sir your discovery was remarkably welltimed herbert having obtained the position you sought you straightway discovered proof of his dishonesty eben colored for the insinuation was plain enough for even him to understand the two things had nothing to do with each other he said that may be but i call the attention of the judge to a very remarkable coincidence have the missing stamps or money been found on the person of the defendant he hasnt been searched i will take it upon me to say that he is ready to submit to an examination said melville herbert said emphatically i am oh it isnt likely youd find anything now said eben with a sneer why not he has had plenty of time to put em away i am willing to have my mothers house searched said herbert promptly oh they aint there said eben significantly where are they then ebens answer took herbert and his lawyer and the judge himself by surprise chapter xii ebens trump card i guess theyre a part of them inside this letter he said as he spoke he produced a letter stamped and sealed but not postmarked the letter was addressed messrs jones fitch chestnut street philadelphia what makes you think this letter contains money or postage stamps mr graham asked george melville because ive seen an advertisement of jones fitch in one of the weekly papers they advertise to send several articles to any address on receipt of seventyfive cents in postage stamps very well what inference do you draw from this dont you see answered eben in malicious triumph thats where part of the stamps went this letter was put into the post office by herbert carr this morning that is not true said herbert quietly maybe it isnt but i guess youll find herbert carrs name signed to the letter said eben have you seen the inside of the letter mr graham no sir then how do you know herbert carrs name is signed to it i dont know but i am pretty sure it is you think herbert carr wrote the letter yes sir if there is no objection said melville i will settle the matter by opening it thats what i want you to do said eben graham and i also said herbert mr melville deliberately cut open one end of the envelope with a small penknife and drew out the folded sheet which it contained as he did so a small sheet of postage stamps fell upon the floor there do you see that said eben in triumph the sheet of stamps contained twentyfive threecent stamps representing in value seventyfive cents shall i read the letter sir asked melville of the judge if there is no objection melville read it aloud as follows wayneboro august lst messrs jones fitch i inclose seventyfive cents in stamps and will be glad to have you send me the articles you advertise in the weekly gazette yours truly herbert carr herbert listened to the reading of this letter in amazement i never wrote that letter he said and i never heard of jones fitch before thats a likely story sneered eben graham i submit to judge slocum that i have proved my case i havent found out when all the stamps left but i have shown where some are one who will steal seventyfive cents worth of stamps will steal six dollars worth i agree with you there mr graham said george melville will you be kind enough to sit down at that table and write to my dictation what should i do that for asked eben suspiciously never mind surely you can have no objection well no i dont know as i have though i think its all foolishness he sat down and a pen was handed him what shall i write he asked write messrs jones fitch what for demanded eben looking discomposed thats my affair write eben wrote the words but he seemed to find some difficulty in doing so it was clear that he was trying to disguise his handwriting what next he asked i inclose seventyfive cents in stamps proceeded george melville do you want to throw suspicion on me asked eben throwing down the pen keep on writing said the judge eben did so but was very deliberate about it and seemed very particular as to how he penned his letter very well said melville now i wish herbert carr to take the pen and i will dictate the same letter herbert readily took the seat just vacated by eben and rapidly wrote the words dictated to him when he had finished his task mr melville took the two copies and first examining them himself handed them together with the original letter to justice slocum i have only to ask your honor he said to compare these three notes and decide for yourself whether the original was written by herbert carr or mr eben graham the witness against him eben graham looked very ill at ease flushing and paling by turns while the examination was going on i submit he said that this is a very extraordinary way of treating a witness justice slocum after a pause said i find that mr eben grahams copy is unmistakably in the same handwriting as the original letter purporting to be written by herbert carr its not so faltered eben then said george melville triumphantly as it seems clear that my young client is the victim of a base conspiracy engineered by the man who has brought this charge of dishonesty against him i have only to ask that he be honorably discharged the request is granted said justice slocum herbert you can go it is clear that you are innocent of the charge made against you i protest began eben graham as for you mr graham said the justice severely i have no words to express my scorn and detestation of your conduct in deliberately contriving a plot to ruin the reputation of an innocent boy who has never done you any harm should herbert carr desire it he is at liberty to sue you for having him arrested on a false charge trumped up by yourself eben began to look frightened i do not wish to punish mr graham said herbert it is enough for me that my honesty has been vindicated go then said the justice to eben it is fortunate for you that this boy is so forbearing eben graham slunk out of the justices office looking meaner and more contemptible than ever while herbert was surrounded by his friends who congratulated him upon the happy issue of the trial chapter xiii ebens last hope fails ebenezer graham had taken no stock in his sons charge against herbert he was not prejudiced in favor of herbert nor did he feel particularly friendly to him but he was a man of shrewdness and common sense and he knew that herbert was not a fool when eben made known to him the fact that the stamps and money were missing he said keenly what has become of em i dont know answered eben but i can guess well enough guess then said his father shortly you know herbert carr took my place last evening well theres no doubt that he took the stamps and money that isnt very likely i feel sure of it so sure that i mean to charge him with it well you can see what he says ebenezer did not understand that eben intended to have the boy arrested and would not have consented to it had he known but eben slipped out of the store and arranged for the arrest without his fathers knowledge indeed he did not learn till the trial had already commenced eben having made some excuse for his absence when eben returned his father greeted him in a tone very far from cordial well eben i hear youve gone and made a fool of yourself i have only been defending your property father said eben sullenly i thought youd appreciate it better than this youve charged an innocent boy with theft and now all his friends will lay it up agin us were you going to be robbed without saying a word asked eben no im not eben graham im goin to say a word and nows the time to say it you cant pull wool over my eyes the moneys gone and the stamps are gone and somebodys got em herbert carr no it isnt herbert carr its somebody nearer to me im ashamed to say than herbert carr do you mean to say i took them asked eben i wont bring a charge unless i can prove it but i shall watch you pretty closely after this in that case i dont wish to work for you any longer i throw up the situation said eben loftily verv well when are you going to leave town i aint going to leave town at present where are you going to board then eben regarded his father in dismay youre not going to send me adrift are you he asked in consternation im not going to support you in idleness if you give up your situation in the store youll have to go to work for somebody else i wish i could thought eben thinking of the rich young man at the hotel from whom he had sought a position as companion then i shall have to leave wayneboro he said theres nothing to do here yes there is farmer collins wants a hired man a hired man repeated eben scornfully do you think i am going to hire out on a farm you might do a great deal worse answered ebenezer sensibly after being a drygoods salesman in boston i havent got down to that i beg to assure you said eben with an air of consequence then you will have to work in the store if you expect to stay at home said his father and hark you eben graham he added dont report any more losses of money or stamps i make you responsible for both eben went back to his work in an uneasy frame of mind he saw that he had not succeeded in imposing upon his father and that the clearsighted old gentleman strongly suspected where the missing articles had gone eben might have told had he felt inclined that the fivedollar bill had been mailed to a lottery agent in new york in payment for a ticket in a southern lottery and that the stamps were even now in his possession and would be sold at the first opportunity his plan to throw suspicion upon herbert had utterly failed and the cold looks with which he had been greeted showed what the villagers thought of his attempt i wont stay in wayneboro much longer eben inwardly resolved its the dullest hole in creation i can get along somehow in a large place but here theres positively nothing hire out on a farm indeed my father ought to be ashamed to recommend such a thing to his only son when hes so well off if he would only give me two hundred dollars i would go to california and trouble him no more plenty of people make money in california and why shouldnt i if that ticket draws a prize and then eben went into calculations of what he would do if only he drew a prize of a thousand dollars that wasnt too much to expect for there were several of that amount and several considerably larger he pictured how independent he would be with his prize and how he would tell his father that he could get along without him displaying at the same time a large roll of bills when he reached california he could buy an interest in a mine and perhaps within three or four years he could return home twenty times as rich as his father it was pleasant to think over all this and almost to persuade himself that the good luck had actually come however he must wait a few days for the ticket had not yet come and the lottery would not be drawn for a week the ticket arrived two days later eben took care to slip the envelope into his pocket without letting his father or anyone else see it for unpleasant questions might have been asked as to where he got the money that paid for it mr graham knowing very well that his son had not five dollars by him for a few days eben must remain in wayneboro until the lottery was drawn if he was unlucky he would have to consider some other plan for raising money to get away from wayneboro it was not till the day after the trial and his triumphant acquittal that herbert saw eben he came to the store to buy some groceries for his mother goodevening herbert said eben eben said herbert coldly except in the way of business i dont want to speak to you you dont bear malice on account of that little affair do you herbert said eben smoothly that little affair as you call it might have been a very serious affair to me i only did my duty said eben was it your duty to charge an innocent person with theft i didnt see who else could have taken the things said eben probably you know as well as anybody said herbert contemptuously what do you mean demanded eben coloring you know better than i do how much do i owe you thirtythree cents there is your money said herbert and walked out of the store i hate that boy said eben scowling at herberts retreating figure he puts on too many airs just because a city mans taken him in charity and is paying his expenses some time ill be able to come up with him i hope herbert was not of an unforgiving nature but he felt that eben had wronged him deeply and saw no reason why he would not repeat the injury if he ever got the chance he had at least a partial understanding of ebens mean nature and utter selfishness and felt that he wished to have nothing to do with him ebenezer graham was very close but he was a hardworking man and honest as the world goes he was tolerably respected in wayneboro though not popular but eben seemed on the high road to become a rascal a week slipped by and a circular containing the list of prizes drawn was sent to eben he ran his eyes over it in a flutter of excitement alas for his hopes in the list of lucky numbers the number on his ticket was not included i have drawn a blank curse the luck he muttered savagely the old man neednt think i am going to stay here in wayneboro if he wont give me money to go out west why then but he did not say what then chapter xiv a trip to boston tomorrow herbert said george melville as they parted for the day i shall propose a new excursion to you herbert regarded him inquiringly i want to go to boston to make a few purchases but principally to consult my physician i hope you are not feeling any worse mr melville said herbert with genuine concern for he had come to feel a regard for his employer who was always kind and considerate to him no i am feeling as well as usual but i wish to consult dr davies about the coming winter whether he would advise me to spend it in massachusetts if mr melville goes away i shall have to look for another place thought herbert soberly it was hardly likely he knew that he would obtain a position so desirable as the one he now filled i hope he will be able to do so mr melville he said earnestly i hope so but i shall not be surprised if the doctor ordered me away then you wont want me to come tomorrow certainly unless you object to going to boston with me object repeated herbert eagerly i should like nothing better in fact our hero though a wellgrown boy of sixteen had never been to boston but three times and the trip commonplace as it may seem to my traveled young readers promised him a large amount of novelty and pleasurable excitement i shall be glad of your company herbert i hardly feel the strength or enterprise to travel alone even for so trifling a trip as going to boston at what hour will you go mr melville i will take the second train at nine oclock it will afford me time enough and save my getting up before my usual time herbert would have preferred going by the first train starting at halfpast seven as it would have given him a longer day in the city but of course he felt that his employer had decided wisely it will be quite a treat to me going to boston he said i have only been there three times in my life you certainly have not been much of a traveler herbert said george melville smiling however you are young and you may see a good deal of the world yet before you die i hope i will it must be delightful to travel yes when you are young and strong said melville thoughtfully that makes a great deal of difference in the enjoyment herbert did not fail to put in an appearance at the hotel considerably before it was time to leave for the train george melville smiled at his punctuality i wish herbert he said that i could look forward with as much pleasure as you feel to our trip today i wish so too mr melville at any rate i shall enjoy it better for having a companion the tickets were bought and they took their places in one of the passenger cars just as the train was ready to start herbert saw a young man with a ticket in his hand hurrying along the platform why theres eben graham he said in surprise is he entering the cars yes he has just got into the car behind us i wonder if he is going to leave wayneboro for good probably he is only going to boston for the day perhaps to buy goods herbert thought it doubtful whether ebenezer graham would trust his son so far but did not say so eben on his part had not seen herbert on board the train and was not aware that he was a fellow passenger the journey was a tolerably long one forty miles and consumed an hour and a half at last they rolled into the depot and before the train had fairly stopped the passengers began to crowd toward the doors of the car let us remain till the crowd has passed out said george melville it is disagreeable to me to get into the throng and it saves very little time very well sir looking out of the car window herbert saw eben graham walking swiftly along the platform and could not forbear wondering what had brought him to the city my doctors office is on tremont street said mr melville i shall go there immediately and may have to wait some time it will be tiresome to you and i shall let you go where you please you can meet me at the parker house in school street at two oclock very well sir do you know where the hotel is no but i can find it answered herbert confidently i believe i will also get you to attend to a part of my business for me i shall be very glad to do so said herbert sincerely it made him feel more important to be transacting business in boston here is a check for a hundred and fifty dollars on the merchants bank continued george melville it is payable to the bearer and you will have no trouble in getting the money on it you may present it at the bank and ask for fives and tens and a few small bills very well sir herbert felt rather proud to have so much confidence reposed in him for to him a hundred and fifty dollars seemed a large sum of money and he felt that george melville was a rich man to draw so much at one time had i better go to the bank at once he asked yes i think so of course i need not caution you to take good care of the money ill be sure to do that sir they walked together to tremont street and mr melville paused at a doorway opposite the common my doctors office is upstairs he said we will part here and meet at the hotel if you are late i may go into the dining room so if you dont see me in the reading room go to the door of the dining room and look in very well sir but i think i shall be on time the bank is open now and you can cash the check if you go down there left to himself herbert walked slowly along looking into shop windows and observing with interested attention the people whom he met it must be very pleasant to live in the city he thought there is so much going on all the time it is no wonder that country boys are drawn toward the city and feel that their cup of happiness would be full if they could get a position in some city store they do not always find the reality equal to their anticipations the long hours and strict discipline of a city office or mercantile establishment are not much like the freedom they pictured to themselves and after they have paid their board bill in some shabby boarding house they seldom find much left over either for amusement or needful expenses the majority of boys would do better to remain in their country homes where at least they can live comfortably and at small expense and take such employment as may fall in their way they will stand a much better chance of reaching a competence in middle life than if they helped to crowd the ranks of city clerks and salesmen there is many a hardworking clerk of middle age living poorly and with nothing laid by in the city who had he remained in his native village might have reached a modest independence it was hardly to be expected however that herbert would feel thus upon him the show and glitter of the city shops and streets produced their natural effect and he walked on buoyantly seeing three times as much as a city boy would have done he turned down school street passing the parker house where he was to meet mr melville just before he reached it he saw eben graham emerge from the hotel and walk towards washington street eben did not look behind him and therefore did not see herbert i wonder where he is going thought our hero as he followed a few steps behind eben chapter xv an obliging guide on washington street not far from old south church is an office for the sale of railroad tickets to western points it was this office which eben entered he is going to inquire the price of a ticket to some western city thought herbert i heard him say one day that he wanted to go west our heros curiosity was naturally aroused and he stood at the entrance where he could not only see but hear what passed within what do you charge for a ticket to chicago he heard eben ask twentytwo dollars was the answer of the young man behind the counter you may give me one said eben as he spoke he drew from his vest pocket a roll of bills and began to count off the requisite sum herbert was surprised he had supposed that eben was merely making inquiries about the price of tickets he had not imagined that he was really going can mr graham have given him money to go he asked himself when can i start asked eben as he received a string of tickets from the clerk at three this afternoon eben seemed well pleased with this reply he carefully deposited the tickets in an inside vest pocket and turned to go out of the office as he emerged from it he caught sight of herbert who had not yet started to go he looked surprised and annoyed herbert carr he exclaimed how came you here mingled with his surprise there was a certain nervousness of manner as herbert thought i came to boston with mr melville said herbert coldly oh ejaculated eben with an air of perceptible relief where is mr melville he has gone to the office of his physician on tremont street leaving you to your own devices eh yes look out you dont get lost said eben with affected gayety i am here on a little business for the old man herbert did not believe this in view of what he had seen but he did not think it necessary to say so goodmorning said herbert in a tone polite but not cordial goodmorning oh by the way i have just been inquiring the cost of a ticket to st louis said eben carelessly indeed do you think of going out there yes if the old man will let me said eben do you prefer st louis to chicago asked herbert watching the face of eben attentively ebens face changed and he looked searchingly at our hero but could read nothing in his face oh decidedly he answered after a slight pause i dont think i would care for chicago and all the while you have a ticket for chicago in your pocket thought herbert suspiciously well thats your own affair entirely not mine what train do you take back to wayneboro asked eben not without anxiety we shall not go before four oclock i may be on the train with you said eben though possibly i shall get through in time to take an earlier one he is trying to deceive me thought herbert goodmorning he said formally and walked away i wish i hadnt met him muttered eben to himself he may give the old man a clew however i shall be safe out of the way before anything can be done herbert kept on his way and found the bank without difficulty he entered and looked about him though unaccustomed to banks he watched to see where others went to get checks cashed and presented himself in turn how will you have it asked the paying teller fives and tens and a few small bills answered herbert promptly the teller selected the requisite number of bank bills quickly and passed them out to herbert our hero counted them to make sure that they were correct and then put them away in his inside pocket it gave him a feeling of responsibility to be carrying about so much money and he felt that it was incumbent on him to be very careful where shall i go now he asked himself he would have liked to go to charlestown and ascend bunker hill monument but did not know how to go besides he feared he would not get back to the parker house at the time fixed by mr melville still he might be able to do it he addressed himself to a rather sprucely dressed man of thirtyfive whom he met at the door of the bank i beg your pardon sir but can you tell me how far it is to bunker hill monument about a mile and a half answered the stranger could i go there and get back to the parker house before one oclock could you repeated the man briskly why to be sure you could but i dont know the way you have only to take one of the charlestown horse cars and it will land you only a couple of minutes walk from the monument can you tell me what time it is sir only a little past eleven so you have never been to bunker hill monument my lad no sir i live in the country forty miles away and seldom come to boston i see i see said the stranger his eyes snapping in a very peculiar way every patriotic young american ought to see the place where warren fell i should like to if you could tell me where to take the cars why certainly i will said the other quickly in fact let me see and he pulled out a silver watch from his vest pocket ive a great mind to go over with you myself i shouldnt like to trouble you sir said herbert oh it will be no trouble business isnt pressing this morning and i havent been over for a long time myself if you dont object to my company i will accompany you you are very kind said herbert if you are quite sure that you are not inconveniencing yourself i shall be very glad to go with you that is if you think i can get back to the parker house by one oclock i will guarantee that you do said the stranger confidently my young friend i am glad to see that you are particular to keep your business engagements in a varied business experience i have observed that it is precisely that class who are destined to win the favor of their employer and attain solid success he seems a very sensible man thought herbert and his advice is certainly good come this way said the stranger crossing washington street scollays square is close at hand and there we shall find a charlestown horse car of course herbert yielded himself to the guidance of his new friend and they walked up court street together that said the stranger pointing out a large somber building to the left is the courthouse the last time i entered it was to be present at the trial of a young man of my acquaintance who had fallen into evil courses and yielding to temptation had stolen from his employer it was a sad sight said the stranger shaking his head i should think it must have been said herbert oh why why will young men yield to the seductions of pleasure exclaimed the stranger feelingly was he convicted asked herbert yes and sentenced to a three years term in the state prison answered his companion it always makes me feel sad when i think of the fate of that young man i should think it would sir i have mentioned it as a warning to one who is just beginning life continued the stranger but here is our car a charlestown car with an outside sign bunker hill in large letters came by and the two got on board they rode down cornhill and presently the stranger pointed out faneuil hall behold the cradle of liberty he said of course you have heard of faneuil hall yes sir and herbert gazed with interest at the building of which he had heard so much it was but a short ride to charlestown they got out at the foot of a steep street at the head of which the tall granite column which crowns the summit of bunker hill stood like a giant sentinel ever on guard chapter xvi a new battle of bunker hill just opposite the monument is a small onestory structure where views of the shaft may be purchased and tickets obtained there is a small admission fee said herberts companion how much is it asked our hero twenty cents as herbert thrust his hand into his pocket for the necessary money his companion said you had better let me pay for both tickets though he said this he didnt make any motion to do so no i will pay for both said herbert but i really cannot permit you to pay for mine and still the speaker made no movement to purchase his ticket herbert settled the matter by laying half a dollar on the desk and asking for two tickets he began to see that in spite of his disclaimer his guide intended him to do so on the whole this didnt please him he would rather have had his offer frankly accepted i didnt mean to have you pay said the young man as they passed through the door admitting them to an inner apartment from which there was an exit into a small inclosed yard through which they were to reach the entrance to a spiral staircase by which the ascent was made herbert did not answer for he understood that his guide was not telling the truth and he did not like falsehood or deceit they entered the monument and commenced the ascent we have a tiresome ascent before us said the other how many steps are there asked herbert about three hundred was the reply at different points in the ascent they came to landings where they could catch glimpses of the outward world through long narrow perpendicular slits in the sides of the monument at last they reached the top herberts guide looked about him sharply and seemed disappointed to find a lady and gentleman and child also enjoying the view herbert had never been so high before indeed he had never been in any high building and he looked about him with a novel sense of enjoyment what a fine view there is here he said true assented his companion let me point out to you the different towns visible to the naked eye i wish you would said the boy so his guide pointed out cambridge chelsea malden the charles and mystic rivers gleaming in the sunshine the glittering dome of the boston state house and other conspicuous objects herbert felt that it was worth something to have a companion who could do him this service and he felt the extra twenty cents he had paid for his companions ticket was a judicious investment he noticed with some surprise that his companion seemed annoyed by the presence of the other party already referred to he scowled and shrugged his shoulders when he looked at them and in a low voice inaudible to those of whom he spoke he said to herbert are they going to stay here all day what does it matter to me if they do returned herbert in surprise indeed to him they seemed very pleasant people and he was especially attracted by the sweet face of the little girl he wished he had been fortunate enough to possess such a sister at last however they finished their sightseeing and prepared to descend herberts companion waited till the sound of their descending steps died away and then turning to herbert said in a quick stern tone now give me the money you have in your pocket what do you mean he said herbert recoiled and stared at the speaker in undisguised astonishment i mean just what i say returned the other you have one hundred and fifty dollars in your pocket you need not deny it for i saw you draw it from the bank and put it away are you a thief then demanded herbert no matter what i am i must have that money said the stranger i came over with you exclusively to get it and i mean business he made a step towards herbert but the boy faced him unflinchingly and answered resolutely i mean business too the money is not mine and i shall not give it up take care said the other menacingly we are alone here you are a boy and i am a man i know that but you will have to fight to get the money said herbert without quailing he looked to the staircase but his treacherous guide stood between him and it and he was practically a prisoner at the top of the monument dont be a fool said the stranger you may as well give up the money to me first as last i dont propose to give it up to you at all said herbert my employer trusted me with it and i mean to be true to my trust you can tell him that it was taken from you that you could not help yourself now hand it over never exclaimed herbert resolutely well see about that said his companion seizing the boy and grappling with him herbert was a strong boy for his age and he accepted the challenge though his antagonist was a man he found that the boy was powerful and not to be mastered as easily as he anticipated confound you he muttered i wish i had a knife though herbert made a vigorous resistance his opponent was his superior in strength and would ultimately have got the better of him he had thrown herbert down and was trying to thrust his hand into his coat pocket when a step was heard and a tall man of western appearance stepped on the scene hello he said surveying the two combatants in surprise whats all this let that boy alone you skunk you as he spoke he seized the man by the collar and jerked him to his feet what does all this mean he asked turning from one to the other this boy has robbed me of one hundred and fifty dollars said the man glibly i fell in with him in the boston cars and he relieved me of a roll of bills which i had drawn from a bank in boston what have you got to say to this asked the western man turning to herbert who was now on his feet only this answered herbert that it is a lie it was i who drew the money from the merchants bank in boston this man saw me cash the check followed me and offered to come here with me when i asked him for directions thats a likely story sneered the young man my friend here is too sharp to believe it dont call me your friend said the western man bluntly im more than half convinced youre a scamp i dont propose to stay here and be insulted let the boy give me my money and i wont have him arrested dont be in too much of a hurry young man i want to see about this thing what bank did you draw the money from from the merchants bank the boy has got things reversed he saw me draw it inveigled himself into my confidence and picked my pocket look here stop right there your story doesnt hang together said the tall westerner holding up his finger you said you met this boy in a horse car we came over together in a charlestown horse car said the rogue abashed youve given yourself away now make yourself scarce scoot the rascal looked in the face of the tall resolute man from the west and thought it prudent to obey he started to descend but a wellplanted kick accelerated his progress and he fell down several steps bruising his knees thank you sir said herbert gratefully it was lucky you came up just as you did the rascal had got his hand on the money he is a miserable scamp answered herberts new friend if thered been a policeman handy id have given him in charge ive come clear from wisconsin to see where warren fell but i didnt expect to come across such a critter as that on bunker hill herbert pointed out to his new friend the objects in view repeating the information he had so recently acquired then feeling that he could spare no more time he descended the stairs and jumped on board a horse car bound for boston chapter xvii an acceptable present as the clock at the old south church struck one herbert ascended the steps of parkers hotel and walked into the reading room george melville was already there you are on time herbert he said with a smile as our hero made his appearance yes sir but i began to think i should miss my appointment where have you been to bunker hill did you ascend the monument yes sir and had a fight at the summit mr melville looked at herbert in amazement had a fight at the top of bunker hill monument he ejaculated yes sir let me tell you about it when the story was told mr melville said that was certainly a remarkable adventure herbert still i am not sorry that it occurred it was herberts turn to look surprised i will tell you why it proves to me that you are worthy of my confidence and can be trusted with the care of money it has also taught you a lesson to beware of knaves no matter how plausible they may be i havent got over my surprise yet sir at discovering the real character of the man who went with me i am sorry i met him i dont like to distrust people nor i but it is not necessary to distrust everybody in your journey through the world you will make many agreeable and trustworthy acquaintances in whom it will be safe to confide it is only necessary to be cautious and not give your confidence too soon oh i didnt mention that i met somebody from wayneboro said herbert was it eben graham yes i met him myself on washington street did you speak to him yes sir i suppose he goes back tonight i dont think he will go back at all mr melville his employer looked at him inquiringly i saw him buy a ticket to chicago though he does not know it continued herbert when he spoke with me he didnt admit it but spoke of going back by an afternoon train i am afraid he has appropriated some of his fathers funds said melville i doubt if ebenezer graham would voluntarily furnish him the means of going west that was just what occurred to me said herbert but i didnt like to think that eben would steal perhaps he has not we shall be likely to hear when we return but you must be hungry we will go in to dinner herbert followed mr melville into the dining room where a good dinner was ordered and partaken of herbert looked over the bill of fare but the high prices quite startled him he was not used to patronizing hotels and it seemed to him that the price asked for a single dish ought to be enough to pay for a whole dinner for two he knew about what it cost for a meal at home and did not dream that it would amount to so much more at a hotel when the check was brought herbert looked at it two dollars and a half he exclaimed it costs an awful amount to live in boston oh a dinner can be got much cheaper at most places in boston said george melville smiling but i am used to parkers and generally come here i am glad it doesnt cost so much to live in wayneboro said herbert we couldnt afford even one meal a day you havent asked me what the doctor said remarked melville as they left the dining room excuse me mr melville it wasnt from any lack of interest he advises me to go west by the first of october either to colorado or southern california herberts countenance fell the first of october would soon come and his pleasant and profitable engagement with mr melville would close i am sorry he said gravely i am not so sorry as i should have been a few weeks ago said melville then i should have looked forward to a journey as lonely and monotonous now with a companion i think i may have a pleasant time who is going with you mr melville asked herbert feeling it must be confessed a slight twinge of jealousy i thought perhaps you would be willing to accompany me said melville would you really take me mr melville cried herbert joyfully yes if you will go i should like nothing better i have always wanted to travel it quite takes my breath away to think of going so far away i should hardly venture to go alone continued george melville i shall need some one to look after the details of the journey and to look after me if i fall sick do you think you would be willing to do that i hope you wont fall sick mr melville but if you do i will take the best care of you i know how i am sure you will herbert and i would rather have you about me than a man indeed i already begin to think of you as a younger brother thank you mr melville said herbert gratefully i am glad you do do you think your mother will object to your leaving home herbert not with you she knows i shall be well provided for with you can i arrange to send money regularly to mother asked the boy i shouldnt like to think of her as suffering for want of it yes but to guard against emergencies we can leave her a sum of money before you start after dinner mr melville proposed to herbert to accompany him on a walk up washington street they walked slowly herbert using his eyes diligently for to him the display in the shop windows was novel and attractive at length they paused at the door of a large and handsome jewelry store one of the two finest in boston i want to go in here herbert said his employer shall i stay outside no come in with me you may like to look about though herbert had no idea of the cost of the fine stock with which the store was provided he saw that it must be valuable and wondered where purchasers enough could be found to justify keeping so large a supply of watches chains rings and the numberless other articles in gold and silver which he saw around him i would like to look at your watches said melville to the salesman who came forward to inquire his wishes gold or silver sir silver this way if you please he led the way to a case where through the glass covering herbert saw dozens of silver watches of all sizes and grades lying ready for inspection for what price can i get a fair silver watch asked melville swiss or waltham waltham i may as well patronize home manufactures here is a watch i will sell you for fifteen dollars said the salesman drawing out a neatlooking watch of medium size it will keep excellent time and give you good satisfaction very well i will buy it on your recommendation have you any silver chains one was selected of pretty pattern and george melville paid for both how do you like the watch and chain herbert said his employer as they left the store they are very pretty sir i suppose you wonder what i want of two watches said melville perhaps you dont like to take your gold watch with you when you go out west for fear of thieves no that is not the reason if i am so unfortunate as to lose my gold watch i will buy another the fact is i have bought this silver watch and chain for you for me exclaimed herbert intensely delighted yes it will be convenient for you as well as me to be provided with a watch every traveler needs one there put it in your pocket and see how it looks you are very kind to me mr melville said herbert gratefully you couldnt have bought me anything which i should value more when herbert had arranged the watch and chain to suit him it must be confessed that it engrossed a large part of his attention and it was wonderful how often he had occasion to consult it during the first walk after it came into his possession chapter xviii a thief in trouble have you ever visited the suburbs of boston asked melville no answered herbert i know very little of the city and nothing of the towns near it then as we have time to spare we will board the next horse car and ride out to roxbury i should like it very much mr melville said herbert in a tone of satisfaction i may remark that roxbury was at that time a separate municipality and had not been annexed to boston they did not have to wait long for a car an open car of the kind in common use during the pleasant season drew near and they secured seats in it after leaving dover street washington street still then narrow broadens into a wide avenue and is called the neck it was gay with vehicles of all sorts and herbert found much to attract his attention the doctor tells me i ought to be a good deal in the open air said melville and i thought i would act at once upon his suggestion it is much pleasanter than taking medicine i should think so answered herbert emphatically arrived at the end of the route melville and herbert remained on the car and returned at once to the city when they reached the crowded part of washington street a surprise awaited herbert from a small jewelry store they saw a man come out and walk rapidly away mr melville said herbert in excitement do you see that man yes what of him it is the man who tried to rob me on bunker hill monument he had hardly uttered these words when another man darted from the shop bareheaded and pursued herberts morning acquaintance crying stop thief the thief took to his heels but a policeman was at hand and seized him by the collar what has this man been doing he asked as the jewelers clerk came up panting he has stolen a diamond ring from the counter answered the clerk i think he has a watch besides its a lie said the thief boldly search him said the clerk and youll find that i have made no mistake come with me to the station house and prepare your complaint said the policeman by this time a crowd had gathered and the thief appealed to them gentlemen he said i am a reputable citizen of st louis come to boston to buy goods and i protest against this outrage it is either a mistake or a conspiracy i dont know which the thief was well dressed and some of the bystanders were disposed to put confidence in him he had not seen herbert and george melville who had left the car and joined the throng or he might not have spoken so confidently he doesnt look like a thief said one of the bystanders a benevolentlooking old gentleman i should say not said the thief more boldly its a pretty state of things if a respectable merchant cant enter a store here in boston without being insulted and charged with theft if i only had some of my friends or acquaintances here they would tell you that it is simply ridiculous to make such a charge against me you can explain this at the station house said the policeman it is my duty to take you there is there no one who knows the gentleman said the philanthropist before referred to is there no one to speak up for him herbert pressed forward and said quietly i know something of him i passed the morning in his company the thief turned quickly but he didnt seem gratified to see herbert the boy is mistaken he said hurriedly i never saw him before but i have seen you sir retorted our hero you saw me draw some money from a bank in state street scraped acquaintance with me and tried to rob me of it on bunker hill its a lie said the prisoner hoarsely do you wish to make a charge to that effect asked the policeman no sir i only mentioned what i knew of him to support the charge of this gentleman indicating the jewelers clerk the old gentleman appeared to lose his interest in the prisoner after herberts statement and he was escorted without further delay to the station house where a gold watch and the diamond ring were both found on his person it is scarcely needful to add that he was tried and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the very city charlestown where he had attempted to rob herbert it is not always that retribution so quickly overtakes the wrongdoer said melville st louis will hardly be proud of the man who claims her citizenship dishonesty doesnt seem to pay in his case said herbert thoughtfully it never pays in any case herbert said george melville emphatically even if a man could steal enough to live upon and were sure not to be found out he would not enjoy his illgotten gain as an honest man enjoys the money he works hard for but when we add the risk of detection and the severe penalty of imprisonment it seems a fatal mistake for any man to overstep the bounds of honesty and enroll himself as a criminal i agree with you mr melville said herbert thoughtfully i dont think i shall ever be tempted but if i am i will think of this man and his quick detection when they reached the depot a little before four oclock george melville sent herbert to the ticket office to purchase tickets while he remained in the waiting room i might as well accustom you to the duties that are likely to devolve upon you he said with a smile herbert had purchased the tickets and was turning away when to his surprise he saw ebenezer graham enter the depot laboring evidently under considerable excitement he did not see herbert so occupied was he with thoughts of an unpleasant nature till the boy greeted him respectfully herbert carr he said when did you come into boston this morning sir have you seen anything of my son eben here gasped mr graham yes sir he was on the same train but i did not see him to speak to him till after i reached the city do you know what he has been doing here asked ebenezer his face haggard with anxiety i only saw him for five minutes answered herbert reluctant to tell the father what he knew would confirm any suspicion he might entertain where did you see him demanded ebenezer quickly at a railroad ticket office not far from the old south church do you know if he bought any ticket asked ebenezer anxiously yes answered herbert i overheard him purchasing a ticket to chicago ebenezer groaned and his face seemed more and more wizened and puckered up it is as i thought he exclaimed bitterly my own son has robbed me and fled like a thief as he is herbert was shocked but not surprised he didnt like to ask particulars but ebenezer volunteered them this morning he said i foolishly gave eben a hundred dollars and sent him to boston to pay for a bill of goods which i recently bought of a wholesale house on milk street if i had only known you were going in i would have sent it by you herbert felt gratified at this manifestation of confidence especially as he had so recently been charged with robbing the post office but did not interrupt mr graham who continued as soon as eben was fairly gone i began to feel sorry i sent him for he got into extravagant ways when he was in boston before and he had been teasing me to give him money enough to go out west with about noon i discovered that he had taken fifty dollars more than the amount i intrusted to him and then i couldnt rest till i was on my way to boston to find out the worst i went to the house on milk street and found they had seen nothing of eben then i knew what had happened the graceless boy has robbed his father of a hundred and fifty dollars and is probably on his way west by this time he was to start by the three oclock train i think said herbert and gave his reasons for thinking so ebenezer seemed so utterly cast down by this confirmation of his worst suspicions that herbert called mr melville thinking he might be able to say something to comfort him chapter xix ebenezer grahams grief how much have you lost by your son mr graham asked george melville nearly two hundred and fifty dollars groaned ebenezer counting what i paid in the city to his creditors it is terrible terrible and he wrung his hands in his bitterness of spirit i am sorry for you said melville and still more for him why should yon be sorry for him demanded ebenezer sharply he hasnt lost anything is it nothing to lose his consciousness of integrity to leave his home knowing that he is a thief little hell care for that said mr graham shrugging his shoulders hes laughing in his sleeve most likely at the way he has duped and cheated me his father how old is eben mr graham he will be twenty in november answered ebenezer apparently puzzled by the question then as he is so young let us hope that he may see the error of his ways and repent that wont bring me back my money objected ebenezer querulously it was clear that he thought more of the money he had lost than of his sons lack of principle no it will not give you back your money but it may give you back a son purified and prepared to take an honorable position in society no no hes bad bad said the stricken father what did he care for the labor and toil it took to save up that money i hope the loss of the money will not distress you mr graham well no not exactly said ebenezer hesitating i shall have to take some money from the savings bank to make up what that graceless boy has stolen it was clear that ebenezer graham would not have to go to the poorhouse in consequence of his losses i can hardly offer you consolation said george melville but i suspect that you will not be called upon to pay any more money for your son i dont mean to said ebenezer grimly going away as he has done he will find it necessary to support himself and will hardly have courage to send to you for assistance let him try it said ebenezer his eyes snapping he may therefore being thrown upon his own resources be compelled to work hard and that will probably be the best thing that can happen to him i hope he will i hope he will said the storekeeper he may find out after a while that he had an easy time at home and was better paid than he will be among strangers i wont pay any more of his debts ill publish a notice saying that i have given him his time and wont pay any more debts of his contracting he might run into debt enough to ruin me between now and the time he becomes of age george melville considered that the storekeeper was justified in taking this step and said so while they were on the train ebenezer got measurably reconciled to his loss and his busy brain began to calculate how much money he would save by ceasing to be responsible for ebens expenses of living and prospective debts without this drawback he knew he would grow richer every year he knew also that notwithstanding the sum it had just cost him he would be better off at the end of the year than the beginning and to a man of his character this was perhaps the best form of consolation that he could have suddenly it occurred to mr graham that he should need a clerk in place of his son now that eben has gone herbert he said i am ready to take you back this was a surprise for herbert had not thought of the effect upon his own business prospects i have got a place thank you mr graham he said you dont call trampin round huntin and fishin work do you said ebenezer it is very agreeable work sir but it stands to reason that you cant earn much that way i wouldnt give you twentyfive cents a week for such doings are you willing to pay me more than mr melville does asked herbert demurely smiling to himself how much does he pay you now asked ebenezer cautiously six dollars a week six dollars a week repeated the storekeeper in incredulous amazement sho youre joking you can ask mr melville sir ebenezer regarded george melville with an inquiring look yes i pay herbert six dollars a week said he smiling well i never ejaculated ebenezer thats the strangest thing i ever heard how in the name of conscience can a boy earn so much money trampin round perhaps it would not be worth as much to anyone else said melville but herbert suits me and i need cheerful company you aint goin to keep him long at that figger be you mr melville asked mr graham bluntly i think we shall be together a considerable time mr graham if however you should be willing to pay herbert a larger salary i might feel it only just to release him from his engagement to me me pay moren six dollars a week gasped ebenezer i aint quite crazy why it would take about all i get from the post office you wouldnt expect me to take less than i can earn elsewhere mr graham said herbert noo answered the storekeeper slowly he was evidently nonplused by the absolute necessity of getting another clerk and his inability to think of a suitable person if tom tripp was with me i might work him into the business said ebenezer thoughtfully but hes bound out to a farmer an inspiration came to herbert he knew that his mother would be glad to earn something and there was little else to do in wayneboro i think he said you might make an arrangement with my mother to make up and sort the mail for a time at least why so i could i didnt think of that answered ebenezer relieved do you think shed come over tomorrow mornin if she cant i will said herbert i dont meet mr melville till nine oclock so do ill expect you i guess ill come over and see your mother this evenin and see if i cant come to some arrangement with her it may be added that mr graham did as proposed and mrs carr agreed to render him the assistance he needed for three dollars a week it required only her mornings and a couple of hours at the close of the afternoon and she was very glad to convert so much time into money it makes me feel more independent she said i dont want to feel that you do all the work herbert and maintain the family singlehanded the same evening herbert broached the plan of traveling with mr melville as might have been expected his mother was at first startled and disposed to object but herbert set before her the advantages both to himself and the family and touched upon the young mans need of a companion so skillfully and eloquently that she was at last brought to regard the proposal favorably she felt that george melville was one to whom she could safely trust her only boy moreover her own time would be partly occupied owing to the arrangement she had just made to assist in the post office so that herbert carried his point the tenth of october arrived the date which george melville had fixed upon for his departure mrs carr had put herberts wardrobe in order and he had bought himself a capacious carpetbag and an umbrella and looked forward with eagerness to the day on which their journey was to commence he had long thought and dreamed of the west its plains and cities but had never supposed that it would be his privilege to make acquaintance with them at any rate until he should have become twice his present age but the unexpected had happened and on monday he and george melville were to start for chicago chapter xx an old acquaintance in chicago in due time our travelers reached chicago and put up at the palmer house herbert was much impressed by the elegance of the hotel its sumptuous furniture and luxurious table it must be considered that he was an inexperienced traveler though had he been otherwise he might be excused for his admiration i have some business in chicago and shall remain two or three days said george melville herbert was quite reconciled to the delay and as his services were not required employed his time in making himself familiar with the famous western city he kept his eyes open and found something new and interesting at every step one day as he was passing through the lower portion of the city his attention was called to a young man wheeling a barrow of cabbages and other vegetables a little in advance of him of course there was nothing singular about this but there seemed something familiar in the figure of the young man herbert quickened his step and soon came up with him one glance was enough though disguised by a pair of overalls and without a coat herbert recognized the once spruce drygoods clerk eben graham eben recognized herbert at the same time he started and flushed with shame not because of the theft of which he had been guilty but because he was detected in an honest but plebeian labor herbert carr he exclaimed stopping short yes eben it is i you find me changed said eben dolefully no i should recognize you anywhere i dont mean that i have sunk very low and he glanced pathetically at the wheelbarrow if you refer to your employment i dont agree with you it is an honest business true but i never dreamed when i stood behind the counter in boston and waited on fashionable ladies that i should ever come to this he seems more ashamed of wheeling vegetables than of stealing thought herbert and he was correct how do you happen to be in this business eben he asked with some curiosity i must do it or starve i was cheated out of my money soon after i came here and didnt know where to turn eben did not explain that he lost his money in a gambling house he might have been cheated out of it but it was his own fault for venturing into competition with older and more experienced knaves than himself i went for thirtysix hours without food continued eben when i fell in with a man who kept a vegetable store and he offered to employ me i have been with him ever since you were fortunate to find employment said herbert fortunate repeated eben in a tragic tone how much wages do you think i get i cant guess five dollars a week and have to find myself answered eben mournfully what would my fashionable friends in boston say if they could see me i wouldnt mind what they said as long as you are getting an honest living how do you happen to be out here asked eben his story was told in a few words you are always in luck said eben enviously i wish i had your chance is mr melville very rich he is rich but i dont know how rich do you think hed lend me money enough to get home i dont know will you ask him i will tell him that you made the request eben answered herbert cautiously have you applied to your father to the old man yes he hasnt any more heart than a grindstone said eben bitterly what do you think he wrote me he refused i suppose here is his letter said eben drawing from his pocket a greasy half sheet of note paper see what he has to say to his only son this was the letter eben graham i have received your letter and am not surprised to hear that you are in trouble as a man sows so also shall he reap a young man who will rob his father of his hard earnings is capable of anything you have done what you could to ruin me and deserve what you have got you want me to send you money to come home and continue your wicked work i shall not do it i wash my hands of you i have already given notice through the country paper that i have given you your time and shall pay no more debts of your contracting i am glad to hear that you are engaged in an honest employment it is better than i expected i would not have been surprised if i had heard that you were in jail my advice to you is to stay where you are and make yourself useful to your employer he may in time raise your wages five years hence if you have turned over a new leaf and led an honest life i may give you a place in my store at present i would rather leave you where you are ebenezer graham what do you say to that isnt that rather rough on an only son eh said eben it occurred to herbert that eben hardly deserved very liberal treatment from his father notwithstanding he was an only son oh the old man is awfully mean and closefisted said eben he cares more for money than for anything else by the way how does melville treat you mr melville said herbert emphasizing the mr is always kind and considerate pays you well eh he pays me more than i could get anywhere else pays all your hotel and traveling expenses eh of course and a good salary besides yes herbert said eben suddenly i want you to do me a favor what is it youve always known me you know when you was a little chap and came into the store i used to give you sticks of candy i dont remember it answered herbert truthfully i did all the same you were so young that you dont remember it well eben what of it i want you to lend me ten dollars herbert in memory of old times herbert was generously inclined on ordinary occasions but did not feel so on this occasion he felt that eben was not a deserving object even had he felt able to make so large a loan besides he could not forget that the young man who now asked a favor had brought a false charge of stealing against him you will have to excuse me eben he answered to begin with i cannot afford to lend so large a sum i would pay you back as soon as i could perhaps you would said herbert though i have not much confidence in it but you seem to forget that you charged me with stealing only a short time since i wonder how you have the face to ask me to lend you ten dollars or any sum it was a mistake muttered eben showing some signs of confusion at any rate i wont say anything more about it while you are in trouble but you must excuse my declining to lend you lend me five dollars then pleaded eben what do you want to do with it to buy lottery tickets i am almost sure i should win a prize and then i can pay you five dollars for one i wouldnt lend any money for that purpose to my dearest friend said herbert buying lottery tickets is about the most foolish investment you could make then i wont buy any said eben lend me the money and i will use it to buy clothes you will have to excuse me said herbert coldly i didnt think youd be so mean whined eben to a friend in distress i dont look upon you as a friend and for very good reasons retorted herbert as he walked away eben looked after him with a scowl of hatred id like to humble that boys pride he muttered as he slowly resumed his march chapter xxi col warner when herbert returned to the hotel he found george melville in the reading room in conversation with a tall and dignifiedlooking stranger is that your brother mr melville asked the latter as herbert came forward and spoke to melville no colonel he is my young friend and confidential clerk herbert carr glad to make your acquaintance mr carr said the colonel affably extending his hand as he spoke this is col warner herbert explained george melville herbert who was naturally polite shook hands with the colonel and said he was glad to make his acquaintance i have been talking with mr melville said the colonel i am sorry to hear that he is traveling in search of health yes sir i hope he will find his journey beneficial oh not a doubt of it not a doubt of it ive been there myself do you know when i was twentyfive which i take to be about the age of your employer i thought i should die of consumption i shouldnt have supposed it sir said herbert and melville too felt surprised as he noticed the stalwart proportions of the former consumptive ha ha i dare say not said the colonel laughing i dont look much like it now eh no you certainly dont colonel said melville i am curious to know how you overcame the threatened danger i did what you are doing sir i came west but the mere coming west did not cure you did it no sir it was the life i lived returned col varner i didnt stay in the cities i went into the wilderness i lived in a logcabin i bought a horse and rode every day i kept in the open air and after a while i found my strength returning and my chest expanding and in a twelvemonth i could afford to laugh at doctors and you have never had a return of the old symptoms asked melville with interest never except four years afterwards when i went to new york and remained nearly a year i am now fifty and rather hale and hearty for my years eh decidedly so let me advise you to follow my example mr melville it was my intention when i started west to live very much as you indicated said melville now that i have heard your experience i am confirmed in my resolve good i am glad to hear it when do you leave chicago tomorrow probably and how far west do you intend to go i have thought of colorado couldnt do better i know colorado like a book in fact i own some valuable mining property there up in ahem gilpin county by the way i take it you are a rich man why dont you invest in that way perhaps however you have it in view no i havent thought of it answered melville the fact is i am not anxious to become richer having enough for all my present needs just so said the colonel but you might marry even if i did you would have money enough said col warner finishing the sentence for him well i am delighted to hear it i am very well fixed myself in fact some of my friendy call me ha ha the nabob but as i was saying i am rich enough and to spare and still you may be surprised still i have no objection to making a little more money col warner nodded his head vigorously and watched george melville to see the effect upon him of this extraordinary statement very natural colonel said melville i believe most people want to be richer perhaps if i had vigorous health i might have the same wish at present my chief wish is to recover my health youll do it sir youll do it and in short order too then you can turn your attention to moneymaking perhaps so said melville with a smile if not for yourself for your young friend here added the colonel i take it he is not rich i have my fortune still to make col warner said herbert smiling the easiest thing in the world out here my boy said the colonel paternally so you start tomorrow he inquired turning to melville i think of it egad ive a great mind to accompany you said the colonel why shouldnt i ive got through all my business in chicago and i like the pure air of the prairies best we shall be glad of your company colonel said melville politely thank you sir that decides me ill see you again and fix the hour of going or rather ill conform myself to your arrangements very well colonel what do you think of my new acquaintance col warner herbert asked melville when they were alone he seems to have a very good opinion of himself answered herbert yes he is very well pleased with himself he isnt a man exactly to my taste but he seems a representative western man he does not look much like a consumptive no sir i feel an interest in him on that account said melville seriously if at any time i could become as strong and stalwart i would willingly surrender onehalf nay ninetenths of my fortune ill health is a great drag upon a man it largely curtails his enjoyments and deprives him of all ambition i dont see why his remedy wouldnt work well in your case mr melville said herbert earnestly perhaps it may at any rate i feel inclined to try it i am glad the colonel is going to travel with us as i shall be able to question him about the details of his cure he seems a bluff genial fellow and though i dont expect to enjoy his companionship much i hope to derive some benefit from it by the way mr melville i met an old acquaintance while i was out walking said herbert indeed eben graham how did he look prosperous hardly he was wheeling a barrow of vegetables did you speak with him yes he wanted to borrow money i am not surprised at that i thought it time for him to be out of money did you lend him no i found he wanted money to buy a lottery ticket i told him i wouldnt lend money to my best friend for that purpose very sensible in you herbert if he had been in distress i might have let him have a few dollars notwithstanding he treated me so meanly at wayneboro but he seems to be earning a living i presume he doesnt enjoy the business he is in no he complains that he has lowered himself by accepting such a place it doesnt occur to him that he lowered himself when he stole money from his father i suppose it doesnt seem to later in the day herbert came across col warner in the corridor of the hotel ha my young friend he said affably i am glad to meet you thank you sir and how is your friend no change since morning answered herbert slightly smiling by the way herbert your name is herbert isnt it may i offer you a cigar said col warner the colonel opened his cigarcase and extended it to herbert thank you sir but i dont smoke dont smoke that is you dont smoke cigars may i offer you a cigarette i dont smoke at all colonel indeed remarkable why sir before i was your age i smoked do you think it good for consumption asked herbert ha ha you have me there well perhaps not do you know said the colonel changing the conversation i feel a great interest in your friend you are very kind upon my soul i do he is a most interesting young man rich too i am glad he is rich he would value health more than money said herbert to be sure to be sure by the way you dont know how much property your friend has no sir he never told me answered herbert surprised at the question keeps such matters close eh now i dont i never hesitate to own up to a quarter of a million yes quarter of a million thats the size of my pile you are fortunate col warner said herbert sincerely so i am so i am two years hence i shall have half a million if all goes well so you wont have a cigar no well ill see you later hes a strange man thought herbert i wonder if his statements can be relied upon somehow herbert doubted it he was beginning to distrust the colonel chapter xxii a mountain stage we pass over several days and change the scene we left herbert and melville in the palmer house in chicago surrounded by stately edifices and surging crowds now everything is changed they are in a mountainous district where a man might ride twenty miles without seeing a house they are in fact within the limits of what was then known as the territory of colorado it is not generally known that colorado contains over a hundred mountain summits over ten thousand feet above the sea level it is perhaps on account of the general elevation that it is recommended by physicians as a good health resort for all who are troubled with lung complaints at the time of which i speak most of the traveling was done by stage now railroads unite the different portions with links of steel and make traveling less cumbersome and laborious there was one of the party however who did not complain but rather enjoyed the jolting of the lumbering stagecoach col warner was of the party he professed to feel an extraordinary interest in george melville and was anxious to show him the country where he had himself regained his health lonely sir repeated the colonel in answer to a remark of george melville why sir its a populous city compared with what it was in when i was out here i built myself a cabin in the woods and once for twelve months i didnt see a white face were there many indians colonel asked herbert indians i should say so only twenty miles from my cabin was an indian village did they trouble you any asked herbert curiously well they tried to answered the colonel one night as i lay awake i heard stealthy steps outside and peeping through a crevice between the logs just above the head of my bed by the way my bed was the skin of a bear i had myself killed i could see a string of utes preparing to besiege me were you afraid asked herbert a little mischievously for he knew pretty well what the colonel would say afraid repeated the colonel indignantly what do you take me for i have plenty of faults continued col warner modestly but cowardice isnt one of them no sir i never yet saw the human being white black or red that i stood in fear of but as i was saying the redskins collected around my cabin and were preparing to break in the door when i leveled my revolver and brought down their foremost man this threw them into confusion they retreated a little way then advanced again with a horrible yell and i gave myself up for lost but i got in another shot bringing down another warrior this time the son of their chief the same scene was repeated well to make a long story short i repulsed them at every advance and finally when but three were left they concluded that prudence was the better part of valor and fled leaving their dead and wounded behind them how many were there of them asked herbert well in the morning when i went out i found seven dead redskins and two others lying at the point of death that was certainly a thrilling adventure colonel said george melville smiling egad i should say so i confess i dont care to meet with any such oh no danger no danger said the colonel airily that is comparatively speaking in fact the chief danger is of a different sort of the sleigh upsetting and tipping us out into some of the canyons i suppose you mean no i speak of the gentlemen of the road road agents as they are generally called you mean highwaymen yes is there much danger of meeting them asked melville well theres a chance they are quite in the habit of attacking stagecoaches and plundering the passengers sometimes they make rich hauls that must be rather inconvenient to the passengers said melville cant the laws reach these outlaws they dont seem to why there are men who have been in the business for years and have never been caught very true said a fellow traveler theres jerry lane for instance he has succeeded thus far in eluding the vigilance of the authorities yes said the colonel i once saw lane myself indeed he did me the honor of relieving me of five hundred dollars couldnt you help it asked herbert no he covered me with his revolver and if i had drawn mine i shouldnt have lived to take aim at him were you in a stage at the time no i was riding on horseback is this lane a large man asked george melville not larger than myself continued the colonel where does he live in some secret haunt in the forest i suppose oh no he doesnt confine himself to one place he travels a good deal sometimes he goes to st louis i have heard that he sometimes even visits new york and is he not recognized no he looks like anything but an outlaw if you should see him you might think him a prosperous merchant or banker thats curious said herbert the fact is said the colonel when you travel by stagecoaches in these solitudes you have to take the chances now i carry my money concealed in an inner pocket where it isnt very likely to be found of course i have another wallet just for show and i give that up when i have to there was a stout florid gentleman present who listened to the above conversation with illdisguised nervousness he was a new york capitalist of german birth going out to inspect a mine in which he proposed purchasing an interest his name was conrad stiefel good gracious said he i had no idea a man ran such a risk or i would have stayed at home i decidedly object to being robbed men are robbed in a different way in new york said george melville how do you mean mr melville by defaulting clerks absconding cashiers swindlers of excellent social position oh we dont mind those things said mr stiefel we can look out for ourselves but when a man points at you with a revolver that is terrible i hope my dear sir you take good care of your money that i do said stiefel complacently i carry it in a belt around my waist thats a good place hey i commend your prudence sir said the colonel you are evidently a wise and judicious man they wont think of looking there hey laughed stiefel i should say not you may think what you like mr stiefel said a tall thin passenger who looked like a book peddler but i contend that my money is in a safer place than yours indeed mr parker i should like to know where you keep it said col warner pleasantly you cant get at it without taking off my stockings said the tall man looking about him in a selfsatisfied manner very good pon my soul said the colonel i really dont know but i shall adopt your hiding place i am an old traveler but not too old to adopt new ideas when i meet with good ones i think you would find it to your interest colonel said parker looking flattered well well said the colonel genially suppose we change the subject there isnt much chance of our being called upon to produce our money or part with it still as i said a while since its best to be cautious and i see that you all are so i begin to feel hungry gentlemen how is it with you are we anywhere near the place for supper asked stiefel i wish i could step into a good broadway restaurant i feel empty only a mile hence gentlemen we shall reach echo gulch where we halt for the night theres a rude cabin there where they will provide us with supper and shelter this announcement gave general satisfaction the colonel proved to be right the stage soon drew up in front of a long onestory building which bore the pretentious name of the echo gulch hotel chapter xxiii a startling revelation a stout blackbearded man stood in front of the hotel to welcome the stage passengers he took a clay pipe from his lips and nodded a welcome glad to see you strangers he said here peter you black rascal help the gentlemen with their baggage the door was thrown open and the party filed into a comfortless looking apartment at one end of which was a rude bar one of the passengers at least seemed to know the landlord for col warner advanced to greet him his face beaming with cordiality how are you john he said how does the world use you the landlord growled something inaudible have a drink colonel was the first audible remark dont care if i do its confounded dry traveling over these mountain roads walk up gentlemen col warner doesnt drink alone with the exception of herbert and george melville the passengers seemed inclined to accept the offer come along melville said the colonel you and your friend must join us please excuse me colonel answered melville i would prefer not to drink oh nonsense to oblige me now thank you but i am traveling for my health and it would not be prudent just as you say melville but a little whisky would warm you up and do you good in my opinion thank you all the same colonel but i think you must count me out the colonel shrugged his shoulders and beckoned herbert you can come anyway your health wont prevent melville did not interfere for he knew it would give offense but he hoped his young clerk would refuse thank you said herbert i wont object to a glass of sarsaparilla sarsaparilla repeated the colonel in amazement whats that we dont keep no medicine growled the landlord have you rootbeer asked herbert what do you take me for said the landlord contemptuously i havent got no rootbeer whiskys good enough for any man i hope youll excuse me then said herbert i am not used to any strong drinks how old are you asked the colonel rather contemptuously sixteen sixteen years old and dont drink whisky my young friend your education has been sadly neglected i dare say it has answered herbert goodnaturedly gentlemen said col warner apologetically the boy is a stranger and isnt used to our free western ways hes got the makings of a man in him and it wont be long before hell get over his squeamishness and walk up to the bar as quick as any one of us herbert and melville stood apart while the rest of the company emptied their glasses apparently at a gulp it was clear that their refusal had caused them to be regarded with dislike and suspicion the accommodations of the echo gulch hotel were far from luxurious the chambers were scarcely larger than a small closet clapboarded but not plastered and merely contained a bedstead washing accommodations were provided downstairs herbert and george melville were assigned to a single room to which they would not have objected had the room been larger it was of no use to indulge in open complaints however since others had to fare in the same way this isnt luxury herbert said melville no answered the boy but i dont mind it if you dont i am afraid i may keep you awake by my coughing herbert not if i once get to sleep i sleep as sound as a top i wish i did but i am one of the wakeful kind being an invalid i am more easily annoyed by small inconveniences you with your sturdy health are more easily suited mr melville i had just as lief sleep downstairs in a chair and give you the whole of the bed not on my account herbert i congratulate myself on having you for a roommate if i had been traveling alone i might have been packed away with the colonel who by this time would be even less desirable as a bedfellow than usual the worthy colonel had not been content with a single glass of whisky but had followed it up several times till his utterance had become thick and his face glowed with a dull brickdust color col warner had been assigned to the adjoining chamber or closet whichever it may be called he did not retire early however while herbert and george melville did strangely enough herbert who was usually so good a sleeper after a short nap woke up he turned to look at his companion for it was a moonlight night and saw that he was sleeping quietly i wonder whats got into me he thought i thought i should sleep till morning he tried to compose himself to sleep but the more effort he made the broader awake he became sometimes it seems as if such unaccountable deviations from our ordinary habits were heavensent as herbert lay awake he suddenly became aware of a conversation which was being carried on in low tones in the next room the first voice he heard he recognized as that of the colonel yes he said some of the passengers have got money theres that stiefel probably carries a big sum in gold and notes when i was speaking of the chance of the stage being robbed he was uncommon nervous whos stiefel was growled in another voice which herbert had no difficulty in recognizing as the landlords oh hes the fat redfaced german from his talk i reckon hes come out to buy mines somewhere in colorado well save him the trouble so we will good joke john oh about this stiefel he carries his money in a belt round his waist i infer that it is gold good what about the others theres a tall thin man his name is parker proceeded the colonel hes smart or thinks he is youll have to pull his stockings off to get his money ha ha how did you find out colonel asked the landlord in admiration drew it out of him sir he didnt know who he was confiding in hell wonder how the deuce his hiding place was suspected other passengers were referred to who have not been mentioned and in each case the colonel was able to tell precisely where their money was kept how about that milksop that wouldnt drink with us inquired the landlord after a while melville i couldnt find out where he keeps his cash probably he keeps it in his pocket he doesnt look like a cautious man whos the boy only a clerk or secretary of melvilles he hasnt any money and isnt worth attention very glad to hear it thought herbert i dont care to receive any attention from such gentry but who would have thought the colonel was in league with stage robbers i thought him a gentleman herbert began to understand why it was that col warner if that was his real name had drawn the conversation to stage robbers and artfully managed to discover where each of the passengers kept his supply of money it was clear that he was in league with the landlord of the echo gulch hotel who it was altogether probable intended to waylay the stage the next day this was a serious condition of affairs the time had been when in reading stories of adventure herbert had wished that he too might have some experience of the kind now that the opportunity had come our hero was disposed to regard the matter with different eyes what can be done he asked himself anxiously to escape the danger which threatens us tomorrow chapter xxiv a morning walk herbert found it difficult to sleep from anxiety he felt that the burden was too great for him alone to bear and he desired to speak on the subject to george melville but there was a difficulty about doing this undetected on account of the thinness of the partitions between the rooms if he could hear col warner the latter would also be able to hear him the stage was to start at seven oclock the next morning and before that time some decision must be made the first question was should they or should they not take passage as they had anticipated at halfpast five herbert turning in bed found his bedfellow awake mr melville he whispered i have something important to communicate and cannot do so here on account of the danger of being heard in the next room are you willing to dress and take a little walk with me before breakfast george melvilles physical condition did not make him usually favorable to early rising but he knew herbert well enough to understand that he had a satisfactory reason for his request yes herbert he said i will get up not a word was exchanged for mr melvilles discretion prevailed over his curiosity in ten minutes both were fully dressed and descended the stairs there was no one stirring except a woman the landlords wife who was lighting the fire in order to prepare breakfast she regarded the two with surprise and perhaps a little distrust youre stirrin early strangers she said yes answered melville courteously we are going to take a little walk before breakfast it may sharpen our appetites humph said the woman thats curious i wouldnt get up so early if i wasnt obliged there aint much to see outdoors it is a new part of the country to us said melville and we may not have another chance to see it when will breakfast be ready asked herbert half an hour more or less answered the woman shortly we will be back in time he said the landlady evidently thought their earlyrising a singular proceeding but her suspicions were not aroused she resumed her work and herbert and his friend walked out through the open door when they had reached a spot a dozen rods or more distant melville turned to his young clerk and asked well herbert what is it i have discovered mr melville that our stage is to be stopped today and the passengers plundered how did you discover this asked melville startled by a conversation which i overheard in the next chamber to us but that chamber is occupied by col warner and he is one of the conspirators said herbert quietly is it possible ejaculated melville can we have been so deceived in him does he propose to waylay the stage no i presume he will be one of the passengers tell me all you know about this matter herbert who is engaged with him in this plot the landlord i am not much surprised at this said melville thoughtfully he is an illlooking man whose appearance fits the part of highwayman very well then you think the colonel is in league with him i am sure of that dont you remember how skillfully col warner drew out of the passengers the hiding places of their money vesterday yes he has told all to the landlord and he will no doubt make use of the knowledge that is all mr melville i could not rest till i had told you so that you might decide what to do it seems quite providential that you were kept awake last night herbert otherwise this blow would have come upon us unprepared even with the knowledge that it impends i hardly know what it is best for us to do we might decide not to go in the stage suggested hebert but we should have to go tomorrow we cannot stay here and there is no other way of traveling as the colonel seems to think i have money there would be another attack tomorrow besides where could we stay except at this hotel which is kept as it appears by the principal robber that is true said herbert puzzled i didnt think of that i would quite as soon stand my chance of being robbed in the stage as be attacked here besides i cannot make up my mind to desert my fellow passengers it seems cowardly to send them off to be plundered without giving them a hint of their danger couldnt we do that the result would be that they would not go and there is no knowing how long we should be compelled to remain in this secluded spot mr melville said herbert suddenly a thought has just struck me i hope it may show us a way out of our danger no i am sorry to say that it wont do that what is it herbert you remember that mention was made yesterday in the stage of a certain famous bandit named jerry lane yes i remember do you think it is possible that he and col warner may be one and the same that is certainly a startling suggestion herbert what reason have you for thinking so it was only a guess on my part but you remember that the colonel said he was a man about his size that might be and he did not confine himself to the western country but might be met with in new york or st louis we met the colonel in chicago it may be as you surmise herbert said george melville after a pause it did occur to me that our worthy landlord might be the famous outlaw in question but the description to which you refer seems to fit the colonel better there is one thing however that makes me a little incredulous what is that mr melville this jerry lane i take to be cool and courageous while the colonel appears to be more of a boaster he looks like one who can talk better than he can act if i had ever seen a description of his appearance i could judge better the two had been walking slowly and thoughtfully when they were startled by a rough voice youre out early strangers turning swiftly they saw the dark forbidding face of the landlord who had approached them unobserved did he hear anything thought herbert anxiously yes we are taking a little walk said melville pleasantly breakfast will be ready soon youd better be back soon if youre goin by the stage this morning you are goin i reckon said the landlord eyeing them sharply we intend to do so said melville we will walk a little farther and then return to the house the landlord turned and retraced his steps to the echo gulch hotel do you think he heard anything that we were saying asked herbert i think not i wonder what brought him out here probably he wanted to make sure that we were going in the stage he is laudably anxious to have as many victims and as much plunder as possible you told him you were going in the stage yes i have decided to do so have you decided upon anvthing else mr melville not positively but there will be time to think of that did you hear where we were to be attacked at a point about five miles from here said herbert this he had gathered from the conversation he had overheard when the two friends reached the hotel they found col warner already downstairs goodmorning gentlemen he said so you have taken a walk i never walk before breakfast for my part nor do i often said melville in this case i was persuaded by my young friend i am repaid by a good appetite cant i persuade you to try a glass of bitters mr melville asked the colonel thank you colonel you will have to excuse me breakfasts ready announced the landlady and the stage passengers sat down at a long unpainted wooden table where the food was of the plainest in spite of the impending peril of which they only had knowledge herbert ate heartily but melville seemed preoccupied chapter xxv melville makes a sensation col warner seemed in very good spirits he ate and drank with violent enjoyment and was as affable as usual george melville regarded him with curiosity the man does not appear like a desperado or outlaw he thought there is nothing to distinguish him from the majority of men one meets in ordinary intercourse he is a problem to me i should like to study him col warner did not fail to observe the unconscious intentness with which melville regarded him and for some reason it did not please him you have lost your appetite mr melville he said lightly you have been looking at me until egad if i were a vain man i should conclude there was something striking about my appearance i wont gainsay that colonel answered melville adroitly i confess i am not very hungry and i will further confess that i have something on my mind indeed better make me your father confessor said the colonel whose suspicion or annoyance was removed by this ready reply so i may after a while said melville he took the hint and ceased to regard the colonel the latter made himself generally social and generally popular the stage drove round to the door after breakfast and there was the usual bustle as the passengers bestowed themselves inside george melville had intended to watch narrowly the landlord and col warner to detect if possible the secret understanding which must exist between them but he was deprived of an opportunity for the very good reason that the landlord had disappeared and was not again seen before their departure the driver gathered up his reins cracked his whip and the stage started herbert looked at george melville a little anxiously not knowing what course he had decided to take they two it will be remembered were the only ones who knew of the intended attack before the stage started melville quietly took the opportunity to hand his pocketbook to herbert saying briefly it will be safer with you in case of an attack but wont it be considered suspicious that you have no money about you suggested herbert i have a roll of bills in my pocketfifty dollars answered melville they had no further opportunity of speaking as one of the passengers came up where they were standing herbert had already taken his seat in the coach when his employer said herbert wouldnt you like to ride outside with the driver yes sir answered herbert promptly for he understood that this was mr melvilles wish it will give us more room and you will have a better view yes sir i shall like it in a quick manner herbert made the change taking care not to look significantly at melville as some boys might have done and thus excited suspicion for the first mile there was very little conversation then col warner spoke well gentlemen he said we are fairly on our way let us hope nothing will mar our pleasure do you anticipate anything asked george melville i why should i we have a skillful driver and i guarantee he wont tip us over mr melville was perhaps referring to the chance of the stage being stopped by some enterprising road agent suggested parker oho sits the wind in that quarter said the colonel laughing lightly not the least chance of that that is the chance is very slight you spoke differently yesterday said the german capitalist did i i didnt mean it i assure you we are as safe here as if we were riding in the interior of new york i suppose i was only whiling away a few idle minutes i am glad to hear it said the german i shouldnt like to meet any of these gentlemen nor i answered melville but i am prepared to give him or them a warm reception as he spoke he drew a revolver from his pocket he sat next to the door and in an exposed situation put up your shooting iron mr melville said col warner exhibiting a slight shade of annoyance let me exchange places with you i should prefer the post of danger if there is any you are very kind colonel said melville quietly but i dont care to change i am quite satisfied with my seat but my dear sir i insist said the colonel making a motion to rise keep your seat colonel i insist upon staying where i am answered melville he was physically far from formidable this young man but there was a resolute ring in his voice that showed he was in earnest really my dear sir said the colonel trying to conceal his annoyance you have been quite misled by my foolish talk i did not suppose you were so nervous possibly i may have a special reason for being so returned george melville what do you mean demanded the colonel quickly if you have we are all interested and ought to know it the colonel is right said the german if you know of any danger it is only fair to inform us all i am disposed to agree with you gentlemen said melville briefly then i have good reason to think that this company of passengers has been marked for plunder col warner started but quickly recovering himself he laughed uneasily tush he said i put no faith in it some one has been deceiving you my friend but the other passengers took it more seriously you evidently know something that we do not said parker i do answered melville col warner looked at him searchingly but did not speak now was the time to test george melvilles nerve he was about to take a bold step gentlemen he said i regret to say that i have every reason to believe there is a man in this stage who is in league with the road agents this statement naturally made a sensation there were seven passengers and each regarded the rest with newborn suspicion there seemed on the whole about as much reason to suspect one man as another and each with the exception of melville found himself looked upon with distrust pooh melville you must have had bad dreams said col warner who was the first to recover his selfpossession really i give you credit for a firstclass sensation as for you gentlemen you may take stock in this cockandbull story if you like i shall not i for one have no fear of my fellow passengers i regard them all as gentlemen and shall not allow myself to be disturbed by any silly fears the air of calm composure with which the colonel spoke served to tranquilize the rest of the passengers who wished to put credit in his assurance the colonel speaks sensibly said mr parker and unless mr melville assigns a reason for his remarkable belief i am disposed to think we have taken alarm too quick of course of course all sensible men will think so said the colonel my friend we shall be tempted to laugh at you if you insist on entertaining us with such hobgoblin fancies my advice is to put up that weapon of yours and turn your attention to the scenery which i can assure you gentlemen is well worthy of your admiration just observe the walls of yonder canyon and the trees growing on the points gentlemen said melville i should be glad to take the view of the last speaker if i had not positive proof that he is the man who has agreed to deliver us into the hands of a road agent within the space of half an i hour sir you shall answer for this exclaimed the colonel furiously as he struggled to secure the weapon his face livid with passion but two passengers one the german who though short was very powerful forcibly prevented him chapter xxvi a council of war are you sure of what you say asked a passenger turning with a puzzled look from george melville who in the midst of the general excitement produced by his revelation sat not unmoved indeed but comparatively calm courage and physical strength are by no means inseparable and this frail young man whose strength probably was not equal to herberts was fearless in the face of peril which would daunt many a stalwart sixfooter in reply to this very natural question george melville repeated the essential parts of the conversation which had taken place between col warner and the landlord col warners countenance changed and he inwardly execrated the imprudence that had made his secret plan known to one of the intended victims is this true col warner asked parker no its a lie returned the colonel with an oath gentlemen said george melville calmly you can choose which you will believe i will only suggest that this man managed very adroitly to find out where each one of us kept his money you can also consider whether i have any cause to invent this story it was clear that the passengers were inclined to put faith in melvilles story gentlemen said the colonel angrily i never was so insulted in my life i am a man of wealth traveling on business i am worth a quarter of a million at least to associate me with road agents whom i have as much reason to fear as you is most ridiculous this young man may be wellmeaning but he is under a most extraordinary hallucination it is my belief that he dreamed the nonsense he has been retailing to you ask the driver to stop the stage said mr benson a gentlman from philadelphia if mr melvilles story is trustworthy we may at any time reach the spot where the highwayman is lurking we must have a general consultation and decide what is to be done this proposal was approved and the driver drew up the stage i dont propose to remain in the company of men who so grossly misjudge me said the colonel with dignity as he made a motion to leave his fellow passengers stay here sir said mr benson in a tone of authority we cannot spare you yet do you dare to detain me sir exclaimed warner menacingly yes we do said the german just stay where you are mr colonel till we decide what to do as each one of the company had produced his revolver the colonel thought it prudent to obey i am disgusted with this fooling he said youre all a pack of cowards driver said george melville has this stage ever been robbed several times the driver admitted when was the last time two months since where did it happen about a mile further on did you ever see this gentleman before he asked pointing to the colonel yes answered the driver reluctantly when did he last ride with you on the day the stage was robbed answered the driver the passengers exchanged glances and then as by a common impulse all turned to col warner to see how he would take this damaging revelation disguise it as he might he was clearly disconcerted is this true colonel asked benson yes it is answered col warner with some hesitation i was robbed with the rest i had four hundred dollars in my wallet and the road agent made off with it and yet you just now poohpoohed the idea of a robbery and said such things were gone by i say so now returned the colonel sullenly i have a good deal of money with me but i am willing to take my chances doubtless your money would be returned to you in all probability if as we have reason to believe you have a secret understanding with the thieves who infest this part of the country your words are insulting let go my arm sir or it will be the worse for you softly softly my good friend said the german have you any proposal to make mr melville only this let us proceed on our journey but let each man draw his revolver and be ready to use it if need be what about the colonel he must go along with us we cannot have him communicating with our enemies outside suppose i refuse sir then my very good friend i think we shall use a little force said the german carelessly pointing his weapon at the captive i will go upon compulsion said the colonel but i protest against this outrage i am a wealthy capitalist from chicago who knows no more about road agents than you do you have been deceived by this unsophisticated young man who knows about as much of the world as a fouryearold child its a fine mares nest he has found this sneer did not disturb the equanimity of george melville i should be glad to believe the colonel were as innocent as he claims he said but his own words overheard last night contradict what he is now saying when we have passed the spot indicated for the attack we will release him and give him the opportunity he seeks of leaving our company the passengers resumed their places in the stage with the exception of herbert who again took his seat beside the driver george melville had not mentioned that it was herbert not himself who had overheard the conversation between the colonel and the land lord fearing to expose the boy to future risk col warner sat sullenly between the german and benson he was evidently ill at ease and his restless glances showed that he was intent upon some plan of escape of this however such was the vigilance of his guards there did not seem much chance the stage kept on its way till it entered a narrow roadway lined on one side by a thick growth of trees melville watching the colonel narrowly saw that in spite of his attempt at calmness his excitement was at fever heat the cause was very evident for at this point a tall figure bounded from the underbrush disguised by a black half mask through which a pair of black eyes blazed fiercely stop the stage he thundered to the driver or i will put a bullet through your head the driver as had been directed instantly obeyed chapter xxvii col warner changes front it may seem a daring thing for one man to stop a stage full of passengers and require them to surrender their money and valuables but this has been done time and again in unsettled portions of the west for the most part the stage passengers are taken by surprise and the road agent is known to be a desperado ready to murder in cold blood anyone who dares oppose him in the present instance however the passengers had been warned of their danger and were ready to meet it brown for of course the masked man was the landlord saw four revolvers leveled at him from inside the stage let go that horse my friend or you are a dead man said conrad stiefel calmly two can play at your game brown was taken by surprise but he was destined to be still more astonished col warner protruded his head from the window saying yes my friend you had better give up your little plan it wont work such language from his confederate on whom he fully relied wholly disconcerted the masked robber well ill be blowed he muttered staring in ludicrous perplexity at his fellow conspirator yes my friend said the colonel i shall really be under the necessity of shooting you myself if you dont leave us alone we are all armed and resolute i think you had better defer your little scheme brown was not quickwitted he did not see that his confederate was trying cunningly to avert suspicion from himself and taking the only course that remained to him of course he thought he was betrayed and was as a natural consequence exasperated he released his hold on the horses but fixing his eyes on the colonel fiercely muttered wait till i get a chance at you ill pay you for this what an idiot thought warner shrugging his shoulders why cant he see that i am forced to do as i am doing i must make things plain to him he spoke a few words rapidly in spanish which brown evidently understood his face showed a dawning comprehension of the state of affairs and he stood aside while the stage drove on what did you say asked conrad stiefel suspiciously you heard me sir said the colonel loftily you owe your rescue from this ruffian to me now you can understand how much you have misjudged me conrad stiefel was not so easily satisfied of this i heard what you said in mexican or whatever lingo it is but i didnt understand it nor i said benson very well gentlemen i am ready to explain i told this man that if he ever attempted to molest me i should shoot him in his track why didnt you speak to him in english asked stiefel because i had a suspicion that the fellow was the same i met once in mexico and i spoke to him in spanish to make sure as he understood i am convinced i was right who is it then asked benson his name sir is manuel de cordova a wellknown mexican bandit who seems to have found his way to this neighborhood he is a reckless desperado and though i addressed him boldly i should be very sorry to meet him in a dark night this explanation was very fluently spoken but probably no one present believed what the colonel said or exonerated him from the charge which george melville had made against him five miles further on col warner left the stage gentlemen he said i am sorry to leave this pleasant company but i have a mining claim in this neighborhood and must bid you farewell i trust that when you think of me hereafter you will acquit me of the injurious charges which have been made against me i take no credit to myself for driving away the ruffian who stopped us but hope you wont forget it no one interfered with the colonel when he proposed to leave the stage indeed the passengers were unanimous in accepting his departure as a relief in spite of his plausible representations he was regarded with general suspicion i wish i knew the meaning of that spanish lingo said the german conrad stiefel i can interpret it for you mr stiefel said george melville quietly i have some knowledge of spanish what did he say asked more than one eagerly he said you fool dont you see the plot has been discovered it wasnt my fault i will soon join you and explain this revelation made a sensation then he was in league with the road agent after all said parker certainly he was did you for a moment doubt it said melville i was staggered when i saw him order the rascal away he is a shrewd villain said benson i hope we shant encounter him again chapter xxviii the conspirators in council it is needless to say that col warners intention in leaving the stage was to join his fellow conspirator there was no advantage in remaining longer with his fellow travelers since the opportunity of plundering them had passed and for the present was not likely to return he had been a little apprehensive that they would try to detain him on suspicion which would have been awkward since they had numbers on their side and all were armed but in that unsettled country he would have been an elephant on their hands and if the idea entered the minds of any one of the stage passengers it was instantly dismissed when the stage was fairly on the way col warner went to a house where he was known and asked for a horse any news colonel asked the farmer as he called himself really he was in league with the band of which warner was the chief no answered the colonel gloomily no worse luck there might have been but for an unfortunate circumstance whats that theres plenty of good money in that stage coach and brown and i meant to have it but some sharpeared rascal heard us arranging the details of the plan and that spoiled it is it too late now asked the farmer eagerly we can follow them and overtake them yet if you say so and be shot for our pains no thank you they are all on the alert and all have their sixshooters in readiness no we must postpone our plan theres one of the fellows that i mean to be revenged upon yet the one that ferreted out our secret plan i must bide my time but i shall keep track of him soon the colonel wellmounted was on his way back to the rude inn where he had slept the night before dismounting he entered without ceremony and his eyes fell upon the landlords wife engaged in some household employment wheres brown he asked abruptly somewheres round was the reply how long has he been home a matter of two hours he came home awfully riled but he wouldnt tell me what it was about whats happened weve met with a disappointment thats whats the matter did the passengers get the better of you asked the woman for she was in her husbands guilty secrets and knew quite well what manner of man she had married they found out our little game answered warner shortly for he did not see any advantage in wasting words on his confederates wife which way did brown go yonder answered mrs brown pointing in a particular direction col warner tied his horse to a small sapling and walked in the direction indicated he found the landlord sullenly reclining beneath a large tree so youre back he said surveying warner with a lowering brow yes and a pretty mess youve made of the job said the landlord bitterly its as much your fault nay more said his superior coolly what do you mean demanded brown not over cordially you would persist in discussing our plan last night in my room though i warned you we might be overheard well we were overheard what spy listened to our talk the young man melville the one traveling with a boy he kept it to himself till the stage was well on its way and then he blabbed the whole thing to all in the stage did he mention you yes and you why didnt you tell him he lied and shoot him on the spot because i shouldnt have survived him five minutes answered the colonel coolly or if i had his companions would have lynched me brown didnt look as if he would have been inconsolable had this occurred in fact he was ambitious to succeed to the place held by the colonel as chief of a desperate gang of outlaws i might have been dangling from a branch of a tree at this moment had i followed your plan my good friend brown and that would have been particularly uncomfortable they might have shot me said brown sullenly i prevented that and gave you timely warning of course its a disappointment but we shall have better luck next time theyve got away yes but i propose to keep track of melville and the boy and have my revenge upon them in time i dont care so much about the money but they have foiled me and they must suffer for it meanwhile i want your help in another plan the two conferred together and mutual confidence was reestablished chapter xxix a new home in the woods george melville had no definite destination he was traveling not for pleasure but for health and his purpose was to select a residence in some high location where the dry air would be favorable for his pulmonary difficulties a week later he had found a temporary home one afternoon herbert and he each on horseback for at that time public lines of travel were fewer than at present came suddenly upon a neat onestory cottage in the edge of the forest it stood alone but it was evidently the home of one who aimed to add something of the graces of civilization to the rudeness of frontier life they reined up simultaneously and melville turning to herbert said there herbert is my ideal of a residence i should not be satisfied with a rude cabin there i should find something of the comfort which we enjoy in new england the situation is fine too said herbert looking about him admiringly the cottage stood on a knoll on either side were tall and stately trees a purling brook at the left rolled its silvery current down a gentle declivity and in front for half a mile was open country i have a great mind to call and inquire who lives here said melville perhaps we can arrange to stay here all night that is a good plan mr melville george melville dismounted from his horse and approaching tapped with the handle of his whip on the door whos there inquired a smothered voice as of one rousing himself from sleep a stranger but a friend answered melville there was a sound as of some one moving and a tall man clad in a rough suit came to the door and looked inquiringly at melville and his boy companion though his attire was rude his face was refined and had the indefinable air of one who would be more at home in the city than in the country delighted to see you both he said cordially offering his hand i dont live in a palace and my servants are all absent but if you will deign to become my guests i will do what i can for your comfort you have anticipated my request said melville let me introduce myself as george melville an invalid by profession just come from new england in search of health my young friend here is herbert carr my private secretary and faithful companion who has not yet found out what it is to be in poorhealth without him i should hardly have dared to come so far alone you are very welcome herbert said the host with pleasant familiarity come in both of you and make yourselves at home the cottage contained two rooms one was used as a bedchamber the other as a sitting room on the walls were a few pictures and on a small bookcase against one side of the room were some twentyfive books there was an easel and an unfinished picture in one corner and a small collection of ordinary furniture you are probably an artist suggested melville yes you have hit it i use both pen and pencil and he mentioned a name known to melville as that of a popular magazine writer i do not propose to give his real name but we will know him as robert falkland i am familiar with your name mr falkland said melville but i did not expect to find you here probably not answered falkland i left the haunts of civilization unexpectedly some months ago and even my publishers dont know where i am in search of health queried melville not exactly i did however feel in need of a change i had been running in a rut and wanted to get out of it so i left my lodgings in new york and bought a ticket to st louis arrived there i determined to come farther so here i have been living in communion with nature seeing scarcely anybody enjoying myself on the whole but sometimes longing to see a new face and you have built this cottage no i bought it of its former occupant but have done something towards furnishing it so that it has become characteristic of me and my tastes how long have you lived here three months but my stay is drawing to a close how is that business that will not be put off calls me back to new york in fact i had appointed tomorrow for my departure melville and herbert exchanged a glance it was evident that the same thought was in the mind of each mr falkland said george melville i have a proposal to make to you the artist eyed him in some surprise go on he said i will buy this cottage of you if you are willing falkland smiled this seems providential he said we artists and men of letters are apt to be short of money and i confess i was pondering whether my credit was good with anybody for a hundred dollars to pay my expenses east once arrived there there are plenty of publishers who will make me advances on future work then we can probably make a bargain said mr melville please name your price now i do not propose to show my ignorance of real estate values in colorado by naming the price which george melville paid for his home in the wilderness in fact i do not know i can only say that he gave falkland a check for the amount on a boston bank and a hundred in cash besides you are liberal mr melville said falkland gratified i am afraid you are not a business man i have not found that business men overpay you are right i am not a business man answered melville though i wish my health would admit of my being so as to the extra hundred dollars i think it worth that much to come upon so comfortable a home ready to my hand it will really be a home such as the log cabin i looked forward to could not be thank you said falkland i wont pretend that i am indifferent to money for i cant afford to be i earn considerable sums but unfortunately i never could keep money or provide for the future i dont know how it would be with me said melville for i am one of those fortunate or otherwise who are born to a fortune i have sometimes been sorry that i had not the incentive of poverty to induce me to work then suppose we exchange lots said the artist lightly i shouldnt object to being wealthy with all my heart answered melville give me your health your literary and artistic talent and it is a bargain i am afraid they are not transferable said the artist but we wont prolong the discussion now i am neglecting the rites of hospitality i must prepare supper for my guests you must know that here in the wilderness i am my own cook and dishwasher let me help you said melville no mr melville said herbert it is more in my line i have often helped mother at home and i dont believe you have had any experience i confess i am a green hand said melville laughing but as irish girls just imported say i am very willing on the whole i think the boy can assist me better said falkland so mr melville consider yourself an aristocratic visitor while herbert and myself sons of toil will minister to your necessities by the way where do you get your supplies asked melville eight miles away there is a mining camp and store i ride over there once a week or oftener and bring home what i need what is the name of the camp deer creek i will point out to herbert before i leave you the bridle path leading to it thank you it will be a great advantage to us to know just how to live with herberts help an appetizing repast was prepared of which all three partook with keen zest the next day falkland took leave of them and melville and his boy companion were left to settle down in their new home chapter xxx a terrible moment melvilles purchase comprised not only the cottage but its contents pictures and books included this was fortunate for though herbert who was strong and fond of outdoor sports such as hunting and fishing could have contented himself melville was easily fatigued and spent at least half of the day in the cabin the books most of which were new to him were a great and unfailing resource among the articles which falkland left behind him were two guns of which herbert and melville made frequent use herbert had a natural taste for hunting though at home having no gun of his own he had not been able to gratify his taste as much as he desired often after breakfast the two sallied forth and wandered about in the neighboring woods gun in hand generally melville returned first leaving herbert not yet fatigued to continue the sport in this way our hero acquired a skill and precision of aim which enabled him to make a very respectable figure even among old and practiced hunters one morning after melville had returned home herbert was led by the ardor of the chase to wander farther than usual he was aware of this but did not fear being lost having a compass and knowing his bearings all at once as he was making his way along a wooded path he was startled by hearing voices he hurried forward and the scene upon which he intruded was dramatic enough with arms folded a white man a hunter apparently stood erect and facing him at a distance of seventyfive or eighty feet was an indian with gun raised and leveled at the former why dont you shoot you red rascal said the white man youve got the drop on me i allow and i am in your power the indian laughed in his guttural way but though he held the gun poised he did not shoot he was playing with his victim as a cat plays with a mouse before she kills it is white man afraid said the indian not tauntingly but with real curiosity for among indians it is considered a great triumph if a warrior can inspire fear in his foe and make him show the white feather afraid retorted the hunter who should i be afraid of of indian dont flatter yourself you pesky savage returned the white man coolly ejecting a flood of tobacco juice from his mouth for though he was a brave man he had some drawbacks you neednt think i am afraid of you indian shoot suggested his enemy watching the effect of this announcement well shoot then and be done with it white man no want to live of course i want to live never saw a healthy white man that didnt if i was goin to die at all i wouldnt like to die by the hands of a red rascal like you indian great warrior said the dusky denizen of the woods straightening up and speaking complacently indian may be great warrior but he is a horse thief all the same said the hunter coolly white man soon die and indian wear his scalp remarked the indian in a manner likely to disturb the composure of even the bravest listener the hunters face changed it was impossible to reflect upon such a fate without a pang death was nothing to that final brutality ha white man afraid now said the indian triumphantly quick to observe the change of expression in his victim no i am not afraid said the hunter quickly recovering himself but its enough to disgust any decent man to think that his scalp will soon be dangling from the belt of a filthy heathen like you however i suppose i wont know it after im dead you have skulked and dogged my steps you red hound ever since i punished you for trying to steal my horse i made one great mistake instead of beating you i should have shot you and rid the earth of you once for all indian no forget white mans blows white man die and indian be revenged yes i spose thats what its coming to said the hunter in a tone of resignation i was a tarnal fool to come out this mornin without my gun if i had it you would sing a different song again the indian laughed a low guttural unpleasant laugh which herbert listened to with a secret shudder it was so full of malignity and cunning triumph and so suggestive of the fate which he reserved for his white foe that it aggravated the latter and made him impatient to have the blow fall since it seemed to be inevitable why dont you shoot you red savage he cried what are you waiting for the indian wished to gloat over the mental distress of his foe he liked to prolong his own feeling of power to enjoy the consciousness that at any moment he could put an end to the life of the man whom he hated for the blows which he felt had degraded him and which he was resolved never to forget or forgive it was the same feeling that has often led those of his race to torture their hapless victims that they may as long as possible enjoy the spectacle of their agonies for this reason he was in no hurry to speed on its way the fatal bullet again the indian laughed and taking aim made a feint of firing but withheld his shot pale and resolute his intended victim continued to face him he thought that the fatal moment had come and braced himself to meet his fate but he was destined to be disappointed how long is this goin to last you red hound he demanded if ive got to die i am ready indian can wait said the savage with a smile of enjoyment you wouldnt find it prudent to wait if i were beside you said the hunter its easy enough to threaten an unarmed man if some friend would happen along to foil you in your cowardly purpose white man send for friend suggested the indian tauntingly herbert had listened to this colloquy with varying emotions and his anger and indignation were stirred by the coldblooded cruelty of the savage he stood motionless seen by neither party but he held his weapon leveled at the indian ready to shoot at an instants warning brought up as he had been with a horror for scenes of violence and a feeling that human life was sacred he had a great repugnance to use his weapon even where it seemed his urgent duty to do so he felt that on him young as he was rested a weighty responsibility he could save the life of a man of his own color but only by killing or disabling a red man indian though he was his life too was sacred but when he threatened the life of another he forfeited his claim to consideration herbert hesitated till he saw it was no longer safe to do so till he saw that it was the unalterable determination of the indian to kill the hunter and then his face pale and fixed he pulled the trigger his bullet passed through the shoulder of the savage the latter uttered a shrill cry of surprise and dismay and his weapon fell at his feet while he pressed his left hand to his wounded shoulder the hunter amazed at the interruption which had been of such essential service to him lost not a moment in availing himself of it he bounded forward and before the savage well knew what he purposed he had picked up his fallen weapon and leveling it at his wounded foe fired his bullet was not meant to disable but to kill it penetrated the heart of the savage and staggering back he fell his face distorted with rage and disappointment the tables are turned my red friend said the hunter coolly its your life not mine this time at that moment herbert pale and shocked but relieved as well pressed forward and the hunter saw him for the first time was it you boy who fired the shot asked the hunter in surprise yes answered herbert then i owe you my life and thats a debt jack holden isnt likely to forget chapter xxxi jack holden on the indian question it is a terrible thing to see a man stretched out in death who but a minute before stood full of life and strength herbert gazed at the dead indian with a strange sensation of pity and relief and could hardly realize that but for his interposition it would have been the hunter not the indian who would have lost his life the hunter was more used to such scenes and his calmness was unruffled thats the end of the dog he said touching with his foot the dead body what made him want to kill you asked herbert revenge answered holden for what had you injured him thats the way he looked at it one day i caught the varmint stealin my best hoss hed have got away with him too if i hadnt come home just as i did i might have shot him most men would but i hate to take a mans life for stealin and i took another way my whip was lyin handy and i took it and lashed the rascal over his bare back a dozen times and then told him to dust or id serve him worse he left but there was an ugly look in his eyes and i knew well enough hed try to get even how long ago was this most a year its a long time but an indian never forgets an injury or an insult and i knew that he was only bidin his time so i always went armed and kept a good lookout it was only this mornin that he caught me at a disadvantage id been taking a walk and left my gun at home he was prowlin round and soon saw how things stood hed have killed me sure if you hadnt come in the nick of time i am glad i was near said herbert but it seems to me a terrible thing to shoot a man im glad it wasnt i that killed him mebbe it was better for me as he was my enemy said jack holden it wont trouble my conscience a mite i dont look upon an indian as a man why not hes a snake in the grass a poisonous serpent thats what i call him said jack holden herbert shook his head he couldnt assent to this you feel different no doubt youre a tenderfoot you aint used to the ways of these reptiles you havent seen what i have answered holden what have you seen asked herbert judging correctly that holden referred to some special experience ill tell you you see im an old settler in this western country ive traveled pretty much all over the region beyond the rockies and ive seen a good deal of the red men i know their ways as well as any man well i was trampin once in montany when one afternoon i and my pard he was prospectin came to a clearin and there we saw a sight that made us all feel sick it was the smokin ruins of a log cabin which them devils had set on fire but that wasnt what i referred to alongside there lay six dead bodies the man his wife two boys somewhere near your age a little girl of maybe ten and a baby all butchered by them savages layin in the hunters vernacular in their gore it was easy to see how theyd killed the baby by his broken skull they had seized the poor thing by the feet and swung him against the side of the house dashin out his brains herbert shuddered and felt sick as the picture of the ruined home and the wretched family rose before his imagination it was indians that did it of course proceeded holden theyre born savage and such things come natural to them are there no good indians asked the boy there may be answered jack holden doubtfully though i havent seen many theyre as scarce as plums in a boardin house puddin i reckon i present this as jack holdens view not mine he had the prejudices of the frontier and frontiersmen are severe judges of their indian neighbors they usually look at but one side of the picture and are not apt to take into consideration the wrongs which the indians have undeniably received there is another extreme however and the sentimentalists who deplore indian wrongs and represent them as a brave suffering and oppressed people are quite as far away from a just view of the indian question whats your name youngster asked holden with the curiosity natural under the circumstances herbert carr do you live nigh here herbert indicated as well as he could the location of his home i know you live with mr falkland are you his son no mr falkland has gone away youre not living there alone be you no i came out here with a young man mr melville he bought the cottage of mr falkland who was obliged to go east you dont say so why were neighbors i live three miles from here did you know mr falkland yes we used to see each other now and then he was a good fellow but mighty queer whats the use of settin down and paintin pictures whats the good of it all dont you admire pictures mr holden asked herbert thats that you called me i didnt quite catch on to it mr holden isnt that your name dont call me mister im plain jack holden call me jack i will if you prefer it said herbert dubiously of course i do we dont go much on style in the woods wont you come home with me and take a look at my cabin i aint used to company but we can sit down and have a social smoke together and then ill manage to find something to eat thank you mr holden i mean jack but i must be getting home mr melville will be feeling anxious for as it is i shall be late is mr melville as you call him any way kin to you no he is my friend and employer young man yes he is about twentyfive how long have you two been out here not much over a week why isnt melville with you this morning he is in delicate health consumption and he gets tired sooner than i do i must come over and see you i reckon i hope you will we get lonely sometimes if you would like to borrow something to read mr melville has plenty of books read repeated jack no thank you i dont care much for books a newspaper now is different a man likes to know whats going on in the world but i leave books to ministers schoolmasters and the like if you dont read how do you fill up your time jack my pipes better than any book lad im goin to set down and have a smoke now wish i had an extra pipe for you thank you said herbert politely but i dont smoke dont smoke how old are you sixteen sixteen years old and dont smoke why where was you raised in the east answered herbert smiling why i smoked before i was three foot high i was goin to say i couldnt get along without srnokin nor i without reading well folks will have their different tastes i allow i reckon ill be goin back shant you bury him asked herbert with a glance at the dead indian no he wouldnt have buried me but you wont leave him here if youll bury him ill help you not now boy since you make a point of it ill come round tomorrow and dig a hole to put him in ill take the liberty of carryin home his shootin iron he wont need it where hes gone the two parted in a friendly manner and herbert turned his face homeward grave and thoughtful chapter xxxii the blazing star mine toward noon the next day george melville and herbert were resting from a country trip sitting on a rude wooden settee which our hero had made of some superfluous boards and placed directly in front of the house when a figure was seen approaching with long strides from the shadow of the neighboring woods it was not until he was close at hand that herbert espied him why its mr holden he exclaimed jack holden my lad said the hunter correcting him is this the man youre living with jack holden was unconventional and had been brought up in a rude school so far as manners were concerned it did not occur to him that his question might have been better framed i am mr melville answered that gentleman seeing that herbert looked embarrassed herbert is my constant and valued companion hes a trump that boy continued holden why if it hadnt been for him thered been an end of jack holden yesterday herbert told me about it it was indeed a tragic affair the sacrifice of life is deplorable but seemed to have been necessary unless indeed you could have disabled him disabled him echoed the hunter that wouldnt have answered by a long shot as soon as the reptile got well hed have been on my trail agin no sir it was my life or his and i dont complain of the way things turned out have you buried him asked herbert yes ive shoved him under and its better than he deserved the sneakin rascal im glad to make your acquaintance mr melville didnt know i had changed neighbors till the boy there told me yesterday ive tramped over this mornin to give you a call you are very kind mr holden sit down here beside us im more at home here answered holden stretching himself on the ground and laying his gun beside him how do you like colorado very much as far as i have seen it said melville herbert probably told you my object in coming here he said you were ailin some way yes my lungs are weak since i have been here i am feeling better and stronger however there dont seem to be anything the matter with the boy nothing but a healthy appetite answered herbert smiling that wont hurt anybody mr melville do you smoke no thank you queer dont see how you can do without it why sir id been homesick without my pipe its company i tell you when a chaps alone and got no one to speak to i take it mr holden you are not here for your health no i should say not im tough as a hickory nut when i drop off its more likely to be an indian bullet than any disease im fortyseven years old and i dont know what it is to be sick you are fortunate mr holden i expect i am but i havent answered your question im interested in mines mr melville have you ever been to deer creek yes i went over with herbert to visit the store there one day last week did you ever hear of the blazing star mine no i believe not i own it said holden its a good mine and would make me rich if i had a little more money to work it are the indications favorable then asked melville it looks well if thats what you mean yes sir the star is a firstclass property then its a pity you dont work it thats what i say myself mr melville ive a proposal to make to you what is it mr holden if you could manage to call me jack it would seem more social like by all means then jack said melville smiling yon give me money enough to develop the mine and ill make half of it over to you how much is needed asked melville not over five hundred dollars its a bargain i tell you i do not myself wish to assume any business cares said melville jack holden looked disappointed just as you say he responded but herbert may feel differently continued melville id like the lad for a partner said holden briskly but i have no money said herbert in surprise george melville smiled if the mine is a good one he said i will advance you the money necessary for the purchase of a half interest if it pays you you may become rich then you can repay the money but suppose it doesnt mr melville objected herbert how can i ever repay you so large a sum on the whole herbert i will take the risk you are very kind mr melville said herbert his face glowing with anticipation to be half owner of a mine with the chance of making a large sum of money naturally elated him why shouldnt i be herbert but i want to see the mine first cant you go over this afternoon asked holden eager to settle the matter as soon as possible it is a long journey said melville hesitating you can stay overnight said jack holden and come back in the morning very well let us go then that is after dinner herbert if you will set the table we will see if we cant offer our friend here some refreshment he is hungry i am sure after his long walk youve hit it mr melville said holden i allow im as hungry as a wolf but you dont set down to table do you oh yes answered mr melville smiling pleasantly i aint used to it said holden but i was once anyhow it wont make no difference in the victuals when dinner was ready the three sat down and did ample justice to it but jack holden made such furious onslaughts that the other two could hardly keep pace with him fortunately there was plenty of food for melville did not believe in economical housekeeping after dinner they set out for deer creek as has been already explained it was the name of a mining settlement now by the way it is a prosperous town though the name has been changed then however everything was rude and primitive jack holden led the way to the blazing star mine and pointed out its capabilities and promise he waited with some anxiety for melvilles decision i dont understand matters very well said melville but i am willing to take a good deal on trust if you desire it i will buy half the mine paying you five hundred dollars for that interest that is i buy it for herbert hooray shouted holden give us your hand pard you are my partner now you know as he spoke he gripped herberts hand in a pressure which was so strong as to be painful and the necessary business was gone through so herbert found himself a half owner of the blazing star mine of deer creek colorado i hope your mine will turn out well herbert said melville smiling i wish it might for mothers sake said herbert seriously it wont be my fault if it dont said his partner i shall stay here now and get to work ought i not to help you asked herbert no mr melville will want you i will hire a man here to help me and charge it to your share of the expenses so the matter was arranged but herbert rode over twro or three times a week to look after his property chapter xxxiii good news from the mine well herbert what news from the mine asked melville two weeks later on herberts return from deer creek whither he had gone alone there are some rich developments so jack says do you know mr melville he says the mine is richly worth five thousand dollars bravo herbert that would make your half worth twentyfive hundred yes said the boy complacently if we could sell at that figure i could pay you back and have two thousand dollars of my own think of that mr melville continued herbert his eyes glowing with pride and pleasure shouldnt i be a rich boy you may do even better herbert dont be in a hurry to sell that is my advice if the present favorable indications continue you may realize a considerably larger sum so jack says he says he is bound to hold on and hopes i will you are in luck herbert yes mr melville and i dont forget that it is to you i am indebted for this good fortune said the boy earnestly if you hadnt bought the property for me i could not i dont know but you ought to get some share ef the profits george melville shook his head my dear boy he said i have more than my share of money already sometimes i feel ashamed when i compare my lot with others and consider that for the money i have i have done no work the least i can do is to consider myself the lords trustee and do good to others when it falls in my way i wish all rich men thought as you do mr melville the world would be happier said herbert true herbert i hope and believe there is a considerable number who like myself feel under obligations to do good i shall be very glad on mothers account if i can go home with money enough to make her independent of work by the way mr melville i found a letter from mother in the deer creek post office shall i read it to you if there is nothing private in it herbert there is nothing private from you mr melville it may be explained that deer creek had already obtained such prominence that the postoffice department had established an office there and learning this herbert had requested his mother to address him at that place he drew the letter from his pocket and read it aloud we quote the essential portions i am very glad to hear that you have made the long journey in safety and are now in health herbert had not mentioned in his home letter the stagecoach adventure for he knew that it would disturb his mother to think that he had been exposed to such a risk it will do no good you know he said to mr melville and his friend had agreed with him it is very satisfactory to me continued herbert reading from the letter that you are under the charge of mr melville who seems to me an excellent conscientious young man from whom you can learn only good your mother thinks very kindly of me said melville evidently pleased she is right too mr melville said herbert with emphasis it will no doubt be improving to you my dear herbert to travel under such pleasant auspices for a boy can learn from observation as well as from books i miss you very much but since the separation is for your advantage i can submit to it cheerfully you ask me about my relations with mr graham i am still in the post office and thus far nearly the whole work devolves upon me except in one respect i am well treated mr g is as you know very penurious and grudges every cent that he has to pay out when he paid me last saturday night the small sum for which i agreed to assist him he had much to say about his large expenses fuel lights etc and asked me if i wouldnt agree to work for two dollars a week instead of three i confess i was almost struck dumb by such an exhibition of meanness and told him that it would be quite impossible since then he has spent some of the time himself in the office and asked me various questions about the proper way of preparing the mail etc and i think it is his intention if possible to get along without me i dont know if he absolutely insists upon it but it would be better to accept the reduction than to give up altogether two dollars a week will count in my small household did you ever hear of such meanness mr melville demanded herbert indignantly here is mr graham making i am sure two thousand dollars a year clear profit and yet anxious to reduce mother from three to two dollars a week it is certainly a very small business herbert i think some men become meaner by indulgence of their defect i shall write mother to give up the place sooner than submit to such a reduction three dollars a week is small enough in all conscience i approve the advice herbert if mr graham were really cramped for money and doing a poor business it would be different as it is it seems to me he has no excuse for his extreme penuriousness how pleasant it would be to pay a flying visit to wayneboro said herbert thoughtfully one never appreciates home until he has left it that pleasure must be left for the future it will keep very true and when i do go home i want to go well fixed herbert had already caught the popular western phrase for a man well to do we must depend on the blazing star mine for that said melville smiling my young readers may like to know that while herbert was prospering financially he did not neglect the cultivation of his mind among the books left by mr falkland were a number of standard histories some elementary books in french including a dictionary a treatise on natural philosophy and a german grammar and reader do you know anything of french or german mr melville inquired our hero when they made their first examination of the library yes herbert i am a tolerable scholar in each i wish i were would you like to study them yes very much then i will make you a proposal you are likely to have considerable time at your disposal if you will study either or both i will be your teacher i should like nothing better said herbert eagerly moreover if you wish to study philosophy i will aid you though we are not in a position to illustrate the subject by experiments herbert was a sensible boy moreover he was fond of study and he saw at once how advantageous this proposal was he secured a private tutor for nothing and as he soon found an excellent one though mr melville had never been a teacher he had an unusual aptitude for teaching and it is hard to decide whether he or herbert enjoyed more the hours which they now regularly passed in the relation of teacher and pupil it must be said also that while george melville evinced an aptitude for teaching herbert showed an equal aptitude for learning the tasks which he voluntarily undertook most boys would have found irksome but he only found them a source of pleasure and had the satisfaction after a very short time to find himself able to read ordinary french and german prose with comparative ease i never had a better pupil said george melville i believe i am the first you ever had said herbert laughing that is true i spoke as if i were a veteran teacher then i wont be too much elated by the compliment chapter xxxiv two old acquaintances reappear in the rude hotel kept by the outlaw whom we have introduced under the name of brown there sat two men to neither of whom will my readers need an introduction they have already appeared in our story one was brown himself the other col warner or as we may as well confess jerry lane known throughout the west as an unscrupulous robber and chief of a band of road agents whose depredations had been characterized by audacity and success brown was ostensibly an innkeeper but this business honest enough in itself only veiled the mans real trade in which he defied alike the laws of honesty and of his country the other was by turns a gentleman of property a merchant a cattle owner or a speculator in all of which characters he acted excellently and succeeded in making the acquaintance of men whom he designed to rob the two men wore a sober look in their business as in those more legitimate there are good times and dull times and of late they had not succeeded i want some money captain said brown sullenly laying down a black pipe which he had been smoking so do i brown answered warner as we will continue to call him its a dry time with me you dont understand me captain continued brown i want you to give me some money first you must tell me where i am to get it answered warner with a shrug of his shoulders do you mean to say you have no money asked brown frowning how should i have because in all our enterprises you have taken the lions share though you havent always done the chief part you cant have spent the whole no not quite but i have nothing to spare i need to travel about and youve got a soft thing grumbled brown you go round and have a good time while i am tied down to this fourthrate tavern in the woods well it isnt much more than that said warner musingly do you expect me to keep a firstclass hotel demanded brown defiantly no of course not brown continued warner soothingly dont let us quarrel we cant afford it let us talk together reasonably what have you to say this that it isnt my fault if things have gone wrong was it my fault that we found so little cash in that last store we broke open nineteen dollars muttered brown contemptuously nineteen dollars as you say it didnt pay us for our trouble well i was as sorry as you i fail to see how it was my fault better luck next time when is the next time to be asked brown somewhat placated as soon as you please what is it i will tell you you remember that stagecoach full of passengers that fooled us some time since i ought to i always meant to get on the track of that melville who spoiled our plot by overhearing us and giving us away to the passengers he is very rich so the boy who was with him told me and i have every reason to rely upon his statement well i want to be revenged upon him and at the same time to relieve him of the doubtless large sum of money which he keeps with him im with you where is he i have only recently ascertained no matter how he lives in a small cabin far from any other about eight miles from the mining town of deer creek i know the place precisely no one lives there with him except the boy and it would be easy enough to rob him i saw a man from deer creek yesterday he tells me that melville has bought for the boy a half share in a rich mine and is thought to have at least five thousand dollars in gold and bills in his cabin browns eyes glistened with cupidity that would be a big haul he said of course it would now brown while you have been grumbling at me i have been saving this little affair for our benefit yours and mine we wont let any of the rest of them into it but whatever we find we will divide and share alike do you mean this captain yes i mean it friend brown you shant charge me with taking the lions share in this case if there are five thousand dollars as my informant seems to think your share shall be half twentyfive hundred dollars exactly twentyfive hundred dollars that will pay for my hard luck lately said brown his face clearing very handsomely too when shall we start tomorrow morning we will set out early in the morning and by the way brown its just as well not to let your wife or anyone else know where we are going all right answered brown cheerfully the next morning the two worthies set out their far from meritorious errand brown told his wife vaguely in reply to her questioning that he was called away for a few days on business if he expected to evade further question by this answer he was mistaken mrs brown was naturally of a jealous and suspicious temperament and doubt was excited in her breast where shall i say you have gone if i am asked she said you may say that you dont know answered brown brusquely i dont think much of a man who keeps secrets from his wife said mrs brown coldly and i dont think much of a man who tells everything to his wife retorted brown its all right kitty you neednt concern yourself but the captain and i are on an expedition which to be successful needs to be kept secret mrs brown was not more than half convinced but she was compelled to accept this statement for her husband would vouchsafe no other that part of the state into which they journeyed was not new ground to either they were familiar with all the settled portion of colorado and had no difficulty in finding the cabin occupied by george melville now it happened that they reached the modest dwelling in the woods about three oclock in the afternoon herbert had ridden over to deer creek to look after his mining property and it was not yet time to expect him back george melville was therefore left alone knowing as my young readers do his literary tastes they will understand that though left alone he was not lonely the stock of books which he had bought from his predecessor was to him an unfailing resource moreover he had taken up italian of which he knew a little and was reading in the original the divina comedia of dante a work which consumed many hours and was not likely soon to be over today however for some reason melville found it more difficult than usual to fix his mind upon his pleasant study was it a presentiment of coming evil that made him so unusually restless at all events the hours which were wont to be fleetfooted passed with unusual slowness and he found himself longing for the return of his young friend i dont know what has got into me today said melville to himself its only three oclock yet the day seems very long i wish herbert would return i feel uneasy i dont know why i hope it is not a presage of misfortune i shall not be sure that something has not happened to herbert till i see him again as he spoke george melville rose from his chair and was about to put on his hat and take a short walk in the neighboring woods when he heard the tramp of approaching horses looking out from the window he saw two horsemen close at hand he started in dismay for in the two men he was at no loss in recognizing his stagecoach companion col warner and the landlord who had essayed the part of a road agent chapter xxxv melville in peril col warner and his companion enjoyed the effect of their presence upon their intended victim and smiled in a manner that boded little good to melville as they dismounted from their steeds and advanced to the door of the cabin how are you melville said warner ironically i see you have not forgotten me no i have not forgotten you answered melville regarding his visitor uneasily this is my friend mr brown perhaps you remember him i do remember him and the circumstances under which i last saw him replied melville rather imprudently brown frowned but he did not speak he generally left his companion to do the talking being in the neighborhood we thought wed call upon you continued col warner walk in gentlemen if you see fit said melville i suppose it would be only polite to say that i am glad to see you but i have some regard for truth and cannot say it i admire your candor mr melville walk in brown ha upon my word you have a nice home here didnt expect to see anything of the kind in this wilderness books and pictures really now brown i am quite tempted to ask our friend melville to entertain us for a few days i dont think it would suit you said melville dryly you are probably more fond of exciting adventure than of books does the boy live with you asked warner dropping his bantering tone and looking about his searchingly yes he is still with me i dont see him because he has gone to deer creek on business when melville saw the rapid glance of satisfaction interchanged by the two visitors he realized that he had made an imprudent admission he suspected that their design was to rob him and he had voluntarily assured them that he was alone and that they could proceed without interruption sorry not to see him said warner id like to renew our pleasant acquaintance melville was about to reply that herbert would be back directly when it occurred to him that this would be a fresh piece of imprudence it would doubtless lead them to proceed at once to the object of their visit while if he could only keep them till his boy companion did actually return they would at least be two to two even then they would be by no means equally matched but something might occur to help them i suppose herbert will return by evening he replied you can see him if you remain till then another expression of satisfaction appeared upon the faces of his two visitors but for this he was prepared sorry we cant stay till then said warner but business of importance will limit our stay eh brown i dont see the use of delaying at all growled brown who was not as partial as his companion to the feline amusement of playing with his intended victim with him on the contrary it was a word and a blow and sometimes the blow came first come to business continued brown impatiently addressing his associate that is my purpose friend brown mr melville it is not solely the pleasure of seeing you that has led my friend and myself to call this afternoon melville nodded so i supposed he said there is a little unfinished business between us as you will remember i owe you a return for the manner in which you saw fit to throw suspicion upon me some time since when we were traveling together i shall be very glad to have you convince me that i did you an injustice said melville i was led to believe that you and your friend now present were leagued together to rob us of our money and valuables if it was not so you were not very far from right mr melville still it was not polite to express your suspicions so rudely besides you were instrumental in defeating our plan i cant express any regret for that col warner or jerry lane as i suppose that is your real name i am jerry lane said warner proudly i may as well confess it since it is well that you should know with whom you have to deal when i say that i am jerry lane you will understand that i mean business i do answered melville quietly you know me by reputation said the outlaw with a curious pride in his unenviable notoriety i do what do men say of me that you are at the head of a gang of reckless assassins and outlaws and that you have been implicated in scores of robberies and atrocities this was not so satisfactory young man said lane to drop his false name i advise you to be careful how you talk it may be the worse for you now to come to business how much money have you in the house why do you ask and by what right we propose to take it now answer my question gentlemen you will be very poorly paid for the trouble you have taken in visiting me i have very little money of course you say so we want an answer as well as i can remember i have between forty and fifty dollars in my pocketbook brown uttered an oath under his breath and lane looked uneasy thats a lie said brown speaking first we were told you had five thousand dollars here your informant was badly mistaken then i am not very wise perhaps in worldly matters but i certainly am not such a fool as to keep so large a sum of money in a lonely cabin like this perhaps not so much as that returned lane i dont pretend to say how much you have that is for you to tell us george melville drew from his pocket a wallet and passed it to the outlaw count the money for yourself if you wish he said you can verify my statement lane opened the wallet with avidity and drew out the contents it was apparent at the first glance that the sum it contained was small it was counted however and proved to amount to fortyseven dollars and a few silver coins the two robbers looked at each other in dismay was it possible that this was all if so they would certainly be very poorly paid for their trouble do you expect us to believe mr melville said jerry lane sternly that this is all the money you have in this cabin yes we are not so easily fooled it is probably all you carry about with you but you have more concealed somewhere about the premises it will be best for you to produce at once unless you are ready to pass in your checks that means said melville growing pale in spite of himself for he knew from report the desperate character of his guests that means i suppose that you will kill me unless i satisfy your rapacity it does said lane curtly now for your answer gentlemen i cannot accomplish impossibilities it is as i say the money in your hands is all that i have by me do you mean to deny that you are rich asked lane no i do not deny it that is not the point in question you ask me to produce all the money i have with me i have done so do you believe this brown asked the captain turning to his subordinate no i dont it is strictly true then said brown you deserve to die for having no more money for us true chimed in lane once more will you produce your secret hoard i have none then you must be dealt with in the usual way brown have you a rope yes is there a convenient tree near by well find one the two seized melville and despite his resistance dragged him violently from the cabin and adjusted a rope about his neck the young man was pale and gave himself up for lost chapter xxxvi the mine is sold while his friend was in peril where was herbert for him too it had been an exciting day deer creek had been excited by the arrival of a capitalist from new york whose avowed errand it was to buy a mine reports from deer creek had turned his steps thither and all the mine owners were on the qui vive to attract the attention of the monied man it was understood that he intended to capitalize the mine when purchased start a company and work it by the new and improved methods which had replaced the older and ruder appliances at first employed mr compton though not a mining expert was a shrewd man who weighed carefully the representations that were made to him and reserved his opinion it was clear that he was not a man who would readily be taken in though there were not wanting men at deer creek who were ready to palm off upon him poor or worthless mines about the only mine owners who did not seek him were the owners of the blazing star both of whom were on the ground the mine was looking up the most recent developments were the most favorable and the prospects were excellent they might indeed peter out as the expression is but it did not seem likely jack said herbert shall we invite mr compton to visit our mine no answered jack holden i am willing to keep it wouldnt you sell yes if i could get my price what is your price twentyfive thousand dollars for the whole mine that is twelve thousand five hundred for mine said herbert his cheek flushing with the excitement he felt youve figured it out right my lad said his partner that would leave me twelve thousand after i have paid up mr melville for the sum i paid in the beginning right again my lad why jack exclaimed herbert do you know what that means it means that i should be rich that my mother could move into a nicer house that we could live at ease for the rest of our lives would twelve thousand dollars do all that no but it would give me a fund that would establish me in business and relieve me of all anxiety jack its too bright to be real we may not be able to sell the mine at that figure herbert dont let us count our chickens before they are hatched or we may be disappointed im as willin to keep the mine as to sell it jack here is mr compton coming said herbert the capitalist paused and addressing herbert said have you anything to do with the mine my lad i am half owner answered herbert promptly and not without pride who is the other half owner mr holden answered herbert pointing out jack may i examine the mine you are quite welcome to sir possibly the fact that this mine alone had not been pressed upon him for purchase predisposed mr compton to regard it with favor every facility was offered him and jack holden who thoroughly understood his business gave him the necessary explanations after an hour spent in the examination mr compton came to business is the mine for sale he asked yes sir what is your price twentyfive thousand dollars is that your lowest price it is jack holden wasted no words in praising the mine and this produced a favorable impression on the capitalist with whom he was dealing ill take it he answered then its a bargain herbert found it difficult to realize that these few words had made him a rich boy he remained silent but in his heart he was deeply thankful not so much for himself as because he knew that he was now able to rejoice his mothers heart and relieve her from all pecuniary cares or anxieties youve made a good bargain sir if i do say it said jack holden for my own part i wasnt so particular about selling the mine but my young partner here is differently placed and the money will come handy to him you are rather young for a mine owner said mr compton regarding herbert with some curiosity yes sir i believe i am the youngest mine owner here are you a resident of this state only temporarily sir i came here with a friend whose lungs are weak you expect to return to the east soon yes sir when you do come to see me i am a commission merchant in boston if it is your intention to follow a business life i may be able to find you a place thank you sir i should like nothing better tomorrow said mr compton i will come here and complete the purchase jack said herbert when the new purchaser of the mine had left them there is no work for us here come with me and let us together tell mr melville the good news a good thought my lad so the two mounted their horses and left deer creek behind them they little suspected how sorely they were needed chapter xxxvii to the rescue herbert and his companion drew near the forest cabin which had been the home of the former without a suspicion that george melville was in such dire peril the boy was indeed thinking of him but it was rather of the satisfaction his employer would feel at his good fortune somehow i feel in a great hurry to get there jack said herbert i shall enjoy telling mr melville of my good luck hes a fine chap that melville said jack holden meaning no disrespect by this unceremonious fashion of speech that he is hes the best friend i ever had jack returned herbert warmly its a pity hes ailing oh hes much stronger than he was when he came out here all the unfavorable symptoms have disappeared maybe hell outgrow it i had an uncle that was given up to die of consumption when he was about melvilles age and he died only last year at the age of seventyfive that must have been slow consumption jack said herbert smiling if mr melville can live as long as that i think neither he nor his friends will have reason to complain is he so rich lad i dont know how rich but i know he has plenty of money how much power a rich man has said herbert musingly now mr melville has changed my whole life for me when i first met him i was working for three dollars a week now i am worth twelve thousand dollars herbert repeated this with a beaming face the good news had not lost the freshness of novelty there was so much that he could do now that he was comparatively rich to do herbert justice it was not of himself principally that he thought it was sweet to reflect that he could bring peace and joy and independence to his mother after all it is the happiness we confer that brings us the truest enjoyment the selfish man who eats and drinks and lodges like a prince but is unwilling to share his abundance with others knows not what he loses even boys and girls may try the experiment for themselves for one does not need to be rich to give pleasure to others come jack let us ride faster i am in a hurry said herbert when they were perhaps a quarter of a mile distant from the cabin they emerged from the forest and could now see the cottage and its surroundings they saw something that almost paralyzed them george melville with a rope round his neck stood beneath a tree col warner was up in the tree swinging the rope over a branch while brown big burly and brutal pinioned the helpless young man in his strong arms good heavens do you see that exclaimed herbert it is the road agents quick or we shall be too late jack had seen he had not only seen but he had already acted quick as thought he raised his weapon and covered brown there was a sharp report and the burly ruffian fell his heart pierced by the unerring bullet herbert dashed forward and seizing the rope released his friend thank heaven herbert you have saved my life murmured melville in tones of heartfelt gratitude theres another of them exclaimed jack holden looking up into the tree and he raised his gun once more dont shoot exclaimed the man whom we know best as col warner ill come down so he did but not in the manner he expected in his flurry for he was not a brave man outlaw though he was he lost his hold and fell at the feet of holden what shall we do with him mr melville asked jack he deserves to die dont kill him bind him and give him up to the authorities i hate to let him off so easy said jack but he did as melville wished but the colonel had a short reprieve on his way to jail a bullet from some unknown assailant pierced his temple and jerry lane the notorious road agent died as he had lived by violence chapter xxxviii conclusion it had been the intention of george melville to remain in colorado all winter but his improved health and the tragic event which i have just narrated conspired to change his determination herbert he said when the business connected with the sale of the mine had been completed how would you like to go home with you yes you dont suppose i would remain here alone if you feel well enough mr melville there is nothing i should like better i do feel well enough if i find any unfavorable symptoms coming back i can travel again but i am anxious to get away from this place where i have come so near losing my life at the hands of the outlaws there was little need of delay their preparations were soon made there was an embarrassment about the cottage but that was soon removed ill buy it of you mr melville said jack holden i cant sell it to you mr holden i will give you a fair price you dont understand me said george melville smiling i will not sell it because i prefer to give it thank you mr melville but you know i am not exactly a poor man the sale of the mine jack said melville with emotion would you have me forget that it is to you and herbert that i owe my rescue from a violent and ignominious death i want no pay for that mr melville no i am sure you dont but you will accept the cabin not as pay but as a mark of my esteem upon that ground jack accepted the cottage with pleasure herbert tried to tempt him to make a visit to the east but he was already in treaty for another mine and would not go the two stayed a day in chicago on their way to boston i wonder if eben is still here thought herbert he soon had his question answered in passing through a suburban portion of the great city he saw a young man sawing wood in front of a mean dwelling while a stout negro was standing near with his hands in his pockets surveying the job he was the proprietor of a colored restaurant and eben was working for him alas for eben the once spruce drygoods clerk was now a miserablelooking tramp so far as outward appearances went his clothes were not only ragged but soiled and the spruce city acquaintances whom he once knew would have passed him without recognition eben eben turned swiftly as he heard his name called and a flush of shame overspread his face is it you herbert he asked faintly yes eben you dont seem very prosperous i never thought i should sink so low answered eben mournfully as to saw wood for a colored man what are you talkin about interrupted his boss angrily aint i as good as a worfless white man that begged a meal of vittles of me coz he was starvin you jest shut up your mouf and go to work eben sadly resumed his labor herbert pitied him in spite of his folly and wickedness eben do you owe this man anything he added yes he does he owes me for his dinner dont you go to interfere returned the colored man how much was your dinner worth asked herbert putting his hand into his pocket it was wuf a quarter there is your money now eben come with me ive been very unfortunate wailed eben would you like to go back to wayneboro asked herbert yes anywhere answered eben eagerly i cant make a livin here i have almost starved sometimes eben ill make a bargain with you if i will take you home will you turn over a new leaf and try to lead a regular and industrious life yes ill do it answered eben then ill take you with me tomorrow i shouldnt like my old friends to see me in these rags said eben glancing with shame at his tattered clothes they shall not come with me and i will rig you out anew youre a good fellow herbert said eben gratefully im sorry for the way i treated you then its all right said herbert herbert kept his promise he took eben to a barber shop where there were also baths having previously purchased him a complete outfit and eben emerged looking once more like the spruce drygoods salesman of yore one day not long afterwards mrs carr was sitting in her little sitting room sewing she had plenty of leisure for this work now for mr graham had undertaken to attend to the postoffice duties himself it was natural that she should think of her absent boy from whom she had not heard for a long time when shall i see him again she thought wearily there was a knock at the outer door she rose to open it but before she could reach it it flew open and her boy taller and handsomer than ever was in her arms oh herbert it was all she could say but the tone was full of joy how i have missed you we will be together now mother i hope so herbert perhaps you can find something to do in wayneboro and even if it doesnt pay as well mother interrupted herbert laughing is that the way to speak to a rich boy like me rich yes mother i bring home twelve thousand dollars mrs carr could not believe it at first but herbert told his story and she gave joyful credence at last eben did not receive as warm a welcome but finally his father was propitiated and agreed to give his son employment in his own store hes there yet his hard experience in the west has subdued his pride and he has really turned over a new leaf as he promised herbert his father will probably next year give him a quarter interest in the firm and the firms name will be ebenezer graham son herbert and his mother have moved to boston our hero is learning business in the counting room of mr compton they live in a pleasant house at the south end and mr melville restored to a very fair measure of health is boarding or rather has his home with them he is devoting his time to literary pursuits and i am told that he is the author of a brilliant paper in a recent number of the north american review herbert finds some time for study and under the guidance of his friend and former employer he has already become a very creditable scholar in french german and english literature he enjoys his present prosperity all the better for the hardships through which he passed before reaching it the end
