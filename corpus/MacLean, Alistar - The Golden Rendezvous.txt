the golden rendezvous by allister mclean all of the characters in this book are fictitious and any resemblance to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental chapter my shirt was no longer a shirt but just a limp and sticky rag soaked with sweat my feet ached from the fierce heat of the steel deck plates my forehead under the peaked white cap ached from the everincreasing constriction of the leather band that made scalping only a matter of time my eyes ached from the steely glitter of reflected sunlight from metal water and whitewashed harbour buildings and my throat ached from pure thirst i was acutely unhappy i was unhappy the crew was unhappy the passengers were unhappy captain bullen was unhappy and this last made me doubly unhappy not because of any tenderness of feeling that i entertained towards the captain but because when things went wrong with captain bullen he invariably took it out of his chief officer i was his chief officer i was bending over the rail listening to the creak of wire and wood and watching our after jumbo derrick take the strain as it lifted a particularly large crate from the quayside when a hand touched my arm captain bullen again i thought drearily it had been at least half an hour since hed been around last to talk to me about my shortcomings and then i realised that whatever the captains caprices wearing chanel no he wasnt one of them this would be miss beresford and it was in addition to the chanel she was wearing a white silk dress and that quizzical halfamused smile that made most of the other officers turn mental cartwheels and handsprings but served only to irritate me i have my weaknesses but tall cool sophisticated and worldly young women with a slightly malicious sense of humour is not one of them good afternoon mr first officer she said sweetly she had a soft musical voice with hardly a hint of superiority or condescension when talking to the lower orders like myself just enough to show that she had been to the best school and college in the east and i hadnt weve been wondering where you were you are not usually an absentee at aperitif time i know miss beresford im sorry what she said was true enough what she didnt know was that i turned up for aperitifs with the passengers more or less at the point of a gun standing company orders stated that it was as much a part of the ships officers duties to entertain the passengers as to sail the ship and as captain bullen loathed all passengers with a fierce and total loathing he saw to it that most of the entertaining fell to me i nodded at the big crate now hovering over the hatchway of number four hold then at the piledup crates at the quayside im afraid i have work to do four or five hours at least cant even manage lunch today far less an aperitif not miss beresford susan it was as if she had heard only my first few words how often do i have to ask you until we reach new york i said to myself and even then it will be no use aloud i said smiling you mustnt make things difficult for me regulations require that we treat all passengers with courtesy consideration and respect and selfrespect made me resent the young and unmarried female passengers who regarded me as a source of idle amusement for their all too many idle hours particularly was this true with rich young idle females and it was common knowledge that julius a beresford required the fulltime services of a whole corps of accountants just to tot up his annual profits especially with respect miss beresford i finished youre hopeless she laughed i was too tiny a pebble to cause even a ripple in her smiling pool of complacency and no lunch you poor man i thought you were looking pretty glum as i came along she glanced at the winch driver then at the seamen manhandling the suspended crate into position on the floor of the hold your men dont seem too pleased at the prospect either they are a morose looking lot i eyed them briefly they were a moroselooking lot oh theyll be spelled for food all right its just that they have their own private worries it must be about a hundred and ten down in that hold there and its an almost unwritten law that white crews should not work in the afternoons m the tropics besides theyre all still brooding darkly over the losses theyve suffered dont forget that its less than seventytwo hours since they had that brush with the customs down in jamaica brush i thought was good in what might very accurately be described as one fell swoop the customs had confiscated from about forty crew members no fewer than twentyfive thousand cigarettes and over two hundred bottles of hard liquor that should have been placed on the ships bond before arrival in jamaican waters that the liquor had not been placed in bond was understandable enough as the crew were expressly forbidden to have any in their quarters in the first place that not even the cigarettes had been placed in bond had been due to the crews intention of following their customary practice of smuggling both liquor and tobacco ashore and disposing of them at a handsome profit to jamaicans more than willing to pay a high price for the luxury of dutyfree kentucky bourbon and american cigarettes but then the crew had not been to know that for the first time in its five years service on the west indian run the ss campari was to be searched from stem to stern with a thorough ruthlessness that spared nothing that came in its path a high and searching wind that swept the ship clean as a whistle it had been a black day and so was this even as miss beresford was patting me consolingly on the arm and murmuring a few farewell words of sympathy which didnt go any too well with the twinkle in her eyes i caught sight of captain bullen perched on top of the companionway leading down from the main deck glowering would probably be the most apt term to describe the expression on his face as he came down the companionway and passed miss beresford he made a heroic effort to twist his features into the semblance of a smile and managed to hold it for all of two seconds until he had passed her by then got back to his glowering again for a man who is dressed in gleaming whites from top to toe to give the impression of a black approaching thundercloud is no small feat but captain bullen managed it without any trouble he was a big man six feet two and very heavily built with sandy hair and eyebrows a smooth red face that no amount of sun could ever tan and a clear blue eye that no amount of whisky could ever dim he looked at the quayside the hold and then at me all with the same impartial disfavour well mister he said heavily hows it going miss beresford giving you a hand eh when he was in a bad mood it was invariably mister in a neutral mood it was first and when in a good temperwhich to be fair was most of the time it was always johnnymeboy but today it was mister i took my guard accordingly and ignored the implied reproof of timewasting he would be gruffly apologetic the next day he always was not too bad sir bit slow on the dockside i nodded to where a group of men some bearded all wearing denim trousers and vaguely militarylooking shirts were struggling to attach chain slings to a crate that must have been at least eighteen feet in length by six square i dont think the carracio stevedores are accustomed to handling such heavy lifts he took a good look they couldnt handle a damned wheelbarrow he snapped eventually never seen such fumblehanded incompetence in my blasted life first time in this stinking flearidden hellhole carracio was actually one of the cleanest and most picturesquely beautiful ports in the caribbeanand i hope to heaven its the last can you manage it by six mister six oclock was an hour past the top of the tide and we had to clear the harbour entrance sand bar by then or wait another ten hours i think so sir and then to take his mind off his troubles and also because i was curious i asked what are in those crates motorcars motorcars are you mad his cold blue eye swept over the whitewashed jumble of the little town and the dark green of the steeply rising forested hills behind this lot couldnt build a rabbit hutch for export far less a motorcar machinery so the bills of lading say dynamos generators refrigerating airconditioning and refueling machinery for new york do you mean to tell me i said carefully that the generalissimo having successfully completed the confiscation of all the american sugarrefining mills is now dismantling them and selling the machinery back to the americans barefaced theft like that jetty larceny on the part of the individual is theft captain bullen said morosely when governments engage in grand larceny its economics but itll be all perfectly legal ive no doubt but it still doesnt make me feel less of a contraband runner but if we dont do it someone else will and the freight rates double the normal which makes the generalissimo and his government pretty desperate for money what do you think bullen growled no one knows how many were killed in the capital and a dozen other towns in tuesdays hunger riots jamaican authorities reckon the number in hundreds since they turfed out most foreigners and closed down or confiscated nearly all foreign businesses they havent been able to earn a penny abroad the coffers of the revolution are as empty as a drum bans completely desperate for money he turned away and stood staring over the harbour big hands widespaced on the guardrail his back ramrodstiff he seemed in no hurry to goand aimless loitering was no part of captain bullens life he was always in a hurry i recognised the signs after three years of sailing with him it would have been impossible not to there was something he wanted to say there was some steam he wanted to blow off and no better outlet than that tried and trusty relief valve chief officer carter only whenever he wished to blow off steam it was a matter of personal pride with him never to bring up the matter himself it was no great trick to guess what was troubling him so i obliged i said conversationally the cables we sent to london sir they had been sent by the captain himself but the we would spread the load if things had gone wrong as they almost certainly had any reply to them yet just ten minutes ago he turned round casually as if the matter had really slipped his memory but the slight purpling tinge in the red face betrayed him and there was nothing casual about his voice when he went on slapped me down mister thats what they did slapped me down my own company and the ministry of transport both of them told me to forget about it said my protests were completely out of order warned me of the consequences of future lack of cooperation with the appropriate authorities whatever the hell appropriate authorities might be me my own company thirtyfive years ive sailed with the blue mail line and now and now his fists clenched and his voice choked into fuming silence so there was someone bringing very heavy pressure to bear after all i murmured there was mister there was the cold blue eyes were very cold indeed and the big hands opened wide then closed tight till the ivory showed bullen was a captain but he was more than that he was the commodore of the blue mail fleet and even the board of directors walk softly when the fleet commodore is around at least they dont treat him like an office boy he went on softly if ever i get my hands on dr slingsby caroline ill break his bloody neck captain bullen would have loved to get his hands on the oddly named dr slingsby caroline tens of thousands of police government agents and american service men engaged in the hunt for him would also have loved to get their hands on him so would millions of ordinary citizens if for no other reason than the excellent one that there was a reward of for information leading to his capture but the interest of captain bullen and the crew of the campari was even more personal the missing man was very much the root of all our troubles dr slingsby caroline had vanished appropriately enough in south carolina he had worked at a u s governments very hushhush weapons research establishment south of the town of columbia an establishment concerned with the evolving as had only become known in the past week or so of some sort of small fission weapon for use by either fighter planes or mobile rocket launchers in local tactical nuclear wars as nuclear weapons went it was the veriest bagatelle compared to the five megaton monsters already developed by both the united states and russia developing barely onethousandth of the explosive power of those and hardly capable of devastating more than a square mile of territory still with the explosive potential of five thousand tons of tnt it was no toy then one day night to be precise slingsby caroline had vanished as he was the director of the research establishment this was serious enough but what was even more dismaying was that he had taken the working prototype with him he had apparently been surprised by two of the night guards at the plant and had killed them both presumably with a silenced weapon since no one heard or suspected anything amiss he had driven through the plant gates about ten oclock at night at the wheel of his own blue chevrolet station wagon the guards at the gate recognising both the car and their own chief and knowing that he habitually worked until a late hour had waved him on without a second glance and that was the last anyone had ever seen of dr caroline or the twister as the weapon for some obscure reason had been named but it wasnt the last that was seen of the blue chevrolet that had been discovered abandoned outside the port of savannah some nine hours after the crime had been committed but less than an hour after it had been discovered which showed pretty smart police work on someones part and it had been just our evil luck that the ss campari had called in at savannah on the afternoon of the day the crime had been committed within an hour of the discovery of the two dead guards in the research establishment all interstate and foreign air and sea traffic in the southeastern united states had been halted as from seven oclock in the morning all planes were grounded until they had been rigorously searched as from seven oclock police stopped and examined every truck crossing a state border and of course everything larger than a rowing boat was forbidden to put out to sea unfortunately for the authorities in general and us in particular the ss campari had sailed from savannah at six oclock that morning automatically the campari became very very hot the number one suspect for the getaway the first radio call came through at am would captain bullen return immediately to savannah the captain no beater about the bush asked why the hell he should he was told that it was desperately urgent that he return at once not replied the captain unless they gave him a very compelling reason indeed they refused to give him a reason and captain bullen refused to return deadlock then because they hadnt much option the federal authorities who had already taken over from the state gave him the facts captain bullen asked for more facts he asked for a description of the missing scientist and weapon and hed soon find out for himself whether or not they were on board followed a fifteenminute delay no doubt necessary to secure the release of top classified information then the descriptions were reluctantly given there was a curious similarity between the two descriptions both the twister and dr caroline were exactly seventyfive inches in length both were very thin the weapon being only eleven inches in diameter the doctor weighed pounds the twister the twister was covered in a one piece sheath of polished anodised aluminum the doctor in a twopiece grey gabardine the twisters head was covered by a grey pyroceram nose cap the doctors by black hair with a telltale lock of grey in the centre the orders for the doctor were to identify and apprehend for the twister to identify but do not repeat do not touch the weapon should be completely stable and safe and normally it would take one of the only two experts who were as yet sufficiently acquainted with it at least ten minutes to arm it but no one could guess what effect might have been had upon the twisters delicate mechanism by the jolting it might have suffered in transit three hours later captain bullen was able to report with complete certainty that neither the missing scientist nor weapon was aboard intensive would be a poor word to describe that search every square foot between the chain locker and steering compartment was searched and searched again captain bullen had radioed the federal authorities and then forgotten about it or would have forgotten about it were it not that twice in the following two nights our radarscope had shown a mysterious vessel without navigation lights closing up from astern then vanishing before dawn and then we arrived at our most southerly port of call kingston in jamaica and in kingston the blow had fallen we had no sooner arrived than the harbour authorities had come on board requesting that a search party from the american destroyer lying almost alongside be allowed to examine the campari our friend on the radarscope without a doubt the search party about forty of them was already lined up on the deck of the destroyer they were still there four hours later captain bullen in a few simple wellchosen words that had carried far and clear over the sunlit waters of kingston harbour had told the authorities that if the united states navy proposed in broad daylight to board a british mercantile marine vessel in a british harbour then they were welcome to try they were also welcome he had added to suffer apart from the injuries and the loss of blood they would incur in the process the very heavy penalties which would be imposed by an international court of maritime law arising from charges ranging from assault through piracy to an act of war which maritime court captain bullen had added pointedly had its seat not in washington dc but in the hague holland this stopped them cold the authorities withdrew to consult with the americans coded cables we learnt later were exchanged with washington and london captain bullen remained adamant our passengers per cent of them americans gave him their enthusiastic support messages were received from both the company head office and the ministry of transport requiring captain bullen to cooperate with the united states navy pressure was being brought to bear bullen tore the messages up seized the offer of the local marconi agent to give the radio equipment an overdue checkup as a heavensent excuse to take the wireless officers off watch and told the quartermaster at the gangway to accept no more messages and so it had continued for all of thirty hours and because troubles never come singley it was onh the morning following our arrival that the harrisons and curtises related families who occupied the forward two suites on a deck received cables with the shocking news that members of both families had been fatally involved in a car crash and left that afternoon black gloom hung heavy over the campari towards evening the deadlock was broken by the skipper of the american destroyer a diplomatic courteous and thoroughly embarrassed commander by the name of marsi he had been allowed aboard the campari been gruffly asked into bullens day cabin accepted a drink been very apologetic and respectful and suggested a way out of the dilemma he said he knew how intolerable it must be for a senior captain to have doubt thrown not only on his word but his ability to carry out a proper search for his own part of it he was thoroughly disgusted with the whole assignment he had commander marsi had pointed out almost despairingly to carry out his orders but how would it be if he and captain bullen put their own interpretation on those orders how would it be if the search were carried out not by his own men but by british customs officials in the regular course of their duty with his men present solely in the capacity of observers and under the strictest instructions not to touch anything captain bullen after much outraged humming and hawing had finally agreed not only did this suggestion save face and salvage honour to a certain degree but he was in an impossible position anyway and he knew it until the search was completed the kingston authorities refused medical clearance and until he had this clearance it would be impossible to unload the six hundred tons of food and machinery he had for delivery there and the port officials could also make things very difficult indeed by refusing clearance papers to sail and so what seemed like every customs official in jamaica was routed out and the search began at pm it lasted until am the following morning captain bullen fumed as steadily and sulphurously as a volcano about to erupt the passengers fumed partly because of having to suffer the indignity of having their cabins so meticulously searched partly because of being kept out of their beds until the early hours of the morning and above all the crew fumed because on this occasion even the normally tolerant customs were forced to take note of the hundreds of bottles of liquor and thousands of cigarettes uncovered by their search nothing else of course was found apologies were offered and ignored medical clearance was given and unloading began we left kingston late that night for all of the following twentyfour hours captain bullen had brooded over the recent happenings then had sent off a couple of cablegrams one to the head office in london the other to the ministry of transport telling them what he captain bullen thought of them i had seen the cables and they really had been something not very wise perhaps but better than having the threatened apoplectic seizure and now it seemed they in turn had told captain bullen what they thought of him i could understand his feelings about dr slingsby caroline who was probably in china by this time a highpitched shout of warning brought us both sharply to the present and what was going on around us one of the two chain slings round the big crate now poised exactly over the hatchway to number four hold had suddenly come adrift one end of the crate dropping down through an angle of and bringing up with a jerking jolt that made even the big jumbo derrick shake and quiver with the strain the chances were good that the crate would now slip through the remaining sling and crash down on to the floor of the hold far below which is probably what would have happened if two of the crew holding on to a corner guiding rope hadnt been quickwitted enough to throw all their weight on to it and so prevent the crane from tilting over at too steep an angle and sliding free but even as it was it was still touch and go the crate swung back towards the side of the ship the two men on the guide rope still hanging on desperately i caught a glimpse of the stevedores on the quayside below their faces twisted into expressions of frozen panic in the new peoples democracy where all men were free and equal the penalty for this sort of carelessness was probably the firing squad nothing else could have accounted for their otherwise inexplicably genuine terror the crate began to swing back over the hold i yelled to the men beneath to run clear and simultaneously gave the signal for emergency lowering the winchman fortunately was as quickwitted as he was experienced and as the wildly careening crate swung jerkily back to dead centre he lowered away at two or three times the normal speed braking just seconds before the lowermost corner of the crate crunched and splintered against the floor of the hold moments later the entire length of the crate was resting on the bottom captain bullen fished a handkerchief from his drills removed his goldbraided cap and slowly mopped his sandy hair and sweating brow he appeared to be communing with himself this he said finally is the bloody end captain bullen in the doghouse the crew sore as hell the passengers hopping mad two days behind schedule searched by the americans from truck to keelson like a contraband runner now probably carrying contraband no sign of the latest bunch of passengers got to clear the harbour bar by six and now this band of madmen trying to send us to the bottom a man can stand so much first just so much he replaced his cap shakespeare had something to say about this first a sea of troubles sir no something else but apt enough he sighed get the second officer to relieve you thirds checking stores get the fourth o not that blithering nincompoop get the bosunhe talks spanish like a native anyway to take over on the shore side any objections and thats the last piece of cargo we load then you and i are having lunch first i told miss beresford that i wouldnt if you think captain bullen interrupted heavily that im going to listen to that bunch jangling their moneybags and bemoaning their hard lot from hors doeuvres right through to coffee you must be out of your mind well have it in my cabin and so we had it in his cabin it was the usual campari meal something for even the most blase epicure to dream about and captain bullen for once and understandably made an exception to his rule that neither he nor his officers should drink with lunch by the time the meal was over he was feeling almost human again and once went so far as to call me johnnymeboy it wouldnt last but it was all pleasant enough and it was with reluctance that i finally quit the airconditioned coolness of the captains day cabin for the blazing sunshine outside to relieve the second officer he smiled widely as i approached number four hold tommy wilson was always smiling he was a dark wiry welshman of middle height with an infectious grin and an immense zest for life no matter what came his way nothing was too much trouble for tommy and nothing ever got him down nothing that is except mathematics his weakness in that department had already cost him his masters ticket but he was that rare combination of an outstanding seaman and a tremendous social asset on a passenger ship and it was for these reasons that captain bullen had insisted on having him aboard hows it going i asked you can see for yourself he waved a complacent hand towards the pile of stacked crates on the quayside now diminished by a good third since i had seen it last speed allied with efficiency when wilson is on the job let no man ever the bosuns name is macdonald not wilson i said so it is he laughed glanced down to where the bosun a big tough infinitely competent hebridean islander was haranguing the bearded stevedores and shook his head admiringly i wish i could understand what hes saying translation would be superfluous i said drily ill take over old man wants you to go ashore ashore his face lit up in two short years the seconds shoregoing exploits had already passed into the realms of legend let no man ever say that wilson ignored dutys call twenty minutes for a shower shave and shake out the number ones the agents offices are just beyond the dock gates i interrupted you can go as you are find out whats happened to our latest passengers captains beginning to worry about them if theyre not here by five oclock hes sailing without them way hes feeling now hed just as soon do that if the agent doesnt know tell him to find out fast wilson left the sun started westering but the heat stayed as it was thanks to macdonalds competence and uninhibited command of the spanish language the cargo on the quayside steadily and rapidly diminished wilson returned to report no sign of our passengers their baggage had arrived two days previously and although only for five people was enough wilson said to fill a couple of railroad trucks about the passengers the agent had been very nervous indeed they were very important people senor very very important one of them was the most important man in the whole province of camafuegos a jeep had already been dispatched westwards along the coast road to look for them it sometimes happened the senor understood that a car spring would go or a shock absorber snap when wilson had innocently inquired if this was because the revolutionary government had no money left to pay for the filling in of the enormous potholes in the roads the agent had become even more nervous and said indignantly that it was entirely the fault of the inferior metal those perfidious americanos used in the construction of their vehicles wilson said he had left with the impression that detroit had a special assembly line exclusively devoted to turning out deliberately inferior cars destined solely for this particular corner of the caribbean wilson went away the cargo continued to move steadily into number four hold about four oclock in the afternoon i heard the sound of the clashing of gears and the asthmatic wheezing of what sounded like a very elderly engine indeed this i thought would be the passengers at last but no what clanked into view round the corner of the dock gate was a dilapidated truck with hardly a shred of paint left on the body work white canvas showing on the tyres and the engine hood removed to reveal what looked from my elevation like a solid block of rust one of the special detroit jobs probably on its cracked and splintered platform it carried three mediumsized crates freshly boxed and metalbanded wrapped in a blue haze from the staccato backfiring of its exhaust vibrating like a broken tuning fork and rattling in every bolt in its superannuated chassis the truck trundled heavily across the cobbles and pulled up not five paces from where macdonald was standing a little man in white ducks and peaked cap jumped out through the space where the door ought to have been stood still for a couple of seconds until he got the hang of terra firma again and then scuttled off in the direction of our gangway i recognised him as our carracio agent the one with the low opinion of detroit and wondered what fresh trouble he was bringing with him i found out in three minutes flat when captain bullen appeared on deck an anxiouslooking agent scurrying along behind him the captains blue eyes were snapping the red complexion was overlaid with puce but he had the safety valve screwed right down coffins mister he said tightly coffins no less i suppose there is a quick and clever answer to a conversational gambit like that but i couldnt find it so i said politely coffins sir coffins mister not empty either for shipment to new york he flourished some papers authorizations shipping notes everything in order including a sealed request signed by no less than the ambassador three of them two british one american subject killed in the hunger riots the crew wont like it sir i said especially the goanese stewards you know their superstitions and how it will be all right senor the little man in white broke in hurriedly wilson had been right about the nervousness but there was more to it than that there was a strange overlay of anxiety that came close to despair we have arranged shut up captain bullen said shortly no need for the crew to know mister or the passengers you could see they were just a careless afterthought coffins are boxed thats them on the truck there yes sir killed in the riots last week i paused and went on delicately in this heat leadlined he says so they can go in the hold some separate corner mister one of the umdeceased is a relative of one of the passengers boarding here wouldnt do to stack the coffins among the dynamos i suppose he sighed heavily on top of everything else were now in the funeralundertaking business life first can hold no more you are accepting thisahcargo sir but of course but of course the little man interrupted again one of them is a cousin of senor carreras who sails with you sefior miguel carreras sefior carreras he is what you say heartbroken senor carreras is the most important man be quiet captain bullen said wearily he made a gesture with the papers yes im accepting note from the ambassador more pressure ive had enough of cables flying across the atlantic too much grief just an old beaten man first just an old beaten man he stood there for a moment hands outspread on the guardrail doing his best to look like an old beaten man and making a singularly unsuccessful job of it then straightened abruptly as a procession of vehicles turned in through the dock gates and made for the campari a pound to a penny mister here comes still more grief praise be to god the little agent murmured the tone no less than the words was a prayer of thanksgiving senor carreras himself your passengers at last captain thats what i said bullen growled more grief the little man looked at him in puzzlement as well as might anyone who didnt understand bullens attitude towards the passengers then turned and hurried off towards the gangway my attention was diverted for a few moments by another crate swinging aboard then i heard captain bullen saying softly and feelingly like i said mister more grief the procession two big chauffeurdriven prewar packards one towed by a jeep had just pulled up by the gangway and the passengers were climbing out those who could that wasor very obviously there was one who could not one of the chauffeurs dressed in green tropical drills and a bush hat had opened the boot of his car pulled out a collapsible handpropelled wheel chair and with the smooth efficiency of experience had it assembled in ten seconds flat while the other chauffeur with the aid of a tall thin nurse clad in overall white from her smartly starched cap to the skirt that reached close down to her ankles tenderly lifted a bent old man from the back seat of the second packard and set him gently in the wheel chair the old boyeven at that distance i could see the face creased and trenched with the lines of age the snowy whiteness of the still plentiful hairdid his best to help them but his best wasnt very much captain bullen looked at me i looked at captain bullen there didnt seem to be any reason to say anything nobody in a crew likes having permanent invalids aboard ship they cause trouble to the ships doctor who has to look after their health to the cabin stewards who have to clean their quarters to the diningroom stewards who have to feed them and to those members of the deck crew detailed for the duty of moving them around and when the invalids are elderly and very infirmand if this one wasnt i sadly missed my guessthere was always the chance of a death at sea the one thing sailors hate above all else it was also very bad for the passenger trade but as long as the illness was of neither a contagious nor infectious nature and that a certificate could be produced from the invalids own doctor to the effect that the invalid was fit for the proposed voyage there was nothing that could be done about it well captain bullen said heavily i suppose id better go and welcome our latest guests aboard finish it off as quickly as possible mister ill do that sir bullen nodded and left i watched the two chauffeurs slide a couple of poles under the seat of the invalid chair straighten and carry the chair easily up the sparred foot planks of the gangway they were followed by the tall angular nurse and she in turn by another nurse dressed exactly like the first but shorter and stockier the old boy was bringing his own medical corps along with him which meant that he had more money than was good for him or was a hypochondriac or very far through indeed or a combination of any or all of those on the credit side was the fact that both had that indefinable competent nononsense look of the professional nurse which would make the lot of our ships surgeon old dr marston who sometimes had to work a whole hour in one day all that much easier but i was more interested in the last two people to climb out of the packards the first was a man of about my own age and size but the resemblance stopped there he looked like a cross between ramon novarro and rudolph valentino only handsomer tall broadshouldered with deeply tanned perfectly sculpted latin features he had the classical long thin moustache strong even teeth with that inbuilt neon phosphorescence that seems to shine in any light from high noon till dark and a darkly gleaming froth of tight black curls on his head he would have been a lost man if youd let him loose on the campus of any girls university for all that he looked as far from being a sissy as any man id ever met he had the strong chin the balanced carriage the light springy boxers step of a man well aware that he can get through this world without any help from a nursemaid if nothing else i thought sourly he would at least take miss beresford out of my hair the other man was a slightly smaller edition of the first same features same teeth same moustache and hair only those were greying he would be about fiftyfive he had about him that indefinable look of authority and assurance which can come from power money or a carefully cultivated phoneyness this i guessed would be the sefior miguel carreras who inspired such fear in our local carracio agent i wondered why ten minutes later the last of our cargo was aboard and all that remained were the three boxed coffins on the back of the old truck i was watching the bosun readying a sling round the first of those when a welldetested voice said behind me this is mr carreras sir captain bullen sent me i turned round and gave fourth officer dexter the look i specially reserved for fourth officer dexter dexter was the exception to the rule that the fleet commodore always got the best available in the company as far as officers and men were concerned but that was hardly the old mans fault there were some men that even a fleet commodore has to accept and dexter was one of them a personable enough youngster of twentyone with fair hair slightly prominent blue eyes an excruciatingly genuine publicschool accent and limited intelligence dexter was the sonand unfortunately heir of lord dexter chairman and managing director of the blue mail lord dexter who had inherited about ten millions at the age of fifteen and understandably enough had never looked back had the quaint idea that his own son should start from the bottom up and had sent him to sea as a cadet some five years previously dexter took a poor view of this arrangement every man in the ship from bullen downwards took a poor view both of the arrangement and dexter but there was nothing we could do about it how do you do sir i accepted carreras outstretched hand and took a good look at him the steady dark eyes the courteous smile couldnt obscure the fact that there were many more lines about his eyes and mouth at two feet than at fifty but it also couldnt obscure the compensatory fact that the air of authority and command was now redoubled in force and i put out of my mind any idea that this air originated in phoneyness it was the genuine article and that was that mr carter my pleasure the hand was firm the bow more than a perfunctory nod the cultured english the product of some stateside ivy league college i have some interest in the cargo being loaded and if you would permit but certainly senor carreras carter that roughhewn anglosaxon diamond not to be outdone in latin courtesy i waved towards the hatch if you would be so kind as to keep to the starboardthe right hand of the hatch starboard will do mr carter he smiled i have commanded vessels of my own it was not a life that ever appealed to me he stood there for a moment watching macdonald tightening the sling while i turned to dexter who had made no move to go dexter was seldom in a hurry to do anything he had a remarkably thick skin what are you on now fourth i enquired assisting mr that meant he was unemployed cummings the purser was an extraordinarily competent officer who never required help he had only one fault brought on by years of dealing with passengershe was far too polite especially with dexter i said those charts we picked up in kingston you might get on with the corrections will you which meant that he would probably land us on a reef off the great bahamas in a couple of days time but mr cummings is expecting the charts dexter he looked at me for a long moment his face slowly darkening then spun on his heel and left i let him go three paces then said not loudly dexter he stopped then turned slowly the charts dexter i repeated he stood there for maybe five seconds eyes locked on mine then broke his gaze aye aye sir the accent on the sir was faint but unmistakable he turned again and walked away and now the flush was round to the back of his neck his back ramrod stiff little i cared by the time he sat in the chairmans seat id have long since quit i watched him go then turned to see carreras looking at me with a slow still speculation in the steady eyes he was putting chief officer carter in the balance and weighing him but whatever figures he came up with he kept to himself for he turned away without any haste and made his way to the starboard side of number four hold as he turned i noticed for the first time the very thin ribbon of black silk stitched across the left lapel of his grey tropical suit it didnt seem to go any too well with the white rose he wore in his buttonhole but maybe the two of them together were recognised as a sign of mourning in those parts and it seemed very likely for he stood there perfectly straight almost at attention his hands loosely by his sides as the three crated coffins were hoisted inboard when the third crate came swinging in over the rail he removed his hat casually as if to get the benefit of the light breeze that had just sprung up from the north the direction of the open sea and then looking round him almost furtively lifted his right hand under the cover of the hat held in his left hand and made a quick abbreviated sign of the cross even in that heat i could feel the cold catspaw of a shiver brush lightly across my shoulders i dont know why not even by the furthest stretch of imagination could i visualise that prosaic hatchway giving on number four hold as an open grave one of my grandmothers was scots maybe i was psychic or had the second sight or whatever it was they called it up in the highlands or maybe i had just lunched too well whatever might have upset me it didnt seem to have upset senor carreras he replaced his hat as the last of the crates touched lightly on the floor of the hold stared down at it for a few seconds then turned and made his way forward lifting his hat again and giving me a clear untroubled smile as he came by for want of anything better to do i smiled back at him five minutes later the ancient truck the two packards the jeep and the last of the stevedores were gone and macdonald was busy supervising the placing of the battens on number four hold by five oclock a whole hour before deadline and exactly on the top of the tide the ss campari was steaming slowly over the bar to the north of the harbour then northwest into the setting sun carrying with it its cargo of crates and machinery and dead men its fuming captain disgruntled crew and thoroughly outraged passengers at five oclock on that brilliant june evening it was not what one might have called a happy ship chapter by eight oclock that night cargo crates and coffins were presumably just as they had been at five oclock but among the living cargo the change for the better from deep discontent to something closely approaching lighthearted satisfaction was marked and profound there were reasons for this of course in captain bullens casehe twice called me johnnymeboy as he sent me down for dinnerit was because he was clear of what he was pleased to regard as the pestiferous port of carracio because he was at sea again because he was on his bridge again and because he had thought up an excellent reason for sending me below while he remained on the bridge thus avoiding the social torture of having to dine with the passengers in the crews case it was because the captain had seen fit partly out of a sense of justice and partly to repay the head office for the indignities they had heaped on him to award them all many more hours overtime than they were actually entitled to for their offduty labours in the past three days and in the case of the officers and passengers it was simply because there are certain welldefined fundamental laws of human nature and one of them was that it was impossible to be miserable for long aboard the ss campari as a vessel with no regular ports of call with only very limited passenger accommodation and capacious cargo holds that were seldom far from full the ss campari could properly be classed as a tramp ship and indeed was so classed in the blue mails brochures butas the brochures pointed out with a properly delicate restraint in keeping with the presumably refined sensibilities of the extraordinarily wellheeled clientele it was addressingthe ss campari was no ordinary tramp ship indeed it was no ordinary ship in any sense at all it was as the brochure said simply without any pretentiousness and in exactly those words a mediumsized cargo vessel offering the most luxurious accommodation and finest cuisine of any ship in the world today it was the chairman of the blue mail lord dexter who had obviously kept all his brains to himself and refrained from passing any on to his son our current fourth officer who had thought it up it was as all his competitors who were now exerting themselves strenuously to get into the act admitted a stroke of pure genius lord dexter concurred it had started off simply enough in the early fifties with an earlier blue mail vessel the ss brandywine for some strange whimsy explicable only on a psychoanalysts couch lord dexter himself a rabid teetotaller had elected to name his various ships after divers wines and other spirituous liquors the brandywine had been one of two blue mail vessels engaged on a regular run between new york and various british possessions in the west indies and lord dexter eying the luxury cruise liners which plied regularly between new york and the caribbean and seeing no good reason why he shouldnt elbow his way into this lucrative dollarearning market had some extra cabins fitted on the brandywine and advertised them in a few very select american newspapers and magazines making it quite plain that he was interested only in top people among the attractions offered had been a complete absence of bands dances concerts fancydress balls swimming pools tombola deck games sightseeing and parties a genius could have made such desirable and splendidly resounding virtues out of things he didnt have anyway all he offered on the positive side was the mystery and romance of a tramp ship which sailed to unknown destinationsthis didnt make any alterations to regular schedules all it meant was that the captain kept the names of the various ports of call to himself until shortly before he arrived there and the resources and comfort of a telegraph lounge which remained in continuous touch with the new york london and paris stock exchanges the initial success of the scheme was fantastic in stock exchange parlance the issue was oversubscribed a hundred times this was intolerable to lord dexter he was obviously attracting far too many of the not quite top people aspiring wouldhes on the lowermiddle rungs of the ladder who had not yet got past their first few million people with whom top people would not care to associate he doubled his prices it made no difference he trebled them and in the process made the gratifying discovery that there were many people in the world who would pay literally almost anything not only to be different and exclusive but to be known to be different and exclusive lord dexter held up the building of his latest ship the campari had designed and built into her a dozen of the most luxurious cabin suites ever seen and sent her to new york confident that she would soon recoup the outlay of a quarter of a million pounds extra cost incurred through the building of those cabins as usual his confidence was not misplaced there were imitators of course but one might as well have tried to imitate buckingham palace the grand canyon or the cullinan diamond lord dexter left them all at the starting date he had found his formula and he stuck to it unswervingly comfort convenience quiet good food and good company where comfort was concerned the fabulous luxury of the staterooms had to be seen to be believed convenience as far as the vast majority of the male passengers was concerned found its ultimate in the juxtaposition in the camparis unique telegraph lounge of the stockexchange tickers and one of the most superbly stocked bars in the world quiet was achieved by an advanced degree of insulation both in cabin suites and engine room by imitating the royal yacht britannia inasmuch as that no orders were ever shouted and the deck crew and stewards invariably wore rubbersoled sandals and by eliminating all the bands parties games and dances which lesser cruise passengers believed essential for the enjoyment of shipboard life the magnificent cuisine had been achieved by luring away at vast cost and the expense of even more bad feeling the chefs from one of the biggest embassies in london and one of the finest hotels in paris those masters of the culinary world operated on alternate days and the paradisical results of their efforts to outdo one another was the envious talk of the western ocean other ship owners might perhaps have succeeded in imitating some or all of those features although almost certainly to a lesser degree but lord dexter was no ordinary ship owner he was as said a genius and he showed it in his insistence above all on having the right people aboard never a single trip passed but the campari had a personage on its passenger list a personage varying from notable to worldfamous a special suite was reserved for personages wellknown politicians cabinet ministers top stars of the stage and screen the odd famous writer or artistif he was clean enough and used a razorand the lower echelons of the english nobility travelled in this suite at vastly reduced prices royalty expresidents expremiers ranking dukes and above travelled free it was said that if all the british peerage on the camparis waiting list could be accommodated simultaneously the house of lords could close its doors it need hardly be added that there was nothing philanthropic in lord dexters offer of free hospitality he merely jacked up his prices to the wealthy occupants of the other eleven suites who would have paid the earth anyway for the privilege of voyaging in such close contact with such exalted company after several years on this run our passengers consisted almost entirely of repeaters many came as often as three times a year fair enough indication of the size of their bank roll by now the passenger list on the campari had become the most exclusive club in the world not to put too fine a point on it lord dexter had distilled the aggregate elements of social and financial snobbery and found in its purest quintessence an inexhaustible supply of gold i adjusted my napkin and looked over the current gold mine five hundred million dollars on the hoof on the dovegrey velvet of the armchair seats in that opulent and airconditioned dining room perhaps nearer a thousand million dollars and old man beresford would account for a good third of it julius beresford president and chief stockholder of the hartmccormick mining federation sat where he nearly always sat not only now but on half a dozen previous cruises at the top righthand side of the captains table next to captain bullen himself he sat there in the most coveted position in the ship not because he insisted on it through sheer weight of wealth but because captain bullen himself insisted on it there are exceptions to every rule and julius beresford was the exception to bullens rule that he couldnt abide any passenger period beresford a tall thin relaxed man with tufted black eyebrows a horseshoe ring of greying hair fringing the sunburnt baldness of his head and lively hazel eyes twiligh in the lined brown leather of his face came along only for the peace comfort and food the company of the great left him cold a fact vastly appreciated by captain bullen who shared his sentiments exactly beresford sitting diagonally across from my table caught my eye evening mr carter unlike his daughter he didnt make me feel that he was conferring an earldom upon me every time he spoke to me splendid to be at sea again isnt it and wheres our captain tonight working im afraid mr beresford i have to present his apologies to his table he couldnt leave the bridge on the bridge mrs beresford seated opposite her husband twisted round to look at me i thought you were usually on watch at this hour mr carter i am i smiled at her i kept a special sort of smile for mrs beresford in the same way that i kept a special sort of look for young dexter plump bejewelled overdressed with dyed blonde hair but still beautiful at fifty mrs beresford bubbled over with good humour and laughter and kindness and to the sour remark that it is easy to be that way with million dollars in the bank i can only observe that after several years on the millionaires run the misery quotient of our wealthy appeared to increase in direct proportion to the bullion in the bank this was only her first trip but mrs beresford was already my favourite passenger i went on but there are so many chains of islets reefs and coral keys hereabouts that captain bullen prefers to see to the navigation himself i didnt add as i might have done that had it been in the middle of the night and all the passengers safely in their beds captain bullen would have been in his also untroubled by any thoughts about his chief officers competence but i thought a chief officer was fully qualified to run a ship miss beresford needling me again sweetsmiling the momentarily innocent clear green eyes almost too big for the delicately tanned face in case anything went wrong with the captain i mean you must hold a masters certificate mustnt you i do i also hold a drivers licence but you wouldnt catch me driving a bus in the rush hour in downtown manhattan old man beresford grinned his wife smiled miss beresford regarded me thoughtfully for a moment then bent to examine her hors doeuvres showing the gleaming auburn hair cut in a bouffant style that looked as if it had been achieved with a garden rake and a pair of secateurs but had probably cost a fortune the man by her side wasnt going to let it go so easily though he laid down his fork raised his thin dark head until he had me more or less sighted along his acquiline nose and said in his clear high drawling voice oh come now chief officer i dont think the comparison is very apt at all the chief officer was to put me in my place the duke of hartwell spent a great deal of his time aboard the campari in putting people in their places which was pretty ungrateful of him considering that he was getting it all for free he had nothing against me personally it was just that he was publicly lending miss beresford his support even the very considerable sums of money earned by inveigling the properly respectful lower classes into viewing his stately home at two and six a time were making only a slight dent on the crushing burden of death duties whereas an alliance with miss beresford would solve his difficulties for ever and ever things were being complicated for the unfortunate duke by the fact that though his intellect was bent on miss beresford his attentions and eyes were for the most part on the extravagantly opulent charmsand undeniable beauty of the platinum blonde and oftendivorced cinema actress who flanked him on the other side i dont suppose it is sir i acknowledged captain bullen refused to address him as your grace and id be damned if id do it either but the best i could think up on the spur of the moment he nodded as though satisfied and returned to attack his hors doeuvre old beresford eyed him speculatively mrs beresford halfsmilingly miss harcourtthe cinema actress admiringly while miss beresford herself just kept on treating us to an uninterrupted view of the auburn bouffant theres little enough to do during offduty hours at sea and watching developments at the captains table would make a very entertaining pastime indeed what promised to make it even more entertaining was the very considerable interest being taken in the captains table by the young man seated at the foot of my own table one of the passengers who had joined at caracio tony carrerasmy guess that he was miguel carteras son had been a correct and far from difficult onwas by any odds the most extraordinarily handsome man whod ever passed through the diningroom door of the campari in one way this might not have signified much as it takes many years to amass sufficient cash to sail on the campari even for a weekend and young men were in a tiny minority at any time but nevertheless there was no denying his impact even at closeup range there was none of that weakness that almost effeminate regularity of feature so often found in the faces of many very goodlooking men he looked for all the world like a slightly latinate reincarnation of a younger errol flynn but harder tougher more enduring the only flaw if one could call it flaw lay in the eyes there seemed to be something ever so slightly wrong with them as if the pupils were slightly flattened giving a hard bright glitter maybe it was just the lighting at the table but there was nothing wrong with them as eyes he had twentytwenty vision all right and was using it all to study the captains table miss beresford or miss harcourt i couldnt be sure which he didnt look the kind of man who would waste his time studying any of the others at that table the courses came and went antoine was on duty in the kitchen that night and you could almost reach out and feel the blissful hush that descended on the company velvet footed goanese waiters moved soundlessly on the dark grey pile of the persian carpet food appeared and vanished as if in a dream an arm always appeared at the precisely correct moment with the precisely correct wine but never for me i drank soda water it was in my contract the coffee appeared this was the moment when i had to earn my money when antoine was on duty and on top of his form conversation was a desecration and a hallowed hush of appreciation an almost cathedral ecstasy was the correct form but about forty minutes of this rapturous silence was about par for the course it couldnt and never did go on i never yet met a rich manor woman for that matter of it who didnt list talking chiefly and preferably about themselves as among their favourite occupations and the prime target for their observations was invariably the officer who sat at the head of the table i looked round ours and wondered who would set the ball rolling miss harrbrideher original centraleuropean name was unpronounceablethin scrawny sixtyish and tough as whalebone who had made a fortune out of highly expensive and utterly worthless cosmetic preparations which she wisely refrained from using on herself mr greenstreet her husband a grey anonymity of a man with a grey sunken face who had married her for heaven only knew what reason for he was a very wealthy man in his own right tony carreras his father miguel carreras there should have been a sixth at my table to replace the curtis family of three who along with the harrisons had been so hurriedly called home from kingston but the old man who had come aboard in his wheel chair was apparently to have his meals served in his cabin during the voyage with his nurses in attendance four men and one woman it made an illbalanced table senor miguel carreras spoke first the camparis prices mr carter are quite atrocious he said calmly he puffed appreciatively at his cigar robbery on the high seas would be a very fitting description on the other hand the cuisine is as claimed you have a chef of divine gifts it is perhaps not too much to pay for a foretaste of a better world this made senor carreras very wealthy indeed and was old hat to me wealthy men never mentioned money lest they be thought not to have enough of it very wealthy men on the other hand to whom money as such no longer mattered had no such inhibitions the passengers on the campari complained all the time about the prices and they kept coming back from all accounts sir divine is just about right experienced travellers who have stayed in the best hotels on both sides of the atlantic maintain that antoine has no equal in either europe or america except perhaps henriques henriques our alternate chef hes on tomorrow do i detect a certain immodesty mr carter in advancing the claims of the campari there was no offence meant not with that smile i dont think so sir but the next twentyfour hours will speak for themselvesand henriquesbetter than i can touche he smiled again and reached for the bottle of remy martinthe waiters vanished at coffee time and the prices theyre terrible i agreed i told that to all the passengers and it seemed to please them we offer what no other ship in the world offers but the prices are still scandalous at least a dozen people in this room at this very moment have told me thatand most of them are here for at least their third trip you make your point mr carter it was tony carreras speaking and his voice was as one might have expected slow controlled with a deep resonant timbre he looked at his father remember the waiting list at the blue mails offices indeed we were pretty far down the list and what a list half the millionaires in central and south america i suppose we may consider ourselves fortunate mr carter in that we were the only ones able to accept at such short notice after the sudden departure of our predecessors in jamaica but dont forget that to catch the boat we had to make a hurried fourhundredmile dash from the capital to carracio by air and road and what roads sefior carreras obviously didnt share the carracio agents respectful terror of the revolutionary government i wondered how a man of carreras obviously aristocratic background had been able to retain his obvious wealth in the face of the forces of change that had overcome and completely wiped out the old orderand why if money was so desperately short on the island he was allowed to convert very large sums of it into dollars to pay for this cruise or how and why he had been able to leave the island at all but i kept my wonderings to myself instead i said youre still a long way off the record sefior carreras last trip we had a family from santiago and two men from beirut both of whom had flown to new york specially for the round voyage and they cant all be wrong eh dont worry mr carter i intend to enjoy myself can you give us any idea of our itinerary thats supposed to be one of the attractions sir no set itinerary our schedule largely depends on the availability and destination of cargoes one thing certain were going to new york most of our passengers boarded there and passengers like to be returned to where they came from he knew this anyway knew that we had coffins consigned to new york we may stop off at nassau depends how the captain feelsthe company gives him a lot of leeway in adjusting local schedules to suit the best needs of the passengers and the weather reports this is the hurricane season mr carreras or pretty close to it if the reports are bad captain bullen will want all the sea room he can get and give nassau a byez i smiled among the other attractions of the ss campari is that we do not make our passengers seasick unless it is absolutely essential considerate very considerate carreras murmured he looked at me speculatively but well be making one or two calls on the east coast i take it no idea sir normally yes again its up to the captain and how the captain behaves depends on a certain dr slingsby caroline they havent caught him yet miss harrbride declared in her rough gravelly voice she scowled with all the fierce patriotism of a firstgeneration american looked round the table and gave us all the impartial benefit of her scowl its incredible frankly incredible i still dont believe it a thirteenthgeneration american i could imagine how unthinkably remote thirteen generations of american ancestors must be to miss hatrbride shed have traded her milliondollar cosmetic empire for even a couple of them i was reading all about him in the tribune two days ago did you know that the lingsbys came to the potomac in just five years after the washingtons three hundred years imagine american for three hundred years and now a renegade a traitor thirteen generations dont take it too hard miss harrbride i said encouragingly when it comes to skipping with the family silver dr caroline just doesnt begin to be in the same class as my countrymen the last englishman who deflected to the communist world had an ancestor in the doomsday book thirty solid generations yet he took off and lit out at the drop of a hat faugh said miss harrbride we heard about this character tony carreras like his father had had his education in some ivy league college he was rather less formal in his attitude towards the english language slingsby caroline i mean makes very little sense to me whats he going to do with this weaponthe twister they call it isnt it even if he does get it out of the country whos going to buy it i mean as nuclear devices go it could be ranked almost as a toy it certainly isnt going to change the balance of world power no matter who gets his hands on it tonys right miguel carreras agreed who is going to buy it besides theres nothing secret any more about the making of nuclear weapons if a country has enough wealth and technical resourcesso far there are only four in the worldit can build a nuclear weapon any time if it hasnt all the plans or working models in the world are useless to them hes going to have an interesting time in hawking the twister around tony carreras finished especially since from all descriptions you cant get the twister into a suitcase but whats this guy got to do with us mr carter as long as he is at large every cargo vessel leaving the eastern seaboard gets a pretty thorough going over to make sure that neither he nor the twister is aboard lows up the turnround of cargo and passenger ships by per cent which means that the longshoremen are losing stevedoring money pretty fast theyve gone on strikeand the chances are so many words have been said on both sides that theyll stay on strike when they do nab dr caroline if traitor said miss harrbride thirteen generations so we stay away from the east coast eh carreras senior asked meantime anyway as long as possible sir but new york is a must when i dont know but if its still strikebound we might go up the st lawrence first depends romance mystery and adventure carreras smiled just like your brochure said he glanced over my shoulder looks like a visitor for you mr carter i twisted in my seat it was a visitor for me rusty williamsrusty from his shock of flaming hairwas advancing towards me whites immaculately pressed uniform cap clasped stiffly under his left arm rusty was sixteen our youngest cadet desperately shy and very impressionable cadets were not normally allowed in the dining room and rustys eyes were goggling as they took in the young ladies at the captains table but he managed to haul them back to me as he halted by my side with a perceptible click of his heels what is it rusty ageold convention said that cadets should always be addressed by their surnames but everyone called rusty just that it seemed impossible not to the captains compliments sir could he see you on the bridge please mr carter ill be right up rusty turned to leave and i caught the gleam in susan beresfords eye a gleam that generally heralded some crack at my expense this one predictably would be about my indispensability about the distraught captain sending for his trusty servant when all was lost and although i didnt think she was the sort of girl to say it in front of a cadet wouldnt have wagered pennies on it so i rose hastily to my feet said excuse me miss harrbride excuse me gentlemen and followed rusty quickly out of the door into the starboard alleyway he was waiting for me the captain is in his cabin sir hed like to see you there what you told me i know sir he told me to say that mr jamieson is on the bridgegeorge jamieson was our third officerand captain bullen is in his cabin with mr cummings i nodded and left i remembered now that cummings hadnt been at his accustomed table as id come out although hed certainly been there at the beginning of dinner the captains quarters were immediately below the bridge and i was there in ten seconds i knocked on the polished teak door heard a gruff voice and went in the blue mail certainly did its commodore well even captain bullen no admirer of the sybaritic life had never been heard to complain of being pampered he had a three roomandbathroom suite done in the best millionaires taste and his day cabin in which i now was was a pretty fair guide to the restwinered carpet that sunk beneath your feet darkly crimson drapes gleaming sycamore panelling narrow oak beams overhead oak and green leather for the chairs and settee captain bullen looked up at me when i came in he didnt have any of the signs of a man enjoying the comforts of home something wrong sir i asked sit down he waved to a chair and sighed theres something wrong all right bananalegs benson is missing white reported it ten minutes ago bananalegs benson sounded like the name of a domesticated anthropoid or at best like a professional wrestler on the smalltown circuits but in fact it belonged to our very suave polished and highly accomplished head steward frederick benson benson had the welldeserved reputation of being a very firm disciplinarian and it was one of his disgruntled subordinates who in the process of receiving a severe and merited dressingdown had noticed the negligible clearance between bensons knees and rechristened him as soon as his back was turned the name had stuck chiefly because of its incongrmity and utter unsuitability white was the assistant chief steward i said nothing bullen didnt appreciate anyone especially his officers indulging in doubletakes exclamations or fatuous repetition instead i looked at the man seated across the table from the captain howard cummings cummings the purser a small plump amiable and infinitely shrewd irishman was next to bullen the most important man on the ship no one questioned that though cummings himself gave no sign that this was so on a passenger ship a good purser is worth his weight in gold and cummings was a pearl beyond any price in his three years on the campari friction and trouble amongand complaints fromthe passengers had been almost completely unknown howard cummings was a genius in mediation compromise the soothing of ruffled feelings and the handling of people in general captain bullen would as soon have thought of cutting off his right hand as of trying to send cummings off the ship i looked at cummings for three reasons he knew everything that went on on the campari from the secret takeover bids being planned in the telegraph lounge to the heart troubles of the youngest stoker in the boiler room he was the man ultimately responsible for all the stewards aboard the ship and finally he was a close personal friend of bananalegs they had sailed together for ten years as chief purser and chief steward on one of the great transatlantic liners and it had been one of the master strokes in the career of that archlurer lord dexter when he had lured both those men away from their ship and installed them aboard the campari cummings caught my look and shook his dark head sorry johnny im as much in the dark as you i saw him shortly before dinner about ten to eight it would have been when i was having a noggin with the paying guests cummings noggin came from a special whisky bottle filled only with ginger ale wed white up here just now he says he saw benson in cabin suite six fixing it for the night about eighttwentyhalf an hour ago no nearer forty minutes now he expected to see him shortly afterwards because for every night for the past couple of years whenever the weather was good benson and white have had a cigarette together on deck when the passengers were at dinner regular time i interrupted very eightthirty near enough never later than eight thirtyfive but not tonight at eightforty white went to look for him in his cabin no sign of him there organized half a dozen stewards for a search and still nothing doing he sent for me and i came to the captain and the captain sent for me i thought send for old trusty carter when theres dirty work on hand i looked at bullen a search sir thats it mister damned nuisance just one damned thing after another quietly if you can of course sir can i have wilson the bosun some stewards and abs you can have lord dexter and his board of directors just so long as you find benson bullen grunted yes sir i turned to cummings didnt suffer from any illhealth did he liable to dizziness faintness heart attacks that sort of thing flat feet was all cummings smiled he wasnt feeling like smiling had his annual checkup last month from doe marston one hundred per cent the flat feet are an occupational disease i turned back to captain bullen could i have twenty minutes perhaps half an hour for a quiet look round sir first with mr cummings its a calm windless night theres been no word of any shouts any cries for help and as theres always a good few of the crew on the lower decks at night the chances are that any thing like that would have been heard and hes not likely to be ill what im getting at is that its a hundred to one against his being in any trouble where he requires immediate help if he did require it hes probably past all help by now i cant see theres any harm in waiting another twenty minutes before raising the alarm no ones going to raise any alarm mister this is the campari yes sir but whether its broadcast over the tannoy system or whispered in a dark corner itll make no difference if benson is missing and is going to stay that way it will be all over the ship by midnight tonight or earlier jobs comforter bullen growled all right johnny you too howie see what you can find your authority to look anywhere sir i asked within reason of course everywhere i insisted or im wasting my time you know that sir my god and its only a couple of days since that jamaican lot remember how our passengers reacted to the customs and american navy going through their cabins the board of directors are going to love this he looked up wearily i suppose you are referring to the passengers quarters well do it quietly sir theyre still at dinner and howie here can fix anything that comes up twenty minutes then youll find me on the bridge dont tramp on any toes if you can help it we left dropped down to a deck and made a right left turn into the hundredfoot central passageway between the cabin suites on a deck there were only six of these suites three on each side white was about halfway down the passageway nervously pacing up and down i beckoned to him and he came walking quickly towards us a thin balding character with a permanently pained expression who suffered from the twin disabilities of chronic dyspepsia and overconscientiousness got all the passkeys white i asked yes sir fine i nodded to the first main door on my right number one suite on the port side open it will you white looked at cummings it was an understood thing at sea that deck officers never never went into the camparis passenger accommodation except by passenger invitation and even then only by kind permission of the purser and head steward but to burgle the passenger accommodation you heard the chief officer i wondered when id previously heard a harsh note in howies voice and decided never he and bananalegs benson were pretty good friends open up he opened up i brushed past him followed by the purser there was no need to switch on the lightsthey were already on asking the camparis passengers at the prices they were paying to remember to turn off the lights would have been a waste of breath and an insult there were no bunks in the camparis cabin suites fourposters and massive fourposters at that with concealed and mechanically operated sideboards which could be quickly raised in bad weather such was the standard of modern weather reporting the latitude allowed captain bullen in avoiding bad weather and the efficiency of our dennybrown stabilisers that i dont think those sideboards had ever been used seasickness was not allowed aboard the campari the suite was composed of a sleeping cabin an adjacent lounge and bathroom and beyond the lounge another cabin all the plateglass windows faced out over the port side we went through the cabins in a minute looking beneath beds examining cupboards wardrobes behind drapes everywhere nothing we left out in the passageway again i nodded at the suite opposite number two this one now i said to white sorry sir cant do it its the old man and his nurses sir they had three special trays sent up to themwhen now let me see yes sir about sixfifteen tonight and mr carreras the gentleman who came aboard today he gave instructions that they were not to be disturbed till morning white was enjoying this very strict instructions sir carreras i looked at the purser whats he got to do with this mr cummings you havent heard no i dont suppose so seems like mr carrerasthe fatheris the senior partner in one of the biggest law firms in the country cerdan and caireras mr cerdan founder of the firm is the old gentleman in the cabin here seems hes been a semiparalysed cripplebut a pretty tough old cripplefor the past eight years his son and wifecerdan junior being the next senior partner to carrerashave had him on their hands all that time and i believe the old boy has been a handful and a half i understand carreras offered to take him along primarily to give cerdan junior and his wife a break carreras naturally feels responsible for him so i suppose thats why he left his orders with benson doesnt sound like a man at deaths door to me i said nobodys wanting to kill him off just to ask him a few questions or the nurses white opened his mouth to protest again but i pushed roughly past him and knocked at the door no answer i waited all of thirty seconds and then knocked again loudly white beside me was stiff with outrage and disapproval i ignored him and was lifting my hand to put some real weight on the wood when i heard a movement and suddenly the door opened inwards it was the shorter of the two nurses the plump one who had answered the door she had an oldfashioned pullstring linen cap over her head and was clutching with one hand a light woolen wrap that left only the toes of her mules showing the cabin behind her was only dimly lit but i could see it held a couple of beds one of which was rumpled the free hand with which she rubbed her eyes told the rest of the story my sincere apologies miss i said i had no idea you were in bed im the chief officer of this ship and this is mr cummings the purser your chief steward is missing and we were wondering if you may have seen or heard anything that might help us missing she clutched the wrap more tightly you mean you mean hes just disappeared lets say we cant find him can you help us at all i dont know ive been asleep you see she explained we take it in threehour turns to be by old mr cerdans bed it is essential that he is watched all the time i was trying to get in some sleep before my turn came to relieve miss werner im sorry i repeated you cant tell us anything then im afraid not perhaps your friend miss werner can miss werner she blinked at me but mr cerdan is not to be please this might be very serious one of the crew is missing and delay doesnt increase his chances very well like all competent nurses she knew how far she could go and when to make up her mind but i must ask you to be very quiet and not to disturb mr cerdan in any way at all she didnt say anything about the possibility of mr cerdan disturbing us but she might have warned us as we passed through the open door of his cabin he was sitting up in bed a book on the blankets before him with a bright overhead bed light illuminating a crimson tasselled nightcap and throwing his face into deep shadow but a shadow not quite deep enough to hide the hostile gleam under barstraight tufted eyebrows the hostile gleam it seemed to me was as much a permanent feature of his face as the large beak of a nose that jutted out over a straggling white moustache the nurse who led the way made to introduce us but cerdan waved her to silence with a peremptory hand imperious i thought was the word for the old boy not to mention badtempered and downright illmannered i hope you can explain this damnable outrage sir his voice was glacial enough to make a polar bear shiver bursting into my private stateroom without so much as by your leave he switched his gimlet eyes to cummings you you there you had your orders damn it strictest privacy absolutely explain yourself sir i cannot tell you how sorry i am mr cerdan cummings said smoothly only the most unusual circumstances rubbish whatever this old coot was living for it couldnt have been with the object of out live his friends hed lost his last friend before hed left the nursery amanda get the captain on the phone at once the tall thin nurse sitting on the highbacked chair by the bedside made to gather up her knittingan all but finished paleblue cardiganlying on her knees but i gestured to her to remain where she was no need to tell the captain miss werner he knows all about ithe sent us here we have only one small request to make of you and mr cerdan and i have only one very small request to make of you sir his voice cracked into a falsetto excitement or anger or age or all three of them get the hell out of here i thought about taking a deep breath to calm myself but even that two or three seconds delay would only have precipitated another explosion so i said at once very good sir but first i would like to know if either yourself or miss werner here heard any strange or unusual sounds inside the past hour or saw anything that struck you as unusual our chief steward is missing so far we have found nothing to explain his disappearance missing hah cerdan snorted probably drunk or asleep then as an afterthought or both he is not that sort of man cummings said quietly can you help us im sorry sir miss werner the nurse had a low husky voice we heard and saw nothing nothing at all that might be of any help but if theres anything we can do theres nothing for you to do cerdan interrupted harshly except your job we cant help you gentlemen good evening once more outside in the passageway i let go a long deep breath that i seemed to have been holding for the past two minutes and turned to cummings i dont care how much that old battleaxe is paying for his stateroom i said bitterly hes still being undercharged i can see why mr and mrs cerdan junior were glad to have him off their hands for a bit cummings conceded coming from the normally imperturbable and diplomatic purser this was the uttermost limit in outright condemnation he glanced at his watch not getting anywhere are we and in another fifteen twenty minutes the passengers will start drifting back to their cabins how about if you finish off here while i go below with white right ten minutes i took keys from white and started on the remaining four suites while cummings left for the six on the deck below ten minutes later having drawn a complete blank in three of the four remaining suites i found myself in the last of them the big one on the port side aft belonging to julius beresford and his family i searched the cabin belonging to beresford and his wifeand by this time i was really searching not just only for benson but for any signs that he might have been therebut again a blank the same in the lounge and bathroom i moved into a second and smaller cabin the one belonging to beresfords daughter nothing behind the furniture nothing behind the drapes nothing under the fourposter i moved to the aft bulkhead and slid back the roll doors that turned the entire side of the cabin into one huge wardrobe miss susan beresford i reflected certainly did herself well in the way of clothes there must have been about sixty or seventy hangers in that wall cupboard and if any one hanger was draped with anything that cost less than two or three hundred dollars i sadly missed my guess i ploughed my way through the balenciagas diors and givenchys looking behind and beneath but nothing there i closed the roll doors and moved across to a small wardrobe in a corner it was full of furs coats capes stoles why anyone should haul that stuff along on a cruise to the caribbean was completely beyond me i laid my hand on a particularly fine fulllength specimen and was moving it to one side to peer into the darkness behind when i heard a faint click as of a handle being released and a voice said it is rather a nice mink isnt it mr carter that should be worth two years salary to you any day chapter susan beresford was a beauty all right a perfectly oval shaped face high cheekbones shining auburn hair eyebrows two shades darker and eyes the greenest green you ever saw she had all the officers on the ship climbing the walls even the ones she tormented the life out of all except carter that was a permanent expression of cool amusement does nothing to endear the wearer to me not just then that i had any complaint on that ground she was neither cool nor amused and that was a fact two dull red spots of angerand was there perhaps a tinge of feartouched the tanned cheeks and if the expression on her face didnt yet indicate the reaction of someone who has just come across a particularly repulsive beetle under a flat stone you could see that it was going to turn into something like that pretty soon it didnt require any micrometer to measure the curl at the corner of her mouth i let the mink drop back into place and pulled the wardrobe door to you shouldnt startle people like that i said reproachfully you should have knocked i should have her mouth tightened she still wasnt amused what were you going to do with that coat nothing i never wear mink miss beresford it doesnt suit me i smiled but she didnt i can explain im sure you can she was halfway round the edge of the door now on her way out but i think i would rather you made the explanation to my father suit yourself i said easily but please hurry what im doing is urgent use the phone there or shall i do it leave that phone alone she said irritably she sighed closed the door and leaned against it and i had to admit that any door even the expensively panelled ones on the campari looked twice the door with susan beresford draped against it she shook her head then gave me an upfromunder look with those startling green eyes i can picture many things mr carter but one thing i cant visualise is our worthy chief officer taking off for some deserted island in a ships lifeboat with my mink in the stern sheets getting back to normal i noted with regret besides why should you there must be over fifty thousand dollars worth of jewellery lying loose in that drawer there i missed that i admitted i wasnt looking in drawers i am looking for a man who is sick or unconscious or worse and benson wouldnt fit in any drawer ive ever seen benson your head steward that nice man she came a couple of steps towards me and i was obscurely pleased to see the quick concern in her eyes hes missing i told her all i knew myself that didnt take long when i was finished she said well upon my word what a todo about nothing he could have gone for a stroll round the decks or a sitdown or a smoke yet the first thing you do is to start searching cabins you dont know benson miss beresford he has never in his life left the passenger accommodation before eleven pm we couldnt be more concerned if wed found that the officer of the watch had disappeared from the bridge or the quartermaster had left the wheel excuse me a moment i opened the cabin door to locate the source of voices outside and saw white and another steward some way down the passage whites eyes lit up as he caught sight of me then clouded in disapproval when he saw susan beresford emerging through the doorway behind me whites sense of propriety was having a rollercoasts ride that night i was wondering where you were sir he said reprovingly mr cummings sent me up no luck down below im afraid sir mr cummings is going through our quarters now he stood still for a moment then the anxiety came to the foreground and erased the disapproval from his face what shall i do now sir nothing not personally youre in charge till we find the chief steward and the passengers come first you know that detail three stewards to be at the forward entrance to the a accommodation in ten minutes time one to search the officers quarters forward another for the officers quarters aft the third for the galleys pantries storerooms but wait till i give the word miss beresford id like to use your phone please i didnt wait for permission i lifted the phone got the exchange had them put me through to the bosuns cabin and found i was lucky he was at home macdonald first mate here sorry to call you out archie but theres trouble bensons missing the chief steward sir there was something infinitely reassuring about that deep slow voice that had never lost a fraction of its lilting west highland intonation in twenty years at sea in the complete lack of surprise or excitement in the tone macdonald was never surprised or excited about anything he was more than my strong right arm he was deckside the most important person on the ship and the most indispensable youll have searched the passengers and the stewards quarters then yes nothing doing take some men on or off watch doesnt matter move along the main decks lots of the crew usually up there at this time of night see if any of them saw benson or saw or heard anything unusual maybe hes sick maybe he fell and hurt himself for all i know hes overboard and if weve no luck another bloody search sir i suppose im afraid so can you be finished and up here in ten minutes that will be no trouble sir i hung up got through to the duty engineer officer asked him to detain some men to come to the passenger accommodation made another call to tommy wilson the second officer then asked to be put through to the captain while i was waiting miss beresford gave me her smile again the sweet one with too much malice in it for my liking my my she said admiringly arent we efficient phoning here phoning there crisp and commanding general carter planning his campaign this is a new chief officer to me a lot of unnecessary fuss i said apologetically especially for a steward but hes got a wife and three daughters who think the bun rises and sets on him she coloured right up to the roots of her auburn hair and for a moment i thought she was going to haul off and hit me then she spun on her heel walked across the deep piled carpet and stood staring out through a window to the darkness beyond id never realised before that a back could be so expressive of emotion then captain bullen was on the phone his voice was as gruff and brusque as usual but even the metallic impersonality of the phone couldnt hide the worry any luck yet mister none at all sir ive a search party lined up could i start m five minutes there was a pause then he said it has to come to that i suppose how long will it take you twenty minutes half an hour youre going to be very quick about it arent you i dont expect him to be hiding from us sir whether hes sick or hurt himself or had some urgent reason for leaving the passengers quarters i expect to find him in some place pretty obvious he grunted and said nothing i can do to help half question half statement no sir the sight of the captain searching about the upper deck or peering under lifeboat covers would do nothing to increase the passengers confidence in the campari right then mister if you want me ill be in the telegraph lounge ill try to keep the passengers out of your hair while youre getting on with it that showed he was worried all right and badly worried hed just as soon have gone into a cage full of bengal tigers as mingle socially with the passengers very good sir i hung up susan beresford had recrossed the cabin and was standing near screwing a cigarette into a jade holder about a foot in length i found the holder vaguely irritating as i found everything about miss beresford irritating not least the way she stood there confidently awaiting a light i wondered when miss beresford had last been reduced to lighting her own cigarettes not in years i supposed not so long as there was a man within a hundred yards she got her light puffed out a lazy cloud of smoke and said a search party is it should be interesting you can count on me im sorry miss beresford i must say i didnt sound sorry ships company business the captain wouldnt like it nor his first officer is that it dont bother to answer that one she looked at me consideringly but i could be uncooperative too what would you say if i picked up this phone and told my parents id just caught you going through our personal belongings i should like that lady i know your parents i should like to see you being spanked for behaving like a spoilt child when a mans life may be in danger the colour in the high cheekbones was going on and off like a neon light that evening now it was on again she wasnt by a long way as composed and detached as shed like the world to think she stubbed out the newly lit cigarette and said quietly how would it be if i reported you for insolence dont just stand there talking about it the phones by your side when she made no move towards it i went on quite frankly lady you and your kind make me sick you use your fathers great wealth and your privileged position as a passenger on the campari to poke fun more often than not malicious fun at members of the crew who are unable to retaliate theyve just got to sit and take it because theyre not like you they have no money in the bank at all most of them but they have families to feed mothers to support so they know they have to keep smiling at miss beresford when she cracks jokes at their expense or embarrasses or angers them because if they dont miss beresford and her kind will see to it that theyre out of a job please go on she said she had suddenly become very still thats all of it misuse of power even in so small a thing is contemptible and then when anyone dares to retaliate as i do you threaten them with dismissal which is what your threat amounts to and thats worse than contemptible its cowardly i turned and made for the door first id look for benson then id tell bullen i was quitting i was getting tired of the campari anyway mr carter yes i turned but kept my hand on the doorknob the colour mechanism in her cheeks was certainly working overtime this time shed gone pale under the tan she took a couple of steps towards me and put her hand on my arm her hand wasnt any too steady i am very very sorry she said in a low voice i had no idea amusement i like but not malicious amusement i thought well i thought it was harmless that no one minded and i would never dream of putting anyones job in danger ha i said you dont believe me still the same small voice still the hand on my arm of course i believe you i said unconvincingly and then i looked into her eyes which was a big mistake and a very dangerous thing to do for those green eyes i noticed for the first time had a curious trick of melting and dissolving that could interfere very seriously with a mans breathing it was certainly interfering with my breathing of course i believe you i repeated and this time the ring of conviction staggered even myself you will please forgive my rudeness but i must hurry miss beresford can i come with you please oh damn it all yes i said irritably id managed to look away from her eyes and start breathing again come if you want at the forward end of the passageway just beyond the entrance to cerdans suite i ran into carreras senior he was smoking a cigar and had that look of contentment and satisfaction that passengers invariably had when antoine was finished with them ah there you are mr carter he said wondered why you hadnt returned to our table what is wrong if i may ask there must be at least a dozen of the crew gathered outside the accommodation entrance i thought regulations forbade theyre waiting for me sir benson you probably havent had the chance to meet him since you came aboard hes our chief stewards missing thats a search party outside missing the grey eyebrows went up what on earth well of course you havent any idea what has happened to him or you wouldnt be organising this search can i help i hesitated thought of miss beresford who had already elbowed her way in realised id now no way of stopping any or all of the passengers from getting into the act if they wanted to and said thank you mr carreras you dont look like a man who would miss very much we come from the same mould mr carter i let this cryptic remark go and hurried outside a cloudless night with the sky crowded with the usual impossible number of stars a soft warm wind blowing out of the south a moderate cross swell running but no match for our dennybrown stabilisers that could knock twentyfive degrees off a thirtydegree roll without half trying a black shape detached itself from a nearby shadowed bulkhead and archie macdonald the bosun came towards me for all his solid fifteenstone bulk he was as light on his feet as a dancer any luck bosun i asked no one saw anything no one heard anything and there were at least a dozen folk on deck tonight between eight and nine mr wilson there ah there mr wilson take the engine room staff and three abs main deck and below you should know where to look by this time i added bitterly macdonald you and i will do the upper decks port side you starboard side me two seamen and a cadet half an hour then back here i sent one man to examine the boat positionswhy benson should have wished to get into a boat i couldnt even imagine except that lifeboats have always had a queer attraction for those who wished to hide although why he should wish to hide i couldnt guess eitherand another to scour the superstructure abaft the bridge i started going through the cabins on the boat deck chart house flag and radar cabins and had mr carreras to help me rusty our youngest apprentice went aft to work his way forward accompanied by miss beresford who had probably guessed and rightly that i was in no mood for her company but rusty was he always was nothing that susan beresford said to or about him made the slightest difference to him he was her slave and didnt care who knew it if shed asked him to jump down the funnel just for her sake hed have considered it an honour i could just imagine him searching about the upper decks with susan beresford by his side his face the same colour as his flaming shock of hair as i stepped out of the radar office i literally bumped into him he was panting as if hed run a long way and i could see i had been wrong about the colour of his face in the halflight on the deck it looked grey like old newspaper radio office sir he gasped out the words and caught my arm a thing he would never normally have dreamed of doing come quickly sir please i was already running you found him no sir its mr brownell brownell was our chief wireless operator something seems to have happened to him i reached the office in ten seconds brushed past the pale blur of susan beresford standing just outside the door crossed over the storm sill and stopped brownell had the overhead rheostat turned down until the room was less than half lit a fairly common practice among radio operators on duty night watches he was leaning forward over his table his head pillowed on his right forearm so that all i could see was his shoulders dark hair and the bald spot that had been the bane of his life his left hand was outflung his fingers just brushing the bridge telephone the transmitting key was sending continuously i eased the right forearm forward a couple of inches the transmitting stopped i felt for the pulse in the outstretched left wrist i felt for the pulse in the side of the neck i turned to susan beresford still standing in the doorway and said do you have a mirror she nodded wordlessly fumbled in her bag and handed over a compact opened the mirror showing i turned up the rheostat till the radio cabin was harsh with light moved brownells head slightly held the mirror near mouth and nostrils for maybe ten seconds took it away glanced at it then handed it back somethings happened to him all right i said my voice was steady unnaturally so hes dead or i think hes dead rusty get dr marston right away hes usually in the telegraph lounge this time of night tell the captain if hes there not a word to anyone else about this rusty disappeared and another figure appeared to take his place beside susan beresford in the doorway carreras he stopped one foot over the storm sill and said my god benson no brownell wireless officer i think hes dead on the offchance that bullen hadnt yet gone down to the lounge i reached for the bulkhead phone labelled captains cabin and waited for an answer staring at the dead man sprawled across the table middleaged cheerful his only harmless idiosyncrasy being an unusual vanity about his personal appearance that had once even driven him to the length of buying a toupee for his bald spot public shipboard opinion had forced him to discard it brownell was one of the most popular and genuinely liked officers on the ship was had been i heard the click of a lifted receiver captain carter here could you come down to the wireless office at once please benson brownell dead sir i think there was a pause a click i hung up reached for another phone that connected directly to the radio officers cabins we had three radio officers and the one with the middle watch from midnight to am usually skipped dinner in the dining room and made for his bunk instead a voice answered peters here first mate sorry to disturb you but come up to the radio room right away whats up youll find out when you get here the overhead light seemed far too bright for a room with a dead man in it i turned the rheostat and the white glare was replaced by a deep yellow glare rustys face appeared in the doorway he didnt seem so pale any more but maybe the subdued light was just being kind to him surgeons coming sir his breathing was quicker than ever just picking up his bag in the dispensary thanks go and fetch the bosun will you and no need to kill yourself running rusty theres no great hurry now he left and susan beresford said in a low voice whats wrong whatwhat happened to him you shouldnt be here miss beresford what happened to him she repeated thats for the ships surgeon to say looks to me as if he just died where he sat heart attack coronary thrombosis something like that she shivered made no reply dead men were no new thing to me but the faint icy prickling on the back of my neck and spine made me feel like shivering myself the warm trade wind seemed cooler much cooler than it had a few minutes ago dr marston appeared no running no haste even with dr marston a slow measured man with a slow measured stride a magnificent mane of white hair clipped white moustache a singularly smooth and unlined complexion for a man getting so far on in years steady clear keen blue eyes with a peculiarly penetrating property here you knew instinctively was a doctor you could trust implicitly which only went to show that your instinct should be taken away from you and locked up in some safe place where it couldnt do you any harm admittedly even to look at him made you feel better and that was all right as far as it went but to go further to put your life in his hands say was a very different and dicey proposition altogether for there was an even chance that you wouldnt get it back again those piercing blue eyes had not lighted on the lancet or made any attempt to follow the latest medical developments since quite a few years prior to the second world war but they didnt have to he and lord dexter had gone through prep school public school and university together and his job was secure as long as he could lift a stethescope and to be fair to him when it came to treating wealthy and hypochondriacal old ladies he had no equal on the seven seas well john he boomed with the exception of captain bullen he addressed every officer on the ship by his first name exactly as a public school headmaster would have addressed one of his more promising pupils but a pupil that needed watching all the same whats the trouble beau brownell taken a turn worse than that im afraid doctor dead good lord brownell dead let me see let me see a little more light if you please john he dumped his bag on the table fished out his stethescope sounded brownell here and there took his pulse and then straightened with a sigh in the midst of life john and not recently either temperatures high in here but i should say hes been gone well over an hour i could see the dark bulk of captain bullen in the doorway now waiting listening saying nothing heart attack doctor i ventured after all he wasnt all that incompetent just a quarter of a century out of date let me see let me see he repeated he turned brownells head and looked closely at it he had to look closely he was unaware that everyone in the ship knew that piercing blue eyes or not he was as shortsighted as a dodo and refused to wear glasses an look at this the tongue the lips the eyes above all the complexion no doubt about it no doubt at all cerebral haemorrhage massive and at his age how old john fortyseven eight thereabouts fortyseven just fortyseven he shook his head gets them younger every day the stress of modern living and that outstretched hand doctor i asked reaching for the phone you think just confirms my diagnosis alas felt it coming on tried to call for help but it was too sudden too massive poor old beau brownell he turned caught sight of bullen leaning in the doorway ah there you are captain a bad business a bad business a bad business bullen agreed heavily miss beresford you have no right to be here youre cold and shivering go to your cabin at once when captain bullen spoke in that tone the beresford millions didnt seem to matter any more dr marston will bring you a sedative later and perhaps mr carreras will be so kind i began certainly carreras agreed at once i will be honoured to see the young lady to her cabin he bowed slightly offered her his arm she seemed more than glad to take it and they disappeared five minutes later all was back to normal in the radio cabin peters had taken the dead mans place dr marston had returned to his favourite occupation of mingling socially and drinking steadily with our millionaires the captain had given me his instructions id passed them on to the bosun and brownell canvaswrapped had been taken forward to the carpenters store i stayed in the wireless office for a few minutes talking to a very shaken peters and looked casually at the latest radio message that had come through all radio messages were written down in duplicate as received the original for the bridge and the carbon for the daily spiked file i lifted the topmost message from the file but it was nothing very important just a warning of deteriorating weather far to the southeast of cuba which might or might not build up to a hurricane routine and too far away to bother us i lifted the blank message pad that lay at peters elbow may i have this help yourself he was still too upset even to be curious as to why i wanted it plenty more where that came from i left him walked up and down the deck outside for some time then made my way to the captains cabin where id been told to report when i was through he was in his usual seat by the desk with cummings and the chief engineer sitting on the settee the presence of mcllroy a short stout tynesider with the facial expression and hair style of friar tuck meant a very worried captain and a council of war mcllroys brilliance wasnt confined to reciprocating engines that plump laughtercreased face concealed a brain that was probably the shrewdest on the campari and that included mr julius beresford who must have been very shrewd indeed to make his three hundred million dollars or whatever it was sit down mister sit down bullen growled the mister didnt mean i was in his black books just another sign that he was worried no signs of benson yet no sign at all what a bloody trip bullen pushed across a tray with whisky and glasses on it unaccustomedly openhanded liberality that was just another sign of his worry help yourself mister thank you sir i helped myself lavish lythe chance didnt come oftenand went on what are we going to do about brownell what the devil do you mean what are we going to do about brownell hes got no folks to notify no consent to get about anything head office has been informed burial at sea at dawn before our passengers are up and about mustnt spoil their blasted trip i suppose wouldnt it be better to take him to nassau sir nassau he stared at me over the rim of his glass then lowered it carefully to the table just because a man has died you dont have to go off your blasted rocker do you nassau or some other british territory or miami some place where we can get competent authorities police authorities to investigate things what things johnny mcllroy asked he had his head cocked to one side like a fat and wellstuffed owl yes what things bullens tone was quite different from mcllroys just because the search party hasnt turned up benson yet you ive called off the search party sir bullen pushed back his chair till his hands rested on the table at the full stretch of his arms youve called off the search party he said softly who the hell gave you authority to do anything of the kind no one sir but i why did you do it johnny mcllroy again very quietly because well never see benson again not alive that is bensons dead bensons been killed no one said anything not for all of ten seconds the sound of the cool air rushing through the louvres in the overhead trunking seemed abnormally loud then captain bullen said harshly killed benson killed are you all right mister what do you mean killed murdered is what i mean murdered murdered mcllroy shifted uneasily in his chair have you seen him have you any proof how can you say he was murdered i havent seen him and i havent any proof not a scrap of evidence i caught a glimpse of the purser sitting there his hands twisting together and his eyes staring at me and i remembered that benson had been his best friend for close on twenty years but i have proof that brownell was murdered tonight and i can tie the two together there was an even longer silence youre mad bullen said at length with harsh conviction so now brownells been murdered too youre mad mister off your bloody trolley you heard what dr marston said massive cerebral haemorrhage but of course hes only a doctor of forty years standing he wouldnt know how about giving me a chance sir i interrupted my voice sounded as harsh as his own i know hes a doctor i also know he hasnt very good eyes but i have i saw what he missed i saw a dark smudge on the back of brownells uniform collarand when has anybody on this ship ever seen a mark on any shirt that brownell ever wore they didnt call him beau brownell for nothing somebody had hit him with something heavy and with tremendous force on the back of the neck there was also a faint discolouration under the left eari could see it as he lay there when the bosun and i got him down to the carpenters store we examined him together there was a corresponding slight bruise under his right earand traces of sand under his collar someone sandbagged him and then when he was unconscious compressed the carotid arteries until he died go and see for yourselves not me mcllroy murmured you could see that even his normally monolithic composure had been shaken not me i believe itabsolutely it would be too easy to disprove it i believe it all right but i still cant accept it but damn it all chief bullens fists were clenched the doctor said that im no medical man mcllroy interrupted but i should imagine the symptoms are pretty much the same in both cases can hardly blame old marston bullen ignored this gave me the full benefit of his commodores stare look mister he said slowly youve changed your tune havent you when i was there you agreed with dr marston you even put forward the heartfailure idea you showed no signs miss beresford and mr carreras were there i interrupted i didnt want them to start getting wrong ideas if word got round the ship and it would have been bound to that we suspected murder then whoever was responsible might have felt themselves forced to act again and act quickly to forestall any action we might take i dont know what they might do but on the form to date it would have been something damned unpleasant miss beresford mr carreras bullen had stopped clenching his hands but you could see that it wouldnt take much to make him start up again miss beresford is above suspicion but carreras and his son just aboard today and in most unusual circumstances it might just tie up it doesnt i checked carreras senior and junior had both been in either the telegraph lounge or the dining room for almost two hours before we found brownell theyre completely in the clear besides being too obvious mcllroy agreed i think captain its time we took our hats off to mr carter here hes been getting round and using his head while all we have been doing is twiddling our thumbs benson captain bullen said he didnt show any signs of taking off his hat how about benson how does he tie up this way i slid the empty telegraph book across the table i checked the last message that was received and went to the bridge routine weather report time but later there was another message written on this pad original carbon duplicate the message is indecipherable but to people with modern police equipment it would be childs play to find out what was written there what is decipherable is the impression of the last two time figures look for yourself its quite clear thirtythree that means a message came through at that moment a message so urgent in nature that instead of waiting for the routine bridge messenger collection brownell made to phone it through at once that was why his hand was reaching for the phone when we found him not because he was feeling ill all of a sudden and then he was killed whoever killed him had to kill knocking brownell out and stealing the message would have accomplished nothing for as soon as he would have come to he would have remembered the contents of the message and immediately sent it to the bridge it must i added thoughtfully have been a damned important message benson bullen repeated impatiently how about benson benson was the victim of a lifetime of habit howie here tells us how benson invariably went out on deck between halfpast eight and twentyfive to nine for a smoke while the passengers were at dinner the radio room is immediately above where he would have been taking his promenadeand the message came through and brownell was killed inside those five minutes benson must have seen or heard something unusual and gone to investigate he might even have caught the murderer in the act and so benson had to die too but why captain bullen demanded he still couldnt believe it all why why why why was he killed why was that message so desperately important the whole damned things crazy and what in gods name was in that message anyway thats why we have to go to nassau to find out sir bullen looked at me without expression looked at his drink evidently decided that he preferred his drink to me or the ill news i brought with meand knocked back the contents in a couple of gulps mcllroy didnt touch his he sat there for a whole minute looking at it consideringly then said you havent missed much johnny but youve missed one thing the wireless officer on watch peters isnt it how do you know the same message wont come through again maybe it was a message requiring acknowledgement if it was and its not acknowledged its pretty certain to come through again then whats the guarantee that peters wont get the same treatment the bosuns the guarantee chief hes sitting in black shadow not ten yards from the wireless office with a marlinespike in his hand and highland murder in his heart you know macdonald heaven help anyone who goes within a sunday walk of the wireless office bullen poured himself another small whisky smiled tiredly and glanced at his single broad commodores stripe mr carter i think you and i should change jackets it was as far in apology as he could ever go and about twelve hours ahead of par think youd like this side of my desk suit me fine sir i agreed especially if you took over entertaining the passengers in that case well stay as we are another brief smile no sooner there than vanished whos on the bridge jamieson isnt it better take over first later sir with your permission theres still the most important thing of all to investigate but i dont even know how to start dont tell me theres something else bullen said heavily ive had some time to think about this thats all i said a message came through to our wireless office a message so important that it had to be intercepted at all costs but how could anyone possibly know that message was coming through the only way that message could have come into the campari was through a pair of earphones clamped to brownells head yet someone else was taking down that message at the same instant as brownell was must have been brownell had no sooner finished transcribing that message onto his pad than he reached for the phone to get the bridge and he no sooner reached for the phone than he died theres some other radio receiver aboard the campari tuned into the same wave length and wherever it is its not a hop skip and jump from the wireless office for wherever the eavesdropper was he got from there to the wireless office in seconds problem find the receiver bullen looked at me mcllroy looked at me they both looked at each other then mcllroy objected but the wireless officer keeps shifting wave lengths how could anybody know what particular wave length he was on at any one moment how can anyone know anything i asked i nodded at the message pad on the table until we get that deciphered the message bullen gazed at the pad abruptly made up his mind nassau it is maximum speed chief but slowly over half an hour so that no one will notice the stepup in revs first the bridge get our position he fetched chart rules dividers while i was getting the figures nodded at me as i hung up lay off the shortest possible course it didnt take long from here to here sir approximately miles then arrival maximum speed of course just before midnight tomorrow night he reached for a pad scribbled for a minute then read out port authorities nassau ss campari position such andsuch arriving tomorrow wednesday request police alongside immediate investigation one murdered man one missing man urgent bullen master that should do he reached for the phone i touched his arm whoever has this receiver can monitor outgoing calls just as easily as incoming ones then theyll know were on to them god only knows what might happen then bullen looked slowly first at me then at mcllroy then at the purser who hadnt spoken a word since id arrived in the cabin then back at me again then he tore the message into tiny shreds and dropped it into the wastepaper basket chapter i didnt get a great deal of investigating done that night id figured out how to start all right but the devil of it was i couldnt start till the passengers were up and about in the morning nobody likes being turted out of his bed in the middle of the night a millionaire least of all after having cautiously identified myself to the bosun to ensure that i didnt get the back of my head stove in with a marlinespike i spent a good fifteen minutes in the vicinity of the wireless office relating its position to other offices and nearby accommodation the wireless office was on the starboard side left immediately above the forward a deck accommodation and cerdans suite was directly belowand on the basis of my assumption that the murderer even if he didnt wait for the last few words of the message to come through could have had no more than ten seconds to get from wherever the hidden receiver was to the wireless office then any place within ten seconds reach of the wireless office automatically came under suspicion there were quite a few places within the suspected limits there was the bridge flag office radar office chart room and all the deck officers and cadets accommodation those could be ruled out at once there was the dining room galleys pantries officers lounge telegraph lounge and immediately adjacent to the telegraph lounge another lounge which rejoiced in the name of the drawing roomit having been found necessary to provide an alternative lounge for our millionaires wives and daughters who werent all so keen on the alcoholic and tickertape attractions of the telegraph lounge as their husbands and fathers were i spent forty minutes going through thosethey were all deserted at that time of nightand if anyone had yet invented a transistor receiver smaller than a match box then i might have missed it but anything larger id have found it for sure that left only the passengers accommodation with the cabins on a deck immediately below the wireless office as the prime suspects the b deck suites on the next deck below were not out with the bounds of possibility but when i ran a mental eye over the stifflegged bunch of elderly crocks on b deck i couldnt think of a man among them who could have made it to the wireless office in under ten seconds and it certainly hadnt been a woman because whoever had killed brownell had not only also laid out benson but removed him from sight and benson weighed a hundred and eighty pounds if he weighed an ounce so a or b decks both of them would have to go through the sieve tomorrow i prayed for good weather to tempt our passengers out onto the sun decks to give the stewards in the course of making up beds and cleaning out the cabins the chance to carry out a thorough search the customs in jamaica of course had already done this but they had been looking for a mechanism over six feet in length not a radio which in these days of miniaturisation could easily have been hidden in say one of those hefty jewel boxes which were run of the mill among our millionaires wives we were running almost due northeast now under the same indigo sky ablaze with stars the campari rolling gently as it sliced along the line of the long slow swell wed taken almost half an hour to make an eightydegree change of course so that no nightowl passenger abroad on deck could see the changing direction of our wake not that those precautions were going to be of any use if any of our passengers had the faintest of stellar navigation or come to that the very elementary ability to locate the pole star i was walking slowly up the boat deck port side when i saw captain bullen approaching he lifted his arm motioned me into the deep shadow cast by one of the ships lifeboats thought i would find you here or hereabouts he said softly he reached under his jacket and pressed something cold and hard into my hand i believe you know how to use one of those starlight glinted dully off the blued metal in my hand a colt automatic one of the three kept on a locked chain in a glass cabinet in the captains sleeping cabin captain bullen was certainly taking things seriously at last i can use it sir right stick it in your belt or wherever you stick those damned things never realised they were so blasted awkward to conceal about your person and heres a spare magazine hope to god we dont have to use them which meant the captain had one also the third gun sir i dont know he hesitated wilson i thought hes a good man but give it to the bosun the bosun bullens voice sharpened then he remembered the need for secrecy and dropped his voice to a conspiratorial growl you know the regulations mister those guns to be used only in times of war piracy or mutiny and never to be issued to anyone other than an officer the regulations dont concern me half as much as my own neck does sir you know macdonalds recordyoungestever sergeantmajor in the commandos a list of decorations as long as your arm give it to macdonald sir well see he grunted well see ive just been to the carpenters store with doc marston first time ive ever seen that old phony shaken to the core he agrees with you says theres no doubt brownell was murdered youd think he was up in the dock of the qld bailey with the alibis hes giving himself but i think mcllroy was right when he said the symptoms were about the same well i said doubtfully i hope nothing comes of it sir what do you mean you know old doc marston as well as i do sir the two great loves of his life are jamaica rum and the desire to give the impression that hes on the inside of everything that goes on a dangerous combination apart from mcllroy the purser yourself and myself the only person who knows that brownell didnt die a natural death is the bosun and hed never talk doc marston is a different proposition altogether not to worry my boy bullen said with something like relish in his voice i told our worthy surgeon that lord dexters pal or not if he as much as lifted a glass of rum before we arrived in nassau id have him on the beach and for good within the week i tried to imagine anyone telling that venerable and aristocratic doctor anything of the sort my mind boggled at the very thought but they hadnt made bullen company commodore for nothing i knew hed done exactly as stated he didnt take off any of brownells clothes i asked his shirt for instance no what does it matter its just that its probable that whoever strangled brownell had his fingers locked round the back of the neck to give leverage and i believe that police today can pick up fingerprints from practically any substance including certain types of clothes they shouldnt have too much trouble picking up prints from those nice shiny starched collars that brownell wore you dont miss much bullen said thoughtfully except maybe youve missed your profession anything else yes about this burial at sea tomorrow at dawn there was a long pause then he said with the blasphemously weary restraint of a longsuffering man who has already held himself in check far too long what bloody burial at dawn brownell is our only exhibition for the nassau police burial sir i repeated but not at dawn about say eight oclock when a fair number of our passengers will be up and about having had their morning constitutional this is what i mean sir i told him what i meant and he listened patiently enough considering when i was finished he nodded slowly two or three times in succession turned and left me without a word i moved out into a lane of light between two lifeboats and glanced at my watch twentyfive minutes past eleven id told macdonald id relieve him at midnight i walked across to the rail and stood there by a lifejacket locker staring out over the slow shimmering swell of the sea hands at arms length on the rail vainly trying to figure out what could possibly lie behind all that had happened that evening when i awoke it was twenty minutes to one not that i was immediately aware of the time when i awoke i wasnt immediately and clearly aware of anything its difficult to be aware of anything when your head is being squeezed between the jaws of a giant vice and your eyes have gone blind to be aware of anything that is except the vice and the blindness blindness my eyes i was worried about my eyes i raised a hand and fumbled round for a while and then i found them they were filled with something hard and encrusted and when i rubbed the crust came away and there was stickiness beneath blood there was blood in my eyes blood that was gumming the lids together and making me blind at least i hoped vaguely it was blood that was making me blind i rubbed some more blood away with the heel of my hand and then i could see not too well not the way i was used to seeing the stars in the sky were not the bright pin points of light to which i was accustomed but just a pale fuzzy haze seen through a frostedglass window i reached out a trembling hand and tried to touch this frosted glass but it vanished and dissolved as i reached out and what my hand touched was cool and metallic i strained my eyes wide open and saw that there was indeed no glass there what i was touching was the lowermost bar of the ships rail i could see better now at least better than a blind man could my head was lying in the scuppers inches away from one of the lifeboat davits what in gods name was i doing there with my head in the scuppers inches away from the davits i managed to get both hands under me and with a sudden drunken lurch heaved myself into a semisitting position with one elbow still on the deck a great mistake a very great mistake for at once a blinding agonising pain that neverrecorded pain that must be experienced in the final shattering millisecond of awareness as a plunging guillotine slices through bone flesh and muscle before crashing into the block beneath slashed its paralysing way across head neck and shoulders and toppled me back to the deck again my head must have struck heavily against the iron of the scuppers but i dont think i even moaned slowly infinitely slowly consciousness came back to me consciousness of a kind where clarity and awareness and speed of recovery were concerned i was a man chained hand and foot surfacing from the bottom of a sea of molasses something i dimly realised was touching my face my eyes my mouth something cold and moist and sweet water someone was sponging my face with water gently trying to mop the blood from my eyes i made to turn my head to see who it was and then i vaguely remembered what had happened last time i moved my head i raised my right hand instead and touched someones wrist take it easy sir you just take it easy the man with the sponge must have had a long arm he was at least two miles away but i recognised the voice for all that archie macdonald dont you try moving now just you wait a bit youll be all right sir archie we were a real disembodied pair i thought fuzzily i was at least a couple of miles away too i only hoped we were a couple of miles away in the same direction is that you archie god knows i didnt doubt it i just wanted the reassurance of hearing him say so its myself sir just you leave everything to me it was the bosun all right he couldnt have used that sentence more than five thousand times in the years id known him just you lie still id no intention of doing anything else id be far gone in years before id ever forget the last time i moved if i lived that long which didnt seem likely at the moment my neck archie my voice sounded a few hundred yards closer i think its broken aye im sure it feels that way sir but im thinking myself maybe its not as bad as all that well see i dont know how long i lay there maybe two or three minutes while the bosun swabbed the blood away until eventually the stars began to swim into some sort of focus again then he slid one arm under my shoulders and under my head and began to lift me inch by patient inch into a sitting position i waited for the guillotine to fall again but it didnt this time it was more like a butchers meat chopper but a pretty blunt chopper several times in a few seconds the campari spun round degrees on its keel then settled down on course again i seemed to recall and this time i didnt lose consciousness what time is it archie a stupid question to ask but i wasnt at my very best and my voice i was glad to hear was at last practically next door to me he turned my left wrist twelve fortyfive your watch says sir i think you must have been lying here a good hour you were in the shadow of the boat and no one would have seen you even if they had passed by this way i moved my head an experimental inch and winced at the pain of it two inches and it would fall off what the hell happened to me archie some kind of turn or other i dont remember some kind of turn his voice was soft and cold i felt his fingers touch the back of my neck our friend with the sandbag has been taking a walk again sir one of these days he added thoughtfully im going to catch him at it sandbag i struggled to my feet but id never have made it without the bosun the wireless office peters its young mr jenkins thats on now sir hes all right you said youd relieve me for the middle watch and when twenty past twelve came i knew something was wrong so i just went straight into the wireless office and phoned captain bullen the captain who else could i phone sir who else indeed apart from myself the captain was the only deck officer who really knew what had happened who knew where the bosun was concealed and why macdonald had his arm round me now still half supporting me leading me forward to the cross passage that led to the wireless office he came at once hes there now talking to mr jenkins worried stiff thinks the same thing might have happened to you as happened to benson he gave me a present before i came looking for you he made a movement and i could see the barrel of a pistol that was all but engulfed in his huge hand i am hoping that i get a chance to use this mr carter and not the butt end either i suppose you realise that if you had toppled forward instead of sideways youd most likely have fallen over the rail into the sea i wondered grimly why they hadnt in fact shoved me over the side but said nothing just concentrated on reaching the wireless office captain bullen was waiting there just outside the door and the bulge in the pocket of his uniform jacket wasnt caused only by his hand he came quickly to meet us probably to get out of earshot of the wireless officer and his reaction to my condition and story of what had happened was all that anyone could reasonably have wished for he was just mad clear through id never seen him in such a mood of tightly controlled anger since id first met him three years ago when hed calmed down a bit he said but why the devil didnt they go the whole hog and throw you overboard while they were at it they didnt have to sir i said wearily they didnt want to kill me just to get me out of the road he peered at me the cold eyes speculative you talk as if you knew why they coshed you i do or i think i do i rubbed the back of my neck with a gentle hand i was pretty sure now there werent any vertebrae broken it just felt that way my own fault i overlooked the obvious come to that we all overlooked the obvious once theyd killed brownell and wed deduced by association that theyd also killed benson i lost all interest in benson i just assumed that theyd got rid of him all i was concerned with all any of us was concerned with was to see that there was no further attack made on the wireless office to try to find out where the receiver was and to figure what lay behind it all benson we were sure was dead and a dead benson could no longer be of any use to us so we forgot benson benson belonged to the past are you trying to tell me that benson was isstill alive he was dead all right i felt about ninety a badly crippled ninety and the vice round my head wasnt easing off any i could notice he was dead but they hadnt got rid of him maybe they hadnt a chance to get rid of him maybe they had to wait till it was real good and dark to get rid of him but they had to get rid of himself wed found him wed have known there was a murderer aboard they probably had him stashed away in some place where we wouldnt have thought of looking for him anyway lying on top of one of the offices stuck in a ventilator behind one of the sundeck benches it could have been anywhere and i was either too near where theyd stashed him so that they couldnt get at him or they couldnt chuck him overboard as long as i was standing by the rail there barring myself they knew they were safe enough going at maximum speed with a bow wave like were throwing up right now no one would have heard anything if they had dropped him into the sea and on a dark and moonless night like this no one would have seen anything either so theyd only me to deal with and they didnt find that any trouble at all i finished bitterly bullen shook his head you never heard a thing not the faintest fall of a footstep not even the swish of a cosh coming through the air old flannelfeet must be a pretty dangerous character sir i said reflectively he didnt make the slightest whisper of sound i wouldnt have thought it possible for all i know i might have taken a fainting turn and struck my head on the davit as i fell thats what i thought myself even suggested it to the bosun here and thats what im going to tell anyone who wants to know tomorrow i grinned and winked at macdonald and even the wink hurt ill tell them youve been overworking me sir and i collapsed from exhaustion why tell anyone bullen wasnt amused it doesnt show where you have been coshed that wound is just above the temple and inside the hairline and could be pretty well camouflaged agreed no sir someone knows i had an accident the character responsible for itand hes going to regard it as damned queer if i make no reference to it at all but if i do mention it and pass it off as a ladylike swoon theres an even chance he may accept it and if he does were still going to have the advantage of being in the position of knowing theres mayhem and murder aboard while they will have no suspicion we know anything of the kind your mind said captain bullen unsympathetically is beginning to clear at last when i awoke in the morning the already hot sun was streaming in through my uncurtained window my cabin immediately abaft the captains was on the starboard side and the sun was coming from forward which meant that we were still steaming northeast i raised myself on my elbow to have a look at the sea conditions for the campari had developed a definite if gentle pitching movement and it was then that i discovered that my neck was rigidly bound in a plaster cast at least it felt exactly like it i could move it about an inch to either side and then a pair of clamps took hold a dull steady ache but no pain worth mentioning i tried to force my head beyond the limits of the clamps but i only tried once i waited till the cabin stopped swaying round and the redhot wires in my neck had cooled off to a tolerable temperature then climbed stiffly out of my bunk let them call me stiffneck carter if they wanted that was enough of that lot i crossed to the window still a cloudless sky with the sun white glaring already high above the horizon striking a glittering blinding path across the blueness of the sea the swell was deeper longer heavier than i expected and coming up from the starboard quarter i wound down the window and there was no wind i could notice which meant that there was a fair breeze pushing up from astern but not enough to whiten the smoothly roiled surface of the sea i showered shavedid never before appreciated how difficult it is to shave when the turning motion of your head is limited to an arc of two inchesthen examined the wound seen in daylight it looked bad much worse than it had in the night above and behind the left temple it was a two inch gash wide and very deep and it throbbed heavily in a way i didnt much care for i picked up the phone and asked for doc marston he was still in bed but yes he would see me right away an earlybird hippocratical willingness that was very much out of character but maybe his conscience was bothering him about his wrong diagnosis of the previous night i dressed put on my hat adjusted it to a suitably rakish angle till the band just missed the wound and went down to see him dr marston fresh rested and unusually clear of eye no doubt due to bullens warning to lay off the rum didnt look like a consciencestricken man whod tossed and turned the sleepless night long he didnt seem unduly worried about the fact that we carried aboard a passenger who if hed truthfully listed his occupation would have put down the word murderer all he seemed concerned about was the entry in last nights log and when i told him no entry about brownell had been made or would be made until we arrived in nassau and that when it was made no mention of my name would appear in connection with the diagnosis of brownells death he became positively jovial he shaved off a few square inches of hair jabbed in a local anaesthetic cleaned and sutured the wound covered it with a sticking plaster pad and wished me good morning he was through for the day it was quarter to eight i dropped down the series of accommodation ladders that led to the focsle and made my way forward to the carpenters store the focsle was unusually crowded for that time of the morning there must have been close on forty members of the ships company gathered there deck staff engineroom staff cooks and stewards all waiting to pay their last respects to brownell nor were these all the spectators i looked up and saw that the promenade deck which curved right round the forward superstructure of the campari was dotted with passengers eleven or twelve in all not many but they represented close on the total male passenger complement aboardi could see nb women therewith the exception of old cerdan and possibly one or two others bad news travelled fast and even for millionaires the chance of seeing a burial at sea didnt come along too often right in the middle of them was the duke of hartwell looking nautical as anything in his carefully adjusted royal yachting club cap silk scarf and brassbuttoned navy doeskin jacket i skirted number one hold and thought grimly that there might indeed be something in the old superstitions the dead cried out for company the old salts said and the dead men loaded only yesterday afternoon and now lying in the bottom of number four hold hadnt been slow to get that company two others gone in the space of a few hours near as a toucher three only id fallen sideways instead of toppling over the rail i felt those icecold fingers on the back of my neck again and shivered then passed into the comparative gloom of the carpenters store right up in the forepeak everything was ready the biera hastily nailedtogether platform of boards seven feet by twolay on the deck and the red ensign tied to two corners of the handles at the top of the bier but free at the other end covered the canvas wathed mound beneath only the bosun and the carpenter were there to look at macdonald you would never have guessed that he hadnt slept the previous night he had volunteered to remain on guard outside the wireless office until dawn it had also been his idea that though the chances of any trouble in daylight were remote two men should be tailed for holystoning the deck outside the wireless office after breakfast for the entire day if necessary meantime the radio office was closedand heavily padlockedto allow peters and jenkins to attend the funeral of their colleague there was no difficulty about this as was common there was a standard arrangement whereby a bell rang either on the bridge or in the chief wireless operators cabin whenever a call came through on the distress frequency or on the camparis call sign the slight vibration of the camparis engines died away as the engine slowed and the revs dropped until we had just enough speed to give us steerageway in that heavy swell the captain came down the companionway carrying a heavy brassbound bible under his arm the heavy steel door in the port hand focsle side was swung open and back till it secured with a clang in its retaining latch a long wooden box was slid into position one end level with the opening in the side of the ship then macdonald and the carpenter bareheaded appeared carrying bier and burden and laid them on the box the service was very brief very simple captain bullen said a few words about brownell about as true as words usually are in those circumstances led the tattered singing of abide with me read the burial service and nodded to the bosun the royal navy did this sort of thing better but we didnt carry any bugles aboard the campari macdonald lifted the inboard end of the bier the canvasswathed mound slid out slowly from beneath the red ensign and was gone with only the faintest of splashings to mark its departure i glanced up at the promenade deck and saw the duke of hartwell there standing stiffly at attention right arm bent up to his peaked cap in rigid salute even allowing for the natural disadvantages lent him by his face i had seldom seen a more ludicrous sight no doubt to the unbiassed observer he was putting up a more fitting show than myself but i find it hard to be at my reverent best when i know that all im committing to the deep is a length of canvas large quantities of engineroom waste and a hundred and fifty pounds of rusty chain to give the necessary negative buoyancy the door in the ships side clanged shut captain bullen handed over the bible to a cadet the engine revs mounted and the campari was back in business again and the first item on the agenda was breakfast in my three years aboard the campari i had rarely seen more than half a dozen passengers in the dining saloon for breakfast most of them preferred to have it served in their suites or on the private verandahs outside their suites barring a few aperitifs followed by antoines or henriques superb cooking there was nothing to beat a good funeral to bring out the sociable best in our passengers there could only have been seven or eight missing altogether i had a full complement at my table except of course for the invalid mr cerdan i should have been on watch but the captain had decided that as there was a very able quartermaster on the wheel and no land within seventy miles young dexter who usually stood the watch with me could stand it alone for the length of breakfast no sooner had i pulled in my chair than miss harrbride fixed her beady eyes on me what on earths happened to you young man she demanded to tell you the truth miss harrbride i dont really know myself you what its true i put on my best shamed face i was standing up on the boat deck last night and the next thing i knew i was lying in the scuppers with my head cut must have struck it against the davit when i fell i had my story all prepared dr marston thinks it was a combination of sunstrokei was loading cargo most of the day yesterday and i can assure you that the sun was very hotand the fact that owing to our troubles in kingston and the delay caused by it i havent had very much sleep in the past three days i must say things do keep happening aboard the campari miguel carteras said his face was grave one man dead from a heart attack or whatever it was another missing they havent found our chief steward yet have they im afraid not sir and now you get yourself banged up lets sincerely hope thats the end of it troubles always happen in threes sir im sure this is the end of it weve never before young man let me have a look at you a peremptory voice demanded from the captains table mrs beresford my favourite passenger i twisted round in my seat to find that mrs beresford who normally sat with her back to me had herself turned completely round in hers beyond her the duke of hartwell unlike the previous night was having no trouble at all in devoting his entire attention to susan beresford the usual counterattraction on his right in the best traditions of the theatrical world rarely rose before noon mrs beresford studied me in silence for the better part of ten seconds you dont look well at all mr carter she pronounced finally twisted your neck didnt you you didnt have to turn round in your chair to talk to me a little i admitted its a bit stiff and hurt your back into the bargain she added triumphantly i can tell from the peculiar way you sit it hardly hurts at all i said bravely it didnt in fact hurt me in the slightest but i hadnt yet got the hang of carrying a gun in my waistband and the butt kept sticking painfully into my lower ribs sunstroke eh her face held genuine concern and lack of sleep you should be in bed captain bullen im afraid youre overworking this young man thats what i keep telling the captain maam i said but he doesnt pay any attention to me captain bullen smiled briefly and rose to his feet his eyes as they roved slowly over the room held the expression of a man who wanted both attention and quiet such was the personality of the man that he got it in three seconds flat ladies and gentlemen he began the duke of hartwell regarded the tablecloth with that smellofbadfish expression he reserved for tenants wanting a cut in rent and merchant navy captains who forgot to preface public addresses with the words your grace i am most distressed the captain went on as i am sure you are all distressed by the events of the past twelve hours that we should lose our chief wireless officer through death by natural causes is god knows bad enough but that our chief steward should vanish the same eveningwell in thirty six years at sea i have never known anything like it what happened to chief steward benson we cannot say with any certainty but i can hazard a guess and at the same time issue a warning there are literally hundreds of cases of men vanishing overboard at night and i have little doubt but that bensons death is due to the same reason which probably accounts for per cent of all the other cases even on the most experienced sailors the effect of leaning over the rail at night and watching the black water passing below has a weirdly hypnotic effect i think its something akin to the vertigo that affects a great number of people people who are convinced that if they go near say the parapet of a high building some strange force will make them topple over no matter what their conscious minds may say only with leaning over the rails of a ship there is no fear just a gradual mesmerism a man just leans further and further over until his centre of gravity is suddenly displaced and then he is gone as an alibi or explanation for bensons disappearance it was as good as any as a general statement it was also unfortunately true and so ladies and gentlemen i would counsel you all most strongly never to approach the ships rails at night unless you are accompanied by someone else i would be most grateful if you would all bear that strongly in mind i looked round the passengers as far as my stiff neck would allow they would bear it in mind all right from now on wild horses wouldnt drag them near the camparis rails at night but bullen went on emphatically it will help neither of those unfortunate men and only do ourselves a great disservice if we allow ourselves to brood over those things i cannot ask you to dismiss those deaths from your minds at once but i can ask you not to dwell on them on a ship as elsewhere life must go on especially i might say on a ship you are aboard the campari to enjoy the cruise we are aboard to help you enjoy it i would be most grateful if you would give us your every assistance to get shipboard life back to normal as soon as possible there was a subdued murmur of agreement then julius beresford rising from his seat beside the captain was on his feet do you mind if i say a few words sir he could have bought the blue mail line without even denting his bank balance but still he asked permission to speak and called old bullen sir certainly mr beresford its just this julius beresford had addressed too many board meetings to be anything other than completely at ease when speaking to people no matter how many million dollars they represented i agree and agree completely with everything our captain has said captain bullen has said that he and his crew have a job to do and that that job is to look after the every comfort and convenience of his passengers under the rather sad circumstances in which we have to meet this morning i think that we the passengers have also a job to doto make things as easy as possible for the captain officers and crew and to help them to bring things back to normal as soon as possible id like to start the ball rolling by asking you all to be my guests for a brief period this evening today ladies and gentlemen my wife celebrates her birthday he smiled down at mrs beresford she forgets exactly which one i cannot invite you to a birthday dinner for what could i offer you as a special meal that antoine and henriques do not give us every night of the week but mrs beresford and i should be grateful if you would be our guests at a cocktail party this evening seven fortyfive in the drawing room thank you i looked round the table miguel carreras was nodding slightly as if in grave acceptance and appreciation of beresfords underlying motives miss harrbride was beaming with pleasure she doted on the beresfords not for their money but for the fact that they were one of the very oldest american families with goodness only knew how many generations behind them mr greenstreet her husband studied the tablecloth in his usual intent fashion and tony carreras more impossibly handsome than ever leaned back in his chair and regarded julius beresford with a slightly amused speculative interest or maybe it was susan beresford he was looking at i was more certain than ever that there was something wrong with tony carreras eyes it was almost impossible to tell in what direction they were looking he caught my glance and smiled youll be there mr carter he had that relaxed easygoing manner that comes from having a bank account bursting at the seams but none of the usual hint of condescension tony carreras i could get to like briefly only im afraid i have to go on watch at eight oclock this evening i smiled if youre still at it at midnight ill join you like hell id join them at midnight id be showing the nassau police over the ship and im afraid youll have to excuse me now i have to relieve the officer of the watch i made my excuses and left on the deck i almost bumped into a sandyhaired young seaman whitehead who usually shared my watches on the bridge in his capacity as engine room telegraphist lookout bridge messenger and coffee maker what are you doing here i asked sharply with young dexter on watch i wanted as many sharp eyes and quick minds as possible round him whitehead had both you know youre not to leave the bridge in my absence sorry sir but ferguson sent me ferguson was the quartermaster on the forenoon watch weve missed the last two course alterations and hes getting pretty worried about it we were bringing round three degrees to the north every fifteen minutes to get on a north by west course but slowly so as not to excite anyone why come and bother me about it i said irritably fourth officer dexter is perfectly capable of handling those matters he wasnt but one of the drawbacks of being a fellow officer of dexter was that you were forced to lie like fury to maintain an outward appearance of solidarity yes sir but hes not there mr carter he left the bridge about twenty minutes ago and he hasnt come back yet i pushed violently past whitehead knocking him to one side and made for the bridge at a dead run three steps at a time up the companionways rounding one corner i caught a glimpse of whitehead staring up after me with a most peculiar expression on his face he probably thought i had gone mad chapter ferguson a tall swarthy saturnine cockney with no hair left to speak of glanced round as i burst through the doorway from the starboard wing of the bridge into the wheelhouse his face showed his relief strewth am i glad to see wheres the fourth mate i demanded search me sir them course alterations to hell with the course alterations where did be go ferguson blinked in surprise he had the same look on his face as whitehead had had a few seconds ago the wary bafflement of a man who sees another going off his rocker i dont know sir he didnt say i reached for the nearest phone got through to the dining room asked for bullen he came on and i said carter here sir could you come up to the bridge straightaway there was a brief pause then why dexters missing sir he had the watch but he left the bridge twenty minutes ago left the bridge bullens voice held no inflection but only because he made it that way lord dexters son or not young dexter was finished on the campari unless he could explain this one away looked for him yet he could be anywhere thats what im afraid of sir the phone clicked and i hung up young whitehead still looking apprehensive had just arrived in the cabin i said youll find the third mate in his cabin my compliments to him ask him if hell take over the bridge for a few minutes ferguson sir the voice was still wary mr dexter said nothing at all when he left yes sir i heard him say something like wait a minute what the hells going on here or something like that i cant be sure then he said keep her as she is back in a jiffy and then he was off that was all that was all sir where was he standing at the time on the starboard wing sir just outside the door and he went down that side yes sir where was whitehead at the time out on the port wing sir fergusons expression and tone showed beyond all doubt that he was with a loony but he was playing it cool all the same didnt cross to see where mr dexter had gone no sir he hesitated well not right away but i thought it a bit funny so i asked him to have a look he couldnt see anything damn how long after mr dexter left before he took this look a minute maybe closer on two couldnt be sure sir but whatever mr dexter saw it was aft yes sir i moved out on the wing bridge and looked aft there was no one to be seen on any of the two decks below the crew had long finished washing down decks and the passengers were still at breakfast nobody there nothing of any interest at all to be seen even the wireless office was deserted its door closed and locked i could see the brass padlock clearly gleaming and glittering in the morning sun as the campari pitched slowly gently through the ever lengthening swell the wireless office i stood there perfectly rigid for all of three seconds a candidate in fergusons eyes for a strait jacket if ever there had been one then took off down the companionway the same way as i had come up three steps at a time only a smart piece of braking on my part and a surprisingly nimble bit of dodging on the captains prevented a headon collision at the foot of the companionway bullen put into words the thought that was obviously gaining currency around the bridge have you gone off your bloody rocker mister the wireless office sir i said quickly come on i was there in a few seconds bullen close behind i tried the padlock a heavyduty doubleaction yale but it was securely locked it was then that i noticed a key sticking out from the bottom of the padlock i twisted it first one way then the other but it was jammed fast i tried to pull it out and had the same lack of success i became aware that bullen was breathing heavily over my shoulder what the devils the matter mister whats got into you all of a sudden one moment sir id caught sight of whitehead making his way up to the bridge and beckoned him across get the bosun tell him to bring a pair of pliers yes sir ill get the pliers i said tell the bosun to bring them i said savagely then ask mr peters for the key to this door hurry he hurried you could see he was glad to escape bullen said look here mister dexter left the bridge because he saw something funny going on so ferguson said where else but here sir why here why not look at that i took the padlock in my hand that bent key and everything thats happened has happened because of here the window no good ive looked i led him round the corner to the single square of plate glass night curtains are still drawn couldnt we smash the damned thing in whats the point its too late now bullen looked at me queerly but said nothing half a minute passed in silence bullen was getting more worried every second i wasnt i was as worried as could be already jamieson appeared on his way to the bridge caught sight of us made to come towards us then carried on as bullen waved him away and then the bosun was there carrying a pair of heavy insulated pliers in his hand open this damned door bullen said curtly macdonald tried to remove the key with his fingers failed and brought the pliers into use with the first tug of the pliers the key in the lock snapped cleanly in half well bullen said heavily that helps macdonald looked at him at me then back at the broken key still held in the jaws of the pliers i didnt even twist it sir he said quietly and if thats a yale key he added with an air of faint distaste then im an englishman he handed over the key for inspection the break showed the grey rough porous composition of some base metal homemade and not very well made at that either bullen pocketed the broken key can you get the other bit out no sir completely jammed he fished in his overalls produced a hacksaw maybe this sir good man it took macdonald three minutes hard work the hasp unlike the padlock was made of tempered steeland then the hacksaw was through he slid out the padlock then glanced enquiringly at the captain come in with us bullen said there was sweat on his brow see that nobody comes near he pushed open the door and passed inside i was on his heels wed found dexter all right and wed found him too late he had that oldbundleofclothes look that completely relaxed huddled shapelessness that only the dead can achieve face down outflung on the corticene flooring he hardly left standing room for bullen and myself shall i get the doctor sir it was macdonald speaking he was standing astride the storm sill and the knuckles of the hand holding the door shone bonily through the tautened skin its too late for a doctor now bosun bullen said stonily then his composure broke and he burst out violently my god mister wheres it all going to end hes dead you can see hes dead whats behind what murderous fiend why did they kin him mister why did they have to kill him damn it to hell why did the fiends have to kill him he was only a kid what real harm did young dexter ever do anybody it said much for bullen at the moment that the thought never even occurred to him that the dead man was the son of the chairman and managing director of the blue mail line that thought would come later he died for the same reason that benson died i said he saw too much i kneeled beside him examined the back and sides of his neck no marks there at all i looked up and said can i turn him over sir it cant do any harm now bullens normally ruddy face had lost some colour and the lips were clamped in a thin hard line i heaved and pulled for a few seconds and managed to get dexter more or less turned over half on his shoulders and half on his back i didnt waste time checking his breathing or his pulse when youve been shot three times through the middle of the body the breathing and pulse are things of the past and dexters white uniform shirt with the three small powderblackened bloodtinged holes just beneath the breastbone showed indeed that he had been shot three times the area covering those holes could have been blotted out by a playing card somebody had made very sure indeed i rose to my feet looked from the captain to the bosun then said to bullen we cant pass this off as a heart attack sir they shot him three times bullen said matteroffactly were up against someone in the maniac class sir i stared down at dexter unable to look away from the face racked and twisted by his last conscious moment of life that fleeting moment of tearing agony that had opened the door to death any one of those bullets would have killed him but whoever killed him killed him three times someone who likes pressing a trigger someone who likes seeing bullets thud into a human being even although that human being is dead already you seem very cool about this mister bullen was looking at me with a strange look in his eyes sure im cool i showed bullen my gun show me the man who did this and ill give him what he gave dexter exactly the same and to hell with captain bullen and the laws of the land thats how cool i am im sorry johnny then his voice hardened again nobody heard anything how did nobody hear anything he had his gun close up to dexter maybe jammed right against him you can see the marks of burnt powder that would help to deaden the sound besides everything points to this person those personsas being professionals they would have silencers on their guns i see bullen turned to macdonald could you get peters here bosun at once aye aye sir macdonald turned to leave and i said quickly sir a word before macdonald goes what is it his voice was hard impatient youre going to send a message too right im going to send a message im going to ask for a couple of fast patrol boats to be sent out here to meet us at the speed those gas turbine jobs can go theyll be alongside before noon and when i tell them ive had three men murdered in twelve hours theyll come running ive had enough of playing it smart first this fake burial to lull their suspicions this morning to make them think weve got rid of the only evidence of murder against them see where its got us another man murdered its no use sir its too late now what do you mean he didnt even bother to replace the lid after he left sir i nodded towards the big transmitterreceiver with its metal lid slightly askew the securing screws loose maybe he was in a hurry to get away maybe he just knew there was no point in securing it anyway we were bound to find it out sooner or later and sooner rather than later i lifted the lid and stood to one side to let bullen look also nothing was ever surer than that no one would ever use that transmitter again it was littered inside with torn wire bent metal smashed condensers and valves someone had used a hammer there was no guesswork about that the hammer was still lying among the tangled splintered wreckage that was all that was left of the once complicated innards of the transmitter i replaced the lid theres an emergency set bullen said hoarsely in the cupboard under the table there the one with the petrol generator hell have missed that but the murderer hadnt missed it he wasnt the type to miss anything and be certainly hadnt missed with that hammer if anything hed done an even more thorough job on the emergency set than on the main set and just for good measure hed smashed up the armature of the petrol generator our friend must have been listening in on his receiver again macdonald put in quietly so he came out either to stop the message or smash up the sets so that no more messages could come through he was lucky had he been a bit later and the radio officer back on watch my men would have been holystoning the decks outside and there would have been nothing he would be able to do i dont associate luck with this killer in any way i said hes too damned efficient for that i dont think any more messages which might have worried him had come through but he was afraid they might he knew both peters and jenkins were off watch at the burial and he probably checked that the wireless office was locked so he waited till the coast was clear came out on deck unlocked the office and went inside and dexter unfortunately for himself saw him going in the key mister bullen said harshly the key how come the marconi man in kingston who checked the sets sir remember he remembered all right the marconi man had telephoned the ship asking if servicing facilities were required and bullen had seized on it as a heavensent opportunity to close down the radio office and refuse to accept any more embarrassing and infuriating messages from london and new york he spent about four hours there time to do anything if he was a marconi man im the queen of the may he had a nice big impressive tool kit with him but the only tool he used if you could call it that was a stick of wax heated to the right temperature to take an impression of the yale even if he had managed to pinch the yale and return it unseen it would have been impossible to cut a new one those special yales are far too complicated and my guess is that that was all he did while he was there and my guess was completely wrong but the thought that this fake marconi man might have employed himself in another way during his stay in the wireless office did not occur to me until many hours later it was so blindingly obvious that i missed it altogether although two minutes constructive thought would have been bound to put me on to it but hours were to elapse before i got round to the constructive thought and by that time it was too late too late for the campari too late for its passengers and far far too late for all too many of the crew we left young dexter lying in the wireless office and secured the door with a new padlock wed talked for almost five minutes about the problem of where to put him before the simple solution occurred to us leave him where he was nobody was going to use that wireless office any more that day he was as well there as anywhere till the nassau police came aboard from the wireless office wed gone straight to the telegraph lounge the teleprinters in there were coupled to receiver transmitters on fixed wave lengths to london paris and new york but could be adapted by men who knew what they were doing such as peters and jenkins to receive and transmit on practically any wave length but not even peters and jenkins could do anything about the situation we found there were two big transmitters in the telegraph lounge cleverly designed to look like cocktail cabinets and both had received the same treatment as the sets in the wireless office the exteriors intact the interiors smashed beyond repair somebody had been very busy during the night the wireless office must have been the last item on his list i looked at bullen with your permission sir macdonald and i will go and have a look at the lifeboats we might as well waste our time that way as in any other he knew what i meant all right and nodded captain bullen was beginning to look slightly hunted he was the ablest the most competent master in the blue mall but nothing in his long training and experience had ever been designed to cope with a situation like this and so macdonald and i duly wasted our time there were three lifeboats equipped with handcranked transmitters for emergency use if the campari sank or otherwise had to be abandoned or they had been equipped with them but not any more the transmitters were gone no need to waste time or make a racket smashing up sets when all you have to do is to drop them over the side our murderous friend hadnt missed a single trick when we got back to the captains cabin where we had been told to report there was something in the atmosphere that i didnt like at all they say you can smell fear i dont know about that but you can sense it and you could certainly sense it in that cabin at nine oclock that morning the fear the atmosphere of trapped helplessness the sense of being completely at the mercy of unknown and infinitely powerful and ruthless forces made for an atmosphere of nervously brittle tension that i could almost reach out and touch mcllroy and cummings were there with the captain and so too was our second mate tommy wilson he had had to be told the stage had been reached now where every officer would have to be told so bullen said in the interests of their own safety and selfdefence i wasnt so sure bullen looked up as we came through the door his face was grim and still a thinly opaque mask for the consuming worry that lay beneath well i shook my head took a seat macdonald remained standing but bullen gestured him irritably to a chair he said to no one in particular i suppose that accounts for all the transmitters on the ship as far as we know yes i went on dont you think we should have white up here sir i was about to do that he reached for the phone spoke for a moment hung up then said roughly well mister you were the man with all the bright ideas last night got any this morning just to repeat the words makes them sound harsh and unpleasant but they were curiously empty of any offence bullen didnt know which way to turn and he was grasping at straws none all we know is that dexter was killed at eight twentysix this morning give or take a minute no question about that and at that moment most of our passengers were at breakfast no question about that either the only passengers not at breakfast were miss harcourt mr cerdan and his two nurses mr and mrs piper from miami and that couple from venezuelaold hournos and his wifeand their daughter our only suspects and none of them makes any sense and all of those were at dinner last night when brownell and benson were killed mcllroy said thoughtfully except the old man and his nurses which leaves them as the only suspects which is not only ridiculous but far too obvious i think weve already had plenty of proof that whatever the people behind all this are guilty of being obvious is not one of them unless of course he added slowly some of the passengers are working in collusion with each other or with the crew tommy wilson murmured what old bullen gave him the full benefit of his commodores stare what did you say i said the crew wilson repeated clearly if old bullen was trying to frighten tommy wilson he was wasting his time and by the crew i also include the officers i agree sir that i heardor knew if those murders for the first time only a few minutes ago and i admit that i havent had time to sort out my thoughts on the other hand i havent had the chance to become so involved as all the rest of you are with all respects im not so deeply lost in the wood that i cant see the trees you all seem to be convinced that it must be one or more of our passengers responsible your chief officer here seems to have set this bee firmly in all your bonnets but if a passenger were in cahoots with one of the crew then its quite possible that that member of the crew was detailed to hang round in the vicinity of the wireless office and start laying about him when necessary you said the chief officer was responsible for planting this idea in our minds bullen said slowly what do you mean by that no more than i said sir i only then the implications of the captains question struck him good god sir mr carter do you think im crazy no one thinks youre crazy mcllroy put in soothingly our chief engineer had always regarded wilson as a bit of a mental bantamweight but you could see him slowly revising his opinion the crew tommy what makes you suspect the crew elimination motive and opportunity wilson said promptly we seem to have more or less eliminated the passengers all with alibis what are the usual motives he asked of no one in particular revenge jealousy gain said mcllroy those three there you are then take revenge and jealousy is it conceivable that any of our passengers should have their knives so deeply stuck in brownell benson and dexter as to want to kill them all ridiculous gain what could that bunch of bloated plutocrats want with any more lucre he looked round slowly and what officer or man aboard the campari couldnt do with a little more lucre i could for one opportunity tommy mcllroy prompted him gently opportunity you said i dont have to go into that wilson said engineer and deck crews could be eliminated at once the engineering side except for officers at mealtimes never go anywhere near the passenger and boat decks the bosuns men here are only allowed there in the morning watch for washing down decks buthe looked round him again even more slowly every deck officer radio officer radar operator cook galley slave and steward aboard the campari has a perfect right to be within a few yards of the wireless office at any time no one could question his presence there not only that a knock came at the door and assistant chief steward white came in hat in hand he was looking acutely unhappy and looked even more so when he saw the extent and composition of the welcoming committee come in and sit down bullen said he waited till white had done this then went on where were you between eight and halfpast eight this morning white this morning eight and halfpast white was immediately all stiff outrage i was on duty sir of course i relax bullen said wearily no one is accusing you of anything then he said more kindly weve all had some very bad news white nothing that concerns you directly so dont get too apprehensive youd better hear it bullen told him without any trimmings of the three murders and the one immediate result was that everyone present could immediately remove white from the list of suspects he might have been a good actor but not even an irving could have turned his colour from a healthy red to a greyish pallor at the touch of a switch which was what white did he looked so bad his breathing got so quick and shallow that i rose hastily and fetched him a glass of water he swallowed it in a couple of gulps sorry to upset you white bullen went on but you had to know now then between eight and eightthirty how many of your passengers had breakfast in their rooms i dont know sir im not sure he shook his head then went on slowly sorry sir i do remember mr cerdan and his nurses of course the hournos family miss harcourt mr and mrs piper as mr carter said mcllroy murmured yes bullen nodded now white be very careful did any of those passengers at any time leave their rooms during this period at any time even for a moment no sir quite definitely not not on my deck anyway the hournos are on b deck but none of the others went in or out of any of the suites only stewards with trays i can swear to that sir from my cubiclemr bensons that is i can see every door in the companionway thats so bullen agreed he asked for the name of the senior steward on b deck spoke briefly on the phone then hung up all right white you can go but keep your eyes and earsopen and report to me immediately you come across anything that strikes you as unusual and dont talk about this to anyone white rose quickly and left he seemed glad to go there it is then bullen said heavily everyoneevery one of the passengers that isin the clear im beginning to think you may have the right of it after all mr wilson he looked speculatively at me how about it now mr carter i looked at him then at wilson and said mr wilson seems to be the only one of us that makes any sense what he says is logical completely plausible and fits the facts its too logical too plausible i dont believe it why not bullen demanded because you cant believe that any crew member of the campari could be bought or because it knocks your own pet theories on the bead i cant give you any whys or why nots sir its just a hunch the way i feel captain bullen grunted not a very kindly grunt either but unexpected support came from the chief engineer i agree with mr carter were up against very very clever peopleif it is people he paused then said suddenly is the passage money for the carreras family father and son paid in yet what the devil has that to do with anything bullen demanded has it been paid mcllroy repeated he was looking at the purser its been paid cummings said quietly he was still a long way from getting over the shock caused by the murder of his friend benson in what currency travellers cheques drawn on a new york bank dollars eh now captain bullen i submit thats very interesting indeed paid in dollars yet in may of last year the generalissimo made it a penal offence to be in possession of any foreign currency whatsoever i wonder where our friends got the money from and why are they permitted to be in possession of it instead of lingering in some jungle jail what are you suggesting chief nothing mcllroy confessed thats the devil of it i just dont see how it can tie up with anything i just submit that it is very curious indeed and that anything curious in the present circumstances is worth investigating he sat silently for a moment then said idly i suppose you know that our generalissimo friend recently received a gift from the other side of the iron curtain a destroyer and a couple of frigates trebled his naval strength in one fell swoop i suppose you know the generalissimo is desperate for money his regime is coming apart at the seams for lack of it and thats what lay behind last weeks bloody riots you know that we have a dozen people aboard who would be worth god knows how many millions in ransom money and that if a frigate suddenly did heave over the horizon and order us to stowell how could we send out an sos with all our transmitters smashed i have never heard such a ridiculous suggestion in my life bullen said heavily but ridiculous or not youre thinking about it captain bullen i said to myself by heaven youre thinking about it to knock your suggestion on the head straightaway how could any vessel ever find us where to look for us we changed course last night were over a hundred miles away from where they might expect us to be even if they had any idea where we were going in the first place i could support the chiefs arguments in that sir i put in there seemed no point in mentioning that i thought mcllroys idea as farfetched as did the captain any person with a radio receiver might equally well have a transmitter and miguel carreras himself mentioned to me that he used to command his own ships navigation by sun or stars would be easy for him he probably knows our position to within ten miles and those messages that came through on the radio mcllroy went on message or messages a message so damned important that two men died and the possibility that another such message might come through caused a third man to die what message captain what so tremendously important a message warnings from where from whom i dont know warnings captain bullen knowledge which in our hands would have destroyed some carefully laid plans and the scope of those plans you can judge from the fact that three men died so that that message should not come through old bullen was shaken he tried not to show it but he was shaken badly and i knew it next moment when he turned to tommy wilson on the bridge mr wilson double lookouts stay doubled till we get to nassau he looked at mcllroy if we get to nassau signaller to stand by the aldis all day i want assistance flags ready for the yardarm radar office if they take their eyes off the screen for a second ill have em on the beach no matter how small a blip they see no matter what distance report immediately to the bridge we turn towards them for assistance sir you blithering idiot bullen snarled we run for our lives in the opposite direction do you want to steam into the waiting guns of a destroyer no question but that bullen was far off balance the selfcontradictory element in his instructions escaped him completely you believe the chief then sir i asked i dont know what to believe bullen growled im just taking no chances when wilson left i said maybe the chief is right maybe wilson is right too both could go together an armed attack on the campari with certain suborned members of the crew backing up the attackers but you still dont believe it mcllroy said quietly im like the captain i dont know what to believe but one thing i do know for certain the radio receiver that intercepted the message we never got thats the key to it all and thats the key were going to find bullen heaved himself to his feet chief id be glad if you came with me were going to search for this radio personally first we start in my quarters then in yours then we go through the quarters of every member of the crew of the campari then we start looking anywhere where it might be cached outside their quarters you come with us macdonald the old man was in earnest all right if that radio was in the crews quarters hed find it the fact that hed offered to start the search in his own suite was warranty enough for that he went on mr carter i believe its your watch yes sir but jamieson could look out for me for an hour permission to search the passengers quarters wilson was right about that bee in your bonnet mister which only went to show how upset bullen was normally where circumstances demanded he was the most punctilious of men and in the presence of the bosun he would never have spoken as he had done to wilson and myself he glowered at me and walked out he hadnt given my permission but he hadnt refused it either i glanced at cummings he nodded and rose to his feet we had luck in the conditions for our search the purser and i in that we didnt have to turf anyone out of their cabins they were completely deserted radio reports in the morning watch had spoken of weather conditions deteriorating sharply to the southeast and bulletins had been posted warning of approaching bad weather the sun decks were crowded with passengers determined to make the most of the blue skies before the weather broke even old cerdan was on deck flanked by his two watchful nurses the tall one with a big meshstring knitting bag and clicking away busily with her needles the other with a pile of magazines reading you had the impression with them as with all good nurses that less than half their minds were on what they were doing without stirring from their chairs they seeded to hover over old cerdan like a couple of broody hens i had the feeling that when cerdan paid nurses to hover he would expect his moneys worth he was in his wheel chair with a richly embroidered rug over his bony knees i took a good long look at that rug as i passed by but i was only wasting my time so tightly was that rug wrapped round his skinny shanks that he couldnt have concealed a match box under it far less a radio with a couple of stewards keeping watch we went through the suites on a and b decks with meticulous care i had a bridge megger with me which was to lend cover to our cover story if we had to use one that we were trying to trace an insulation break in a power cable but no passenger with a guilty mind was going to fall for that one for a moment when he found us in his cabin so we thought the stewards a good idea there should have been no need for any passenger aboard the campari to have a radio every passengers cabin on the ship with the camparis usual extravagance was fitted out with not one but two bulkhead relay receivers fed from a battery of radios in the telegraph lounge eight different stations could be brought into circuit simply by pressing the eight preselector buttons this was all explained in the brochure so normally nobody thought of bringing radios along cummings and i missed nothing we examined every cupboard wardrobe bed drawer even my ladies jewel boxes nothing nothing anywhere except in one place miss harcourts cabin there was a portable there but then i had known that there had been one every night when the weather was fine miss harcourt would wander out on deck clad in one of her many evening gowns find a chair and twiddle around the tuning knob till she found some suitable soft music maybe she thought it lent something to the air of enchantment and mystery that should surround a movie queen maybe she thought it romantic it could have been of course that she just liked soft music however it was one thing was certainmiss harcourt was hot our suspect not to put too fine a point on it she just didnt have the intelligence and in fairness despite her pretensions she was too nice i retired defeated to the bridge and took over from jamieson almost an hour elapsed before another defeated man came to the bridge captain bullen he didnt have to tell me he was defeated it was written on him in the still troubled face the slight sag of the broad shoulders and a mute head shake from me told him all he needed to know i made a mental note in the not unlikely event of lord dexter turfing us both out of the blue mail to turn down any suggestions by captain bullen that we should go into a detective agency together there might be faster ways of starving perhaps but none more completely certain we were on the second leg of our course now degrees west of north heading straight for nassau twelve hours and we would be there my eyes ached from scanning the horizons and skies even although i knew that there were at least ten others doing the same thing still my eyes ached whether i believed mcllroys suggestion or not i certainly behaved as if i did but the horizon remained clear completely miraculously clear for this was normally a fairly heavily travelled steamer lane and the loudspeaker from the radar room remained obstinately silent we had a radar screen on the bridge but rarely troubled to consult it walters the operator on watch could isolate and identify a blip on the screen long before most of us could even see it after maybe half an hours restless pacing about the bridge bullen turned to go just at the head of the companionway he hesitated turned beckoned me and walked out to the end of the starboard wing i followed ive been thinking about dexter he said quietly what would be the effect im past caring about the passengers now im only worried about the lives of every man and woman aboardif i announced that dexter had been murdered nothing i said if you can call mass hysteria nothing you dont think the fiends responsible for all this might call it off whatever it is im dead certain they wouldnt as no mention has been made of dexter yet no attempt to explain away his absence they must know we know hes dead theyll know damned well that the officer of the watch cant disappear from the bridge without a hue and cry going up wed just be telling them out loud what they already know without being told you wont scare this bunch off people dont play as rough as they do unless theres something tremendous at stake thats what i thought myself johnny he said heavily thats just what i thought myself he turned and went below and i had a sudden foreknowledge of how bullen would look when he was an old man i stayed on the bridge until two oclock long past my usual time for relief but then id deprived jamieson who had the afternoon watch of much free time that morning a tray came up to me from the galley and for the first time ever i sent an offering by henriques back untouched when jamieson took over the bridge he didnt exchange a word with me except routine remarks about course and speed from the strained set expression on his face you would have thought he was carrying the mainmast of the campari over his shoulder bullen had been talking to him hed probably been talking to all the officers that would get them all as worried as hell and jittery as a couple of old spinsters lost in the casbah i didnt see that it would achieve anything else i went to my cabin closed the door pulled off shoes and shirt and lay down on my bunkno fourposters for the crew of the campariafter adjusting the louvre in the overhead coldair trunking until the draught was directed on my chest and face the back of my head ached and ached badly i adjusted a pillow under it and tried to ease the pain it still ached so i let it go and tried to think somebody had to think and i didnt see that old bullen was in any state for it neither was i but i thought all the same i would have bet my last cent that the enemyi couldnt think of them as anything else by this timeknew our course destination and time of arrival almost as well as we did ourselves and i knew that they couldnt afford to let us arrive in nassau that night not at least until they had accomplished what they had set out to accomplish whatever that might be somebody had to think time was terribly short by three oclock id got nowhere id worried all round the problem as a terrier worries an old slipper id examined it from every angle id put forward a dozen different solutions all equally improbable and turned up around dozen suspects all equally impossible my thinking was getting me nowhere i sat up careful of my stiff neck fished a bottle of whisky from a cupboard poured a drink watered it knocked it back and then because it was illegal helped myself to another i placed this second on the table by my bunk and lay down again the whisky did it ill always swear the whisky did it as a mental lubricant for rustedup brains it has no parallel after five more minutes of lying on my back staring sightlessly up at the coldair trunking above my head i suddenly had it i had it suddenly completely and all in a moment and i knew beyond doubt that i had it right the radio the receiver on which the message to the wireless office had been intercepted there had been no radio god only a blind man like myself could have missed it of course there had been no radio but there had been something else again i sat bolt upright with a jerk archimedes coming out of his bath and yelped as a hot blade skewered through the back of my neck are you subject to these attacks often or do you always carry on like this when you are alone a solicitous voice enquired from the doorway susan beresford dressed in a squarenecked white silk dress was standing in the entrance her expression half amused half apprehensive so complete had been my concentration that id never even heard the door open miss beresford i rubbed my aching neck with my right hand what are you doing here you know passengers are not allowed in the officers quarters no i understood my father had been up several times in the past few trips talking to you your father is not young female and unmarried pfui she stepped into the cabin and closed the door behind her all at once the smile was no longer on her face will you talk to me mr carter any time i said courteously but not here my voice trailed away i was changing my mind even as i spoke you see youre the only person i can talk to she said yes a beautiful girl alone in my cabin and plainly anxious to speak to me and i wasnt even listening to her i was figuring out something it did involve susan beresford but only incidentally oh do pay attention she said angrily all right i said resignedly im paying youre paying what she demanded attention i reached for my whisky glass cheers i thought you were forbidden alcohol on duty i am what do you want i want to know why no one will talk to me she lifted a hand as i made to speak please dont be facetious im worried somethings terribly wrong isnt there you know i always talk more to the officers than any of the other passengersi passed up the pleasure of loosing off a couple of telling shaftsand now nobody will talk to me daddy says im imagining it im not i know im not they wont talk and not because of me i know theyre all dead scared about something going about with tight faces and not looking at anyone but looking at them all the time something is wrong isnt there terribly terribly wrong and fourth officer dexter hes missing isnt he what would be wrong miss beresford please this was something for the books susan beresford pleading with me she walked across the cabinwith the size of the accommodation old dexter saw fit to provide for his chief officers that didnt require more than a couple of stepsand stood in front of me tell me the truth three men missing in twentyfour hoursdont tell me thats coincidence and all the officers looking as if theyre going to be shot at dawn dont you think it strange youre the only person who seems to have noticed anything unusual how about all the other passengers the other passengers the tone of her voice didnt say a great deal for the other passengers how can they notice anything with all the women either in bed for their afternoon sleep or at the hairdressers or in the massage room and all the men sitting around in the telegraph lounge like mourners at a funeral just because the stock exchange machines have broken down and thats another thing why have those machines broken down and why is the radio office closed and why is the campari going so fast i went right aft just now to listen to the engines and i know weve never gone so fast before she didnt miss much and that was a fact i said why come to me daddy suggested it she hesitated then half smiled he said i was imagining things and that for a person suffering from delusions and a hyperactive imagination he could recommend nothing better than a visit to chief officer carter who doesnt know the meaning of either your father is wrong wrong you da ahsuffer from delusions about your imagining things you arent i finished my whisky and got to my feet something is wrong far wrong miss beresford she looked me steadily in the eyes then said quietly will you tell me what it is please the cool amusement was now completely absent from both face and voice a completely different susan beresford from the one id known and one i liked very much better than the old one for the first time and very late in the day the thought occurred to me that this might be the real susan beresford when you wear a price ticket marked umpteen million dollars and are travelling in a forest alive with wolves looking for gold and a free meal ticket for life some sort of shield some kind of protective device against the wolves is liable to be very handy indeed and i had to admit that the air of half mocking amusement which seldom left her was a most effective deterrent will you tell me please she repeated shed come close to me now the green eyes had started to melt in that weird way they had and my breathing was all mixed up again i think you could trust me mr carter yes i looked away it took the last of my will power but i looked away and managed to get my breathing working again inout inout it wasnt too difficult when you got the hang of it i think i could trust you miss beresford i will tell you but not right away if you knew why i say that you wouldnt press me to tell you any of the passengers out taking the air or sunbathing what the sudden switch made her blink but she recovered quickly and gestured to the window in this i saw what she meant the sun had gone completely and heavy dark cumulus clouds coming up from the southeast had all but obscured the sky the sea looked rougher than it had been but i had the feeling that the temperature would have fallen away i didnt like the look of the weather and i could quite understand why none of the passengers would be on deck that made things awkward but there was another way i see what you mean i promise you ill tell you all you want to know this eveningthat was a pretty elastic time limitif you in turn promise you wont tell anyone ive admitted anything is wrongand if you will do something for me what do you want me to do this you know your father is holding some sort of cocktail party for your mother in the drawing room tonight its timed for seven fortyfive get him to advance it to seven thirty i want more time before dinner never mind why now use any reason you like but dont bring me into it and ask your father to invite old mr cerdan to the party also doesnt matter if he has to take his wheel chair and the two nurses along with him get him to the party your fathers a man of very considerable powers of persuasionand i imagine you could persuade your father to do anything tell him you feel sorry for the old man always being left out of things tell him anything only get old man cerdan to the cocktail party i cant tell you how vital that is she looked at me in slow speculation she really had the most extraordinary eyes three weeks shed been with us and id never really noticed them before eyes of that deep yet translucent green of sea water over sand in the windward isles eyes that melted and shimmered in the same way as when a catspaw of wind riffled the surface of the water eyes that i dragged my own eyes away see carter old beresford had said theres the man for you no imaginative fancies about him thats what he thought i became aware that she was saying quietly ill do it i promise i dont know what track youre on but i know its the right track what do you mean i said slowly that nurse of mr cerdans the tall one with the knitting she can no more knit than fly over the moon she just sits there clicking needles botching every other stitch and getting practically nowhere i know being a millionaires daughter doesnt mean that you cant be as slick with a pair of knitting needles as the next girl what i caught her by the shoulders and stared down at her you saw this youre sure of it sure im sure well now i was still looking at her but this time i wasnt seeing the eyes i was seeing a great number of other things and i didnt like any of them i said this is very interesting ill see you later be a good girl and get that fixed with your father will you i gave her shoulder an absentminded pat turned away and stared out of the window after a few seconds i became aware that she hadnt yet gone shed the door opened one hand on the handle and was looking at me with a peculiar expression on her face you wouldnt like to give me a toffee apple to suck if you can imagine a voice both sweet and bitter at the same moment then that is how hers was or a ribbon for my pigtails with that she banged the door and was gone the door didnt splinter in any way but that was only because it was made of steel i gazed at the closed door for a moment then gave up any other time i might have devoted some minutes to figuring out the weird and wonderful working of the female brain but this wasnt just any other time whatever it was this just wasnt any other time i pulled on shoes shirt and jacket pulled out the colt from under the mattress stuck it in my waist belt and went off in search of the captain chapter as far as attendance went mr julius beresford had no grounds for complaint that night every single passenger on the ship had turned up for his wifes cocktail party and as far as i could see every offduty officer on the campari was there as well and the party was certainly going splendidly already at seven fortyfive practically everyone was already on his or her second drink and the drinks served up in the drawing room of the campari were never small ones beresford and his wife had been moving round speaking to each of the guests in rotation and now it was my turn i saw them approaching raised my glass and said many happy returns mrs beresford thank you young man enjoying yourself of course so is everybody and you should be most of all yes she sounded just the slightest bit doubtful i dont know if julius was rightly mean its less than twentyfour hours if youre thinking about benson and brownell maam youre worrying unnecessarily you couldnt have done a better thing than arrange this im sure every passenger on the ship is grateful to you for helping to get things back to normal so quickly i know all the officers are anyway just as i told you my dear beresford patted his wifes hand then looked at me amusement touching the corners of his eyes my wife like my daughter seems to have the greatest faith in your judgement mr carter yes sir i wonder if you could persuade your daughter not to go visiting in the officers quarters no beresford said regretfully its impossible selfwilled young lady he grinned ill bet she didnt even knock she didnt i looked across the room to where miss beresford was giving tony carreras the full benefit of her eyes over the rim of a martini glass they certainly made a striking couple she had with respect some bee in her bonnet about something being wrong aboard the campari i think the unfortunate happenings last night must have upset her naturally and you managed to remove this i think so sir there was a slight pause then mrs beresford said impatiently julius were just beating about the bush oh now mary i dont think rubbish she said briskly young man do you know one of the principal reasons i came along on this trip apart she smiledfrom the food because my husband asked me to because he wanted a second opinion from you julius as you know has made several trips on your ship he has as the saying goes had an eye on you for a job in his organisation my husband i may say has made his fortune not so much by working himself as by picking the right men to work for him hes never made a mistake yet i dont think hes making a mistake now and you have another very special recommendation yes maam i said politely youre the only young man of our acquaintance who doesnt turn himself into a carpet to be trampled on as soon as our daughter appears in sight a very important qualification believe me would you like to work for me mr carter beresford asked bluntly i think i would sir well mrs beresford looked at her husband thats settled will you julius beresford interrupted no sir why not because your interests are in steel and oil i know only the sea and ships they dont mix i have no qualifications to work for you and at my present age id be too long in acquiring them and i couldnt accept a job for which id no qualifications even at double the money or three times im grateful for the offer sir believe me i do appreciate it but theres more to it than money ah well the beresfords looked at each other they didnt seem too disturbed over my refusal there was no reason why they should we asked a question we got an answer fair enough he changed the subject what do you think of my feat in getting the old man here tonight i think it was very thoughtful of you i glanced across the room to a spot near the door where old cerdan sherry glass in hand was sitting in his wheel chair with his nurses on a settee by his side they too had sherry glasses the old boy seemed to be talking animatedly to the captain he must lead a very shutin life much difficulty in persuading him none at all he was delighted to come i filed away this piece of information my one encounter with cerdan had left me with the impression that the only thing that would delight him about such an invitation would be the opportunity to give a surly refusal if youll excuse us mr carter hosts duties to their guests you know certainly sir i stood to one side but mrs beresford planted herself in front of me and smiled quizzically mr carter she said firmly youre a very stiffnecked young man and please dont for a moment imagine that im referring to your accident of last night they moved off i watched them go thinking all sorts of thoughts then crossed to the hinged flap that led to the rear of the bar whenever i approached that flap i felt it was not a glass i should have in my hand but a machete to help me hack my way through the jungle of flowers potted shrubs cacti and festoons of creepers and hanging plants that transformed the place into the most unlikely looking bar youd ever seen the interior desiguer responsible had gone into rhapsodies about it but it was all right for him he didnt have to live with it all he had to do was to retire nightly to his semidetached in south london where his wife would have had him out the door if hed tried on any such nonsense at home but the passengers seemed to like it i made it to the back of the bar without getting scratched too much and said to the barman hows it going louis very well sir louis said stiffly his bald pate was gleaming with sweat and his hairline moustache twitching nervously there were irregularities going on and louis didnt like irregularities then he thawed a bit and said they seem to be drinking a fair bit more than usual tonight sir not half as much as they will later on i moved to the crystalladen shelves from where i could see under the back of the bar and said you dont look very comfortable to me by god and im not and indeed there wasnt much room for the bosun to wedge his bulk between the raised deck and the underside of the bar his knees were up to his chin but at least he was completely invisible to anyone on the other side of the counter stiff as hell sir never be able to move when the time comes and the smell of all that liquor driving you round the bend i said sympathetically i wasnt as cool as i sounded i had to keep wiping the palms of my hands on the sides of my jacket but try as i would i couldnt seem to get them properly dry i moved over to the counter again a double whisky louis a large double whisky louis poured the drink and handed it across without a word i raised it to my lips lowered it below counter level and a large hand closed gratefully round it i said quietly as if speaking to louis if the captain notices the smell afterwards you can claim it was that careless devil louis that spilt it over you im taking a walk now archie if everythings ok ill be back in five minutes and if not if youre wrong heaven help me the old man will feed me to the sharks i made my way out from behind the bar and sauntered slowly towards the door i saw bullen trying to catch my eye but i ignored him he was the worlds worst actor i smiled at susan beresford and tony carreras nodded civilly enough to old cerdan bowed slightly to the two nurses the thin one i noticed had returned to her knitting and she seemed to me to be doing all right and reached the doorway once outside i dropped all pretence at sauntering i reached the entrance to the passengers accommodation on a deck in ten seconds halfway down the long central passageway white was sitting in his cubicle i walked quickly down there lifted the lid of his desk and took out the four items lying inside colt revolver torch screw driver and master key i stuffed the colt into my belt the torch in one pocket the screw driver in the other i looked at white but he didnt look at me he was staring down into one corner of his cubicle as if i didnt exist he had his hands clasped tightly together like one in prayer i hoped he was praying for me even with his hands locked he couldnt stop them from shaking uncontrollably i left him without a word and ten seconds later was inside cerdans suite with the door locked behind me on a sudden instinct i switched on my torch and played the beam round the edges of the door the door was pale blue against a paleblue bulkhead hanging from the top of the bulkhead dangling down for a couple of inches over the top of the door was a paleblue thread a broken paleblue thread to the people who had put it there an unmistakable calling card that visitors had been there i wasnt worried about that but i was worried by the fact that it showed that someone was suspicious very very suspicious this might make things very awkward indeed maybe we should have announced dexters death i passed straight through the nurses cabin and the lounge into cerdans cabin the curtains were drawn but i left the lights off light could show through curtains and if they were as suspicious as i thought someone might have wondered why i had left so suddenly and taken a walk outside i hooded the torch to a small pencil beam and played it over the deck head the coldair trunking ran fore and aft and the first louvre was directly above cerdans bed i didnt even need the screw driver i shone the torch through the louvre opening and saw inside the trunking something gleaming metallically in the bright spot of light i reached up two fingers and slowly worked that something metallic down through the louvre a pair of earphones i peered into the louvre again the earphones lead had a plug on the end of it and the plug was fitted into a socket that had been screwed on to the upper wall of the trunking and the radio office was directly above i pulled out the plug rolled the lead round the headphones and switched off my torch white was exactly as i had left him still vibrating away like a tuning fork i opened his desk returned key screw driver and torch the earphones i kept and the gun they were into their third cocktails by the time i returned to the drawing room i didnt need to count empty bottles to guess that the laughter the animated conversation the increase in the decibel ratio was proof enough captain bullen was still chatting away to cerdan the tall nurse was still knitting tommy wilson was over by the bar i rubbed my cheek and he crushed out the cigarette he was holding i saw him say something to miguel and tony carreras at twenty feet in that racket it was impossible to hear a word he said saw tony carreras lift a halfamused halfquestioning eyebrow then all three of them moved towards the bar i joined captain bullen and cerdan long speeches werent going to help me here and only a fool would throw away his life by tipping off people like those good evening mr cerdan i said i pulled my left hand out from under my jacket and tossed the earphones onto his rugcovered lap recognise them cerdans eyes stared wide then he flung himself forwards and sideways as if to clear his encumbering wheel chair but old bullen had been waiting for it and was too quick for him he hit cerdan with all the pentup worry and fury of the past twentyfour hours behind the blow and cerdan toppled over the side of his chair and crashed heavily to the carpet i didnt see him fall i only heard the sound of it i was too busy looking out for myself the nurse with the sherry glass in her hand quick as a cat flung the contents in my face at the same instant as bullen hit cerdan i flung myself sideways to avoid being blinded and as i fell i saw the tall thin nurse flinging her knitting to one side and thrusting her hand deep into the string knitting bag with my right hand i managed to tug the colt clear of my belt before i hit the ground and squeezed the trigger twice it was my right shoulder that hit the carpet first just as i fired and i didnt really know where the bullets went nor for that one nearly blinding instant of agony as the shock of falling was transmitted to my injured neck did i care then my head cleared and i saw that the tall nurse was on her feet not only on her feet but raised high on her toes head and shoulders arched sharply forwards ivoryknuckled hands pressed deep into her midriff then she swayed forward in macabre slowmotion action and crumpled over the fallen cerdan the other nurse hadnt moved from her seat with captain bullens colt only six inches from her face and his finger pretty white on the trigger she wasnt likely to either the reverberations of my heavy colt painful and deafening in their intensity in that confined metalwalled space faded away into a silence that was deathly in more ways than one and through that silence came a soft highland voice saying gently if either of you move i will kill you carreras senior and junior who must have had their backs to the bar were now turned round halfway towards it staring at the gun in macdonalds hand miguel carreras face was unrecognisable his expression changed from that of a smooth urbane and highly prosperous businessman into something very ugly indeed his right hand as he had whirled round had come to rest on the bar near a cutglass decanter archie macdonald wasnt wearing any of his medals that night and carreras had no means of knowing the long and bloodstained record the bosun had behind him or he would never have tried to hurl that decanter at macdonalds head carreras reactions were so fast the movement so unexpected that against another man he might have made it against macdonald he didnt even manage to get the decanter off the counter and a split second later was left staring down at the shattered bloody mess that had been his hand for the second time in a few seconds the crashing roar of a heavy gun this time intermingled with the tinkle of smashed and flying glass died away and again macdonalds voice came almost regretfully i should have killed you but i like reading about those murder trials were saving you for the hangman mr carreras i was climbing back to my feet when someone screamed a harsh ugly sound that drilled piercingly through the room another woman took it up a sustained shriek like an express whistle wide open heading for a level crossing and the stage seemed all set for mass hysteria stop that damned screaming i snarled do you hear stop it at once its all over now the screaming stopped silence again a weird unnatural silence that was almost as bad as the racket that had gone before and then beresford was coming towards me a bit unsteadily his lips forming words that didnt come his face white i couldnt blame him in his wellordered and wealth cushioned world the entertainments offered his guests couldnt often have ended up with bodies strewn all over the floor youve killed her carter he said at length his voice was harsh and strained youve killed her i saw it we all saw it aba defenceless woman he stared at me and if he had any thought of offering me a job again i couldnt see it in his face you murdered her woman my foot i said savagely i bent down yanked off the nurses hat then ruthlessly ripped away a glued wig to show a black closecropped crew cut attractive isnt it the very latest from paris and defenceless i grabbed her bag turned it upside down emptied the contents on the carpet stooped and came up with what had originally been a fulllength doublebarrelled shotgun the barrels had been sawn off until there was no more than six inches of them left the wooden stock removed and a roughly made pistoltype grip fitted in its place ever seen one of those before mr beresford native product of your own country i believe a whippet or some such name fires lead shot and from the range our nurse friend here intended to use it it would have blown a hole clear through my middle defenceless i turned to where bullen was standing his gun still trained on the other nurse is that character armed sir well soon find out bullen said grimly you carrying a gun my friend the nurse swore at him two words in basic anglosaxon in a low snarling voice bullen gave him no warning he swept up the colt and struck the barrel heavily across the mans face and temple he staggered and swayed out on his feet i caught him held him with one hand while with the other i ripped the dress down the front pulled out a snubnosed automatic from a felt holster under the left arm then let him go he swayed some more collapsed on the settee then rolled to the floor iss all this necessary beresfords voice was still hoarse and strained stand back everyone bullen said authoritatively keep well over to the windows and clear of these two men our two carreras friends they are highly dangerous and might try to jump in among you for cover macdonald that was splendidly done but next time shoot to kill thats an order i accept full responsibility dr marston bring the necessary equipment please and attend to carreras hand he waited till marston had left then turned to beresford with a wry smile sorry to ruin your party mr beresford and all this i assure you is highly necessary butbut the violence thethe killing they murdered three of my men in twentyfour hours they what benson brownell and fourth officer dexter murdered them brownell was strangled benson was strangled or shot dexters lying dead in the wireless office with three bullets in his stomach and god knows how many more men would have died if chief officer carter hadnt got on to them i looked round the white strained still unbelieving faces there was no real understanding yet of what the captain was saying the shock the fear the near hysteria left no room for thought in their minds of them all i had to admit that old beresford had taken it best to adjust himself to what must have been the incredible spectacle of seeing fellow passengers suddenly gunned down by officers of the campari to fight his way out of this fog of crazy bewilderment but i mean captain what part can an old cripple like mr cerdan have in all this according to mr carter cerdan isnt old at allhes just made up to look old and also according to mr carter if cerdan is a cripple paralysed from the waist down as he is supposed to be then youre going to witness a modern miracle of healing just as soon as he recovers consciousness for all we know cerdan is very probably the leader of this bunch of murderers we dont know but what in gods name is behind it all beresford demanded thats just what we are about to find out bullen said tightly he glanced at carreras father and son come here you two they came macdonald and tommy wilson following carreras senior had a handkerchief wrapped round his shattered hand trying not very successfully to stem the flow of blood and the eyes that caught mine were wicked with hate tony carreras on the other hand seemed calmly unconcerned even slightly amused i made a mental note to keep a very close eye indeed on tony carreras he was too calm and relaxed by half they halted a few feet away bullen said mr wilson sir that sawnoff shotgun belonging to our late friend here pick it up wilson picked it up do you think you could use it and dont point the damned thing at me he added hastily i think so sir cerdan and the socalled nurse a sharp eye on them if they come to and try anything bullen left the sentence unfinished mr carter carreras and his son may be armed yes sir i moved round behind tony carreras careful to keep out of the line of fire of both bullen and macdonald caught his jacket by the collar and jerked it savagely down over shoulders and arms till it reached the level of his elbows you seem to have done this sort of thing before mr carter tony carreras said easily he was a cool customer all right too damned cool for my liking television i explained he was carrying a gun under the left shoulder he was wearing a specially made shirt with a couple of hemmed slits front and back on the lefthand side so that the chest strap for the holster was concealed under the shirt tony carreras was very thorough in his preparations i went over his clothes but hed only the one gun i went through the same routine with miguel carreras who wasnt anywhere near as affable as his son but maybe his hand was hurting him he wasnt carrying any gun and maybe that made miguel carreras the boss maybe he didnt have to carry any gun maybe he was in a position to order other people to do his killing for him thank you captain bullen said mr carreras we will be in nassau in a few hours time the police will be aboard by midnight do you wish to make a statement now or would you rather make it to the police my hand is broken miguel carreras voice was a harsh whisper the forefinger is smashed it will have to be amputated someone is going to pay for this i take it that is your answer bullen said calmly very well bosun four heaving lines if you please i want those men trussed like turkeys aye aye sir the bosun took one step forward then stood stockstill through the open doorway had come a flat staccato burst of soundthe unmistakable chattering of a machine gun it seemed to come from almost directly above from the bridge and then all the lights went out i think i was the first person to move i think i was the only person to move i took a long step forward hooked my left arm round tony carreras neck rammed the colt into the small of his back and said softly dont even think of trying anything carreras and then there was silence again it seemed to go on and on and on but it probably didnt last more than a few seconds altogether a woman screamed a brief choking sound that died away into a moan and then there was silence once more a silence that ended abruptly with a violent crashing splintering as heavy solid metallic objects operating in almost perfect unison smashed in the plateglass windows that gave to the deck outside at the same instant there came the sharp echoing crash of metal against metal as the door was kicked wide open to smash back against the bulkhead drop your guns all of you miguel carreras called in a high clear voice drop them now unless you want a massacre the lights came on vaguely outlined against the four smashed windows of the drawing room i could see the blurs of four indistinct heads and shoulders and arms the blurs i didnt care about it was what they held in their arms that worried methe wicked looking snouts and cylindrical magazines of four submachine guns a fifth man dressed in jungle green and wearing a green beret on his head stood in the doorway a similar automatic carbine cradled in his hands i could see what carreras meant about dropping our guns it seemed an excellent idea to me we had about as much chance as the last ice cream at a childrens party i was already starting to loosen my grip on the gun when incredulously i saw captain bullen jerk up his colt on the armed man in the doorway it was criminal suicidal folly either he was acting completely instinctively without any thought at all or the bitter chagrin the killing disappointment after having thought that he had held all the cards in his hands had been too much for him i might have known i thought briefly and wildly hed been far too calm and selfcontrolled the safety valve screwed down on the bursting boiler i tried to shout out a warning but it was too late it was far too late i shoved tony carreras violently aside and tried to reach bullen to strike down his gun hand but i was still far too late a lifetime too late the heavy colt was rearing and bucking in bullens hand and the man in the doorway to whom the ridiculous idea of resistance must have been the very last thought in his head let the machine gun slide slowly out of lifeless hands and toppled backwards out of sight the man outside the window nearest the door had his machine gun lined up on the captain bullen in that second was the biggest fool in the world a crazy suicidal maniac but even so i couldnt let him be gunned down where he stood i dont know where my first bullet went but the second must have struck the machine gun i saw it jerk violently as if struck aside by a giant hand and then came a continuous cacophonous drum fire of deafening sound as a third man squeezed the trigger of his machine gun and kept on squeezing it something with the power and weight of a plunging pile driver smashed into my left thigh hurling me back against the bar my head struck the heavy brass rail at the foot of the counter and the sound of the drum fire died away the stink of drifting cordite and the silence of the grave even before consciousness came fully back to me even before i opened my eyes i was aware of those of the cordite and the unearthly stillness i opened my eyes slowly pushed myself shakily up till i was sitting with my back more or less straight against the bar and shook my head to try to clear it i had understandably enough forgotten about my stiff neck the sharp stab of pain did more to clear my head than anything else could have done the first thing i was aware of was the passengers they were all stretched out on the carpet lying very still for one heartstopping moment i thought they were all dead or dying mown down in swathes by that stuttering machine gun then i saw mr greenstreet miss harrbrides husband move his head slightly and look round the drawing room with a cautious and terrified eye one eye was all i could see at any other time it would have been very very funny but i never felt less like laughing the passengers perhaps through wisdom but more probably through the reflex reaction of instinctive selfpreservation must have flung themselves to the deck the moment the machine gun had opened up and were only now daring to lift their heads i concluded that i couldnt have been unconscious for more than a few seconds i moved my eyes to the right carreras and son were standing just where they had been and tony carreras had a gun in his hand now my gun beyond them a huddled group lay sprawling or sitting about the floor cerdan the nurse id shot and three others tommy wilson the laughing lovable happygolucky tommy wilson was dead he wouldnt have to worry about his mathematics any more it didnt need old doc marston and his shortsighted peering to tell me that wilson was dead he was lying on his back and it looked to me as if half his chest had been shot away he must have taken the main brunt of that concentrated burst of machinegun fire and tommy hadnt even lifted his gun archie macdonald was stretched out on his side close to wilson he seemed to me to be very still far far too still i couldnt see the front of his body for he was turned away from me for all i knew magnum slugs had torn the life out of him as they had out of tommy wilson but i could see blood all over his face and neck slowly soaking into the carpet captain bullen was the one who was sitting he wasnt dead anyway but i wouldnt have bet a brass farthing on his chances of staying alive he was fully conscious his mouth warped and dragged into an unnatural smile his face white and twisted with pain from shoulder almost to the waist his right side was soaked in blood so soaked that i couldnt see where the bullets had gone home but i could see bright red bubbles flecking the twisted lips which meant that he had been shot through the lung i looked at the three of them again bullen macdonald wilson three better men it would have been hard to find three better shipmates impossible to find they had wanted none of this none of this blood and agony and death all they had wanted was the chance to do their jobs in peace and quiet and as best they could hardworking companionable and infinitely decent men they had sought no violence thought no violence so now they lay there dead and dying macdonald and bullen with their wives and families tommy wilson with his fiancee in england and a girl in every port in america and the caribbean i looked at them and i felt no sadness or sorrow or anger or shock i just felt cold and detached and strangely uninvolved in it all i looked from them to the carreras family and cerdan and i made myself a promise and it was well for me that neither carreras heard my promise or knew of its irrevocable finality for they were clever calculating men and they would have shot me dead as i lay there i wasnt feeling any pain at all but i remembered about the pile driver that had hurled me back against the bar i looked down at my left leg and from midthigh to well below the knee the trousers were so saturated with blood that there was no trace of white left the carpet all round my leg was soaked with it that carpet i remembered vaguely had cost over and it was certainly taking a terrible beating that night lord dexter would have been furious i looked at my leg again and fingered the soggy material three distinct tears which meant that i had been shot three times i supposed the pain would come later a great deal of blood far too much blood i wondered if an artery had been torn ladies and gentlemen it was carreras speaking and although his hand must have been giving him hell there was no sign of it in his face the fury the malevolence i had so recently seen was only a memory he was back on balance again urbane commanding in complete control of the situation i regret all this regret it extremely he waved his left hand in the direction of bullen and wilson macdonald and myself all so unnecessary so terribly unnecessary brought upon captain bullen and his men by captain bullens reckless folly most of the passengers were on their feet now and i could see susan beresford standing beside her father staring down at me as if she werent seeing too well eyes abnormally large in the pale face i regret too the distress you have been caused and to you mr and mrs beresford i tend my apologies for the ruin of your nights entertainment your kindness has been illrewarded for gods sake cut out the fancy speeches i interrupted my voice didnt sound like mine at all a harsh strained croak a bullfrog with laryngitis get the doctor for captain bullen hes been shot through the lung he looked at me speculatively then at bullen then back at me a certain indestructible quality about you mr carter he said thoughtfully he bent over and peered at my blood stained leg shot three times your leg must be pretty badly smashed yet you can observe so tiny a detail as a fleck of blood on captain bullens mouth you are incapacitated and i am glad had your captain officers and crew been composed exclusively of men like yourself i would never have come within a thousand miles of the campari as for the doctor he will be here soon he is tending a man on the bridge jamieson our third officer mr jamieson is beyond all help he said curtly like captain bullen he fancied himself as a man cast in a heroic mould like captain bullen he has paid the price for his stupidity the man at the wheel was struck in the arm by a stray bullet he turned to face the passengers you need have no further worry about your personal safety the campari is now completely in my hands and will remain so however you form no part of my plans and will be transferred in two or three days to another vessel meanwhile you will all eat live and sleep in this room i cannot spare individual guards for each stateroom mattresses and blankets will be brought to you if you cooperate you can exist in reasonable comforts you certainly have no more to fear what is the meaning of this damnable outrage carreras there was a shake in beresfords voice those desperadoes those killers what of them who are they where in the name of god did they come from what do you intend to do youre mad man completely mad surely you know you cant expect to get off with this you may use that thought for consolation ah doctor there you are he held out his right hand swathed in its bloodstained handkerchief have a look at this will you damn you and your hand dr marston said bitterly the old boy was trembling the sight of the dead and dying must have hit him hard but he was hopping mad for all that there are other more seriously injured men here i must you may as well realise that i and i alone give the orders from now on carreras interrupted my hand at once ah juan this to a tall thin swarthy man who had just entered a rolledup chart under his arm give that to mr carter here thats him yes mr carter captain bullen saidand i have been aware of it for many hoursthat we are heading for nassau and are due there in less than four hours lay off a course to take us well clear of nassau to the east then out midway between the great abaco and eleuthera islands and so approximately northnorthwest into the north atlantic my own navigation has become rather rusty i fear mark in the approximate times for course changes i took the chart pencil parallel rulers and dividers and laid the chart on my knee carreras said consideringly what no do your own damned navigation or words to that effect whats the point i said wearily you wouldnt hesitate to line up all the passengers and shoot them one by one if i didnt cooperate its a pleasure to deal with a man who sees and accepts the inevitable carreras smiled but you greatly overestimate my ruthlessness later mr carter when we have you fixed up you shall become a permanent installation on the bridge it is unfortunate but i suppose you realise that you are the only deck officer left to us youll have to get some other installation on the bridge i said bitterly my thighbone is smashed what he looked at me narrowly i can feel it grating i twisted my face up to let him see how i could feel it grating dr marston will soon confirm it we can arrive at some other arrangement carreras said equably he winced as dr marston probed at his hand the forefinger it will have to come off i dont think so a local anaesthetic a small operation and i believe i can save it carreras didnt know the danger he was in if he let old marston get to work on him hed probably end up by losing his whole arm but it will have to be done in my surgery its probably time we all west to the surgery tony check engine room radar room all men off duty see that they are all safely under guard then take that chart to the bridge and see that the helmsman makes the proper course alterations at the proper time see that the radar operator is kept under constant supervision and reports the slightest object on his screen mr carter here is quite capable of laying off a course which would take us smack into the middle of eleuthera island two men to take mr cerdan to his cabin dr marston is it possible to take those men down to your surgery without endangering their lives the good samaritan all overcome with concern for his fellow men i dont know marston finished his temporary bandaging of carreras hand and crossed to bullen how do you feel captain bullen looked at him with lacklustre eyes he tried to smile but it was no more than an agonised grimace he tried to speak but no words came just fresh bubbles of blood at his lips marston produced scissors cut the captains shirt open examined him briefly and said we may as well risk it two of your men mr carreras two strong men see that his chest is not compressed he left bullen bent over macdonald and straightened almost immediately this man can be moved with safety macdonald i said the bosun hehes not dead hes been hit on the head creased probably concussed perhaps even the skull fractured but hell survive he seems to have been hit on the knee tonothing serious i felt as if someone had lifted the sydney bridge off my back the bosun had been my friend my good friend for too many years now and besides with archie macdonald by me all things were possible and mr carter carreras queried dont you touch my leg i yelled not until i get an anaesthetic hes probably right marston murmured he peered closely not much blood now youve been lucky john if the main artery had been severedwell youd have been gone he looked at carreras his face doubtful he could be moved i think but with a fractured thighbone the pain will be excruciating mr carter is very tough carreras said unsympatheticcally it wasnt his thighbone hed been a good samaritan for a whole minute now and the strain had proved too much for him mr carter will survive chapter i survived all right but no credit for that was due to the handling i received on the way down to the sick bay the sick bay was on the port side two decks below the drawing room on the second companionway one of the two men who were carrying me slipped and fell and i was aware of nothing more until i woke up in bed like every compartment on the campari the sick bay was fitted out regardless of cost a large room twenty feet by sixteen it had the usual walltowall persian carpeting and pastel walls decorated with murals depicting water skiing skindiving swimming and other such sporting activities symbolic of fitness and good health craftily designed to encourage to get on their feet and out of there with all possible speed any patient unfortunate enough to be confined to any of the three beds the beds themselves with their heads close up to the windows in the ships side struck a jarring note they were just plain standard iron hospital beds the only concession to taste being that they were painted in the same pastel tints as the bulkheads in the far corner of the room remote from the door was old marstons consulting desk with a couple of chairs further along the inner bulkhead nearer the door was a flattopped couch that could be raised for examinations or if need be the carrying out of minor operations between couch and desk a door led to two smaller compartments a dispensary and a dentists surgery i knew that because i had recently spent three quarters of an hour in that dentists chair with marston attending to a broken tooth the memory of the experience would stay with me the rest of my days the three beds were occupied captain bullen was in the one nearest to the door the bosun next to him and myself in the corner opposite marstons desk all of us lying on rubber sheets placed over the beds marston was bent over the middle bed examining the bosuns knee beside him holding a metal tray with bowls sponges instruments and bottles containing some unidentifiable liquids was susan beresford she looked very pale i wondered vaguely what she was doing here seated on the couch was a young man badly in need of a shave he was wearing green trousers a green sweatstained epauletted shirt and green beret he had his eyes halfclosed against the smoke spiralling up from the cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth and carried an automatic carbine in his hand i wondered how many men with how many automatic carbines were posted all over the campari detailing a man to guard three brokendown crocks like macdonald bullen and myself showed that carreras had plenty of men to spare or was excessively cautious or maybe both what are you doing here miss beresford i asked she looked up startled and the instruments rattled metallically on the tray in her hands oh i am glad she said she sounded almost as if she meant it i thought how do you feel the way i look why are you here because i needed her doc marston straightened slowly and rubbed his back dealing with wounds like thesewell i must have a helper nurses john are usually young and female and there are only two on the campari in that category miss beresford and miss harcourt i dont see any signs of miss harcourt i tried to visualise the glamorous young actress in the reallife role of florence nightingale but my imagination was in no shape to cope with absurdities like that i couldnt even see her playing it on the screen she was here he said curtly she fainted that helps hows the bosun i must ask you not to talk john he said severely youve lost a great deal of blood and youre very weak please conserve your strength hows the bosun i repeated dr marston sighed hell be all right that is hes in no danger abnormally thick skull i should say that saved him concussion yes but not fractured i think hard to say without an xray respiration pulse temperature blood pressurenone of them shows any signs pointing to extensive brain injury its his leg im worried about his leg patella kneecap to you completely shattered beyond repair tendons sliced tibia fractured leg sawn in half must have been hit several times the damned murderers amputation you dont think no amputation he shook his head irritably ive removed all the broken pieces i can find bones will either have to be fused so shortening the leg or a metal plate too soon to say but this i can say hell never bend that knee again youre telling me hes crippled for life im sorry i know youre very friendly so hes finished with the sea im sorry marston repeated medical incompetence apart he was really a pretty decent old buffer your turn now john yes i wasnt looking forward to my turn i looked at the guard hey you yes you wheres carreras sefior carreras the young man dropped his cigarette on the persian carpet and ground it out with his heel lord dexter would have gone off his rocker it is not my business to know where sefior carreras is that settled that he spoke english i couldnt have cared less at the moment where carreras was marston had his big scissors out was preparing to slit up my trouser leg captain bullen i asked what chance i dont know hes unconscious now he hesitated he was wounded twice one bullet passed clean through below the shoulder tearing the pectoral muscle the other entered the right chest a little lower breaking a rib then must have gone through the lung near the apex the bullet is still lodged inside the body almost certainly in the vicinity of the shoulder blade i may decide to operate later to remove it operate the thought of old marston hacking round inside an unconscious bullen made me feel even paler than i looked i choked down the next few words i thought of and said operate you would take the grave chance you would be willing to risk your lifetimes professional reputation a mans life is at stake john he said solemnly but you might have to penetrate the chest wall a major operation dr marston without assistant surgeons without skilled nurses without a competent anaesthetist no xrays and you might be removing a bullet thats plugging a vital gap in the lung or pleura or whatever you call it besides the bullet might have been deflected anywhere i took a deep breath dr marston i cannot say how much i respect and admire you for even thinking of operating in such impossible conditions but you will not run the risk doctor as long as the captain is incapacitated i am in command of the campari in nominal command anyway i added bitterly i absolutely forbid you to incur the very heavy responsibility of operating in such adverse conditions miss beresford you are a witness to that well john you may be right old marston said weightily he was suddenly looking five years younger you may indeed be right but my sense of duty it does you great credit doctor but think of all those people who have been carrying a bullet about inside their chests since the first world war and still going strong theres that of course theres that i had rarely seen a man looking so relieved well give nature a chance hey captain bullens as strong as a horse the old man had at least a fighting chance now i felt as if id just saved a life i said weakly you were right doctor im afraid i have been talking too much could i have some water please of course my boy of course he brought some watched me drink it and said that feel better thank you my voice was very faint i moved my lips several times as if speaking but no words came marston alarmed put his ear close to my mouth to make out what i was trying to say and i murmured slowly and distinctly my thighbone is not broken but pretend it is he started eyes reflecting astonishment opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again he wasnt all that slow the old boy he nodded slightly and said ready for me to begin he began susan beresford helped him my leg was a gory sight but looked worse than it was one bullet had passed directly through the leg but the other two had just torn superficial gashes on the inside and it was from those that most of the blood had come all the while he was working dr marston kept up for the sake of the guard a running commentary on the extent and severity of my wounds and if i hadnt known he was lying fluently he would have made me feel very ill indeed he certainly must have convinced the guard when hed cleaned and bound the wounds a process i bore with stoic fortitude only because i didnt want to start yelling in front of susan beresford he fixed some splints to my leg and bound those on also this done he propped up my leg on a pile of pillows went into the dispensary and reappeared with a couple of screwed pulleys a length of wire with a heavy weight attached to the end and a leather strap the strap he fitted to my left ankle whats this in aid of i demanded im the medical officer please remember he said curtly his left eyelid dropped in a slow wink traction mr carter you dont want your left leg to be permanently shortened for life sorry i muttered maybe i had been misjudging old marston just a little nothing would ever make me reconsider my opinion of him as a doctor but he was shrewd enough in other things the first thing a man like carreras would have asked was why a man with a broken bone in his thigh was not in traction marston screwed the two hooks into holes in the deckhead passed the wire through attached the weight to one end and the strap to the other it didnt feel too uncomfortable he then picked up the length of trouser leg that had been cut off checked quickly to see if the guard was watching splashed some water on it and then wrung it out on top of my bandages even to myself i had to admit that id seldom seen a more convincing sight a patient more completely and thoroughly immobilised he finished just in time he and susan beresford were just clearing away when the door opened and tony carreras came in he looked at bullen macdonald and myself slowly consideringly he wasnt a man who would miss very much then came to my bedside good evening carter he said pleasantly how are you feeling wheres that murderous parent of yours i asked murderous parent you do my father an injustice asleep at the moment as it happens his hand was giving him great pain after marston had finished with iti wasnt surprised at thatso he was given a sleeping draught the good ship campari is all buttoned up for the night and captain tony carreras in charge you may all sleep easy youll be interested to hear that weve just picked up nassau on the radarscopeport forty or some such nautical termso you werent playing any funny tricks with that course after all i grunted and turned my head away carreras walked across to marston how are they doctor how do you expect them to be after your thugs have riddled them with bullets marston demanded bitterly captain bullen may live or die i dont know macdonald the bosun will live but hell be a stifflegged cripple for life the chief officer has a compound fracture of the femurthe thighbone completely shattered if we dont get him to hospital in a couple of days he also will be crippled for life as it is hell never be able to walk properly again i am genuinely sorry tony carreras said he actually sounded as if he meant it killing and crippling good men is an unforgivable waste well almost unforgivable some things justify it your humanity does you credit i sneered from my pillow we are humane men he said youve proved that all right i twisted to look at him but you could still show a little consideration for a very sick man indeed he was very good at lifting eyebrows indeed danl boone here i nodded towards the sentry with the gun you permit your men to smoke on duty jose he smiled jose is an inveterate chain smoker take his cigarettes away and hed probably go on strike this isnt the grenadier uards you know carter why the sudden concern you heard what dr marston said captain bullen hes in a critical condition with a hole through his lung ah i think i understand you agree doctor i held my breath the chances were that the old boy hadnt even the faintest idea what we were talking about but again id underrated ills astuteness for a man with a ruptured lung be said gravely there can be nothing worse than a smokeladen atmosphere i see jose carreras spoke rapidly in spanish to the guard who grinned amiably got to his feet and made for the door picking up a chair en route the door swung to behind him no discipline tony carreras sighed none of this brisk sentrygo marching and countermarching like buckingham palace mr carter a chair tilted against a wall our latin blood i fear but i warn you none the less effective a guard for all that i see no harm in his keeping a watch outside apart from jumping out through one of the windows into the sea below not that you are in any condition to do that anyway cant see what mischief you can get up to he paused looked at me consideringly you are singularly incurious mr carter far from being in character makes one suspicious you know curious about what i growled nothing to be curious about how many of those armed thugs do you have aboard the campari forty not bad eh well thirtyeight effectives captain bullen killed one and you seriously damaged the hand of another where did you learn to shoot like that carter luck cerdan recovered yet yes he said briefly he didnt seem to want to talk about cerdan he killed dexter i persisted no werner the nursethe one you killed tonight for a professed humanitarian the death of one of his colleagues in crime left him strangely unmoved a stewards uniform and a tray of food at face level your head steward white saw him twice and never suspected not that he went within thirty feet of white and it was just dexters luck that he saw this steward unlocking the radio room i suppose that same murderous devil got brownell and benson benson caught him coming out of the radio room after disposing of brownell and was shot werner was going to dump him straight over the side but there were people directly underneath he dragged him across to the port side again crew beneath so he emptied a life jacket locker and put benson inside carteras grinned and just your bad luck that you happened to be standing right beside that locker when we sent werner up to dispose of the body just before midnight last night who dreamed up this scheme of having the false marconi man in kingston drill through from the wireless office to the coldair trunking in cerdans room below and buttoning the earphones permanently into the wireless officers receiving circuit cerdan your old man or you my father and the trojan horse idea your father also he is a brilliant man now i know why you were not curious you knew it wasnt hard to guess i said wearily not that is when it was too late all our troubles really started in carracio and we loaded those huge crates in caracio now i know why the stevedores were so terrified when one of the crates almost slipped from its slings now i know why your old man was so damned anxious to inspect the hold not to pay his respects to the dead men in their coffins but to see how his men were placed for smashing their way out of the crates and then they broke out last night and forced the battens of the hatch how many men in a crate carreras twenty rather uncomfortably jammed poor fellows i think they had a rough twentyfour hours twenty two crates we loaded four of those whats in the other crates machinery mr carter just machinery one thing i am really curious about yes whats behind all this murderous business kidnap ransom i am not at liberty to discuss those things with you he grinned at least not yet you remaining here miss beresford or do you wish me to escort you up to your parents in the drawing room please leave the young lady marston said i want her to help me keep a twentyfourhour watch on captain bullen he might have a relapse at any moment as you wish he bowed to susan beresford good night all the door closed susan beresford said so thats how they came aboard how in the world did you know how in the world did i know you didnt think they had forty men hidden up inside the funnel did you once we knew it was careras and cerdan it was obvious they came aboard at carracio so did those huge crates two and two miss beresford have never failed to add up to four she flushed and gave me a very oldfashioned look but i ignored it and went on you both see what this means dont you let him tell us doctor miss beresford said acidly hes just dying to tell us it means that theres something very very big behind it all i said slowly all cargoes except those in free ports and under certain transshipment conditions which dont apply here have to be inspected by customs those crates passed the carracio customswhich means that the customs know whats inside probably explains too why our carracio agent was so nervous but the customs let it pass why because they had orders to let those crates pass and who gave them the orders their government and who gave the government its orders who but the generalissimo after all he is the government the generalissimo i went on thoughtfully is directly behind all this and we know hes desperate for money i wonder i wonder you wonder what marston asked i dont really know tell me doctor have you the facilities for making tea or coffee here never yet seen a dispensary that hadnt my boy what an excellent idea susan beresford jumped to her feet id love a cup of tea coffee tea coffee humour a sick man this should be quite an experience for miss beresford making her own coffee i mean you fill the percolator with water please stop there she crossed to my bedside and looked down at me her face without expression her eyes very steady you have a short memory mr carter i told you the night before last that i was sorry very sorry remember i remember i acknowledged sorry miss beresford susan she smiled if you want your coffee that is blackmail oh for heavens sake call her susan if she wants dr marston interrupted irritably whats the harm doctors orders i said resignedly ok susan bring the patient his coffee the circumstances were hardly normal i could get back to calling her miss beresford later on five minutes passed then she brought the coffee i looked the tray and said what only three cups there should e four four four three for us and one for our friend outside our friend you mean the guard who else have you gone mad mr carter fairs fair marston murmured john to you she looked coldly at him glared at me and said icily have you gone mad why should i bring that thug coffee do nothing our chief officer always has a reason for his actions marston said in sharp and surprising support please do as he asks she poured a cup of coffee took it through the outside door and was back in a few seconds he took it i asked didnt he just seems hes had nothing except a little water to drink in the past day or so i can believe it i should imagine that they werent too well equipped in the catering line in those crates i took the cup of coffee she offered me drained it and set it down it tasted just the way coffee ought to taste how was it susan asked perfect any suggestion i made that you didnt even know how to boil water i withdraw unreservedly she and marston looked at each other and then marston said no more thinking or worrying to do tonight john nary a bit all i want is a good nights sleep and thats why i put a pretty powerful sedative in your coffee he looked at me consideringly coffee has a remarkable quality of disguising other flavours hasnt it i knew what he meant and he knew i knew what he meant i said dr marston i do believe i have been guilty of underestimating you very considerably i believe you have john he said jovially i believe you have indeed i became drowsily aware that my left leg was hurting not badly but badly enough to wake me up someone was pulling it giving it a strong steady tug every few seconds letting go then tugging it again and he kept on talking all the time he was doing it i wished that that someone whoever he was would give it up the tugging and the talking didnt he know i was a sick man i opened my eyes the first thing i saw was the clock on the opposite bulkhead ten oclock ten oclock in the morning for broad daylight was coming in through uncurtained windows dr marston had been right about the sedative powerful was hardly the word for it someone was talking sure enough old bullen was babbling away incoherently in a drugged and troubled sleep but there was no one tugging at my leg it was the traction weight suspended from the ceiling that was doing the tugging the campari in spite of her stabilisers was rolling through a ten tofifteendegree arc which meant that there must be a pretty heavy and steep beam sea or swell running whenever the ship came to the end of a roll the suspended pulley reaching the limit of its pendulum swing would give a pronounced jerk a few seconds later another jerk now that i was fully awake it was more painful than i had at first thought even if i had had a genuinely fractured femur that sort of thing wouldnt be doing me any good at all i looked round to see dr marston and to ask him to remove it but the first person who caught my eye was not dr marston but miguel carreras he was standing near the top of my bed maybe he had been shaking me awake he was newly shaven looked fresh and rested had his neatly bandaged right hand in a sling and carried some charts under his arm he gave me a slight smile good morning mr carter how do you feel now i ignored him susan beresford was sitting at the doctors desk she looked pretty tired to me and there were dark smudges under the green eyes i said susan wheres doc marston susan carreras murmured how swiftly contiguity breeds familiarity i ignored him again susan said in the dispensary asleep hes been up most of the night wake him will you tell him i want this damned weight off its tearing my leg in two she went into the dispensary and carreras said your attention mr carter if you please when i get that weight off i said surlily not before dr marston appeared rubbing the sleep from his eyes and started to remove the weight without a word captain bullen and the bosun i asked how are they the captains holding his ownust the old boy looked tired and sounded tired the bosuns recovering fast both of them came to early this morning i gave them sedatives the longer they sleep the better i nodded waited till he had lifted me to a sitting position and adjusted my leg then said curtly what do you want carteras he unrolled a chart and spread it over my knees a little navigational assistance crosschecking shall we call it you will cooperate ill cooperate what susan beresford crossed from the desk and stared down at me you youre going to help this man you heard me didnt you what do you want me to be a hero i nodded at my leg look where being heroics got me i wouldnt have believed it patches of colour flared in the pale cheeks you going to help thisthis monster this murderer if i dont i said wearily hell like as not start on you maybe break a linger at a time or yank out a tooth at a time with dr marstons forcepsand without anaesthetic im not saying hed like doing it but hed do it im not afraid of mr carreras she said defiantly but she was paler than ever then its time you were i said curtly well carreras you have sailed the north atlantic mr carter between europe and america i mean many times good he jabbed at the chart a vessel leaving the clyde and sailing for norfolk virginia i wish you to sketch the course it would take any reference books you wish i can have fetched i dont require any i took his pencil norths about round ireland so a slightly flattened great circle route along the westbound summer lane so to this point well southeast of newfoundland the northward curve looks strange but thats only because of the projection of the chart it is the shortest route i believe you and then shortly after that the course diverges from the main westbound new york lane approximately here and comes into norfolk more or less from the eastnortheast i twisted my head round to try to see out of the surgery door whats all that racket wheres it coming from sounds like riveting guns or pneumatic chisels to me later later he said irritably he unrolled another chart and the irritation vanished from his face splendid carter splendid your track coincides almost exactly with the information i have here why the hell did you ask me i doublecheck everything mr carter this vessel now is due to arrive at norfolk at exactly ten oclock at night on saturday in two days time not earlier not later exactly ten oclock if i wish to meet that vessel at dawn that day where would the interception point be i kept my questions to myself dawn in that latitude at this time is five oclock give or take a few minutes what speed does this vessel do of course foolish of me ten knots ten knots seventeen hours one hundred and seventy nautical miles the interception point would be here exactly hed consulted his own chart again exactly most gratifying he looked at a slip of paper in his hand our present position is north west near enough anyway how long would it take us to get to this interception point what is that hammering outside i demanded what devilry are you up to now carreras answer my question he said sharply he held all the cards i said whats our speed just now fourteen knots fortythree hours i said after a minute just under fortythree hours he said slowly its now ten am thursday and i have to rendezvous at five am on saturday my god that is only fortythree hours the first shadow of worry crossed his face what is the maximum speed of the campari eighteen knots i caught a glimpse of susans face she was fast losing all her illusions about chief officer carter ah eighteen his face cleared and at eighteen knots at eighteen knots youll probably tear the stabilisers off and break up the campari i told him he didnt like that he said what do you mean i mean youve got trouble coming carreras big trouble i looked at the window i cant see that sea but i can feel it an abnormally long deep swell ask any fisherman in the bahamas what that means at this time of the year and hell tell you it can mean only one thing carrerastropical storm pretty certainly a hurricane the swell is coming from the east and thats where the heart of the storm lies maybe a couple of hundred miles away yet but its there and the swells getting worse have you noticed its getting worse because the classic path of a hurricane in these parts is west northwest at a speed of ten to fifteen miles an hour and were heading north by east in other words tee hurricane and the campari are on a collision course you started listening to some weather reports carreras how long will it take at eighteen knots he pressed thirtythree hours about in good weather and the course i laid it off and looked at him the same as you have on that chart undoubtably it is what wave length for weather reports no wave length i said drily if theres a hurricane moving in westwards from the atlantic every commercial station on the eastern seaboard will be broadcasting practically nothing else he moved across to marstons phone spoke to the bridge gave instructions for maximum speed and for listening in to weather reports when hed finished i said eighteen knots well i warned you i must have as much time as possible in hand he looked down at bullen who was still rambling on incoherently in his sleep what would our captain do in those circumstances turn and run in any direction except north we have our passengers to think of they dont like getting seasick theyre going to be very seasick im afraid but all in a good cause yes i said slowly i knew now the source of the hammering on deck a good cause for a patriot such as yourself carreras what better cause could there be the generalissimos coffers are empty not a soul in sight and his regime is tottering only one thing can save the sick man of the caribbeana transfusion a transfusion of gold this ship that were going to intercept carrerashow many millions in gold bullion is she carrying marston was back in the surgery now and he and susan looked at me then at each other and you could see their mutual diagnosis delayed shock had made me lightheaded carreras i could see wasnt thinking anything of the kind his face like his body had gone very still you have access to sources of information of which i am completely unaware his voice was hardly more than a whisper what sources carter quickly there are no sources carreras i grinned at him should there be no one plays catandmouse with me he was still very quiet the sources carter here i tapped my head only here this source he regarded me for some seconds in cold silence then nodded fractionally i knew it the first time i saw you there is aa quality about you a champion boxer looks a champion boxer even in repose a dangerous man cannot look anything else but dangerous even in the most domestic situations the most harmless surroundings you have that quality i have trained myself to recognise such things hear that i said to susan you never even suspected it hey thought i was just like everybody else didnt you you are even more astute than i thought mr carter carteras murmured if adding two and two to make an obvious four is what you call being astute then sure im astute my god if i were astute i wouldnt be lying here now with a shattered leg an occasional reminder of my helplessness would do no harm the generalissimo needing cashi should have worked it out long ago yes yes shall i tell you why brownell our radio officer was killed i should be interested because you had intercepted a message from the harrisons and curtises the two families recalled by cable from kingston this message said that the cables had been a hoax and if we knew it had been a hoax we would have started looking very closely at messrs carteras and cerdan the people who had taken their places the point is that the cables they had received came through your capital city carreras which argues post office connivance and by inference government knowledge the government owns the post office secondly there is a long waiting list in your country for berths on the campari you were near the bottom but were mysteriously jumped to the top you said you were the only people who could take immediate advantage of the two suddenly vacant suites poppycock somebody in authorityin great authoritysaid carteras and cerdan go to the top and no one squawked i wonder why thirdly although there is a waiting list none of the people on it are your nationals carreras they are not permitted to travel on foreignowned vesselsand in addition find themselves immediately in prison if caught in possession of foreign currency but you were permitted to traveland you paid in us dollars youre still with me he nodded we had to take the chance of paying in dollars further the customs closed their eyes to those crates with your men aboardand those crates with the cannons that shown cannons marston interrupted he was looking almost completely dazed cannons the noise you can hear outside carreras said equably mr carter will explain by and by i wish he went on almost with regret that we were on the same side of the fence you would have made an incomparable lieutenant mr carter you could have named your own price thats just about what mr beresford said to me yesterday i agreed everybodys offering me jobs these days the timing of the offers could have been improved do you mean to tell me susan said that daddy offered dont panic i said he changed his mind so carreras there we have it government connivance on all sides and what does the government want money completely desperate paid three hundred and fifty million dollars to iron curtain countries in the past year or two for arms trouble was the generalissimo never had three hundred and fifty million dollars in the first place now nobody will buy his sugar trades practically nonexistent so how does an honest man raise money easy he steals it insulting personal remarks we can dispense with suit yourself maybe armed robbery and piracy on the high seas sounds more moral than stealing i wouldnt know anyway what does he steal bonds stocks shares convertible drafts currency not on your life he only wants something that can never be traced back to himand the only stuff he can get in sufficient quantity is gold your leader mr carreras i finished thoughtfully must have a very extensive spy network both in britain and amcrica if one is prepared to lay out sufficient capital on an affair such as this he said indifferently a large spy system is unnecessary i even have the complete loading plans of the bullion vessel in my cabin most men have their price mr carter i wish someone would try me someday i said well there you are the american government has made no secret recently of its great success in recovering a large proportion of its gold reserves which went to europe in the past few years that bullion has to be transportedand part of it ill bet my boots is in this ship were intercepting the fact that it is not due to arrive in norfolk until after dark is interesting enough in itself what is even more interesting is that norfolk in this case almost certainly means the hampton roads naval operating base where the ship can be unloaded with maximum security and norfolk i would say is the point that offers the shortest overland route to fort knox where the gold will eventually be stored how much gold carreras one hundred and fifty million dollars he said calmly you have missed very little and nothing of importance one hundred and fifty million dollars i mentally examined this sum from several different angles but there didnt seem to be any comment to meet the case so i asked why did you pick on the campari i thought you would have guessed that one too in point of fact we had three other ships under active consideration as well all ships on the new yorkcaribbean run we have been studying the movements of all four ships for some time yours suited best you cut things pretty fine didnt you if we had been a couple of days late in arriving in carracio there has been a naval vessel a frigate standing by and ready to intercept you on a peaceful pretext ever since you left savannah i was aboard but it wasnt necessary so that explained the vessel we had seen on our radar screens at night after leaving savannah not an american warship as we had thought but the generalissimos this way was much easier much more satisfactory and of course i said you couldnt have used the frigate for this job hasnt the cruising range hopeless in bad weather no derricks for heavy transshipment lifts and conspicuous far too conspicuous but the campariwhos going to miss the campari if shes only a few days late in arriving at a destination only the head office and the head office is being taken care of carreras said you dont think we overlooked the obvious do you our own transmitter was brought aboard and is already in circnit a stream of perfectly satisfactory messages are going out i assure you so you fixed that and the campari has the speed to overtake most cargo ships its a good large sea boat for practically any weather has firstclass radar for picking up other vessels and jumbo derricks for heavy lifts i paused and looked at him we even have reinforced decks for gun platforms both forward and on the poop most british vessels have had those installed as a matter of course when building but i warn you that they have to be strengthened from below with angle irons a couple of days job in itself without them anything more than a threeinch will buckle and twist the plates beyond repair after even only a couple of shots a couple of shots will be all that we require i thought about that last remark a couple of shots it didnt make any kind of sense at all what was carreras up to what on earth are you both talking about susan asked wearily reinforced steel decks angle ironswhat is it all about come with me miss beresford and i shall take pleasure in showing you personally what i mean carreras smiled besides im sure your good parents are becoming very anxious about you i shall see you later mr carter come miss beresford she looked at him in doubtful hesitation i said you might as well go susan you never know what luck youll have one good shove when hes near the rail and offbalance just pick your time your anglosaxon humour becomes rather wearisome carreras said thinly one hopes that you will be able to preserve it intact in the days to come he left on this snitably sinister note and marston looked at me speculation taking the place of puzzlement in his eyes did carreras mean what i thought he meant he did thats the hammering youve been hearing the pneumatic drills there are prepared bolt holes in the reinforced sections on the poop and foredeck to accept the base plates of several different sizes of british guns carreras guns probably come from the other side of the iron curtain and he has to drill new holes he hes actually going to fit naval guns he had them in a couple of those crates almost certainly stripped down into sections ready for quick assembly dont have to be anything very big ant be its a dockyard job to fit anything of any size but it will be big enough to stop this ship i dont believe it marston protested holdup on the high seas piracy in this day and age its ridiculous its impossible you tell that to carreras he hasnt a moments doubt but that its very very possible neither have i can you tell me whats going to stop him but weve got to stop him john we must stop him why good god why let a man like that get away with heaven only knows how many million pounds is that what youre worried about of course marston snapped so would anyone be youre right of course doctor i agreed im not at my best today what i could have said was that if he thought about it a bit more he would become ten times as worried as he was and not about the money about half as worried as i was and i was worried to death and frightened badly frightened carreras was clever all right but perhaps a shade less so than he imagined he made the mistake of letting himself get too involved in conversation and when a man gets too involved and has anything to hide he makes the further mistake of either talking too much of not talking enough carreras had made the mistake on both counts but why should he worry about whether he talked too much or not he couldnt lose not now breakfast came i didnt feel much like eating but i ate all the same i had lost far too much blood and whatever little strength i could recover i was going to need that night i felt even less like sleep but for all that i asked marston for a sedative and he gave it to me i was going to need all the sleep i could get too i wouldnt get much that coming night the last sensation i recalled as i dozed off was in my mouth a queer unnatural dryness that usually comes with overmastering fear but it wasnt fear i told myself it wasnt really fear just the effect of the sleeping draught thats what i told myself chapter it was late afternoon when i awoke round four oclock still a good four hours short of sunset but already the surgery lights were on and the sky outside dark almost as night driving slanting rain was sheeting down torrentially from the black lowering clouds and even through closed doors and windows i could hear the high thin sound part whine part whistle of a galeforce wind howling through the struts and standing rigging the campari was taking a hammering she was still going fast far far too fast for the weather conditions and was smashing her way through high heavy rolling seas bearing down on her starboard bow that they werent mountainous waves or waves of even an unusual size for a tropical storm i was quite sure it was the fact that the campari was battering her way at high speed through quartering seas that seemed to be almost tearing her apart she was corkscrewing viciously a movement that applies the maximum possible strain to a ships hull with metronomic regularity the compari was crashing starboard bow first into a rising sea lifting bows and rolling over to port as she climbed up the wave hesitating then pitching violently forward and rolling over to starboard as she slid down the far shoulder of the vanishing wave to thud with a teethrattling jolting violence into the shoulder of the next sea a shaking shuddering collision that made the campari vibrate for seconds on end in every plate and rivet throughout her entire length no doubt but that the clyde yard that had built her had built her well but they wouldnt have constructed her on the assumption that she was going to fall into the hands of maniacs even steel can come apart dr marston i said try to get carreras on that phone hello awake he shook his head ive been on to him myself an hour ago hes on the bridge and he says hes going to stay there all night if need be and he wont reduce speed any further hes taken her down to fifteen knots already he says the mans mad thank god for the stabilisers if it werent for them wed be turning somersaults can they stand up to this sort of thing indefinitely i should think it highly unlikely the captain and bosun how are they the captains still asleep still delirious but breathing easier our friend mr macdonald you can ask for yourself i twisted in my bed the bosun was indeed awake grinning at me marston said seeing youre both awake do you mind if i have a kip down in the dispensary for an hour i could do with it he looked as if he could too pale and exhausted well call you if anything goes wrong i watched him go then said to macdonald you like your sleep dont you just naturally idle mr carter he smiled i was wanting to get up but the doctor wasnt keen surprised you know your kneecap is smashed and itll be weeks before you can walk properly again hed never walk properly again aye its inconvenient dr marston has been talking to me about this fellow carreras and his plans the mans daft hes all that but daft or not whats to stop him the weather perhaps its pretty nasty outside the weather wont stop him hes got one of those fanatic onetrack minds but i might have a small try at it myself you macdonald had raised his voice now lowered it to a murmur you with a smashed thighbone how in the its not broken i told him of the deception i think i can get around on it if i dont have too much climbing to do i see and the plan sir i told him he thought me as daft as carreras he did his best to dissuade me finally accepted the inevitable and had his own suggestions to make we were still discussing it in low voices when the sickbay door opened and a guard showed susan beresford in closed the door and left where have you been all day i said accusingly i saw the guns she was pale and tired and seemed to have forgotten that she had been angry with me for cooperating with carreras hes got a big one mounted on the poop and a smaller one on the focsle covered with tarpaulins now the rest of the day i spent with mummy and daddy and the others and how are our passengers i enquired hopping mad at being shanghaied or do they regard it as yet another of the attractions of the camparia splendid adventure thrown in at no extra charge that they can talk about to the end of their days im sure most of them must be pretty relieved that carreras is not holding them all to ransom most of them are not caring one way or another she said theyre so seasick they couldnt care if they lived or died i feel a bit the same way myself i can tell you youll get used to it i said callously youll all get used to it i want you to do something for me yes john the dutiful murmur in the voice which was really tiredness the use of the first name had me glancing sharply across at the bosun but he was busy examining a part of the deckhead that was completely devoid of anything to examine get permission to go to your cabin say youre going for blankets that you felt too cold here last night your fathers dinner suitslip it between the blankets not the tropical one the dark one for heavens sake see youre not observed have you any darkcoloured dresses darkcoloured dresses she frowned why for petes sake i said in lowvoiced exasperation i could hear the murmur of voices outside answer me a black cocktail dress bring it also she looked at me steadily would you mind telling me the door opened and tony carreras came in balancing easily on the swaying dipping deck he carried a rainspattered chart under his arm evening all he spoke cheerfully enough but for all that he looked rather pale carter a small job from my father course positions of the fort ticonderoga at eight am noon and four pm today plot them and see if the conderoga is on its predicted course fort ticonderoga being the name of the ship we have to intercept what else butbut the positions i said stupidly the course positions ofhow the devil do you know dont tell me the ticonderoga is actually sending you her positions are the are the radio operators on that ship my father thinks of everything tony carreras said calmly literally everything i told you he was a brilliant man you know were going to ask the ticonderoga to stand and deliver do you think we want it sending out soss when we fire a warning shot across its bows the ticonderogas own radio officers had a slight accident before the ship left england and had to be replaced by ah more suitable men a slight accident susan said slowly what with seasickness and emotion her face was the colour of paper but she wasnt scared of carreras any that i could see what kind of accident a kind that can so easily happen to any of us miss beresford tony carreras was still smiling but somehow he no longer looked charming and boyish i couldnt really see any expression on the face at all all i could see were the curiously flattened eyes more than ever i was sure that there was something wrong with young carreras eyes and more than ever i was sure that the wrongness lay not in the eyes alone but was symptomatic and indicative of a wrongness that lay much deeper than the eyes nothing serious i assure you meaning that they hadnt been killed more than once one of the replacements is not only a radioman but an expert navigator we saw no reason why we should not take advantage of this fact to keep us informed as to the exact position of the ticonderoga every hour on the hour your father leaves nothing to chance i admitted except that he seems to be depending on me as the expert navigator on this ship he didnt knowwe werent to knowthat all the other deck officers on the campari were going to beahso foolish weboth my father and idislike killing of any kind again the unmistakable ring of sincerity but i was beginning to wonder if the bell hadnt a crack in it my father is also a competent navigator but unfortunately he has his hands very full at the moment he happens to be the only professional seaman we have your other men arent alas no but they are perfectly adequate to the task of seeing that professional seamenyour mendo their duties as they should this was cheering news if carreras persisted in pushing the campari through the storm at this rate practically everyone who wasnt a professional seaman was going to be feeling very ill indeed that might help to ease my nights labours i said whats going to happen to us after youve hijacked this damned bullion dump you all on the ticonderoga he said lazily what else yes i sneered so that we can straight away notify every ship that the campari had notify whoever you like he said placidly think were crazy were abandoning the campari the same morning another vessel is already standing by miguel carreras does think of everything i said nothing and turned my attention to the charts while susan made her request to be allowed to bring blankets he smilingly said he would accompany her and they left together when they returned in five minutes time i had entered the course positions on the chart and found that the fort ticonderoga was really on course i handed the chart to carreras with that information he thanked me and left dinner came at eight oclock it wasnt much of a meal as campari dinners went antoine was never at his best when the elements were against him but it was fair enough for all that susan ate nothing i suspected that she had been sick more than once but had made no mention of it millionaires daughter or not she was no crybaby and had no selfpity which was only what i would have expected from the daughter of the beresfords i wasnt hungry myself there was a knot in my stomach that had nothing to do with the motion of the campari but again on the principle that i was going to need all the strength i could find i made a good meal macdonald ate as if he hadnt seen food for a week bullen still slept under sedation restless against the securing straps that held him to his bed breathing still distressed mumbling away continuously to himself at nine oclock marston said time now for coffee john time for coffee i agreed marstons hands i noticed werent quite steady after too many years of consuming the better part of a bottle of rum every night his nerves werent in any too fit a condition for this sort of thing susan brought in five cups of coffee one at a time the wild pitching of the campari the jarring jolting shocks as we crashed down into the troughs made the carrying of more than one at a time impossible one for herself one for macdonald one for marston one for meand one for the sentry the same youngster as had been on guard the previous night for the four of us sugar for the sentry a spoonful of white powder from marstons dispensary susan took his cup outside hows our friend i asked when she returned almost as green as i am she tried to smile but it didnt come off seemed glad to get it where is he in the passage sitting on the floor jammed in a corner gun across his knees how long before that stuff acts doctor if he drinks it all straight away maybe twenty minutes and dont ask me how long the effects will last people vary so much that ive no idea maybe half an hour maybe three hours you can never be certain with those things youve done all you can except the last thing take off those outside bandages and those damned splints will you he looked nervously at the door if someone comes weve been through all that i said impatiently even by taking a chance and losing well be no worse off than we were before take them off marston fetched a chair to give himself steadier support sat down eased the point of his scissors under the bandages holding the splints in place and sliced through them with half a dozen swift clean cuts the bandages fell away the splints came loose and then the door opened half a dozen long strides and tony carreras was by my bedside staring down thoughtfully he looked even paler than the last time id seen him the good healer on the night shift eh having a little patient trouble doctor trouble i said hoarsely id my eyes screwed half shut lips compressed fists lying on the coverlet tightly clenched carter in agony i hoped i wasnt overdoing it is your father mad carreras i closed my eyes completely and stiflednearlya moan as the campari lurched forward and down into an abnormally deep trough with a shuddering jarring impact that all but threw carreras off his feet even through closed doors even above the eldritch howl of the wind and the lash of the galedriven rain the sound of the impact was like gunfire and not distant gunfire at that does he want to kill us all why in gods name cant he slow down mr carter is in very great pain doc marston said quietly whatever his faults as a doctor he was fast at catching on and when you looked into those steady wise blue eyes beneath the magnificent mane of white hair it was impossible not to believe him agony would be a better word he has as you know a compound fracture of the femur with delicate fingers he touched the bloodstained bandages that had been concealed by the splints so that carreras could see just how compound it was every time the ship moves violently the broken ends of the bone grind together you can imagine what its like no i doubt if you can i am trying to rearrange and tighten the splints so as to immobilise the leg completely difficult job for one man in those conditions care to give me a hand in one second flat i revised my estimate of marstons shrewdness no doubt hes just been trying to allay any suspicions that carreras might have had but he couldnt have thought up a worse way not that is if carreras offered his help for the chances were that if he did delay to help hed find the sentry snoring in the passageway outside when be left sorry beethoven himself never sounded half as sweet as the music of that single word from carreras cant wait captain carreras making his rounds and all that thats what miss beresford is here for anyway failing all else just shoot him full of morphia five seconds later he was gone marston raised an eyebrow less affable than of yore john you would say a shade lacking in the sympathy he so often professes hes worried i said hes also a little frightened and perhaps heaven be praised even more than a little seasick but still very tough for all that susan go and collect the sentrys cup and see if friend carreras has really gone she was back in fifteen seconds hes gone the coast is clear i swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up a moment later i had fallen heavily to the floor my head just missing the iron foot of macdonalds bed four things were responsible for this the sudden lurch of the deck as the campari had fallen into a trough the stifiness of both legs the seeming paralysis of my left leg and the pain that had gone through my thigh like a flame as soon as my foot had touched the deck hands gripping the bosuns bed i dragged myself to my feet and tried again marston had me by the right arm and i needed all the support i could get i made it to my own bed and sat down heavily macdonalds face was expressionless susan looked as if she were about to cry for some obscure reason that made me feel better i lurched to my feet like an opening jackknife caught hold of the foot of my own bed and had another go it was no good i wasnt made of iron the lurching of the campari i could cope with and the first stiffness was slowly beginning to disappear even that frightening weakness in my left leg i could in some measure ignore i could always hop along but that pain i couldnt ignore i wasnt made of iron i have a nervous system for transmitting pain just like anyone elses and mine was operating in top gear at the moment even the pain i believe i could have coped with but every time i set my left foot on the deck the shooting agony in my left thigh left me dizzy and lightheaded barely conscious a few steps on that leg and i just wouldnt be conscious at all i supposed vaguely it must have had something to do with all the blood i had lost i sat down again get back into bed marston ordered this is madness youre going to have to lie on your back for at least the next week good old tony carreras i said i was feeling a bit lightheaded and thats a fact clever lad tony hed the right idea your hypodermic doctor painkiller for the thigh shoot me full of it you know the way a football player with a gammy leg gets an injection before the game no football player ever went out on a field with three bullet holes through his leg marston said grimly dont do it dr marston susan said urgently please dont do it hell surely kill himself bosun marston queried give it to him sir the bosun said quietly mr carter knows best mr carter knows best susan mimicked furiously she crossed to the bosun and stared down at him its easy for you to lie there and say he knows best you dont have to go out there and get killed to be shot down or die from the loss of blood not me miss the bosun smiled up at her you wont catch me taking risks like that im sorry mr macdonald she sat down wearily on his bedside im so ashamed i know that if your leg wasnt smashed up but look at him he cant even stand far less walk hell kill himself i tell you kill himself perhaps he will but then he will only be anticipating by about two days miss beresford macdonald said quietly i know mr carter knows we both know that no one on the campari has very long to live not unless someone can do something you dont think miss beresford he went on heavily that mr carter is doing this just for the exercise marston looked at me face slowly tightening you and the bosun have been talking talking about something i know nothing about ill tell you when i come back if you come back he went to his dispensary came back with a hypodermic and injected some pale fluid against all my instincts this itll ease the pain no doubt about that but it will also permit you to overstrain your leg and cause permanent damage not half as permanent as being dead i hopped across into the dispensary pulled old man beresfords suit out from the pile of folded blankets susan had fetched and dressed as quickly as my bad leg and the pitching of the campari would allow i was just turning up the collar and tying the lapels together with a safety pin when susan came in she said abnormally calm it suits you very well jackets a bit tight though its a damned sight better than parading about the upper deck in the middle of the night wearing a white uniform wheres this black dress you spoke of here she pulled it out from the bottom blanket thanks i looked at the label balenciaga should make a fair enough mask i caught the hem of the dress between my hands glanced at her saw the nod and ripped a dollar a stitch i tore out a rough square folded it into a triangle and tied it round my face just below the level of my eyes another few rips another square and i had a knotted cloth covering head and forehead until only my eyes showed the pale glimmer of my hands i could always conceal nothing is going to stop you then she said steadily i wouldnt say that i eased a little weight onto my left leg used my imagination and told myself that it was going numb already lots of things can stop me any one of fortytwo men all armed with guns and submachine guns can stop me if they see me she looked at the ruins of the balenciaga tear off a piece for me while youre at it for you i looked at her she was as pale as i felt what for im coming with you she gestured at her clothes the navy blue sweater and slacks it wasnt hard to guess what you wanted daddys suit for you dont think i changed into these for nothing i dont suppose so tore off another piece of cloth here you are well she stood there with the cloth in her hand well just like that eh its what you wanted isnt it she gave me a slow oldfashioned upfromunder shook her head and tied on the cloth i hobbled back to the sick bay susan following wheres miss beresford going marston demanded sharply why is she wearing that hood shes coming with me i said so she says going with you and youd let her he was horrified shell get herself killed its likely enough i agreed something probably the anaesthetic was having a strange effect on my head i felt enormously detached and very calm but as the bosun says whats a couple of days early i need another pair of eyes somebody who can move quickly and lightly to reconnoitre above all a lookout lets have one of your torches doctor i object i strongly protest against get him the torch susan interrupted he stared at her hesitated sighed and turned away macdonald beckoned me sorry i cant be with you sir but this is the next best thing he pressed a seamans knife into my hand wide hinged blade on one side shacklelocking marlinespike on the other the marline came to a needle point if you have to use it hit upward with the spike the blade under your hand take your word for it any time i hefted the knife saw susan staring at it her eyes wide you you would use that thing stay behind if you like the torch dr marston i pocketed the flash kept the knife in my hand and passed through the surgery door i didnt let it swing behind me i knew susan would be there the sentry sitting wedged into a corner of the passage was asleep his automatic carbine was across his knees it was an awful temptation but i let it go a sleeping sentry would call for a few curses and kicks but a sleeping sentry without his gun would start an allout search of the ship it took me two minutes to climb up two companionways to the level of a deck nice wide flat companionways but it took me two minutes my left leg was very stiff very weak and didnt react at all to autosuggestion when i kept telling myself it was getting less painful by the minute besides the campari was pitching so violently now that it would have been a fulltime job for a fit person to climb upwards without being flung off pitching the campari was pitching but with a now even more exaggerated corkscrew motion great sheets of flying water breaking over the bows and being hurled back against the superstructure at some hundreds of miles from the centre of a hurricaneand i didnt need any barometers or weather forecasts to tell me what was in the calling it is the outspreading swell that indicates the direction of the centre of a hurricane but closer in and we were getting far too close for comfort it is the wind direction that locates the centre we were heading roughly twenty degrees east of north and the wind blowing from dead ahead that meant the hurricane was roughly to the east of us with a little southing still keeping pace with us travelling roughly northwest a more northerly course than was usual and the campari and the hurricane were on more of a collision course than ever the strength of the wind i estimated at force eight or nine on the old beaufort scale that made the centre of the storm less than a hundred miles away if carreras kept on his present course at his present speed everybodys troubles his as well as ours would soon be over at the top of the second companionway i stood still for a few moments to steady myself took susans arm for support then lurched aft in the direction of the drawing room twenty feet away id hardly started lurching when i stopped something was wrong even in my fuzzy state it didnt take long to find out what was wrong on a normal night at sea the campari was like an illuminated christmas tree tonight every deck light was off another example of carreras taking no chances although this was an unnecessary and exaggerated example sure he didnt want anyone to see him but in a black gale like this no one could have seen him anyway even had any vessel been heading on the same course which was hardly possible unless its master had taken leave of his senses but it suited me well enough we staggered on making no attempt to be silent with the shriek of the wind the thunderous drumming of the torrential rain and the repeated pistolshot explosions as the earing camparis bows kept smashing into the heavy rolling ombers ahead no one could have heard us a couple of feet way the smashed windows of the drawing room had been roughly boarded up careful not to cut a jugular or put an eye out on one of the jagged splinters of glass i pressed my face close to the boards and peered through one of the cracks the curtains were drawn inside but with the gale whistling through the gaps between the boards they were blowing and flapping wildly most of the time one minute there and id seen all i wanted to see and it didnt help me at ail the passengers were all herded together at one end of the room most of them huddled down on closepacked mattresses a few sitting with their backs to the bulkhead a more miserably seasick collection of millionaires i had never seen in my life their complexions ranged from a faintly greenish shade to a deadwhite pallor they were suffering all right in one corner i saw some stewards cooks and engineer officers including mcllroy with cummings beside him seamans branch apart it looked as if every offduty man was imprisoned there with the passengers carreras was economising on his guards i could see only two of them hardfaced unshaven characters with a tommy gun apiece for a moment i had the crazy idea of bursting in the door and rushing them but only for a moment armed with only a clasp knife and with a top speed of about that of a fairly active tortoise i wouldnt have got a yard two minutes later we were outside the wireless office no one had challenged us no one had seen us the decks were entirely deserted it was a night for deserted decks the wireless office was in darkness i pressed one ear to the metal of the door closed a had over the other ear to shut out the clamour of the storm and listened as hard as i could nothing i placed a gentle hand on the knob turned and pushed the door didnt budge a fraction of an inch i eased my hand off that doorknob with all the wary caution and thistledown delicacy of a man withdrawing the kohinoor from a basket of sleeping cobras whats the matter susan asked is that was as far as she got before my hand closed over her mouth not gently we were fifteen feet away from that door before i took my hand away what is it what is it her low whisper had a shake in it she didnt know whether to be scared or angry or both the door was locked why shouldnt it be why should they keep watch the door is locked by a padlock from the outside we put a new one there yesterday morning its no longer there somebody has shut the catch on the inside i didnt know how much of this she was getting the roar of the sea the drum fire of the rain the wind rushing in from the darkness of the north and playing its highpitched threnody in the rigging seemed to drown and snatch away the words even as i spoke them i pulled her into what pitiful shelter was offered by a ventilator and her next words showed that she had indeed heard and understood most of what i had said they have left a sentry just in case anyone tried to break in how could anyone break in were all under guard and lock and key its as carreras junior sayshis old man never takes a chance i hesitated then because i didnt know what else to say i went on ive no right to do this but i must im desperate i want you to be a stalking hors help get that character out of there what do you want me to do good girl i squeezed her arm knock at the door pull that hood off and show yourself at the window hell almost certainly switch on a light or flash a torch and when he sees its a girlwell hell be astonished but not scared hell want to investigate and then youyou thats it with only a clasp knife the tremor in her voice was unmistakable youre very sure of yourself im not sure at all but if we dont make a move until were certain of success we might as well jump over the side now ready what are you going to do once you get inside she was scared and stalling not that i was happy myself send an sos on the distress frequency warn every vessel within listening range that the campari has been seized by force and is intending to intercept a bullioncarrying vessel at such and such a spot within a few hours everyone in north america will know the situation thatll get action all right yes a long pause thatll get action the first action it will get is that carreras will discover that his guard is missing and where had you thought of hiding him in the atlantic she shivered briefly then said obliquely i think perhaps carreras knows you better than i do the guards missing theyll know it must be one of the crew responsible theyll soon find out that the only guard keeping an eye on the crew who wasnt awake all the time is the boy outside the sick bay she was silent for a moment then went on so softly that i could hardly hear her above the storm i can just see carreras ripping those bandages off your leg and finding out that your thigh is not broken you know what will happen then it doesnt matter it matters to me she said the words calmly matter of factly as if they were of no particular significance another thing you said everybody would know the setup within a few hours the two radio operators carreras has planted on the ticonderoga will know immediately they will immediately radio the news back to the campari to carreras after im finished in the wireless office no one will ever be able to send or receive on that set again all right so youll smash it up that itself would be enough to let carreras know what youve done and you cant smash up every radio receiver on the campari you cant for instance get near the ones in the drawing room everybody will know you say that means the generalissimo and his government will know also and then all the stations on the island will do nothing but keep up a nonstop broadcast of the news carreras is bound to hear it i said nothing i thought vaguely that i must have lost a great deal of blood her mind was working about ten times as quickly and clearly as mine not that that made her very smart she went on you and the bosun seem very sure that carreras wont let usthe passengers and crewlive perhaps you think its because he cant have any witnesses that whatever advantage the generalissimo gained from getting this money would be offset over and over again by the worldwide reaction against him if the world knew what he had done perhaps reaction i said reaction hed find the american and british navies and air forces on his doorstep the following morning and that would be the end of the generalissimo not even russia would raise a hand to help him they wouldnt as much as rattle a rocket of course he cant afford to let anyone know hed be finished in fact he couldnt even afford to let anyone know hed made the attempt so as soon as carreras picks up the news of your sos he gets rid of all the witnessespermanently and sheers off transships to this other vessel thats waiting and thats that i stood there saying nothing my mind felt dull and heavy and tired my body even more so i tried to tell myself it was just the drug marston had pumped into me but it wasnt that i knew it wasnt that the sense of defeat is the most powerful opiate of all i said hardly knowing what i was saying well at least we would have saved the gold the gold you had to be a millionaires daughter before you could put all that scorn into your voice when you mentioned the word gold who cares a fig for all the gold in the world whats gold compared to your life and my life my mothers and fathers and the lives of everyone on the campari how much money did carreras say the fort ticonderoga was carrying you heard him a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and fifty million daddy could raise that in a week and still have as much again left lucky daddy i muttered lightheaded thats what i was getting what did you say nothing nothing it all seemed such a good idea when macdonald and i worked it out susan im sorry she caught my right hand in both of hers and held it tight im truly sorry johnny where did you get this johnny business from i mumbled i like it whats good enough for captain bullenyour hands are like ice she exclaimed softly and youre shivering gentle fingers pushed up under my hood and your forehead is burning running a temperature and fever youre not well oh youre not well come on back down to the sick bay johnny please no please dont nag at me woman i pushed myself wearily off the ventilator come on where are you going she was quickly beside me her arm in mine and i was glad to hang on cerdan our mysterious friend mr cerdan do you realise that we know practically nothing about mr cerdan except that he seems to be the one who lies back and lets the others do all the work carreras and cerdan they seem to be the kingpins and maybe carreras isnt the boss after all but i do know this if i could get a knife sticking into the throat or a gun jabbing into the back of either of those men i would have a big card to play in this game come on johnny she pleaded come on down below all right so im loopy but its still true if i could shove either of those men into the drawing room ahead of me and threaten the two guards with his death if they didnt drop their guns i rather think they would with two machine guns and all the men in there to help i could do a lot on a night like this im not crazy susan just desperate like i said you can hardly stand there was a note of desperation in her voice now thats why youre here to hold me up carteras is out of the question hell be on the bridge and thatll be the most heavily guarded place on the ship because its the most important place i winced and shrank back into a corner as a great bluewhite jagged streak of forked lightning almost directly ahead flickered and stabbed through the black wall of cumulonimbus clouds and the driving rain momentarily illuminating every detail of the camparis decks in its blinding glare the curiously flat explosive clap of thunder was muffled lost in the teeth of the gale that helps i muttered thunder lightning a tropical rainstorm and moving into the heart of a hurricane king lear should have seen this little lot hed never have complained of his blasted heath again macbeth she said that was macbeth oh hell i said she was getting as nutty as i was i took her arm or she took mine i forget which come on were too exposed here a minute later we were down on a deck crouched against a bulkhead i said finesse will get us nowhere im going into the central passageway straight into cerdans cabin ill stick my hand in my pocket pretend i have a gun stay at the entrance to the passageway warn me if anyone comes hes not in she said we were standing at the starboard forward end of the accommodation just outside cerdans sleeping cabin hes not at home theres no light on the curtains will be drawn i said impatiently the ships fully darkened ill bet carreras hasnt even got the navigation lights on we shrank against the bulkhead as another lightning flash reached down from the darkened clouds seemed almost to dance on the tip of the camparis mast i wont be long wait she held me with both hands the curtains arent drawn that flashi could see everything inside the cabin you could see for some reason id lowered my voice almost to a whisper anyone inside i couldnt see all the inside it was just for a second i straightened pressed my face hard against the window and stared inside the darkness in the cabin was absolute absolute that is until another forked finger of lightning lit up the entire upper works of the campari once more momentarily i saw my own hooded face and staring eyes reflected back at me in the glass then exclaimed involuntarily for i had seen something else again what is it susan demanded huskily whats wrong this is wrong i fished out marstons torch hooded it with my hand and shone it downwards through the glass the bed was up against the bulkhead almost exactly beneath the window cerdan was lying on the bed clothed and awake his eyes staring up as if hypnotised by the beam of the torch wide eyes staring eyes his white hair was not just where his white hair had been it had slipped back revealing his own hair beneath black hair jetblack hair with a startling streak of irongrey almost exactly in the middle black hair with an irongrey streak where had i seen somebody with hair like that when had i ever heard of somebody with hair like that all of a sudden i knew it was when not where i knew the answer i switched off the light cerdan there was shock and disbelief and utter lack of comprehension in susans voice cerdan bound hand and foot and tied to his bed so that he cant move an inch cerdan but no no she was ready to give up oh johnny what does it all mean i know what it all means no question now but that i knew what it all meant and wished to heaven i didnt id only thought id been afraid before the time id only been guessing but the time for guessing was past oh my god it was past i knew the truth now and the truth was worse than i had ever dreamed i fought down the rising panic and said steadily through dry lips have you ever robbed a grave susan have i ever she broke off and when her voice came again there were tears in it were both worn out johnny lets get down below i want to go back to the sick bay i have news for you susan im not mad but im not joking and i hope to god that graves not empty i caught her arm to lead her away and as i did the lightning flashed again and her eyes were wild and full of fear i wondered what mine looked like to her chapter what with the darkness my bad leg the intermittent lightning the wild rearing wavetop staggering and plunging of the campari and the need to use the greatest caution all the way it took us a good fifteen minutes to reach number four hold far back on the afterdeck and when we got there pulled back the tarpaulin loosened a couple of battens and peered down into the nearstygian depths of the hold i wasnt at all sure that i was glad we had come along with several tools id filched an electric lantern from the bosuns store on the way there and though it didnt give off much of a light it gave off enough to let me see that the floor of the hold was a shambles id secured for sea after leaving carracio but i hadnt secured for a nearhurricane for the excellent reason that whenever the weather was bad the campari had invariably run in the other direction but now carreras had taken us in the wrong direction and he either hadnt bothered or forgotten to secure for the worsening weather conditions forgotten almost certainly for number four hold presented a threat to say the least to the lives of everybody aboard carreras and his men included at least a dozen heavy crates the weight of one or two of which could be measured in tons had broken loose and were sliding and lurching across the floor of the hold with every corkscrewing pitch of the campari alternately crashing into the secured cargo aft or the bulkhead forward my guess was that this wasnt doing the forward bulkhead any good and just let the motion of the campari change from pitching to rolling especially as we neared the centre of the hurricane and the massive dead weights of those sliding crates would begin to assault the sides of the ship buckled plates torn rivets and a leak that couldnt be repaired would be only a matter of time to make matters worse carreras men hadnt bothered to remove the broken splintered sides of the wooden crates in which they and the guns had been slung aboard they too were sliding about the floor with every movement of the ship being continually smashed and becoming progressively smaller in size as they were crushed between the sliding crates and bulkheads pillars and fixed cargo not the least frightening part of it all was the din the almost continuous goosepimpling metallic screech as ironbanded cases slid over steel decks a highpitched grating scream that set your teeth on edge a scream that invariably ended predictably yet always unexpectedly in a jarring crash that shook the entire hold as the crates brought up against something solid and every sound in that echoing reverberating emptily cavernous hold was magnified ten times all in all the floor of that hold wasnt the place i would have chosen for an afternoon nap i gave the electric lantern to susan after shining it on a vertical steel ladder tapering down into the depths of the hold down you go i said for heavens sake hang on to that ladder theres a baffle about three feet high at the bottom of it get behind it you should be safe there i watched her climb slowly down manoeuvred two of the battens back into place over my head no easy job with one hand and left them like that maybe they would be jarred loose they might even fall down into the hold it was a chance i had to take they could only be secured from above and the covering tarpaulin could also only be secured from above there was nothing i could do about that either if anyone was crazy enough to be out on deck that night especially as carreras had no life lines rigged the chances were in that blinding storm they wouldnt even notice the flapping corner of the tarpaulin or if they did they would only either pass it by or at the most secure it if someone was cunous enough to go to the length of pushing back a battenwell there was no point in worrying about that i went down the hatch slowly awkwardly painfullymarston had a higher opinion of his anaesthetics than i had and joined susan on the floor behind the baffle at this level the noise was redoubled the sight of those headhigh behemoths of crates charging across the hold more terrifying than ever susan said the coffins where are they all i had told her was that i wanted to examine some coffins i couldnt bring myself to tell her what we might find in them theyre boxed in wooden crates on the other side of the hold the other side she twisted her head lined up the lantern and looked at the sliding wreckage and crates screeching and tearing their way across the floor the other side we wouldwe would be killed before we got halfway there like enough but i dont see anything else for it hold on a minute will you you with your leg you cant even hobble oh no before i could stop her she was over the baffle and half running half staggering across the hold tripping and stumbling as the ship lurched and her feet caught on broken planks of wood but always managing to regain balance to stop suddenly or dodge nimbly as a crate slid her way she was agile i had to admit and quick on her feet but she was exhausted with seasickness with bracing herself for the past hours against the constant violent lurching of the campari shed never make it but make it she did and i could see her on the other side flashing her torch round my admiration for her spirit was equailed only by my exasperation at her actions what was she going to do with those boxed coffins when she found them carry them back across the floor one under each arm but they werent there for after she had looked everywhere she shook her head and then she was coming back and i was shouting out a warning but the warning stuck in my throat and was only a whisper and she wouldnt have heard it anyway a plunging careening crate propelled by a sudden vicious lurch as the campari plunged headlong into an exceptional trough caught her back and shoulder and pitched her to the floor pushing her along before its massive weight as if it were imbued with an almost human inhumanuality of evil and malignance and determined to crush the life out of her against the forward bulkhead and then in the last second before she would have died the campari straightened the crate screeched to a halt less than a yard from the bulkhead and susan was lying there between crate and bulkhead very still i must have been at least fifteen feet away from her but i have no recollection of covering the distance from the baffle to where she lay and then back again but i must have done for suddenly we were there in a place of safety and she was clinging to me as if i were the last hope left in the world susan my voice was hoarse a voice belonging to someone else altogether susan are you hurt she clung even closer by some miracle she still held the lantern clutched in her right hand it was round the back of my neck somewhere but the reflected beam from the ships side gave enough light to see by her mask had been torn ff her face was scratched and bleeding her hair a bedragled mess her clothes soaked and her heart going like a captive birds for an incongruous moment an unbidden recolection touched my mind a recollection of a very cool very poised sweetly mallcious pseudosolicitous young lady asking me about cocktails only two days ago in carracio but the vision faded as soon as it had come the incongruity was too much susan i said urgently are you im not hurt she gave a long tremulous sigh that was ore shudder than sigh i was just too scared to move he eased her grip a trifle looked at me with green eyes enormous in the pallor of her face then buried her face my shoulder i thought she was going to choke me it didnt last long fortunately i felt the grip slowly easing w the beam of the lantern shifting and she was saying in n abnormally matteroffact voice there they are i turned round and there not ten feet away they were deed three cotlinscarreras had already removed the casesand securely stowed between baffle and bulkhead and added with tarpaulins so that they could come to no harm tony carreras kept on repeating his old man didnt miss much dark shiny coffins with blackbraided ropes and brass handles one of them had an inlet plaque on the lid copper r brass i couldnt be sure that saves me some trouble my voice was almost back normal i took the hammer and chisel id borrowed from e bosuns store and let them drop this screw driver will all i need well find two of those with whats normally side them give me the lantern and stay there ill be as quick as i can youll be quicker if i hold the lantern her voice matched my own in steadiness but the pulse in her throat was going like a trip hammer hurry please i was in no way to argue i caught the foot of the nearest coffin and pulled it towards me so that i could have room to work it was jammed i slid my hand under the end to lift it and suddenly my finger found a hole in the bottom of the coffin and then another and a third a leadlined coffin with holes bored in the bottom of it that was curious to say the least when id moved it far enough out i started on the screws they were brass and very heavy but so was the screw driver id taken from macdonalds store and at the back of my mind was the thought that if the knockout drops dr marston had provided for the sentry were in any way as ineffective as the anaesthetic he had given me then the sentry would be waking up any minute now if he hadnt already come to i had that coffin lid off in no time at all beneath the lid was not the satin shroud or silks i would have expected but a filthy old blanket in the generalissimos country perhaps their customs with coffins were different from ours i pulled off the blanket and found i was right their customs were on occasion different the corpse in this case consisted of blocks of amatolach block was clearly marked with the word so there was no mistake about ita primer a small case of detonators and a compact square box with wires leading from it a timing device probably susan was peering over my shoulder whats amatol high explosive enough there to blow the campari apart she asked nothing else i replaced the blanket screwed on the lid and started on the next coffin this too had holes in the underside probably to prevent the explosives sweating i removed the lid looked at the contents and replaced the lid number two was a duplicate of number one and then i started on the third one the one with the plaque this would be the one the plaque was heartshaped and read with impressive simplicity richard hoskins senator just that senator of what i didnt know but impressive impressive enough to ensure its reverent transportation to the united states i removed the lid with care gentleness and as much respectful reverence as if richard hoskins actually were inside which i knew he wasnt whatever lay inside was covered with a rug i lifted the rug gingerly susan brought the lantern nearer and there it lay cushioned in blankets and cotton wool a polished cylinder seventyfive inches in length eleven inches in diameter with a whitish pyroceram nose cap just lying there there was something frightening about it something unutterably evil but perhaps that was just because of what was in my own mind what is it susans voice was so low tht she bad to come closer to repeat the words oh johnny what in the world is it the twister thethe what the twister oh dear god she had it now thisthis atomic device that was stolen in south carolina the twister she rose unsteadily to her feet and backed away the twister it wont bite you i said i didnt feel too sure about that either the equivalent of five thousand tons of tnt guaranteed to blast any ship on earth to smithereens if not actually vaporise and thats just what carreras intends to do ii dont understand maybe she was referring to the actual hearing of the wordsour talk was continually being punctuated by the screeching of metal and the sounds of wood being crushed and snapped to the meaning of what i was saying you when he gets the gold from the ticonderoga and transships it to this vessel he has standing by hes going to blow up the campari withwith this there is no ship standing by there never was when hes loaded the gold aboard the kindhearted miguel carreras is going to free all the passengers and crew of the campari and let them off in the fort ticonderoga as a further mark of his sentimentality and kindness hes going to ask that senator hoskins here and his two presumably illustrious companions be taken back for burial in their native land the captain of the ticonderoga would never dream of refusingand if it came to the bit carreras would make certain that he damned well didnt refuse see that i pointed to a panel near the tail of the twister dont touch it if you can imagine anyone screaming in a whisper then thats what she did i wouldnt touch it for all the money in the ticonderoga i assured her fervently im even scared to look at the damned thing anyway that panel is almost certainly a timing device which will be preset before the coffin is transshipped we sail merrily on our way hellbent for norfolk the army navy air force fbi and what have youfor carreras radio stooges aboard the ticonderoga will make good and certain that the radios will be smashed and well have no means of sending a message half an hour an hour after leaving the camparian hour at least i should think even carreras wouldnt want to be within miles of an atomic device going upwell it would be quite a bang hell never do itnever the emphatic voice didnt carry the slightest shred of conviction the man must be a fiend grade one i agreed and dont talk rubbish about his not doing it why do you think they stole the twister and made it appear as if dr slingsby caroline had lit out with it from the very beginning it was with the one and only purpose of blowing the fort ticonderoga to kingdom come so that there would be no possibility of any comeback everything hinged on the total destruction of the ticonderoga and everyone aboard it including passengers and crew of the campari maybe carreras two fake radiomen could have smuggled some explosives aboard but it would be quite impossible to smuggle enough to ensure complete destruction hundreds of tons of high explosives in the magazines of a british battle cruiser blew up in the last war but still there were survivors he couldnt sink it by gunfirea couple of shots from a moderately heavy gun and the camparis decks would be so buckled that the guns would be uselessand even then there would be bound to be survivors but with the twister there will be no chances of survival none in the world carreras men she said slowly they killed the guards in this atomic research establishment what else and then forced dr caroline to drive out through the gates with themselves and the twister in the back the twister was probably en route to their island by air inside an hour but someone drove the brake wagon down to savannah before abandoning it no doubt to throw suspicion on the campari which they knew was leaving savannah that morning im not sure why but i would take long odds it was because carreras knowing the campari was bound for the caribbean was reasonably sure that she would be searched at her first port of call giving him the opportunity to introduce his bogus marconi man aboard while i had been talking id been studying two circular dials inset in the panel on the twister now i spread the rug back in position with all the loving care of a father smoothing out the bedcover over his youngest son and started to screw the coffin lid back in position for a time susan watched me in silence then said wonderingly mr cerdan dr caroline the same person it has to be the same person i remember now at the time of the disappearance of the twister it was mentioned that only one or two people so far know how to arm the twister he was just as important to their plans as the twister without him it was useless poor old doc caroline has had a rough passage im afraid not only kidnapped and forced to do as ordered but knocked about by us also the only people who could have saved him under constant guard by those two thugs disguised as nurses he bawled me out of his cabin the first time i saw him but only because he knew that his devoted nurse sitting beside him with her dear little knitting bag on her lap had a sawedoff shotgun inside it but but why the wheel chair was it necessary to take such elaborate of course it was they couldnt have him mingling with the passengers communicating with them it helped conceal his unusual height and it also gave them a perfect reason to keep a nonstop watch on incoming radio messages he came to your fathers cocktail party because he was told to the coup was planned for that evening and it suited carreras to have his two armed nurses there to help in the takeover poor old caroline that dive he tried to make from his wheel chair when i showed him the earphones wasnt made with the intention of getting at me at all he was trying to get at the nurse with the sawedoff shotgun but captain bullen didnt know that so he laid him out i tightened the last of the screws and said dont breathe a word of this back in the sick baythe old man talks nonstop in his sleepor anywhere else not even to your parents come on that sentry may come to any minute you youre going to leave that thing her she stared at me in disbelief you must get rid of it you must how carry it up a vertical ladder over my shoulder that thing weighs about three hundred fifty pounds altogether including the coffin and what happens if i do get rid of it carreras finds out within hours whether or not he finds out or guesses who took it doesnt matter what does matter is that hell know he can no longer depend on the twister to get rid of all the inconvenient witnesses on the campari what then my guess is that not one member of the crew or passengers will have more than a few hours to live he would have to kill us then no question of transshipping us to the ticonderoga as for the ticonderoga he would have to board it kill all the crew and open the sea cocks that might take hours and would inconvenience him dangerously might wreck all his plans but he would have to do it the point is that getting rid of the twister is not going to save any lives at all all it would accomplish is the certain death of all of us what are we going to do her voice was strained and shaky her face a pale blur in the reflected light oh johnny hat are we going to do im going back to bed heaven only knew i felt like it then ill waste my time trying to figure out how to save r caroline dr caroline i dont seewhy dr caroline because hes number one for the high jump as things stand long before the rest of us because hes the man whos going to arm the twister i said patiently do you think hell transfer him to the ticonderoga and let him acquaint he captain with the fact that the coffin hes taking back to the states contains not senator hoskins but an armed and ticking atom bomb wheres it all going to end there was panic open panic in her voice now a near hysteria i cant believe it i cant believe it its like some dark nightmare she had her hands twisted in my lapels her face buried in my jacket well anyway her old mans jacket and her voice was muffled oh johnny wheres it all going to end a touching scene a most touching scene a mocking voice said from close behind me it all ends here and now this moment i whirled round or at least i tried to whirl round but i couldnt even do that properly what with disengaging susans grip the weakness in my leg and the lurching of the ship the sudden turn threw me completely off balance and i stumbled and fell against the ships side a powerful light switched on blinding me and in black silhouette against the light i could see the snub barrel of an automatic on your feet carter there was no mistaking the voice tony carreras no longer pleasant and affable but cold hard vicious the real tony carreras at last i want to see you fall when this slug hits you cleverclever carter or so you thought on your feet i said or youd rather take it lying there suit yourself the gun lifted a trifle the direct nononsense type he didnt believe in fancy farewell speeches shoot them and be done with it i could believe now that he was his fathers son my bad leg was under me and i couldnt get up i stared into the beam of light into the black muzzle of the gun i stopped breathing and tensed myself tensing yourself against a fired from a distance of five feet is a great help but i wasnt feeling very logical at the moment dont shoot susan screamed dont kill him or well all die the torch beam wavered then steadied again it steadied on me and the gun hadnt shifted any that i could see susan took a couple of steps towards him but he fended her off stiffarmed out of the way lady id never in my life heard such concentrated venom and malignance id misjudged young carreras all right and her words hadnt even begun to register on him so implacable was his intention i still wasnt breathing and my mouth was as dry as a kith the twister her voice was urgent compelling desperate hes armed the twister what what are you saying this time she had got through the twister armed the voice malignant as ever but i thought i detected overtones of fear yes carreras armed id never known before how important lubrication of the throat and mouth was to the human voice a buzzard with tonsillitis had nothing on my croak armed carreras armed the repetition was not for emphasis i couldnt think of anything else to say how to carry this off how to exploit the few seconds grace that susan had bought for me i shifted the hand that was propping me up the one in the black shadow behind me as if to brace myself against the pitching of the campari my fingers closed over the handle of the hammer id dropped i wondered bleakly what i was going to do with it the torch and the gun were as steady as ever youre lying carter the confidence was back in his voice god knows how you found out about it but youre lying you dont know how to arm it that was it keep him talking just keep him talking i dont but dr slingsby caroline does that shook him literally the torch wavered but it didnt waver enough how do you know about dr caroline he demanded hoarsely his voice was almost a shout how do you i was speaking to him tonight i said calmly speaking with him but but theres a key to arm this the only key to arm it and my father has it dr caroline has a spare in his tobacco pouch you never thought to look did you carreras i sneered youre lying he repeated mechanically then more strongly lying i say carter i saw you tonight i saw you leave the sick baymy god do you think i was so stupid as not to get suspicious when i saw the sentry drinking coffee given him by kindhearted carterlocked it up followed you to the radio office and then down to carolines cabin but you never went inside carter i lost you then for a few minutes i admit but you never went inside why didnt you stop us earlier because i wanted to find out what you were up to i found it so hes the person we thought we saw i said to susan the conviction in my voice astonished even myself you poor fool we noticed something in the shadows and left in a hurry but we went back carreras oh yes we went back to dr caroline and we didnt waste any time talking to him either we had a far smarter idea than that miss beresford wasnt quite accurate i didnt arm the twister dr caroline himself did that i smiled and shifted my eyes from the beam of the torch to a spot behind and to the right of carreras tell him doctor carreras half turned cursed viciously swung back his mind was fast his reactions faster hed hardly even begun to fall for the old gag all hed allowed us was a second of time and in that brief moment i hadnt even got past tightening my grip on the hammer and now he was going to kill e but he couldnt get his gun lined up susan had been waiting for the chance she sensed that id been building up towards the chance she dropped her lantern and flung herself forward even as carreras had started to turn and she ad only about three feet to go now she was clinging despirately to his gun arm all her weight on it forcing it down towards the floor i twisted myself convulsively forward and that twopound hammer came arching over my shoulder and flew straight for carreras face with all the power all the hatred and viciousness that was in me he saw it coming his left hand still gripping the torch as raised high to smash down on the unprotected nape of susans neck he jerked his head sideways sung out his left arm in instinctive reaction the hammer caught him just below the left elbow with tremendous force his torch went flying through the air and the hold was plunged into absolute darkness where the hammer went i dont know a heavy rate screeched and rumbled across the floor just at that moment and i never heard it land the crate ground to a standstill in the sudden momentary silence i could hear the sound of struggling of heavy breathing i was slow in getting to my feet my left leg was practically useless but maybe it only seemed slow to me fear hen it is strong enough has the curious effect of slowing p time and i was afraid i was afraid for susan carreras except as the source of menace to her didnt exist for me at he moment only susan he was a big man a powerful man e could break her neck with a single wrench kill her with a single blow i heard her cry out a cry of shock or fear a moments silence a heavy soft thump as of falling bodies a scream of agony again from susan and then that silence again they werent there when i reached the spot where they had been struggling they werent there for a second i stood still in that impenetrable darkness bewildered then my hand touched the top of the threefoot baffle and i had it in their wrestling on that crazily careening deck theyd staggered against the baffle and toppled over on to the floor of the hold i was over that baffle before i had time to think before i knew what i was doing the bosuns knife was in my hand the needlepointed marlinespike open the locking shackle closed i stumbled as the weight came on my left leg fell to my knees touched someones head and hair long hair susan i moved away and had just reached my feet again when he came at me he came at me he didnt back away try to keep out of my reach in that darkness he came at me that meant hed lost his gun we fell to the floor together clawing clubbing kicking once twice half a dozen times he caught me on the chest the side of the body with sledgehammer shortarm jabs that threatened to break my ribs but i didnt really feel them he was a strong man tremendously strong but even with all his great strength even had his left arm not been paralysed and useless he would have found no escape that night i grunted with the numbing shock of it and carreras shrieked out in agony as the hilt of macdonalds knife jarred solidly home against his breastbone i wrenched the knife free and struck again and again and again after the fourth blow he didnt cry out any more carreras died hard hed stopped hitting me now his right arm was locked round my neck and with every blow he struck the throttling pressure of the arm increased all the convulsive strength of a man dying in agony was brought bear on exactly that spot where i had been so heavily and bagged pain crippling pain redhot barbed lances of re shot through my back and head i thought my neck was going to break i struck again and then the knife fell from y hand when i came to the blood was pounding dizzily in my ars my head felt as if it were going to burst my lungs were heaving and gasping for air that wouldnt come i felt as if were choking being slowly and surely suffocated and then i suddenly realised the truth i was being suffocated e arm of the dead man by some freak of muscular contraction was still locked around my neck i couldnt have been out for long not for more than a minute with both hands i grasped his arm by the wrist and managed to tear it free from my neck for thirty seconds perhaps longer i lay ere stretched out on the floor of the hold my heart pounding gasping for breath as waves of weakness and dizziness washed over me while some faraway insistent voice as desperately urgent as it was distant kept saying in this remote corner of my mind you must get up you must get up and then i had it i was lying on the floor of the hold and those huge crates were still sliding and crashing around with every heave and stagger of the campari and susan she was lying there too i pushed myself to my knees fumbled around in my pocket i found marstons pencil flash and switched it on it still worked the beam fell on carreras and id only time to notice that the whole shirt front was soaked with blood i involuntarily turned the torch away sick and nauseed susan was lying close in to the baffle half on her side half on her back her eyes were open dull and glazed with shock and pain but they were open its finished i could hardly recognise the voice as mine its all over now she nodded and tried to smile you cant stay here i went on the other side of the bafflequldck i rose to my feet caught her under the arms and lifted she came easily lightly then cried out in agony and went limp on me but i had her before she could fall braced myself against the ladder lifted her over the baffle and laid her down gently on the other side in the beam of my torch she lay there on her side her arms outflung the left arm between wrist and elbow was twisted at an impossible angle broken no doubt of it broken when she and carreras had toppled over the baffle she must have been underneath her left arm had taken the combined strain of their falling bodies and the strain had been too much but there was nothing i could do about it not now i turned my attention to tony carreras i couldnt leave him there i knew i couldnt leave him there when miguel carreras found out that his son was missing hed have the campari searched from end to end i had to get rid of him but i couldnt get rid of him in that hold there was only one place where i could finally completely and without any fear of rediscovery put the body of tony carreras in the sea tony carreras must have weighed at least two hundred pounds that narrow vertical steel ladder was at least thirty feet high i was weak from loss of blood and sheer physical exhaustion and id only one sound leg so i never stopped to think about it if i had the impossibility of what i had to do would have defeated me even before i had begun i hauled him to the ladder dragged him up to a sitting position against it hooked my hands under his shoulders and jerked up his dead weight inch by inch until his shoulders and hanging head were on a level with my own stooped quickly caught him in a firemans lift and started climbing for the first time that night the pitching corkscrewing campari was my friend when the ship plunged into a trough rolling to starboard at the same time the ladder would incline away from me as much as fifteen degrees and id take a couple of quick steps hang on grimly as the campari rolled back and the ladder swung out above me wait for the return roll and then repeat the process twice carreras all but slipped from my shoulder twice i had to take a quick step down to renew my purchase i hardly used my left leg at all my right leg and both arms took all the strain above all my shoulders took the strain i felt at times as if the muscles would tear but it wasnt any worse than the pain in my leg so i kept on going i kept going till i reached the top another halfdozen rungs and i would have had to let him drop for i dont think i could ever have made it i heaved him over the hatch coaming followed sank down on deck and waited till my pulse rate dropped down to the low hundreds after the stench of oil and the close stufliness of that hold the driving galeborne rain felt and tasted wonderful i cupped the torch in my handnot that there was more than a very remote chance of anyone being round at that hour in that weatherand went through his pockets till i found a key tagged sick bay then i caught him by the collar and started for the side of the ship a minute later i was down in the bottom of the hold again i found tony carreras gun stuck it in my pocket and looked at susan she was still unconscious which was the best way to be if i had to carry her up that ladder and i had with a broken arm she couldnt have made it alone and if i waited till she regained consciousness she would be in agony all the way and she wouldnt have remained conscious long after coping with carreras dead weight the task of getting susan beresford up on deck seemed almost easy i laid her carefully on the rainwashed deck replaced the battens and tied the tarpaulin back in place i was just finishing when i sensed rather than heard her stir dont move i said quickly on the upper deck again i had to raise my voice almost to a shout to make myself heard against the bedlam of the storm your forearms broken yes matterfact far too matteroffact tony carreras did you leave thats all over i told you that was all where is he overboard overboard the tremor was back in her voice and i liked it much better than the abnormal calmness how did he i stabbed him god knows how many times i said wearily do you think he got up all by himself climbed the ladder and jumped sorry susan i shouldnt well im not quite my normal i guess come on time old doc marston saw that arm i made her cradle the broken forearm in her right hand helped her to her feet and caught her by the good arm to help steady her on that heaving deck the blind leading the blind when we reached the forward break of the well deck i made her sit in the comparative shelter there while i went into the bosuns store it took me only seconds to find what i wanted two coils of nylon rope which i stuck into a canvas bag and a short length of thicker manilla i closed the door left the bag beside susan and staggered across the sliding treacherous decks to the port side and tied the manilla to one of the guardrail stanchions i considered knotting the rope then decided against it macdonald whose idea this was had been confident that no one in this wild weather would notice so small a thing as a knot round the base of a stanchion and even if it were noticed carreras men would not be seamen enough to investigate and pull it in but anyone peering over the side and seeing the knots might have become very curious indeed i made the knot round that stanchion very secure indeed for there was going to depend on it the life of someone who mattered very much to myself ten minutes later we were back outside the sick bay i need not have worried about that sentry head bent low over his chest he was still far away in another world and showed no signs of leaving it i wondered how he would feel when he came to would he suspect he had been drugged would he put any unusual symptoms down to a combination of exhaustion and seasickness i decided i was worrying about nothing one sure guess i could make and that was that when the sentry awoke he would tell no one about his sleep miguel carreras struck me as the kind of man who might have a very short way indeed with sentries who slept on duty i took out the key id found on tony carreras and unlocked the door marston was at his desk the bosun and bullen were both sitting up in bed this was the first time id seen bullen conscious since hed been shot he was pale and haggard and obviously in considerable pain but he didnt look as if he were on his last legs it took a lot to kill off a man like bullen he gave me a long look that was pretty close to a glare well mister where the hell have you been normally with those words it would have come out like a rasp but his lung wound had softened his rasp to a hoarse whisper if id had the strength to grin id have done just that but i didnt have the strength there was hope for the old man yet a minute sir dr marston miss beresford has a i can see i can see how in the world did you manage close to us now he broke off and peered at me with his shortsighted eyes i would say john that youre in the more immediate need of attention me im all right oh you are are you he took susan by her good arm and led her into the dispensary he said over his shoulder seen yourself in a mirror recently i looked in a mirror i could see his point balenciagas werent bloodproof the whole of the left side of my head face and neck was covered in blood that had soaked through hood and mask matted in thick dark blood that even the rain hadnt been able to remove the rain if anything had made it look worse than it really was it must all have come from tony carteras bloodstained shirt when id carried him up the ladder of number four hold itll wash off i said to bullen and the bosun its not mine thats from tony carreras carreras bullen stared at me then looked at macdonald in spite of the evidence in front of his eyes you could see that he thought id gone off my rocker what do you mean i mean what i say tony carreras i sat heavily on a chair and gazed down vacantly at my soaking clothes maybe captain bullen wasnt so far wrong i felt an insane desire to laugh i knew it was a climbing hysteria that came from weakness from overexhaustion from mounting fever from expending too much emotion in too short a time and i had to make a physical effort to fight it down i killed him tonight down in number four hold youre mad bullen said flatly you dont know what youre saying dont i i looked at him then away again ask susan beresford mr carters telling the truth sir macdonald said quietly my knife sir did you bring it back i nodded rose wearily hobbled across to macdonalds bed and handed him the knife id had no chance to clean it the bosun said nothing just handed it to bullen who stared down at it for long unspeaking moments im sorry my boy he said at length his voice was husky damnably sorry but weve been worried to death i grinned faintly it was an effort even to do that so was i sir so was i all in your own good time bullen said encouragingly i think mr carter should tell us later sir macdonald suggested hes got to clean himself up get those wet clothes off and into bed if anyone comes right bosun right you could see that even so little talk was exhausting him better hurry my boy yes i looked vaguely at the bag id brought with me ive got the ropes there archie let me have them sir he took the bag pulled out the two coils of rope pulled the pillow from his lower pillowcase stuffed the ropes inside and placed them under his top pillow good a place as any sir if they really start searching theyre bound to find it anyway now if youd just be dropping this pillow and bag out the window i did that stripped washed dried myself as best i could and climbed into bed just as marston came into the bay shell be all right john simple fracture all wrapped up and in her blankets and shell be asleep in a minute sedatives you know i nodded you did a good job tonight doctor boy outside is still asleep and i hardly felt a thing in my leg it was only half a lie and there was no point in hurting his feelings unnecessarily i glanced down at my leg the splints ill fix them right away he fixed them not more than half killing me in the process and while he was doing so i told them what had happened or part of what had happened i told them the encounter with tony carreras was the result of an attempt id made to spike the gun on the afterdeck with old bullen talking away nonstop in his sleep any mention of the twister would not have been clever at all at the end of it all after a heavy silence bullen said hopelessly its finished its all finished all that work and suffering for nothing all for nothing it wasnt finished it wasnt going to be finished ever not till either miguel carreras or myself was finished if i were a betting man id have staked the last cent of my fortune on carreras i didnt say that to them i told them instead of the simple plan i had in mind an unlikely plan concerned with taking over the bridge at gun point but it wasnt half as hopeless and desperate as the plan i really had in mind the one id tell archie macdonald about later again i couldnt tell the old man for again the chances were heavy that he would have betrayed it in his halfdelirious muttering under sedation i hadnt even liked to mention tony carreras but the blood had to be explained away when i finished bullen said in his hoarse whisper im still the captain of the ship i will not permit it good god mister look at the weather look at your condition i will not allow you to throw your life away i cannot permit it thank you sir i know what you mean but you have to permit it you must because if you dont what if someone comes into the sick bay when youre not here he asked helplessly hed accepted the inevitable this i produced a gun and tossed it to the bosun this was tony carreras there are still seven shots in the magazine thank you sir macdonald said quietly ill be very careful with those shots but yourself man bullen demanded huskily how about yourself give me back that knife archie i said chapter i slept that night and slept deeply as deeply almost as tony carreras i had neither sedatives nor sleeping pills exhaustion was the only drug i needed coming awake next morning was a long slow climb from the depths of a bottomless pit i was climbing in the dark but in the strange way of dreams i wasnt climbing and it wasnt dark some great beast had me in his jaws and was trying to shake the life out of me a tiger but no ordinary tiger a sabretoothed tiger the kind that had passed from the surface of the earth a million years ago so i kept on climbing in the dark and the sabretoothed tiger kept on shaking me like a terrier shaking a rat and i knew that my only hope was to reach the light above but i couldnt see any light then all of a sudden the light was there my eyes were open and miguel carreras was bending over me and shaking my shoulder with no gentle hand i would have preferred the sabretoothed tiger any day marston stood at the other side of the bed and when he saw i was awake he caught me under the arms and lifted me gently to a sitting position i did my best to help him but i wasnt concentrating on it i was concentrating on the lipbiting and eyeclosing so that carreras couldnt miss how far through i was marston was protesting he shouldnt be moved mr carreras he really shouldnt be moved hes in constant pain and i repeat that major surgery is essential at the earliest possible moment it was about forty years too late now i supposed for anyone to point out to marston that he was a born actor no question in my mind now but that that was what he should have been the gain to both the thespian and medical worlds would have been incalculable i rubbed the sleep from my eyes and smiled wanly why dont you say it outright doctor amputation is what you mean he looked at me gravely then went away without saying anything i looked across at bullen and macdonald both of them were awake both of them carefully not looking in my direction and then i looked at carreras at first glance he looked exactly the same as he had a couple of days ago at first glance that was a second and closer inspection showed the difference a slight pallor under the tan a reddening of the eyes a tightening of the face that had not been there before he had a chart under his left arm a slip of paper in his left hand well i sneered hows the big bold pirate captain this morning my son is dead he said dully i hadnt expected it to come like this or so soon but the very unexpectedness of it helped me to the right reaction the reaction he would probably expect from me anyway i stared at him through slightly narrowed eyes and said hes what dead miguel carreras whatever else he lacked unquestionably had all the normal instincts of a parent a father the very intensity of his restraint showed how badly he had been hit for a moment i felt genuinely sorry for him for a very short moment then i saw the faces of wilson and jamieson and benson and brownell and dexter the faces of all those dead men and i wasnt sorry any more dead i repeated shocked puzzlement but not too much shock it wouldnt be expected of me your son dead how can he be dead what did he die of almost of its own volition before i suddenly checked the movement my hand started reaching for the clasp knife under the pillow not that it would have made much difference even if he had seen it five minutes in the dispensary steriliser had removed the last of the traces of blood i dont know he shook his head and i felt like cheering there were no traces of suspicion in his face i dont know dr marston i said surely you we havent been able to find him he has disappeared disappeared it was captain bullen making his contribution and his voice sounded a shade stronger a little less husky than it had the previous night vanished a man just cant vanish aboard a ship like that mr carreras we spent over two hours searching the ship my son is not aboard the campari when did you last see him mr carter i didnt indulge in guilty starts sharp upward glances or anything daft like that i wondered what his reactions would have been if id said when i heaved him over the side of the campari last night instead i pursed my lips and said after dinner last night when he came here he didnt linger said something like captain carreras making his rounds and left that is correct id sent him to make a tour of inspection how did he look not his usual self green seasick my son was a poor sailor carreras acknowledged it is possible you said he was making rounds i interrupted of the whole ship decks and everything that is so did you have life lines rigged on the fore and after decks no i had not thought it necessary well i said grimly theres your possible answer your probable answer no life lines nothing to hang on to felt ill ran for the side a sudden lurch i left the sentence hanging it is possible but not in character he had an exceptional sense of balance balance doesnt help much if you slip on a wet deck quite i also havent ruled out the possibility of foul play foul play i stared at him duly grateful that the gift of telepathy is so very limited with all the crew and passengers under guard lock and key how is foul play possible unless i added thoughtfully theres a nigger in your own woodpile i have not yet completed my investigations the voice was cold the subject was closed and miguel carreras was back in business again bereavement wouldnt crush this man however much he might inwardly mourn his son it wouldnt in the slightest detract from his efficiency or his ruthless determination to carry out exactly the plans he had made it wasnt for instance going to make the slightest difference to his plans to send us all into orbit the following day signs of humanity there might be but the abiding fundamental in carreras character was an utter an allexcluding fanaticism that was all the more dangerous in that it lay so deeply hidden beneath the smooth urbanity of the surface the chart carter he handed it across to me along with paper giving a list of fixes let me know if the fort ticonderoga is on course and if she is running on time we can later calculate our time of interception if and when i get a fix this morning youll get a fix bullen assured him huskily they say the devil is good to his own carreras and hes been good to you youre running out of the hurricane and youll have clear patches of sky by noon rain later in the evening but first clearing you are sure captain bullen you are sure we are running out of the hurricane im sure or rather the hurricane is running away from us old bullen was an authority on hurricanes and would lecture on his pet subject at the drop of a hat even to carreras even when a hoarse whisper was all the voice he could summon neither wind nor sea have moderated very muchand they certainly hadntbut what matters is the direction of the wind its from the northwest now which means that the hurricane lies to the northeast of us it passed us by to the east on our starboard hand sometime during the night moving northwards then suddenly swung northeast quite often when a hurricane reaches the northern limits of its latitude and then is caught up by the westerlies it can remain stationary at its point of recurvature for twelve or twentyfour hourswhich would have meant that you would have had to sail through it but you had the luck it recurved and moved to the east almost without a break bullen lay back close to exhaustion even so little had been too much for him you can tell all this just lying in your bed there carreras demanded bullen gave him the commodores look he would have given any cadet who dared question his knowledge and ignored him the weather is going to moderate carreras persisted thats obvious isnt it carreras nodded slowly making his rendezvous in time and being able to transship the gold had been his two great worries and now both of them were gone he turned abruptly walked out of the sick bay bullen cleared his throat and said formally in his strained whisper congratulations mr carter you are the most fluent liar ive ever known macdonald just grinned the forenoon the afternoon came and went the sun duly appeared as bullen had prophesied and later disappeared also as he had prophesied the sea moderated although not much not enough i guessed to alleviate the sufferings of our passengers and the wind stayed where it was out of the northwest bullen under sedation slept nearly all day once again relapsing into his incoherent mumblingsnone of them i was relieved to note were about tony carreras while macdonald and i talked or slept but we didnt sleep before i told him what i hoped to do that night whenor if i managed to get loose on the upper deck susan i hardly saw that day she made her appearance after breakfast with her arm in plaster and in a sling there was no danger of this arousing any suspicion even in a mind like carreras the story was to be that she had gone to sleep in a chair been flung out of it during the storm and sprained her wrist such accidents were so commonplace in heavy weather that no one would think to raise an eyebrow about ten oclock in the morning she asked to be allowed to join her parents in the drawing room and stayed there all day fifteen minutes after noon carreras appeared again if his investigations into possible foul play connected with his sons death had made any progress he made no mention of it he did not even refer to the disappearance again he had the inevitable charttwo of them this timewith him and the noon position of the campari seemingly hed managed to get a good fix from the sun our position our speed their position their speed and our respective courses do we intercept at the point marked x i suppose youve already worked it out for yourself i have we dont intercept i said after a few minutes at our present speed we should arrive at your rendezvous in between eleven and eleven and a half hours say midnight five hours ahead of schedule thank you mr carter my own conclusion exactly the fivehour wait for the ticonderoga wont take long in passing i felt a queer sensation in my middle the phrase about a persons heart sinking may not be physiologically accurate but it described the feeling accurately this would ruin everything completely destroy what little chance my plan ever had of succeeding but i knew the consternation did not show in my face planning on arriving there at midnight and hanging round till the fly walks into your parlour i shrugged well youre the man whos making the decisions what do you mean by that he asked sharply nothing much i said indifferently its just that i would have thought that you would want your crew at the maximum stage of efficiency for transshipping the gold when we met the fort ticonderoga so so theres still going to be a heavy sea running in twelve hours time when we stop at the rendezvous the campari is going to lie in the trough of the seas and in the elegant phrase of our times roll her guts out i dont know how many of that crowd of landlubbers you have along with you were seasick last night but ill bet there will be twice as many tonight and dont think our stabilisers are going to save you they depend upon the factor of the ships speed for their effect a welltaken point he agreed calmly i shall reduce speed aim at being there about four am he looked at me with sudden speculation remarkably cooperative full of helpful suggestions curiously out of the estimate i had formed of your character which only goes to show how wrong your estimate is my friend common sense and selfinterest explain it i want to get into a proper hospital as soon as possiblethe prospect of going through life with one leg doesnt appeal the sooner i see passengers crew and myself transferred aboard the ticonderoga the happier ill be only a fool kicks against the pricks i know a fait accompli when i see one you are going to transfer us all aboard the ticonderoga arent you carreras i shall have no further use for any member of the camparis crew far less for the passengers he smiled thinly captain teach and blackbeard are not my ideals mr carter i should like to be remembered as a humane pirate you have my word that all of you will be transferred in safety and unharmed the last sentence had the ring of truth and sincerity because it was true and sincere it was the truth but it wasnt of course the whole truth hed left out the bit about our being blown out of existence half an hour later about seven oclock in the evening susan beresford returned and marston left under guard to dispense pills and soothing words to the passengers in the drawing room many of whom were after twentyfour hours of continuously heavy weather understandably not feeling at their best susan looked tired and paleno doubt the emotional and physical suffering of the previous night together with the pain from her broken arm accounted for thatbut i had to admit for the first time in an unbiassed fashion that she also looked very lovely id never before realised that auburn hair and green eyes were a combination that couldnt be matched but possibly this was because id never before seen an auburn haired girl with green eyes she was also tense nervous and jumpy as a cat unlike old doc marston and myself shed never have made it in the method school she came softly to my bedsidebullen was still under sedation and macdonald either asleep or dozingand sat down on a chair after id asked her how she was and how the passengers were and shed asked me how i was and id told her and she hadnt believed me she said suddenly johnny if everything goes all right will you get another ship i dont follow well she said impatiently if the camparis blown up and we get away or if were saved some other way will you i see i suppose i would youll like that getting back to sea again this was a crazy conversation but she was only whistling in the dark i said i dont think ill be back to sea again somehow giving in giving up a different thing altogether i dont want to spend the rest of my life catering to the whims of wealthy passengers i dont include the beresford family father mother and daughter she smiled at this going into the weird routine of melting the green in her eyes the kind of smile that could have a very serious effect on the constitution of a sick man like myself so i looked away and went on im a pretty fair mechanic and ive a bit of cash put away theres a very nice flourishing little garage down in kent that i can take over any time i want and archie macdonald there is an outstanding mechanic wed make a pretty fair team i think have you asked him yet what chance have i had i said irritably ive only just thought about it youre pretty good friends arent you good enough whats that got to do with anything nothing just nothing funny thats all theres the bosun hell never walk properly again nobody will want him at sea any more hes probably got no qualifications for any decent job on landespecially with that legand all of a sudden chief officer carter gets tired of the sea and decides its not that way at all i interrupted youve got it all wrong probably probably she agreed im not very clever but you dont have to worry about him anyway daddy told me this afternoon that hes got a job for him oh i took a chance and looked at her eyes again what kind of job a storeman a storeman i know i sounded disappointed but id have sounded ten times as disappointed if i had been able to take all this seriously if id been able to share her belief that there was a future well its kind of him nothing wrong with a storeman but i just dont see archie macdonald as one thats all especially not in america will you listen she asked sweetly a touch of the miss beresford that was im listening youve heard that daddys building a big refinery in the west of scotland storage tanks own port to take goodness knows how many tankers ive heard well thats the place stores for the oil port and the refinery millions and millions of dollars of stores daddy says with goodness knows how many men to look after them and your friend in charge with a dream house attached that is a very different proposition altogether i think it sounds wonderful susan just wonderful its terribly kind of you not me she protested daddy look at me say that without blushing she looked at me she blushed with those green eyes the effect was devastating i thought about my constitution again and looked away and then i heard her saying daddy wants you to be the manager of the new oil port so then you and the bosun would be in business together after all wouldnt you i turned slowly and stared at her i said slowly was that the job he meant when he asked me if id like to work for him of course and you didnt give him a chance to tell you do you think hed given up he hadnt really started you dont know my father and you cant claim id anything to do with it either i didnt believe her i said i cant tell you howwell how grateful i am its a terrific chance i know and admit if you see your father again this evening thank him very much indeed from me her eyes were shining id never seen a girls eyes shining for me before not in this way then youllthen youll and tell him no and tell him its a foolish thing to have pride perhaps but ive still got a little left i hadnt meant my voice to sound so harsh it just came out that way whatever job ill get ill get the one i found for myself not one bought for me by a girl as a thumbsdown on a genuine and generous offer i reflected bitterly the refusal could have been more graciously phrased she looked at me her face suddenly very still said oh johnny in a curiously muffled voice turned and buried her face half on the pillow half on the sheets her shoulders heaving sobbing as if her heart would break i didnt feel good at all i could have walked under a five barred gate without opening it i reached and touched her head awkwardly and said im terribly sorry susan but just because i turn down its not that its not that she shook her head in the pillow voice more muffled than ever it was all make believe no not that everything i said was true but just for a few moments wewell we werent here wewe were away from the campari it was something that had nothing to do with the campari youyou understand i stroked her hair yes susan i understand i didnt know what she was talking about it was like a dream i didnt see where she came into the dream in the future awayaway from this dreadful ship and then you burst the dream and were back on the campari and no one knows what the ends to be except usmummy daddy all of them carreras has them believing their lives will be spared she sobbed again then said between sobs oh my dear were just kidding ourselves its all over everythings over forty armed men and theyre prowling all over the ship i saw them double guards everywherethere are two outside this door and every door locked theres no hope theres no hope mummy daddy you me all of usthis time tomorrow it will all be over miracles dont happen any more its not all over susan id never make a salesman i thought drearily if i met a man dying of thirst in the sahara i couldnt have convinced him that water was good for him its never all over but that didnt sound any better than my first attempt i heard the creak of springs and saw macdonald propped up on one elbow thick black eyebrows raised in puzzlement and concern the sound of her crying must have wakened him its all right archie i said just a bit upset thats all im sorry she straightened herself and turned her tearstained face in the bosuns direction her breath was coming in the quick short indrawn gasps that are the aftermath of crying im terribly sorry i woke you up but there is no hope is there mr macdonald archie will do for me the bosun said gravely well archie she tried to smile at him through her tears im just a terrible coward and you spending all day with your parents and never once being able to tell them what you know what kind of cowardice do you call that miss macdonald said reproachfully youre not answering me she said in tearful accusation i am a west highlander miss beresford macdonald said slowly i have the gift of my ancestors a black gift at times that id rather be without but i have it i can see what comes tomorrow or the day after tomorrow not often but at times i can you cannot will the second sight to come but come it does i have seen what is to come many times in the past few years and mr carter there will tell you that i have never once been wrong this was the first i had ever heard of it he was as fluent a liar as myself everything is going to turn out well do you think so do you really think so there was hope in her voice now hope in her eyes that slow measured speech of macdonalds the rocklike steadiness of the dark eyes in that sunweathered face bespoke a confidence a certainty an unshakeable belief that was most impressive there now i thought was a man who would have made a great salesman i dont think miss beresford again the grave smile i know our troubles are almost at their end do what i do put your last cent on mr carter here he even had me convinced i too knew that everything was going to turn out just fine until i remembered who he was depending on me i gave susan a handkerchief and said go and tell archie about that job youre not going to trust your life to that thing there was horror in susans face panic in her voice as she watched me tie a bowline round my waist why its no thicker than my little finger i could hardly blame her that thin three stranded rope no bigger than an ordinary clothesline was hardly calculated to inspire confidence in anyone it didnt inspire much in me even although i did know its properties its nylon miss macdonald explained soothingly the very rope mountaineers use in the himalayasand you dont think theyd trust their lives to anything they werent dead sure of you could hang a big motorcar on the end of this and it still wouldnt break susan gave him her its allright for you to talk when itsnot your life thats depending onit look bit her lip and said nothing the time was exactly midnight if id read the clock dial settings on the twister properly six hours was the maximum delayed action that could be obtained assuming carreras rendezvoused exactly on time at am it would be at least another hour before he could get clear so the twister wouldnt be armed until after midnight everything was ready the sickbay door had been cautiously locked on the inside with the key id taken from tony carreras so that neither of the two guards could burst in unexpectedly in the middle of things and even if they did get suspicious and force an entrance macdonald had a gun macdonald himself was now sitting at the top of my bed beside the window marston and i had half carried him there from his own bed his left leg was quite useless like myself hed been given an injection by doc marston to deaden the pain mine being twice as powerful as the previous nights dose but then macdonald was not going to be called upon to use his leg that night only his arms and shoulders and there was nothing wrong with macdonalds arms and shoulders they were the strongest on the campari i had the feeling i was going to need all their strength only macdonald knew the purpose i had in mind only macdonald knew that i intended returning the way i went the others believed in my suicidal plan for an attack on the bridge believed if i were successful i would be returning via the sickbay door but they didnt believe i would return at all the atmosphere was less than festive bullen was awake now lying flat on his back his face silent and grim i was dressed in the same dinner suit as id worn the previous night it was still damp still crusted with blood id no shoes on the clasp knife was in one pocket oil skin wrapped torch in the other the mask round my face hood over my head my leg ached i felt as a man feels after a long bout of flu and the fever still burned in my blood but i was as ready as i was ever going to be lights i said to marston a switch clicked and the sick bay was as dark as the tomb i drew back the curtains pulled open the window and secured it on the latch i stuck my head outside it was raining steadily heavily a cold driving rain out of the northwest slanting straight in through the window on to the bed the sky was black with no star above the campari still pitched a little rolled a little but it was nothing compared to the previous night she was doing about twelve knots i twisted my neck and peered upwards no one there i leaned out as far as possible and looked fore and aft if there was a light showing on the campari that night i couldnt see it i came inside stooped picked up a coil of nylon rope checked that it was the one secured to the iron bedstead and flung it out into the rain and the darkness i made a last check of the rope knotted round my waistthis was the one the bosun held in his handsand said im off as a farewell speech it could perhaps have been improved upon but it was all i could think of at the time captain bullen said good luck my boy hed have said an awful lot more if he knew what i really had in mind marston said something i couldnt catch susan said nothing at all i wriggled my way through the window favouring my wounded leg and then was fully outside suspended from the sill by my elbows i could sense rather than see the bosun by the window ready to pay out the rope round my waist archie i said softly give me that spiel again the one about how everything is going to turn out all right youll be here again before we know youre gone he said cheerfully see and bring my knife back i felt for the rope attached to the bed got it in both hands eased my elbows off the sill and dropped quickly hand over hand as macdonald played out my life line five seconds later i was in the water the water was dark and cold and it took my breath away after the warmth of the sick bay the shock of the almost immediate transition the abrupt drop in temperature was literally paralysing momentarily involuntarily i lost my grip on the rope panicked when i realised what had happened floundered about desperately and caught it again the bosun was doing a good job above the sudden increase in weight as id lost my life line must have had him halfway out of the window but the cold wasnt the worst if you can survive the initial shock you can tolerate the cold to a limited degree accustomed but not reconciled what you cant tolerate what you cant become accustomed to is the involuntary swallowing of large mouthfuls of salt water every few seconds and that was what was happening to me i had known that being towed alongside a ship doing twelve knots wasnt going to be any too pleasant but i had never thought it was going to be as bad as this the factor i hadnt taken into the reckoning was the waves one moment i was being towed face down and planing up the side of a wave the next as the wave swept by under me i was almost completely out of the water then falling forwards and down wards to smash into the rising shoulder of the next wave with a jarring violence that knocked all the breath from my body and when all the breath has been driven from you the bodys demands that you immediately gulp in air are insistent imperative and not to be denied but with my face buried in the sea i wasnt gulping in air i was gulping down large quantities of salt water it was like having water under high pressure forced down my throat by a hose i was floundering porpoising twisting and spinning exactly like a hooked fish being pulled in on the surface through the wake of a fasttrolling motorboat slowly but very surely i was drowning i was beaten before i started i knew i had to get back and at once i was gasping and choking on sea water my nostrils were on fire with it my stomach was full of it my throat burned with it and i knew that at least some of it had already reached my lungs a system of signals had been arranged and now i began to tug frantically on the rope round my waist hanging on to the other rope with my left hand i tugged half a dozen times slowly in some sort of order at first then as no response came frantically despairingly i was porpoising up and down so violently that all macdonald could be feeling anyway was a constant and irregular series of alternate tightenings and slackenings of the line he had no means of distinguishing between one type of tug and another i tried to pull myself back on my own line but against the onrushing pressure of the water as the campari ploughed through that stormy sea it was quite impossible when the tension came off the line round my waist it needed all the strength of both my hands just to hang on to the life line without being swept away with all the strength and desperation that was in me i tried to edge forward an inch but i couldnt even make that inch and i knew i couldnt hang on much longer salvation came by sheer chance no credit to me one particularly heavy wave had twisted me round till i was on my back and in this position i fell into the next trough and hit the following wave with back and shoulders followed the inevitable explosive release of air from my lungs the just as inevitable sucking in of fresh airand this time i found i could breathe air rushed into my lungs not water i could breathe lying on my back like this half lifted out of the water by my grip on the life line and with my head bent forward almost to my chest between my overhead arms my face remained clear of the water and i could breathe i wasted no time but went hand over hand down the life line as fast as macdonald paid out the rope about my waist i was still swallowing some water but not enough to matter after about fifteen seconds i took my left hand off the life line and started scraping it along the side of the ship feeling for the rope id left dangling over the side of the afterdeck last night the life line was now sliding through my right hand and wet though it was it was burning the skin of my palm but i hardly noticed it i had to find that manilla id left tied to the guardrail stanchion if i didnt then it was curtains not only would the hopes of my carrying out my plan be at an end it would be the end for me also macdonald and i had had to act on the assumption that the rope would be there and no attempt would be made to pull me back until he got the clear prearranged signal that it was time to begin just that and to make any such clear signal while in the water i had discovered was impossible if the manilla wasnt there id just be towed along at the end of that nylon rope until i was drowned nor would that take long the salt water id swallowed the violent buffeting of the waves the blows id suffered from being flung a score of times against the iron walls of the campari the loss of blood and my injured legall those had taken their frightening toll and i was dangerously weak it would not be long my left hand brushed against the manilla i grabbed it a drowning man seizing the last straw in the wide endless expanse of the ocean tucking the life line through the rope round my waist i over armed myself up the manilla till i was all but clear of the water wrapped my one good leg round the rope and hung there gasping like an exhausted dog shivering and then being violently sick as i brought up all the sea water that had collected in my stomach after that i felt better but weaker than ever i started to climb i hadnt far to go twenty feet and id be there but i hadnt gone two feet before i was bitterly regretting the fact that i hadnt followed my impulse of the previous night and knotted the manilla the manilla was soaking wet and slippery and i had to clasp tight with all the strength of my hands to get any purchase at all and there was little enough strength left in my hands my aching forearm muscles were exhausted from clinging so long and so desperately to the life line my shoulders were just as far gone even when i could get a good purchase even when my weakening hands didnt slide down the rope when i put all my weight on them i could till pull myself up only two or three inches at a time three inches no more that was all i could manage at one time i couldnt make it reasons instinct logic common sense il told me that i couldnt make it but i made it the last two feet of the climb was something out of a dark nightmare hauling myself up two inches slipping back an inch hauling myself up again and always creeping nearer the top three feet from the top i stopped i knew i was only that distance way from safety but to climb another inch on that rope was something i knew i could never do arms shaking from the strain shoulders on fire with agony i hauled my body up until my eyes were level with knotted hands even in that almost pitchy darkness i could see the faint white blur of my gleaming knuckles for a second i hung there then flung my right hand desperately upwards if i missed the coaming of the scuppers but i couldnt miss it i had no more strength in me i could never make such an effort again i didnt miss it the top joint of my middle finger hooked over the coaming and locked there then my other hand was beside it i was scrabbling desperately for the lowermost bar in the guardrails i had to get it over and over at once or id fall back into the sea i found the bar had both hands on it swung my body convulsively to the right till my sound foot caught the coaming reached up to the next bar reached the teak rail half dragged half slid my body over the top and fell heavily on the deck on the other side how long i lay there trembling violently in every weary muscle in my body whooping hoarsely for the breath my tortured lungs were craving gritting my teeth against the fire in my shoulders and arms and trying not to let the red mist before my eyes envelop me completely i do not know it may have been two minutes it may have been ten somewhere during that time i was violently ill again and then slowly ever so slowly the pain eased a little my breathing slowed and the mists before my eyes cleared away but i still couldnt stop trembling it was well for me that no fiveyearold happened along the deck that night he could have had me over the side without taking his hands out of his pockets i untied the ropes from my waist with numbed and fumbling and all but useless hands tied them both to the stanchion just above the manilla pulled the life line till it was almost taut then gave three sharp deliberate tugs a couple of minutes passed then came three clearly defined answering tugs they knew now i had made it i hoped they felt better about it than i did not that that would be hard i sat there for at least another five minutes till some measure of strength came back to me rose shakily to my feet and padded across the deck to number four hold the tarpaulin on the starboard forward corner was still secured that meant there was no one down below but i really hadnt expected them to be there yet i straightened looked all round me then stood very still the driving rain streaming down my sodden mask and soaking clothes not fifteen yards away from me right aft i had seen a red glow come and vanish in the darkness ten seconds passed then the glow again id heard of waterproof cigarettes but not all that waterproof but someone was smoking a cigarette no question about that like falling thistledown only quieter i drifted down in the direction of the glow i was still trembling but you cant hear trembling twice i stopped to line up direction and distance by that glowing cigarette and finally stopped less than ten feet away from it my mind was hardly working at all or id never have dared to do it a carless flick of a torch beam say and it would have been all over but no one flicked a torch the red glow came again and i could now just make out that the smoker wasnt standing in the rain he was in the vshaped entrance of a tarpaulin a big tarpaulin draped over some big object the gun of course the gun that carreras had mounted on the afterdeck with the tarpaulin serving the dual purpose of protecting the mechanism from the rain and concealing it from any other vessel they might have passed during the day i heard the murmur of voices not the smoker but another two crouched somewhere inside the shelter of the tarpaulin that meant three people there three people guarding the gun carreras was certainly taking no chances with that gun but why so many as three you didnt need three then i had it carreras hadnt just been talking idly when hed spoken of the possibility of foul play in connection with the death of his son he did suspect it but his cold logical mind had told him that neither crew nor passengers of the campari could have been responsible if his son had met death by violence then death could only have come from one of his own men the renegade who had killed his son might strike again might attempt to ruin his plans and so three men on guard together they could watch each other i left skirted the hatch and made my way to the bosuns store i fumbled round in the darkness found what i wanted a heavy marlinespike and then was on my way marlinespike in one hand macdonalds knife in the other dr carolines cabin was in darkness i was pretty sure that the windows were uncurtained but i left my torch where it was susan had said that carreras men were prowling round the decks that night the chance wasnt worth it and if dr caroline wasnt already in number four hold then the chances were high indeed that he would only be in one other place in his bed and bound to it hand and foot i climbed up to the next deck and padded along to the wireless office my breathing and pulse were almost back to normal now the shaking had eased and i could feel the strength slowly flooding back into my arms and shoulders apart from the constant dull ache in my neck where the sandbag merchant and tony carreras had been at work the only pain i felt was a sharp burning in my left thigh where the salt water had got into the open wounds without the anaesthetic id have been doing a war dance on one leg of course the wireless office was in darkness i leaned my ear against the door straining to hear the slightest sound from inside and was just reaching out a delicate hand for the doorknob when i just about had a heart attack a telephone bell had gone off with a shatteringly metallic loudness not six inches from the ear id so hard pressed against the door it jarred me rigid for all of five seconds lots wife couldnt even have hoped to compete with me then i pussyfooted silently across the deck into the shelter of one of the life boats i heard the vague murmur of someone talking on the telephone saw the light come on in the wireless office the door open and a man come out before he switched off the light i saw two things i saw him bring a key from his righthand trouser pocket and i saw who it was the artist with the machine gun who had killed tommy wilson and cut down all the rest of us if i had to settle any more accounts that night i hoped bleakly it would be with this man he closed the door locked it and went down the ladder to a deck below i followed him to the top of the ladder and stayed there there was another man at the foot of the ladder lit torch in hand just outside dr carolines cabin and in the backwash of light from the cabin bulkhead i could see who it was carreras himself there were two other men close by and i could distinguish neither of them but i was certain that one of them would be dr caroline they were joined by the radio operator and the four men moved off aft i never thought of going after them i knew where they were going ten minutes that was the detail the news broadcast about the disappearance of the twister had mentioned there were only one or two men who could arm the twister and it couldnt be done in less than ten minutes i wondered vaguely if caroline knew he had only ten minutes to live and that was all the time i had to do what i had to do it wasnt long i was coming down the ladder while carreras swinging torch was still in sight three quarters of the way down three steps from the bottom i froze into immobility two men leaning into that driving rain their black blurred shapes were barely distinguishable but i knew it was two men because of the low murmur of voiceswere approaching the foot of the ladder armed menthey were bound to be armed almost certainly with the ubiquitous tommy gun which seemed the standard weapon among the generalissimos henchmen they were at the foot of the ladder now i could feel the ache in my hands from the tension of my grip round marlinespike and opened clasp knife then suddenly they went veering off to the right round the side of the ladder i could have reached out and touched them both i could see them almost clearly now clearly enough to see that both had beards and had i not been wearing the black hood and mask they would have been bound to see the white glimmer of my face how they didnt even see my shape standing there on the third bottom step was beyond me the only reason i could think of was that they both had their heads lowered against the driving rain seconds later i was inside the central passageway of a accommodation i hadnt poked my head round the outside passage door to see if the land was clear after that escape id felt that nothing mattered id just walked straight inside the passageway was empty the first door on the right the one opposite carolines was the entrance to carreras suite i tried the door locked i walked down the passage to where benson the dead chief steward had had his cubicle hoping that the luxurious carpet underfoot was absorbent enough to soak up the water that was almost cascading off me white bensons successor would have had a blue fit if he could have seen the damage i was doing the master key to the passengers suites was in its secret little cubbyhole i removed it went back to carreras cabin unlocked the door and went inside locking it behind me the lights were on throughout the suite carreras probably hadnt bothered to switch them off when hed left he wasnt paying for the electricity i went through the cabins sending each door in turn flying open with the sole of my stockinged foot nothing no one i had one bad moment when i entered carreras own sleeping cabin and saw this desperate hooded crouched figure dripping water hands clenched round weapons with wide staring eyes and blood dripping down beside the left eye myself in a looking glass i had seen prettier sights i hadnt been aware that id been cut i supposed it must have been the result of one of the many knocks id had against the side of the campari opening up the wound in my head carreras had boasted that he had a complete loading plan of the fort ticonderoga in his cabin nine minutes now maybe even less where in the name of god would he keep the plan i went through dressing tables wardrobes lockers cupboards bedside tables nothing nothing seven minutes where where would he keep it think carter for heavens sake think maybe caroline was getting on with the arming of the twister faster than anyone had thought possible how did anyone know as the broadcast had said that it took all of ten minutes to arm it if the twister was such a secret and until it had been stolen it had been such a toppriority hush hush secret that no member of the public had known of its existenceow did anyone know it took ten minutes to arm it how could anyone know maybe all it required was a twist here a turn there maybemaybe he was finished already maybe i put those thoughts to one side drove them out of my mind crushed them ruthlessly that way lay panic and defeat i stood stockstill and forced myself to think calmly dispassionately i had been looking in all the most obvious places but should i have been looking in the obvious places after all id gone through this cabin once before looking for a radio id gone through it pretty thoroughly and i hadnt seen any signs he would have it hidden of course he would have it hidden he wouldnt have taken a chance on anyone finding it such as the steward whose daily duty it was to clean out his cabin before his men had taken over the ship no stewards on duty now of course but then he probably hadnt bothered to shift it since the takeover where would he have hidden it where a steward wouldnt stumble across it that ruled out all the furniture fittings all the places id wasted time in searching it also ruled out bed blankets mattresses but not the carpet the ideal hiding place for a sheet of paper i almost threw myself at the carpet rn his sleeping cabin the carpets in the camparis accommodation were secured by pressbutton studs for ease of quick removal i caught the corner of the carpet by the door ripped free a dozen studs and there it was right away six inches in from the edge a large sheet of canvas paper folded in four with tes fort ticonderoga most secret printed in one corner five minutes to go i stared at the paper until i had memorised its exact position relative to the carpet picked it up and smoothed it out diagrams of the ticonderoga with complete stowage plans of the cargo but all i was interested in was the deck cargo the plan showed crates stacked on both fore and aft decks and twenty of those on the foredeck were marked with a heavy red cross red for gold in a small careful hand carreras had written on the side all deck cargo crates identical in size gold in waterproof with welded steel boxes to float free in event of damage or sinking each crate equipped with yellow water stain i supposed this was some chemical which when it came into contact with salt water would stain the sea for a wide area around i read on gold crates indistinguishable from general cargo all crates stamped harms worth holden electrical engineering company stated contents generators and turbines forwarddeck cargo consigned to nashville tennessee exclusively turbines afterdeck cargo consigued to oak ridge tennessee exclusively generators so marked forward twenty crates on forward deck gold i didnt hurry time was desperately short but i didnt hurry i studied the plan which corresponded exactly to carreras observations and i studied the observations themselves until i knew i would never forget a word of them i folded and replaced the plan exactly as i had found it pressed the carpet snap studs back into place went swiftly through the cabins on a last check to ensure that i had left no trace of my passing there were none that i could see i locked the door and left the cold driving rain was falling more heavily than ever now slanting in across the port side drumming metallically against the bulkheads rebounding anklehigh off the polished wooden decks on the likely enough theory that carreras patrolling men would keep to the sheltered starboard side of the accommodation i kept to the opposite side as i hurried aft in my stockinged soles and wearing that black suit and mask no one could have heard or seen me at a distance of more than a few feet no one heard or saw me i heard or saw no one i made no attempt to look listen or exercise any caution at all i reached number four hold within two minutes of leaving carreras cabin i neednt have hurried carreras had made no attempt to replace the tarpaulin hed had to pull back in order to remove the battens and i could see straight down into the bottom of the hold four men down there two holding powerful electric lanterns carreras with a gun hanging by his side the lanky stooped form of dr slingsby caroline still wearing that ridiculous white wig askew on his head bent over the twister i couldnt see what he was doing it was like a nineteenthcentury print of grave robbers at work the tomb like depths of the hold the coffins the lanterns the feeling of apprehension and hurry and absorbed concentration that lent an evilly conspiratorial air as the elements were there and especially the element of tension an electric tension you could almost feel pulsating through the darkness of the night but a tension that came not from the fear of discovery but from the possibility that at any second something might go finally and cataclysmically wrong if it took ten minutes to arm the twister and obviously it took even longer than that then it must be a very tricky and complicated procedure altogether dr carolines mind it was a fair guess would be in no fit state to cope with tricky and complicated procedures hed be nervous probably badly scared his hands would be unsteady he was working probably with inadequate tools on an unstable platform by the light of unsteady torches and even though he might not be desperate enough or fool enough to jinx it deliberately there seemed to me as there obviously seemed to the men down in the hold that there was an excellent chance that his hand would slip instinctively i moved back a couple of feet until the opening of the hatch came between me and the scene below i couldnt see the twister any more that made me quite safe if it blew up i rose to my feet and made a couple of cautious circuits of e hatch the first close in the second further out but carreras had no prowlers there apart from the guards on e gun the afterdeck appeared to be completely deserted returned to the port forward corner of the hatch and settled own to wait i hoped i wouldnt have to wait too long the sea water ad been cold the heavy rain was cold the wind was cold was soaked to the skin and was recurringly and increasingly object to violent bouts of shivering shivering i could do nothing to control the fever ran fiercely in my blood maybe e thought of dr carolines hand slipping had something do with the shivering whatever the reason id be lucky get off with no more than pneumonia another five minutes and i took a second cautious peek own into the hold still at it i rose stretched and began to pace softly up and down to ward off the stiffness and cramp that was settling down on my body especially on the legs things went the way i hoped i couldnt afford to have stiffness anywhere if things went the way i hoped i peered down a third me into the hold and this time stayed in that stooped position unmoving dr caroline had finished under the watchful eye and gun of the radio operator he was screwing the brass plaqued lid back on the coffin while carreras and the other an had the lid already off the next coffin and were bent over it presumably fusing the conventional explosive inside probably it was intended as a standby in case of the malfunction of the twister or even more probably in the event the failure of the twisters timing mechanism it was designed to set it off by sympathetic detonation i didnt know i couldnt guess and for the moment i was not in the slightest worried the crucial moment had come the crucial moment for dr caroline i knew as he was bound to knowthat they couldnt afford to let him live hed done all they required of him he was of no further use to them he could die any moment now if they chose to put a gun to his head and murder him where he stood there was nothing in the world i could do about it nothing i would even try to do about it i would just have to stand there silently without movement or protest and watch him die for if i let dr caroline die without making any move to save him then only he would die but if i tried to save him and falled and with only a knife and marlinespike against two submachine guns and pistols the chances of failure were per centthen not only caroline but every member of the passengers and crew of the campari would die also the greatest good of the greatest number would they shoot him where he stood or would they do it on the upper deck logic said they would do it on the upper deck carreras would be using the campari for a few days yet he wouldnt be wanting a dead man lying in the hold and there would be no point in shooting him down there and then carrying him up above when he could make the climb under his own steam and be disposed of on the upper deck if i were carreras that is what i would have figured and that was how he did figure caroline tightened the last screw laid down the screw driver and straightened i caught a glimpse of his face white strained one eye twitching uncontrollably the radio operator said senor carreras carreras straightened turned looked at him then at caroline and nodded take him to his cabin carlos report here afterwards i moved back swiftly as a torch shone vertically upwards from the hold carlos was already climbing the ladder report here afterwards god id never thought of so obvious a possibility for a moment i panicked hands clenched on my pitiful weapons irresolute paralysed in thought and action without any justification whatsoever id had the picture firmly in mind of being able to dispose of carolines appointed executioner without arousing suspicion had carlos the radio operator been under instructions to knock off the unsuspecting caroline on the way forward then carry on himself to his wireless office then i might have disposed of him and hours might have passed before carreras got suspicious but now he was in effect saying take him up top shove him over the side and come back and tell me as soon as you have done so i could see the heavy rain slanting whitely through the wavering torch beam as carlos climbed swiftly up the ladder by the time he reached the top i was round the other side of the hatch coaming lying flat on the deck cautiously i hitched an eye over the top of the coaming carlos was standing upright on the deck now his torch shining down wards into the hold i saw dr carolines white head appear saw carlos move back a couple of steps and then caroline too was over the top a tall hunched figure pulling high his collar against the cold lash of the rain i heard but failed to understand a quick sharp command and then they were moving off diagonally caroline leading carlos with his torch on him from behind in the direction of the companionway leading up to b deck i rose to my feet remained immobile was carlos taking him back to his cabin after all had i been mistaken could it be i never finished the thought i was running after them as quickly as lightly as silently as the stiffness in my left leg would permit of course carlos was taking him in the direction of the companionway had he marched him straight towards the rail caroline would have known at once what awaited him would have turned and hurled himself against carlos with all the frantic savagery of a man who knows he is about to die five seconds only five seconds elapsed from the time i started running until i caught up with them five seconds far too short a time to think of the suicidal dangers involved far too short to think what would happen if carlos should swing his torch round if any of the three guards at the gun should happen to be watching this little procession if either carreras or his assistant in the hold should choose to look over the coaming to see how the problem of disposal was being attended to far too little time to figure out what i was going to do when i caught up with carlos and i was given no time to figure i was only three or four feet away when in the backwash of light from the torch i saw carlos reverse his grip on his tommy gun catch it by the barrel swing it up high over his head it had reached its highest point and was just started on the downswing when the bast of the heavy marlinespike caught him on the back of the neck with all my weight and fury behind it i heard something crack caught the tommy gun out of his suddenly nerveless hand before it could crash to the deck and made a grab for the torch i missed the torch struck the deck with a muffled thud it must have been a ships rubbercomposition issuerolled over a couple of times and came to rest its beam shining straight out over the edge of the ship carlos himself pitched heavily forward struck dr caroline and the two of them fell against the lower steps of the companionway keep quiet i whispered urgently keep quiet if you want to live i dived for the torch fumbled desperately for the switch couldnt find it stuck the glass face against my jacket to kill the beam finally located the switch and turned it off what in heavens name keep quiet i found the trigger on the automatic pistol and stood there stockstill staring aft into the darkness in the direction of both the hold and the gun striving to pierce the darkness listening as if my life depended on it which it did ten seconds i waited i had to move i couldnt afford to wait another ten seconds thirty seconds would have been enough and more for carlos to dispose of dr caroline a few seconds after that and carreras would start wondering what had happened to his trusty henchman i thrust gun and torch towards caroline found his hands in the darkness hold these i said softly what what is this an agonised whisper in the dark he was going to smash your head in now shut up you can still die im carter the chief officer id pulled carlos clear of the companionway where hed held caroline pinned by the legs and was going through his pockets as quickly as i could in the darkness the key the key to the wireless office id seen him take it from his righthand trouser pocket but it wasnt there any more the lefthand one not there either the seconds were rushing by desperately i tore at the patch pockets of his armytype blouse and i found it in the second pocket but id lost at least twenty seconds iss he dead caroline whispered are you worried stay here i shoved the key into a safe inner pocket caught the guard by his collar and started to drag him across the wet deck it was less than ten feet to the ships rail i dropped him located the hinged section of the teak rail fumbled for the catch released it swung the rail through degrees and snapped it back in its open position i caught the guard by his shoulders eased the upper part of his body over the second rail then tipped the legs high the splash he made couldnt have been heard thirty feet away certainly no one in number four hold or under the gun tarpaulin could possibly have heard anything i ran back to where dr caroline was sitting on the lower steps of the companionway maybe he was just obeying the order id given him but probably he was just too dazed to move anyway i said quick give me your wig what what my second guess had been right he was dazed your wig its no easy feat to shout in a whisper but i almost made it my wig but but its glued on i leaned forward twisted my fingers in the temporary thatch and tugged it was glued on all right the gasp of pain and the resistance offered to my hand showed he hadnt been kidding that wig felt as if it was riveted to his skull it was no night for half measures i clamped my left hand over his mouth and pulled savagely with my right a limpet the size of a soup plate couldnt have offered more resistance but it did come off i dont know how much pain there was in it for him but it certainly cost me plenty his teeth almost met through the heel of my palm the machine gun was still in his hand i snatched it away whirled and stopped motionless for the second time in a minute i could see rain slanting whitely through the vertical beam of a torch that meant only one thing someone was climbing up the ladder from the bottom of the hold i reached the ships side in three long steps placed the wig in the scuppers laid the gun on top of it raced back to the companionway jerked dr caroline to his feet and dragged him towards the bosuns store less than ten feet inboard from the companionway the door was still less than halfway shut when carreras appeared over the coaming but his torch wasnt pointing in our direction i closed the door silently until only a crack remained carreras was closely followed by another man also with a torch both of them headed for the ships side i saw the beam of carreras torch suddenly steady on the opened rail then heard the sharp exclamation as he bent forward and peered in the scuppers a moment later he was erect again examining the gun and the wig he held in his hand i heard him say something short and staccato repeated several times then he started talking rapidly to his companion but it was in spanish and i couldnt get it he then examined the inside of the wig indicated something with the torch beam shook his head in what might have been sorrow but was more probably exasperated anger flung the wig over the side and returned to the hold taking the tommy gun with him his companion followed our friend didnt seem too happy i murmured hes a devil a devil dr carolines voice was shaking only now was he beginning to realise the narrowness of his escape how closely death had brushed him by you heard him one of his own men dead and all he could call him was a crazy fool and he just laughed when the other man suggested they turn the ship to look for him you understand spanish pretty well he said something like just like that sadistic soandso to force caroline to open the rail so that he could see what was coming to him he thinks i turned on the guard grabbed his gun and that in the fight before we both went overboard my wig was torn off there was a handful of my hair sticking to the underside of the wig he says sorry about that dr caroline good god sorry you saved both our lives mine anyway sorry dr caroline i thought was a pretty strong nerved person he was recovering fast from the shock i hoped his nerves were very strong indeed he was going to need them all to survive the ordeal of the next few hours it was that handful of hair that really convinced him i said nothing and he went on please tell me exactly what is going on for the next five minutes while i kept watch through that crack in the doorway dr caroline plied me with questions and i answered them as quickly and briefly as i could he had a highly intelligent incisive mind which i found vaguely surprising which in turn was a stupid reaction on my part you dont pick a dimwit as the chief of development for a new atomic weapon i supposed his rather comicalsounding name and the brief glimpse id had of him the previous night a man bound hand and foot to a fourposter and looking into a torch beam with wide and staring eyes looks something less than his best had unconsciously given me the wrong impression entirely at the end of the five minutes he knew as much about the past developments as i did myself what he didnt know was what was to come for i hadnt the heart to tell him he was giving me some details of his kidnap when carreras and his companion appeared they replaced battens tied the tarpaulins and went forward without any delay that meant i supposed that the fusing of the auxiliary time bombs in the other two coffins was complete i unwrapped the torch from its oilskin covering looked round the store picked up a few tools and switched off the light right i said to caroline come on where he wasnt keen to go anywhere and after what hed been through i didnt blame him back down that hold hurry we may have little enough time two minutes later with the battens and tarpaulin pulled back into place as well as possible above us we were on the floor of the hold i neednt have bothered bringing any tools carreras had left his behind him scattered carelessly round understandably he hadnt bothered to remove them he would never be using those tools again i gave caroline the torch to hold selected a screw driver and started on the lid of the brass plaqued coffin what are you going to do caroline asked nervously you can see what im doing for pitys sake be careful that weapon is armed so its armed its not due to go until when seven oclock but its unsafe highly unsafe its as unstable as hell good god carter i know i know his unsteady hand was on my arm his face contorted with anxiety the development on this missile wasnt fully completed when it was stolen the fuse mechanism was only in an untried experimental state and tests showed that the retaining spring on a trembler switch is far too weak the twister is dead safe normally but this trembler switch is brought into circuit as soon as it is armed and a jar a knock the slightest fallanything could overcome the tension of the spring and shortcircuit the firing mechanism fifteen seconds later the bomb goes up i hadnt noticed until then but it was much warmer down in that hold than it had been on deck i raised a soaking sleeve in a halfwitted attempt to wipe some sweat off my forehead have you told carreras this the warmth was also affecting my voice bringing it out as a harsh strained croak i told him he wont listen i thinki think carreras is a little mad more than a little he seems perfectly prepared to take a chance and he has the twister tightly packed in cotton wool and blankets to eliminate the possibility of a jar i gazed at him for a long moment without really seeing him then got on with the next screw it seemed much stiffer than the last one but it was just possible that i wasnt applying so much pressure as i had been before for all that i had all the screws undone inside three minutes gently i slid off the lid placed it to one side slowly peeled back a couple of blankets and there lay the twister it looked more evil than ever i stood up took the torch from caroline and said armed eh of course there are your tools disarm the bloody thing he stared at me his face suddenly empty of expression thats why were here why else surely it was obvious get on with it it cant be done it cant be done i caught him by the arm not gently look friend you armed the damned thing just reverse the process thats all impossible finality in the voice when its armed the mechanism is locked in position with a key the key is in carreras pocket chapter the weakness in my left leg a nearparalysing weakness hit me all of a sudden and i had to sit down on the baffle and hang on to the ladder for support i gazed down at the twister for a long time i gazed down at it with bitter eyes then i stirred and looked at dr caroline would you mind repeating that he repeated it im terribly sorry carter but there you have it the twister cant be rendered safe without the key and carreras has the key i thought of all the impossible solutions to this one and recognised them at once for what they were impossible i knew what had to be done now the only thing that could be done i said tiredly do you know dr caroline that youve just condemned forty people to certain death i have done that well carreras when he put that key in his pocket he was condemning himself and all his men to death just as surely as the man who pulls the switch for the electric chair and what am i worrying about anyway deaths the only certain and permanent cure for scourges like carreras and the people who associate with him as for lord dexter hes rolling in the stuff he can always build another campari what are you talking about mr carter there was apprehension in his voice as he looked at me more than apprehension fear are you feeling all right carter of course im all right i said irritably everybodys always asking the same stupid question i stooped picked up the rope grommet and halftrac midget hoist id taken from the bosuns store then rose wearily to my feet come on doctor give me a hand with this give you a hand with what he knew damned well what i meant but the fear in his mind wouldnt let him believe it the twister of course i said impatiently i want to get it over to the port side hidden in the tarpaulins behind the baffle are you crazy he whispered are you quite crazy did you hear what i said youre going to lift it out of its coffin withwith that one little slip the tiniest jar are you going to help me he shook his head shuddered and turned away i hooked the hoist on to a headhigh rung of the ladder pulled the lower block until it hung just above the twister picked up the grommet and moved round to the tail of the weapon i was stooping low over it when i heard a quick footstep behind me and a pair of arms locked themselves round my body arms informed with all the strength of fear and desperation i struggled briefly to free myself but i might as well have tried to shrug off the tentacles of a squid i tried to stamp on his instep but all i did was hurt my heel id forgotten that i wasnt wearing shoes let go i said savagely what the hell do you think youre doing im not going to let you do it im not going to let you do it he was panting his voice low and hoarse and desperate im not going to let you kill us all there are certain people in certain situations with whom there is no arguing this was such a situation and caroline such a person i half turned thrust backwards with all the power of my good leg and heard him gasp as his back struck heavily against the ships side a momentary loosening of his grip a wrench and i was free i picked up the big marlinespike and showed it to him in the light of the torch i dont want to use this i said quietly next time i will my promise cant you stop shaking long enough to realise that im trying to save all our lives not throw them away dont you realise that anyone might pass by up top any moment see the loose tarpaulin and investigate he stood there hunched against the metal staring down at the floor he said nothing i turned took the torch in my teeth placed the grommet on the edge of the coffin and bent down to lift the tail of the twister or to try to lift it it weighed a ton to me it did anyway what with one thing and another i wasnt as fit as i had been id managed to lift it perhaps three inches and didnt see how i was going to hold it there for even a couple of seconds when i heard a footstep and a kind of moan behind me i tensed braced myself for the next assault then relaxed slowly as dr caroline stepped past me bent down and slid the grommet round the tail of the twister together we managed to move the grommet up to approximately the midpoint of the missile neither of us said anything i hauled on the halftrac pulley until it became taut dr caroline said hoarsely itll never take it that thin cord its tested to a thousand pounds i hauled some more and the tail began to lift the grommet wasnt central i lowered it again the grommet was adjusted and next time i hauled the twister came clear along its entire length when it was about three inches above its cottonwool and blanket bed i set the autolock i mopped my forehead again it was warmer than ever down in that hold how are you going to get it across to the other side carolines voice had lost its shake now it was flat and without inflection the voice of a man resigned to the dark inevitability of a nightmare well carry it across between us we should manage it carry it across he said dully it weighs two hundred and seventyfive pounds i know what it weighs i said irritably you have a bad leg he hadnt heard me my hearts not good the ships rolling you can see that that polished aluminium is as slippery as glass one of us would stumble lose his grip maybe both of us it would be bound to fall wait here i said i took the torch crossed to the port side picked up a couple of tarpaulins from behind the baffle and dragged them across the floor well place it on these and pull it across pull it across the floor bump it across the floor he wasnt as resigned to the nightmare as i had thought he looked at me then at the twister then at me again and said with unshakeable conviction youre mad oh for gods sake cant you think of anything else to say i grabbed the pulley again released the lock hauled and kept on hauling caroline wrapped both arms round the twister as it came clear of the coffin struggling to make sure that the nose of the missile didnt collide with the baffle step over the baffle and take it with you i said keep your back to the ladder as you turn he nodded silently his face strained and set in the pale beam of the torch he put his back to the ladder tightened his grip on the twister an arm on each side of the grommet lifted his leg to clear the baffle then staggered as a sudden roll of the ship threw the weight of the missile against him his foot caught the top of the baffle the combined forces of the twister and the ships roll carried him beyond his centre of gravity he cried out and overbalanced heavily across the baffle to the floor of the hold id seen it coming rather id seen the last second of it happening i swept my hand up blindly hit the autolock and jumped for the swinging missile throwing myself between it and the ladder dropping my torch as i reached out with both hands to prevent the nose from crashing into the ladder in the sudden impenetrable darkness i missed the twister but it didnt miss me it struck me just below the breastbone with a force that brought an agonised gasp from me then id both arms wrapped round that polished aluminium shell as if i were going to crush it in half the torch i yelled somehow in that moment it didnt seem in any way important that i should keep down my voice get the torch my ankle the hell with your ankle get the torch i heard him give a halfsupressed moan then sensed that he was clambering over the baffle i heard him again his hands scuffing over the steel floor then silence have you found it the campari had started on its return roll and i was fighting to keep my balance ive found it then switch it on you fool i cant a pause its broken that helped a lot i said quickly catch hold of the end of this damned thing im slipping he did and the strain eased he said have you any matches matches carter showing inhuman restraint if it hadnt been for the twister it would have been lunny matches after being towed through the water for five minutes alongside the campari i hadnt thought of that he said gravely a few moments silence then he offered i have a lighter god help america i said fervently if all her scientists light it man light it a wheel scraped on flint and a flickering pool of pale yellow light did its pitiful best to illuminate that one tiny corner of the dark hold the block and tackle quickly i waited until he had reached it take the strain on the free end knock off the lock and lower gently ill guide it on to the tarpaulins i moved out half a step from the baffle taking much of the weight of the missile with me i was barely a couple of feet away from the tarpaulins when i heard the click of the autolock coming off and suddenly my back was breaking the pulley had gone completely slack the entire two hundred and seventyfive pounds of the twister was in my arms the campari was rolling away from me i couldnt hold it i knew i couldnt hold it my back was breaking i staggered and lurched forward and the twister with myself above and still clinging desperately to it crashed heavily on to the tarpaulins with a shock that seemed to shake the entire floor of the hold i freed my arms and climbed shakily to my feet dr caroline the flickering flame held just at the level of his eyes was staring down at the gleaming missile like a man held in thrall his face a frozen mask of all the terrible emotions hed ever known then the spell broke fifteen seconds he shouted hoarsely fifteen seconds to go he flung himself at the ladder but got no further than the second step when i locked arms round both himself and the ladder he struggled violently frantically briefly then relaxed how far do you think youre going to get in fifteen seconds i said i dont know why i said it i was barely aware that i had said it i had eyes and mind only for the missile lying there my face probably showed all the emotions that dr carolines had been registering and he was staring too it was a senseless thing to do but for the moment we were both senseless men staring at the twister to see what was going to happen as if we would ever see anything neither eyes nor ears nor mind would have the slightest chance in the world of registering anything before that blinding nuclear flash annihilated us vaporised us blew the campari out of existence ten seconds passed twelve fifteen twenty half a minute i eased my aching lungs hadnt drawn breath in all that timeand my grip round caroline and the ladder well i said how far would you have got dr caroline climbed slowly down the two steps to the floor of the hold dragged his gaze away from the missile looked at me for a long moment with uncomprehending eyes then smiled do you know mr carter the thought never even occurred to me his voice was quite steady and his smile wasnt the smile of a crazy man dr caroline had known that he was going to die and then he hadnt died and nothing would ever be quite so bad again he had found that the valley of fear does not keep on going down forever somewhere there is a bottom then a man starts climbing again you grab the trailing rope first and then release the autolock i said reproachfully if i was lightheaded who was to blame me not the other way round you might remember next time there are some things for which to make an apology is impossible so he didnt even try he said regretfully im afraid ill never make a sailorman but at least we know now that the retaining spring on the trembler switch is not as weak as we had feared he smiled wanly mr carter i think ill have a cigarette i think ill join you i said after that it was easywell relatively easy we still treated the twister with the greatest respecthad it struck at some other angle it might indeed have detonated but not with respect exaggerated to the extent of tiptoeing terror we dragged it on its tarpaulin across to the other side of the hold transferred the halftrac hoist to the corresponding ladder on the port side arranged a couple of spare tarpaulins and blankets from the coffin to make a cushioned bed for the twister between baffle and ships side hoisted the missile across the baffle without any of the acrobatics that had accompanied the last transfer lowered it into position pulled over the blankets and covered it completely with the tarpaulins on which we had dragged it across the floor itll be safe here dr caroline enquired he seemed almost back to what i should have imagined his normal self to be except for the hurried breathing the cold sweat on his brow and face theyll never see it theyll never even think to look here why should they what do you propose to do now leave with all possible speed ive played my luck far enough but first the coffin must weight it to compensate for the absence of the twister then batten down the lid again and then where do we go youre not going anywhere youre staying here i explained to him just why he had to stay there and he didnt like it one little bit i explained to him some more pointed out carefully so that he couldnt fail to understand that his only chance of life depended on his staying there and he still didnt like it any more but he saw that it had to be done and the fear of certain death eventually outweighed the very understandable and almost hysterical panic my suggestion had caused him and after that fifteensecond lifetime when we had waited for the twister to detonate nothing could ever seem so terrifying again five minutes later i battened down the coffin lid for the last time thrust the screw driver in my pocket and left the hold the wind i thought had eased a little the rain beyond question was heavier by far even in the pitchy darkness of that night i could see the blur of whiteness round my stockinged feet as the heavy winddriven drops spattered on the iron decks and rebounded anklehigh i took my time making my way forward there was no hurry any more and now that the worst was behind i had no mind to destroy it all or destroy us all by undue haste i was a black shadow at one with the blackness of the night and no ghost was ever half so quiet once two patrolling guards passed me by going aft once i passed a couple huddled miserably in the lee of a accommodation deck seeking what little shelter they could from that cold rain neither pair saw me neither even suspected my presence which was just as it should have been the dog never catches the hare for lunch is less important than life i had no means of telling the time but at least twenty minutes must have passed before i once more found myself outside the wireless office every major event in the past three days right from the very first had in some way or other stemmed from that wireless office it seemed only fitting that it should also be the scene of the playing of the last card left in my hand the padlock was through the hasp and it was locked that meant there was no one inside i retreated to the shelter of the nearest boat and settled down to wait the fact that there was no one in there didnt mean that there wasnt going to be someone there very soon tony carreras had mentioned that their stooges on the ticonderoga reported course and position every hour carlos the man id killed must have been waiting for just such a message and if there was another report due through then it was a certainty that carreras would have his other operator up to intercept it at this penultimate state of the game he would be leaving nothing at all to chance and in the same state of the game neither was i the radio operator bursting in and finding me sitting in front of his transmitter was the last thing i could afford to have happen the rain drummed pitilessly on my bent back i couldnt get any wetter than i was but i could get colder i got colder very cold indeed and within fifteen minutes i was shivering constantly twice guards padded softly by carreras was certainly taking no chances that night and twice i made sure was certain that they must find me so violent was my shivering that i had to clamp my sleeve between my teeth to prevent the chattering from betraying me but on both occasions the guards passed by oblivious the shivering became even worse would that damned radio operator never come or had i outsmarted myself had i doubleguessed and doubleguessed wrongly perhaps the radio operator wasnt going to come at all i had been silting on a coiled lifeboat fall and now i rose to my feet irresolute how long would i have to wait there before i would be convinced that he wasnt going to come or maybe he wasnt due for another hour yet or more wherein lay the greater danger risking going into the wireless office now with the everpresent possibility of being discovered and trapped in there or waiting an hour maybe two hours before making my move by which time it would almost certainly be too late anyway better a chance of failure i thought than the near certainty of it and now that id left number four hold the only life which would be lost through my mistakes would be my own now i thought ill do it now i took three silent steps then no more the radio operator had arrived i took three silent steps back the click of a key turning in the padlock the faint creak of the door the metallic sound of it shutting a faint gleam of light behind the curtained window our friend preparing to receive i thought he wouldnt stay long that was a safe enough guess just long enough to take down the latest details of course and speed of the ticonderoga unless the weather was radically different to the northeast it was most unlikely that the ticonderoga could have fixed its position that night and take it up to carreras on the bridge i presumed that carreras would still be there it would be entirely out of keeping with the man if in those last few crucial hours he didnt remain on the bridge and take personal charge of the entire operation as he had done throughout i could just see him accepting the sheet of figures with the latest details of the ticonderogas progress smiling his smile of cold satisfaction making his calculations on the chart z my thoughts stopped dead right there i felt as if someone had turned a master switch inside me and everything had seized up heart breathing mind and every organ of sensation i felt as i had felt during those dredful fifteen seconds while dr caroline and i had waited for the twister to blow up i felt that way because there had abruptly paralysingly flashed on me the realisation that would have come to me half an hour ago if i hadnt been so busy commiserating with myself on the misery i was suffering whatever else carreras had not established himself as a consistent prudent and methodical man and hed never yet worked out any chart problems on figures supplied him without coming to have a check made by his trusty navigator chief officer john carter my mind churned into low gear again but it didnt make any difference true hed sometimes waited some hours before having his check made but he wouldnt be waiting some hours tonight because by then it would be far too late we couldnt be more than three hours now from our rendezvous with the ticonderoga and hed want a check made immediately waking up a sick man in the middle of the night would hardly be a consideration to worry carreras nothing was surer than that within ten or fifteen minutes of that message coming through hed be calling at the sick bay to find his navigator gone to find the door locked from the inside to find macdonald waiting with a gun in his hand macdonald had only one automatic carreras could call on forty men with submachine guns there could only be one ending to any battle in the sick bay and the end would be swift and certain and final in my minds eye i could just see stammering machine guns spraying the sick bay could see macdonald and susan bullen and marstoni crushed down the thought forced it from my mind that way lay defeat when the radio operator left the office if i got inside unseen if i was left undisturbed to send off the message how long would that leave me to get back to the sick bay ten minutes not any more than ten minutes say seven or eight minutes to make my way undetected right aft to the port side where i had left the three ropes tied to the guardrail stanchion secure one to myself grab the life line give the signal to the bosun lower myself into the water and then make the long halfdrowning trip back to the sick bay ten minutes eight i knew i could never do it in double that time if my trip from the sick bay to the afterdeck through that water had been any criterion the trip back against instead of with the current would be at least twice as bad and the first trip had been near enough the end of me eight minutes the chances were high id never get back there at all or the radio operator i could kill the radio operator as he left the office i was desperate enough to try anything and frantic enough to have a fair chance of success even with patrolling guards round that way carreras would never get the message but he would be waiting for it oh yes he would be waiting for it he would be very anxious indeed to have that last check and if it didnt come within minutes he was going to send someone to investigate and when that someone found the operator was dead or missing the balloon would be up with a vengeance guards running here guards running there lights on all over the ship every possible source of trouble investigated and that still included the sick bay and macdonald would still be there with his gun there was a way it was a way that gave little enough hope of success with the added drawback that i would be forced to leave those three incriminating ropes attached to the guardrail aft but at least it didnt carry with it an outright guarantee of failure i stooped felt for the coiled fall rope cut it with my clasp knife one end of the rope i secured to my waist with a bowline the rest of it about sixty feet i wrapped round my waist tucking the end in i fumbled for and found the radio office key that id taken off the dead carlos i stood in the rain and the darkness and waited a minute elapsed no more then the radio operator appeared locked the door behind him and made for the companionway leading up to the bridge thirty seconds later i was sitting in the seat hed just vacated looking up the call sign of the fort ticonderoga i made no attempt to hide my presence there by leaving the light off that would only have aroused the suspicions and quickly too of any passing guards hearing the stutter of transmitted morse coming from a darkened wireless office twice i tapped out the call sign of the ticonderoga and on the second occasion i got an acknowledgement one of carreras radio operator stooges aboard the ticonderoga was certainly keeping a pretty sharp watch i should have expected nothing else it was a brief message speeded on its way by the introductory words highest priority urgent immediate repeat immediate attention master fort ticonderoga i sent the message and took the liberty of signing it from the office of the minister of transport by the hand of viceadmiral richard hodson director naval operations i switched off the light opened the door and peered out cautiously no curious listeners no one at all in sight i came all the way out locked the padlock and threw the key over the side thirty seconds later i was on the port side of the boat deck carefully gauging as best i could in that darkness and driving rain the distance from where i stood to the break in the focsle about thirty feet i finally estimated and the distance from the focsle break aft to the window above my bed was i guessed about the same if i was right i should be almost directly above that window now the sick bay was three decks below if i wasnt rightwell id better be right i checked the knot round my waist passed the other end of the rope round a convenient arm of a davit and let it hang down loosely over the side i was just about to start lowering myself when the rope below me smacked wetly against the ships side and went taut someone had caught that rope and hauled it tight panic touched me but the instinct for selfpreservation still operated independently of my mind i flung an arm round the davit and locked on to the wrist of the other hand anyone wanting to pull me over the side would have to pull that davit and lifeboat along with me but as long as that pressure remained on the rope i couldnt escape couldnt free a hand to untie the bowline or get at my clasp knife the pressure eased i fumbled for the knot then stopped as the pressure came on again but the pressure was only momentary no pull but a tug four tugs in rapid succession if i wasnt feeling weak enough already id have felt that way with relief four tubs the prearranged signal with macdonald to show i was on my way back i might have known archie macdonald would have been keeping watch every second of the time i was away he must have seen or heard or even felt the rope snaking down past the window and guessed that it could only be myself i went down that rope like a man reborn checked suddenly as a strong hand caught me by the ankle and five seconds later was on terra firma inside the sick bay the ropes i said to macdonald i was already untying the one round my own waist the two ropes on the bedstead off with them throw them out the window moments later the last of the three ropes had vanished i was closing the window pulling the curtains and calling softly for lights the lights came on macdonald and bullen were as i had left them both eyeing me with expressionless faces macdonald because he knew my safe return meant at least possible success and did not want to betray his knowledge bullen because i had told him that i intended to take over the bridge by force and he was convinced that my method of return meant failure and didnt want to embarrass me susan and marston were by the dispensary door both fully dressed neither making any attempt to conceal disappointment no time for greetings susan on with the heaters full on this place feels like a frig after this window being open so long carreras will be here any minute and its the first thing he will notice after that towels for me doc a hand to get macdonald back to his own bed move man move and why arent you and susan dressed for bed if carreras sees you we were expecting the gentleman to come calling with a gun macdonald reminded me youre frozen stiff mr carter blue with cold and shivering like you were in an icebox i feel like it we dumped macdonald none too gently on his bed pulled up sheets and blankets then i tore off my clothes and started to towel myself dry no matter how i towelled i couldnt stop the shivering the key macdonald said sharply the key in the sickbay door god yes id forgotten all about it susan will you unlock it and then to bed quickly and you doctor i took the key from her opened the window behind the curtain and flung the key out the suit i had been wearing the socks the wet towels followed in short order but not before i had remembered to remove the screw driver and macdonalds clasp knife from the jacket i dried and combed my hair into some sort of orderas orderly as anyone could expect it to be after a few hours sleeping in bed and helped doc marston as he swiftly changed the plaster on my head and wrapped splints and fresh bandages round the still soaking ones covering the wounds in my leg then the lights clicked off and the sick bay was once more in darkness have i forgotten anything anybody i asked anything that might show ive been out of here nothing i dont think theres anything the bosun speaking im sure the heaters i asked are they on its freezing in here its not that cold my boy bullen said in his husky whisper youre freezing thats what marston havent you hotwater bags marston said briskly two of them here they are he thrust them into my hands in the dark had them all prepared for you we suspected all that sea water and rain wouldnt do that fever of yours any good and heres a glass to show your friend carreras a few drops of brandy in the bottom to convince him how far through you are you might have filled it i complained i did i emptied it no question but that that neat brandy had a heating effect it seemed to burn a hole through me all the way down to my stomach but the only overall effect it had was to make the rest of me seem colder than ever then macdonalds voice quick and quiet someone coming id time to fumble the empty glass on to the bedside table but time for nothing more not even time to slide down to a lying position under the blankets the door opened the overhead lights clicked on and carreras the inevitable chart under his arm advanced across the sick bay towards my bed as usual he had his expressions and emotions under complete control anxiety tension anticipation all those must have been in his mind and behind everything the memory of his lost son but no trace showed he stopped a yard away and stared down at me eyes speculative and narrowed and cold not asleep carter eh he said slowly not even lying down he picked up the glass from the bedside table sniffed it and set it down again brandy and youre shivering carter shivering all the time why answer me im frightened i said sourly every time i see you i get terrified mr carreras doc marston had just appeared through the dispensary doorway a blanket wrapped round him his magnificent mane of white hair tousled in splendid disorder rubbing the sleep from his eyes this is outrageous completely outrageous disturbing this very sick boyand at this hour i must ask you to leave sir and at once carreras looked him over from head to toe and back again then said quietly and coldly be quiet i will not be quiet doc marston shouted mgm would have given him a life contract any day im a doctor ive my duty as a doctor and by god im going to have my say as a doctor there was unfortunately no table at hand otherwise he would have crashed down his fist on it but even without the table banging it was a pretty impressive performance and carreras was obviously taken aback by marstons professional ire and outrage chief officer carter is a very sick man marston thundered on i havent the facilities here to treat a compound fracture of the femur and the result was inevitable pneumonia sir pneumonia in both lungs so much fluid gathered already that he cant lie down he can hardly breathe temperature pulse high fever constant shivering ive packed him with hotwater bottles fed him drugs aspirin brandy all to no effect fever just wont go down one moment burning hot the next soaking wet he was right about the soaking wet bit anyway i could feel the sea water from the sodden bandages seeping through to the mattress below for gods sake carreras cant you see hes a sick man leave him be ill only keep him a moment doctor carreras said soothingly whatever faint stirrings of suspicion he might have had had been completely laid to rest by marstons oscarwhining performance i can see that mr carter is unwell but this will give him no trouble at all i was reaching for the chart and pencil even before he handed it to me what with the constant shivering and the numbness that seemed to be spreading from my injured leg over my entire body the calculations took longer than usual but they werent difficult i looked at the sickbay clock and said you should be in position shortly before four am we cant miss him you would say mr carter he wasnt as confident and unworried as he looked even in the dark with the radar going i dont see how you can i wheezed some more so that he wouldnt forget to remember how sick i was and went on how do you propose to make the ticonderoga stop i was as anxious as he was that contact should be established and transfers accomplished as quickly and smoothly as possible the twister in the hold was due to blow up at am id just as soon be a long distance away by that time a shell across the bow and a signal to stop if that doesnt work he added reflectively a shell through the focsle you really do surprise me carreras i said slowly surprise you a barely perceptible lift of the left eyebrow for carreras a perfect riot of expression how so a man who has taken such infinite pains and i must admit shown such superb planning throughout to throw it all away by such careless haphazard action at the end he made to speak but i held up my hand and carried on im just as interested as you are in seeing that the fort ticonderoga is stopped i dont give a tuppenny damn about the gold i do know its essential that captain bullen the bosun and i get to a firstclass hospital immediately i do want to see all the passengers and crew transferred to safety i dont want to see any members of the ticonderogas crew killed by gunfire and finally get on with it he interrupted coldly right you intercept at five in the present weather conditions itll be half light the night enough to let the master of the fort ticonderoga see you approaching when he sees another vessel closing in on himwith the whole width of the atlantic to use to pass him by hell become immediately suspicious after all he knows hes carrying a fortune in gold hell turn and run for it in the halflight with poor visibility falling rain pitching decks and a gun crew almost certainly untrained in naval gunnery your chances of registering a hit on the small target presented by a target running away from you are pretty small not that that popgun im told youve mounted on the focsle will achieve very much anyway no one could call the gun ive mounted on the afterdeck a popgun mr carter but for all the untroubled smoothness of the face he was thinking plenty its almost the equivalent of a so what youll have to turn broadside on to bring that one to bear and while youre turning the ticonderoga will be getting even further away from you for the reasons al ready given youll almost certainly miss anyway after the second shot those deck plates will probably be buckled to hell and gone then how do you propose to stop him you cant make a fourteenthousandton cargo ship stop just by waving a few tommy guns at it it will not come to that there is an element of uncertainty in everything but we shall not fail theres no need for any element of uncertainty carreras indeed how would you propose it should be done i think thats enough it was captain bullen who broke in his husky voice heavy with all the weight and authority of the commodore of the blue mail doing chart work under pressure is one thing voluntarily scheming to further this criminals plans is another i have been listening to all of this havent you gone far enough mister hell no i said i wont have gone far enough till all of us have gone all the way to the navy hospital in hampton roads the things dead simple carreras when he comes within a few miles on the radarscope start firing off distress signals at the same timeyoud better arrange this now have your stooges on the ticonderoga take a message to the master saying theyve just picked up sos signals from the campari when he comes nearer send an aldistress message that you sprung engineroom plates coming through the hurricane which hes bound to have heard of that the camparis pumps cant cope that youre beginning to sink and that you want crew and passengers taken off i smiled my wan smile the last part is true anyway when hes stopped alongside and you whip the tarpaulins off your gunswell you have him he cant and wont try to get away he stared at me without seeing me then gave a small nod i suppose its out of the question to persuade you to become myahlieutenant carter just see me safe aboard the ticonderoga carreras thats all the thanks i want that shall be done he glanced at his watch in under three hours six of your crew will be here with stretchers to transfer captain bullen the bosun and yourself to the ticonderoga he left i looked round the sick bay they were all there bullen and macdonald in their beds susan and marston by the dispensary door both shawled in blankets they were all looking at me and the expressions on their faces were very peculiar indeed to say the least of it the silence went on and on for what seemed like a quite unnecessarily long time then bullen spoke his voice slow and hard carreras has committed one act of piracy he is about to commit another by doing so he declares himself an enemy of queen and country you will be charged with giving aid and comfort to the enemy with being directly responsible for the loss of a hundred and fifty million dollars in gold bullion i shall take statements from witnesses present as soon as we get aboard the ticonderoga i couldnt blame the old man he still believed in carreras promise as to our future safety in his eyes i was just making things too damned easy for carreras but now wasnt the time to enlighten him oh here i said thats a bit hard isnt it aiding abetting accessorying if you like but all this treason stuff why did you do it susan beresford shook her head wonderingly oh why did you do it helping him like that just to save your own neck and now wasnt the time to enlighten her either neither she nor bullen were actor enough to carry off their parts in the morning if they knew the whole truth thats a bit hard too i protested only a few hours go there was no one keener than yourself to get away from he campari and now that i didnt want it done this way i didnt know until now hat there was a chance that the ticonderoga could escape i wouldnt have believed it john dr marston said eavily i just wouldnt have believed it its all right for you to talk i said youve all got families ive only got myself can you blame me for wanting o look after all i have no one took me up on this masterpiece of logical reasoning looked round them one by one and they turned away one y one susan marston and bullen not bothering to hide heir expressions and then macdonald too turned away but not before his left eyelid had dropped in a long slow wink i eased myself down in bed and made up my mind for sleep no one asked me how i got on that night chapter when i awoke i was stiff and sore and still shivering but it wasnt the pain or the cold or the fever that had brought me up from the murky depths of that troubled sleep it was noise a series of grinding creaking metallic crashes that echoed and shuddered throughout the entire length of the campari as if she were smashing into an iceberg with every roll she took i could tell from the slow sluggish lifeless roll that the stabilisers werent working the campari was stopped dead in the water well mister bullens voice was a harsh grate your plan worked damn you congratulations the ticonderogas alongside alongside right alongside macdonald confirmed lashed alongside in this weather i winced as the two ships rolled heavily together in the trough of a deep swell and i heard the harsh tearing scream of sound as topsides metal buckled and rended under the staggering weight of the impact itll ruin the paint work the mans mad hes in a hurry macdonald said i can hear the jumbo winch aft hes started transshipping cargo already aft i couldnt keep the note of excitement out of my voice and everybody suddenly looked at me curiosity in their eyes aft are you sure im sure sir are we tied bow to bow and stern to stern or are we facing in opposite directions no idea both he and bullen were giving me very close looks but there was a difference in the quality of the closeness does it matter mr carter he knew damned well it did it doesnt matter i said indifferently not much it didnt matter only million dollars that was all it mattered wheres miss beresford i asked marston with her folks he said shortly packing clothes your kind friend carreras is allowing the passengers to take one suitcase apiece with them he says theyll get the rest of their stuff back in due courseif anyone manages to pick up the campari after he has abandoned it that is it was typical i thought of the mans extraordinary thoroughness in all he did by letting them pack some clothes and promising the eventual safe return of the remainder he would eliminate from even the most suspicious minds the unworthy thought that perhaps his intentions towards the crew and passengers werent of the highest and the noblest the phone rang marston picked it up listened briefly then hung up stretcher party in five minutes he announced help me dress please i said my white uniform shorts and white shirt you youre not getting up marston was aghast what if im getting up dressing and getting back to bed again i said shortly do you think im daft whats carreras going to think if he sees a man with a compound fracture of the thigh hopping briskly over the rail of the ticonderoga i dressed stuck the screw driver under the splints on my left leg and got back to bed again i was no sooner there than the stretcher party appeared and all three of us still blanketwrapped were lowered gently on to the stretchers the six bearers stooped caught the handles and we were on our way we were carried straight aft along the main deck passage to the afterdeck i saw the end of the passage approaching the grey cold dawn light replacing the warm electric glow of the passageway and i could feel my muscles tense involuntarily the ticonderoga would be in sight in a few seconds along our starboard side and i wondered if i would dare to look would we be tied bow to bow or bow to stern would i have won or lost we came out on the afterdeck i forced myself to look id won bow to bow and stern to stern from my low elevation on the stretcher i couldnt see much but that i could seebow to bow stern to stern that meant that the camparis after jumbo was unloading from the ticonderogas afterdeck i looked again and checked again and there was no mistake bow to bow stern to stern i felt like a million dollars a hundred million dollars the ticonderoga a big cargo vessel dark blue with a red funnel was almost the same size as the campari more important their afterdecks were almost the same height above the water which made for ease of transfer of both cargo and human beings i could count eight crates already aboard the afterdeck of the campari a dozen still to come the transfer of human livestock had gone even further all of the passengers as far as i could judge and at least half of the camparis crew were already standing on the afterdeck of the ticonderoga making no move except to brace themselves against the rolling of the ship their stillness was encouraged by a couple of hardfaced characters in green jungle uniform each with a machine pistol cocked a third gunman covered two ticonderoga seamen who were stationed at lowered guardrails to catch and steady men as they stepped or jumped from the afterdeck of the campari to that of the ticonderoga as the two ships rolled together two more supervised ticonderoga crew members fitting slings to the crates still to be transferred from where i lay i could see four other armed menthere were probably many more patrolling the decks of the ticonderoga and four others on the afterdeck of the campari despite the fact that most of them were dressed in a quasi uniform of jungle green they didnt look like soldiers to me they just looked like what they were hardened criminals with guns in their hands cold eyed men with their history written in their faces by the lines of brutality and depravity although he was maybe a bit short on the side of aesthetic appreciation there was no doubt but that carreras picked his killers well the sky was low with grey tattered cloud stretching away to the grey indistinctness of a tumbled horizon the wind westerly now was still strong but the rain had almost stopped no more than a cold drizzle felt rather than seen visibility was poor but it would be good enough to let carreras see that there were no other ships in the vicinity and the radarscope of course would be working all the time but apparently the visibility hadnt been good enough to let carreras see three ropes still attached to the base of the guardrail stanchion on the port side from where i lay i could see them clearly to me they looked about the size of the cables supporting the brooklyn bridge i hastily averted my eyes but carreras i could now see had no time to look round him anyway he himself had taken charge of the transshipment of the crates hurrying on both his own men and the crew of the ticonderoga shouting at them encouraging them driving them on with an unflagging unrelenting energy and urgency which seemed strangely at variance with his normally calm dispassionate bearing he would of course be understandably anxious to have the transfer completed before any curious third ship might heave in sight over the horizon but even so and then i knew what accounted for all the nearly desperate haste i looked at my watch it was already ten minutes past six ten past six from what id gathered of carreras proposed schedule for the transfer and from the lack of light in the sky id have put the time at no more than halfpast five i checked again but no mistake sixten carreras would want to be over the horizon when the twister went up he would be safe enough from blast and radioactive fallout but heaven alone knew what kind of tidal wave would be pushed up by the explosion of such an underwater nuclear deviceand the twister was due to go up in fifty minutes his haste was understandable i wondered what had held him up perhaps the late arrival of the ticonderoga or the lapse of a longer period of time than he had expected in luring it alongside not that it mattered now a signal from carreras and it was time for the stretcher cases to be transferred i was the first to go i didnt much fancy the prospect of the brief trip id just be a reddish stain spread over a couple of hundred square feet of metal if one of the bearers slipped as the two big ships rolled together but the nimblefooted seamen probably had the same thought in mind for themselves for they made no mistake a minute later and both other stretchers had been brought across we were set down near the forward break of the afterdeck beside our passengers and crew in a group slightly to one side with a guard all to themselves stood a few officers and maybe a dozen men of the ticonderogas crew one of them a tall lean angryeyed man in his early fifties with the four gold rings of a captain on his sleeves and carrying a telegraph form in his hand was talking to mcllroy our chief engineer and cummings mcllroy ignoring the sudden lift of the guards gun brought him across to where wed been set down thank god you all survived mcllroy said quietly last time i saw you three i wouldnt have given a bent penny for any of your chances this is captain brace of the ticonderoga captain brace captain bullen chief officer carter glad to make your acquaintance sir bullen whispered huskily but not in these damnable circumstances no question about it the old man was on the way to recovery well leave mr carter out of it mr mcllroy i intend to prefer charges against him for giving undue and unwarranted aid to that damned monster carreras considering id saved his life by refusing to let doc marston operate on him i did think he might have shown a little more gratitude johnny carter mcllroy looked his open disbelief its impossible youll have your proof bullen said grimly he looked up at captain brace knowing that you knew what cargo you were carrying i should have expected you to make a run for it when intercepted naval guns or no naval guns but you didnt did you you answered an sos isnt that it distress rockets claims that plates had been sprung in the hurricane sinking come and take us off right captain i could have outrun or out manuvered him brace said tightly then in sudden curiosity how did you know that because i heard our first mate here advising him that it was the best way to do it part of your answer already eh mcllroy he looked at me without admiration then back at mcllroy have a couple of men move me nearer that bulkhead i dont feel too comfortable here i gave him an injured glance but it bounced right off him his stretcher was shifted and i was left more or less alone in front of the group i lay there for about three minutes watching the cargo transfer a crate a minute and this despite the fact that the manilla holding the after ends of the two vessels together snapped and had to be replaced ten minutes at the most and he should be all through a hand touched my shoulder and i looked round julius beresford was squatting by my side never thought id see you again mr carter he said candidly how do you feel better than i look i said untruthfully and why left all alone here he asked curiously this i explained is what is known as being sent to coventry captain bullen is convinced that i gave unwarranted help or aid or some such legal phrase to carreras hes not pleased with me rubbish he snorted he heard me doing it dont care what he heard beresford said flatly whatever he heard he didnt hear what he thought he did i make as many mistakes as the next man maybe more than most but i never make a mistake about men which reminds me my boy which reminds me i cant tell you how pleased i amand how delighted hardly the time and place for it but nevertheless my very heartiest congratulations my wife feels exactly the same way about it i assure you it was taking me all my time to pay attention to him one of the crates was swinging dangerously in its slings and if one of those crates dropped fell on the deck and burst open to reveal its contents i didnt see that there was going to be much future for any of us it wasnt a thought i liked to dwell on it would be better to turn my mind to something else like concentrating on what julius beresford was saying i beg your pardon i said the job at my scottish oil port he was half impatient half smiling you know delighted that you are going to accept but not half as delighted as we are about you and susan all her life shes been pursued as you can guess by hordes of golddigging dead beats but i always told her that when the day came that she met a man who didnt give a damn for her money even though he was a hobo i wouldnt stand in her way well shes found him and youre no hobo the oil port susan and me i blinked at him look sir i might have known it i might have known it the laugh was pretty close to a guffaw thats my daughter never even got round to telling you yet wait till my wife hears this when did she tell you i asked politely when id last seen her about twofifteen that morning i would have thought it the last thing in her mind yesterday afternoon that was even before she had made the job proposal to me but shell get round to it my boy shell get round to it i wont get round to it i didnt know how long she had been standing there but she was there now a stormy voice to match stormy eyes ill never get round to it i must have been mad im ashamed of myself for even thinking i heard him daddy i was there last night with the others in the sick bay when he was telling carreras that the best way of stopping the ticonderoga was a long piercing blast on a whistle brought the tale of carters cowardice to a merciful end immediately green shirted armed men began to appear from other parts of the ticonderoga from the bridge and engine room where theyd been on guard during the transshipment which was now finished except for one last crate two of the men with guns i noticed were dressed in blue merchant navy uniforms those would be the radio officers carreras had introduced aboard the ticonderoga i looked at my watch six twenty five carreras was cutting it fine enough and now carreras himself had jumped across to the afterdeck of the ticonderoga he said something to captain brace i couldnt hear what it was but i could see brace his face hard and grim nodding reluctantly carreras arranging for the transfer of the coffins on his way back to the rail he stopped beside me you see that miguel carteras keeps his words everybody safely transferred he glanced at his watch i still need a lieutenant goodbye carreras he nodded turned on his heel and left as his men brought the coffins on to the afterdeck of the ticonderoga they handled them very reverently indeed with a tender delicacy that showed they were only too aware of their contents the coffins were not immediately recognisable as such in the final gesture of the consummate actor paying the minutest attention to the last detail in his role he had draped them with three stars and stripes knowing carreras i was pretty sure that hed brought them all the way from the caribbean captain brace stooped lifted a corner of the flag on the coffin nearest to him and looked down at the brass plaque with the name of senator hoskins on it i heard a quick indrawing of breath saw that susan beresford hand to her parted lips was staring down wideeyed at it too remembered that she must be still under the impression that the twister was inside reached out and grabbed her ankle i grabbed it hard be quiet i muttered fiercely for heavens sake shut up she heard me she kept quiet her old man heard me but he kept quiet also which must have taken quite a bit of doing on his part when he saw me with my hand round his daughters ankle but the ability to keep expressions and emotions buttoned up must be among the most elementary training for an aspiring multimillionaire the last of carreras men were gone carreras with them he didnt waste any time wishing us bon voyage or anything of the kind he just ordered ropes cast off and disappeared at speed for the bridge a minute later the campari was under way and her afterdeck haphazardly packed with crates was slewing round and heading away towards the east well bullen said into the heavy silence there he goes the murderer with my ship damn his soul he wont have it for long i said not even half an hour captain brace i advise you well dispense with your advice mister captain bullens voice was a series of rattraps snapping shut the blue eyes very frosty indeed this is urgent sir its imperative that captain brace i gave you a direct order mr carter you will obey will you please be quiet captain bullen respectful exasperation but more exasperation than respect i still think youd better be listening to him sir the bosun put in gravely unhappy mr carter was not idle last right unless im much mistaken thanks bosun i turned to captain brace again phone the officer of the watch due west degrees from the campari and full speed no emergency power now captain brace the urgency in my voice got through for a person who had just lost one hundred and fifty million dollars in gold brace reacted surprisingly quickly and well to the man who had just caused him to lose it he gave a few quick words of instruction to a junior officer then turned a coldly speculative gaze on me your reasons sir in number four hold of the campari carreras is carrying an armed atomic bomb with the time fuse running out the twister the new missile stolen from the americans a week or so ago a glance round the strained incredulous faces of the listeners showed that they knew what i was talking about all right it showed clearly that they couldnt believe it the twister atomic bomb braces voice was harsh and too loud what damned rubbish will you listen miss beresford am i telling the truth youre telling the truth her voice was unsteady her green eyes jumpy and still on that coffin i saw it captain but so i said the bomb armed due to go off ini glanced at my watchless than twentyfive minutes carreras knows its due to go off then thats why hes in such a tearing hurry to get away he imagines the twister is aboard here and thats why im in such a tearing hurry to go in the opposite direction i know its not but it is here said susan violently it is you know it is that coffin there youre wrong miss beresford the ticonderoga was picking up speed now the rumbling thrust of her propellor shaft vibrating through the deck plates i wouldnt have put it past carreras to have had his glasses trained on our afterdeck as long as he possibly could so i lay quietly where i was for the next ten or fifteen seconds while about forty pairs of frankly terrified eyes stared at the flagshrouded coffins then the poop of the ticonderoga had swung round to the east the campari was blocked from sight and i was out of my blankets ripping off the outside blankets and splints and fishing out the concealed screw driver before getting stiffly to my feet the effect upon passengers and crew who had believed implicitly that chief officer carter had a compound fracture of the thigh was startling to say the least but i had no time to consider effects i hobbled to the nearest coffin and pulled the flag clear mr cartercaptain brace was by my sidewhat on earth are you doing criminal though carreras may be he told me senator hoskins ha i said with the handle of the screw driver i rapped out three sharp double knocks on the lid of the coffin three knocks came in reply i glanced round the everclosing ring of watchers a cameraman should have been there recording those expressions for posterity remarkable recuperative powers those american senators i said to captain brace you just cant keep them down youll see id the lid off that coffin in two minutes flat in coffinlid removing as in everything else practice makes perfect dr slingsby caroline was as pale as any corpse id ever seen he looked as if he had been frightened to death i didnt blame him there must be lots of harrowing experiences calculated to drive a man round the bend but i think being screwed down in a coffin for about five hours must beat the lot dr caroline wasnt yet round the bend but hed been approaching it pretty fast with the throttle wide open by the time i got to him he was shaking like a broken bedspring his eyes wide with fear and he could hardly speak that knock of mine must have been the sweetest music hed ever heard i left the ministrations to other hands and headed for the next coffin the lid on this one was either pretty stiff or i was pretty weak and i wasnt making much progress when a burly seaman from the ticonderogas crew took the driver from my hand i wasnt sorry to let it go i looked at my watch seventeen minutes to seven and this time mr carter it was captain brace once more at my elbow a man whose expression clearly showed that his mind had given up trying to cope it was understandable enough conventional explosive with a time setting i think its meant to blow up the twister in sympathetic detonation if the twisters own time mechanism doesnt work frankly i dont know the thing is that even this could sink the ticonderoga couldnt we couldnt we just heave it over the side he asked nervously not safe sir about due to go off and the jar of its hitting the water might be just enough to trigger off the clock it would blow a hole the size of a barn through the side of your ship you might get someone to unscrew the third lid too i looked at my watch again fifteen minutes to seven the campari was already hardly more than a dark smudge far down on the lightening horizon to the east six perhaps seven miles away a fair distance off but not far enough the lid was clear of the second coffin i pulled back the covering blankets located the primer and the two slender leads to the inset detonator and gingerly sliced through these one at a time with a knife just to be on the safe side i threw detonator and primer over the side two minutes later id rendered the time bomb in the third coffin equally harmless i looked round the afterdeck if those people had any sense the place should have been deserted by now no one seemed to have stirred an inch mr carter bullen said slowly hed stopped glaring at me i think perhaps you owe us a little explanation this business of dr caroline the coffins thethe substitutions so i gave it to him highly condensed while everybody crowded round and at the end he said and i think maybe i might owe you a small apology contrite but not going overboard about it but i cant get the thought of the twister out of my headthe twister and the campari she was a good ship mister damn it i know carreras is a villain a monster a man surrounded by cutthroats but did you have to do it this way to condemn them all to death forty lives on your hands better than a hundred and fifty lives on carreras hands julius beresford said sombrely which is what it would have been but for our friend here couldnt be done sir i said to bullen the twister was armed and locked in position carreras has the key the only way to render that bomb safe would be to tell carreras and let him unlock it if wed told him before hed left here sure hed have disarmed it then he would have killed every man and woman on the ticonderoga you can bet what you like that the generalissimos last instruction was no one must live to talk about this its still not too late bullen said insistently he wasnt giving a damn about carreras but he loved the campari once were under way theres no chance of his being able to board us again and kill us even assuming he comes after us we can dodge whatever shells one moment sir i interrupted how do we warn him by radio man by radio theres still six minutes get a message the ticonderogas transmitters are useless i said wearily theyre smashed beyond repair what brace caught my arm what smashed how do you know use your head i said irritably those two bogus wireless operators were under orders to wreck the transmitters before they left do you think carreras wanted you sending out soss all over the atlantic the moment he took off the thought hadnt even occurred to me brace shook his head and spoke to a young officer on the phone you heard cheek he checked and was back in thirty seconds his face grave hes right sir completely smashed our friend carreras i murmured his own executioner two seconds later and five minutes ahead of schedule the campari blew itself out of existence she must have been at least thirteen miles away she was well hulldown over the horizon and the high square bulk of the ticonderogas raised poop lay in our direct line of sight but for all that the searing bluewhite glare that was the heart of the exploding bomb struck at our cringing wounded eyes with all the strength of a dozen noonday suns while it momentarily highlit the ticonderoga in blinding white and shadows blacker than night as if some giant searchlight had been switched on only yards away the intense whiteness the murderous dazzlement lasted no more than the fraction of a second though its imprint on the eyes retina lasted many times longer and was replaced by a single barstraight column of glowing red fire that streaked up into the dawn until it pierced the cloud above and following that a great column of boiling seethingwhite water surged up slowly from the surface of the sea incredibly slowly seemed to reach halfway up to the clouds then as slowly began to fall again what little was left of the shattered and vaporised campari would have been in that gigantic waterspout the campari and carreras from birth to death that waterspout must have taken a full minute and it was only seconds after it had vanished and the eastern horizon became clear again that the single flat thunderclap of sound followed by the deep menacing rumble of the afterexplosion and accompanying shock waves came at us over the surface of the sea then all was silence profound and deathly well dr caroline i said conversationally at least you have the satisfaction of knowing that the damned thing works he didnt take me up on my conversational gambit no one took me up on it they were all waiting for the tidal wave but no tidal wave came after a minute or two a long low very fastmoving swell bore down on us from the east passed under the ticonderoga made her pitch heavily perhaps half a dozen times and then was gone it was captain brace who was the first of all of them to find his voice thats it then captain bullen all gone up in smoke your ship and my one hundred and fifty million dollars in gold z just the ship captain brace i said just the ship as for the twenty vaporised generators im sure the united states government will gladly recompense the harms worth and holden electrical engineering company he smiled faintly heaven knows he couldnt have felt like smiling there were no generators in those crates mr carter gold bullion for fort knox how that devil carreras you knew there was gold in those crates i asked of course i did rather i knew we had it on board but there had been a mistake in marking the crates so much damned secrecy i suppose that one hand didnt know what the other hand was doing according to my manifest the crates of gold were the forward twenty on the upper deck but an admiralty message last night informed me of the mistake that had been made rather it informed those damned renegades of radio operators never showed it to me of course they must have radioed the news to carreras and the first thing they did when they tied up alongside was to give him the written message itself as confirmation he gave it to me as a souvenir he added bitterly he held out his hand with the form in it want to see it no need i shook my head i can tell you word for word whats in that cable highest priority urgent immediate repeat immediate attention master fort ticonderoga grave error in loading manifest special cargo not repeat not in forward twenty crates forward deck marked turbines nashville tennessee but repeat but in forward twenty crates afterdeck marked generators oak ridge tennessee indications you may be running into hurricane essential secure afterdeck cargo earliest from the office of the minister of transport by hand of viceadmiral richard hodson director naval operations captain brace stared at me how in the name of miguel carreras also had a manifest in his cabin i said marked and correctly exactly the same as yours i saw it that radio message never came from london it came from me i sent it from the wireless office of the campari at two oclock this morning it was a long silence indeed that followed predictably enough it was susan beresford who finally broke it she moved across to bullens stretcher looked down at him and said captain bullen i think you and i both owe mr carter a very great apology i think we do miss beresford i think we do indeed he tried to scowl but it didnt quite come off but he told me to shut up mind you me his captain you heard him thats nothing she said in dismissal youre only his captain he told me to shut up too and im his fiancee were getting married next month his fiancee getting getting married next month in spite of the pain captain bullen propped himself up on one elbow stared uncomprehendingly at each one of us in turn then lay back heavily on his stretcher well ill be damned this is the first ive heard of this its the first mr carter has heard of it too she admitted but hes hearing it now
