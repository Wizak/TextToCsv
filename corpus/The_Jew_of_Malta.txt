the jew of malta the famous tragedy of the rich iew of malta as it was playd before the king and qveene in his majesties theatre at white hall by her majesties servants at the cockpit written by christopher marlo london printed by i b for nicholas vavasour and are to be sold at his shop in the innertemple neere the church to to my worthy friend master thomas hammon of grays inn etc this play composed by so worthy an author as master marlowe and the part of the jew presented by so unimitable an actor as master alleyn being in this later age commended to the stage as i ushered it unto the court and presented it to the cockpit with these prologues and epilogues here inserted so now being newly brought to the press i was loath it should be published without the ornament of an epistle making choice of you unto whom to devote it than whom of all those gentlemen and acquaintance within the compass of my long knowledge there is none more able to tax ignorance or attribute right to merit sir you have been pleased to grace some of mine own works with your courteous patronage i hope this will not be the worse accepted because commended by me over whom none can claim more power or privilege than yourself i had no better a newyears gift to present you with receive it therefore as a continuance of that inviolable obligement by which he rests still engaged who as he ever hath shall always remain tuissimus tho heywood the prologue spoken at court gracious and great that we so boldly dare mongst other plays that now in fashion are to present this writ many years agone and in that age thought second unto none we humbly crave your pardon we pursue the story of a rich and famous jew who livd in malta you shall find him still in all his projects a sound machiavill and thats his character he that hath past so many censures is now come at last to have your princely ears grace you him then you crown the action and renown the pen epilogue spoken at court it is our fear dread sovereign we have bin too tedious neither cant be less than sin to wrong your princely patience if we have thus low dejected we your pardon crave and if aught here offend your ear or sight we only act and speak what others write the prologue to the stage at the cockpit we know not how our play may pass this stage but by the best of poets in that age the maltajew had being and was made and he then by the best of actors playd in hero and leander one did gain a lasting memory in tamburlaine this jew with others many th other wan the attribute of peerless being a man whom we may rank with doing no one wrong proteus for shapes and roscius for a tongue so could he speak so vary nor ist hate to merit in him who doth personate our jew this day nor is it his ambition to exceed or equal being of condition more modest this is all that he intends and that too at the urgence of some friends to prove his best and if none here gainsay it the part he hath studied and intends to play it epilogue to the stage at the cockpit in graving with pygmalion to contend or painting with apelles doubtless the end must be disgrace our actor did not so he only aimd to go but not outgo nor think that this day any prize was playd here were no bets at all no wagers laid all the ambition that his mind doth swell is but to hear from you by me twas well dramatis personae ferneze governor of malta lodowick his

prologue speaker scene malta the jew of malta enter machiavel machiavel albeit the world think machiavel is dead yet was his soul but flown beyond the alps and now the guise is dead is come from france to view this land and frolic with his friends to some perhaps my name is odious but such as love me guard me from their tongues and let them know that i am machiavel and weigh not men and therefore not mens words admird i am of those that hate me most though some speak openly against my books yet will they read me and thereby attain to peters chair and when they cast me off are poisond by my climbing followers i count religion but a childish toy and hold there is no sin but ignorance birds of the air will tell of murders past i am ashamd to hear such fooleries many will talk of title to a crown what right had caesar to the empery might first made kings and laws were then most sure when like the dracos they were writ in blood hence comes it that a strongbuilt citadel commands much more than letters can import which maxim had phalaris observd had never bellowd in a brazen bull of great ones envy o the poor petty wights let me be envied and not pitied but whither am i bound i come not i to read a lecture here in britain but to present the tragedy of a jew who smiles to see how full his bags are crammd which money was not got without my means i crave but this grace him as he deserves and let him not be entertaind the worse because he favours me exit act i barabas discovered in his countinghouse with heaps of gold before him barabas so that of thus much that return was made and of the third part of the persian ships there was the venture summd and satisfied as for those samnites and the men of uz that bought my spanish oils and wines of greece here have i pursd their paltry silverlings fie what a trouble tis to count this trash well fare the arabians who so richly pay the things they traffic for with wedge of gold whereof a man may easily in a day tell that which may maintain him all his life the needy groom that never fingerd groat would make a miracle of thus much coin but he whose steelbarrd coffers are crammd full and all his lifetime hath been tired wearying his fingers ends with telling it would in his age be loath to labour so and for a pound to sweat himself to death give me the merchants of the indian mines that trade in metal of the purest mould the wealthy moor that in the eastern rocks without control can pick his riches up and in his house heap pearl like pebblestones receive them free and sell them by the weight bags of fiery opals sapphires amethysts jacinths hard topaz grassgreen emeralds beauteous rubies sparkling diamonds and seldseen costly stones of so great price as one of them indifferently rated and of a carat of this quantity may serve in peril of calamity to ransom great kings from captivity this is the ware wherein consists my wealth and thus methinks should men of judgment frame their means of traffic from the vulgar trade and as their wealth increaseth so inclose infinite riches in a little room but now how stands the wind into what corner peers my halcyons bill ha to the east yes see how stand the vanes east and by south why then i hope my ships i sent for egypt and the bordering isles are gotten up by nilus winding banks mine argosy from alexandria loaden with spice and silks now under sail are smoothly gliding down by candyshore to malta through our mediterranean sea but who comes here enter a merchant how now merchant barabas thy ships are safe riding in maltaroad and all the merchants with other merchandise are safe arrivd and have sent me to know whether yourself will come and custom them barabas the ships are safe thou sayst and richly fraught merchant they are barabas why then go bid them come ashore and bring with them their bills of entry i hope our credit in the customhouse will serve as well as i were present there go send em threescore camels thirty mules and twenty waggons to bring up the ware but art thou master in a ship of mine and is thy credit not enough for that merchant the very custom barely comes to more than many merchants of the town are worth and therefore far exceeds my credit sir barabas go tell em the jew of malta sent thee man tush who amongst em knows not barabas merchant i go barabas so then theres somewhat come sirrah which of my ships art thou master of merchant of the speranza sir barabas and sawst thou not mine argosy at alexandria thou couldst not come from egypt or by caire but at the entry there into the sea where nilus pays his tribute to the main thou needs must sail by alexandria merchant i neither saw them nor inquird of them but this we heard some of our seamen say they wonderd how you durst with so much wealth trust such a crazed vessel and so far barabas tush they are wise i know her and her strength but go go thou thy ways discharge thy ship and bid my factor bring his loading in exit merchant and yet i wonder at this argosy enter a second merchant second merchant thine argosy from alexandria know barabas doth ride in maltaroad laden with riches and exceeding store of persian silks of gold and orient pearl barabas how chance you came not with those other ships that saild by egypt second merchant sir we saw em not barabas belike they coasted round by candyshore about their oils or other businesses but twas ill done of you to come so far without the aid or conduct of their ships second merchant sir we were wafted by a spanish fleet that never left us till within a league that had the galleys of the turk in chase barabas o they were going up to sicily well go and bid the merchants and my men despatch and come ashore and see the fraught dischargd second merchant i go exit barabas thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea and thus are we on every side enrichd these are the blessings promisd to the jews and herein was old abrahams happiness what more may heaven do for earthly man than thus to pour out plenty in their laps ripping the bowels of the earth for them making the seas their servants and the winds to drive their substance with successful blasts who hateth me but for my happiness or who is honourd now but for his wealth rather had i a jew be hated thus than pitied in a christian poverty for i can see no fruits in all their faith but malice falsehood and excessive pride which methinks fits not their profession haply some hapless man hath conscience and for his conscience lives in beggary they say we are a scatterd nation i cannot tell but we have scambled up more wealth by far than those that brag of faith theres kirriah jairim the great jew of greece obed in bairseth nones in portugal myself in malta some in italy many in france and wealthy every one ay wealthier far than any christian i must confess we come not to be kings thats not our fault alas our numbers few and crowns come either by succession or urgd by force and nothing violent oft have i heard tell can be permanent give us a peaceful rule make christians kings that thirst so much for principality i have no charge nor many children but one sole daughter whom i hold as dear as agamemnon did his iphigen and all i have is hers but who comes here enter three jews first jew tush tell not me twas done of policy second jew come therefore let us go to barabas for he can counsel best in these

conquer and kill all so they spare me my daughter and my wealth aside first jew were it for confirmation of a league they would not come in warlike manner thus second jew i fear their coming will afflict us all barabas fond men what dream you of their multitudes what need they treat of peace that are in league the turks and those of malta are in league tut tut there is some other matter int first jew why barabas they come for peace or war barabas haply for neither but to pass along towards venice by the adriatic sea with whom they have attempted many times but never could effect their stratagem third jew and very wisely said it may be so second jew but theres a meeting in the senatehouse and all the jews in malta must be there barabas hum all the jews in malta must be there ay like

barabas we will not banish thee but here in malta where thou gottst thy wealth live still and if thou canst get more barabas christians what or how can i multiply of naught is nothing made first knight from naught at first thou camst to little wealth from little unto more from more to most if your first curse fall heavy on thy head and make thee poor and scornd of all the world tis not our

have they taken all first jew yet brother barabas remember job barabas what tell you me of job i wot his wealth was written thus he had seven thousand sheep three thousand camels and two hundred yoke of labouring oxen and five hundred sheasses but for every one of those had they been valud at indifferent rate i had at home and in mine argosy and other ships that came from egypt last as much as would have bought his beasts and him and yet have kept enough to live upon so that not he but i may curse the day thy fatal birthday forlorn barabas and henceforth wish for an eternal night that clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh and hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes for only i have toild to inherit here the months of vanity and loss of time and painful nights have been appointed me second jew good barabas be patient barabas ay i pray leave me in my patience you that were neer possessd of wealth are pleasd with want but give him liberty at least to mourn that in a field amidst his enemies doth see his soldiers slain himself disarmd and knows no means of his recovery ay let me sorrow for this sudden chance tis in the trouble of my spirit i speak great injuries are not so soon forgot first jew come let us leave him in his ireful mood our words will but increase his ecstasy second jew on then but trust me tis a misery to see a man in such affliction farewell barabas barabas ay fare you well exeunt three jews see the simplicity of these base slaves who for the villains have no wit themselves think me to be a senseless lump of clay that will with every water wash to dirt no barabas is born to better chance and framd of finer mould than common men that measure naught but by the present time a reaching thought will search his deepest wits and cast with cunning for the time to come for evils are apt to happen every day enter abigail but whither wends my beauteous abigail o what has made my lovely daughter sad what woman moan not for a little loss thy father has enough in store for thee abigail nor for myself but aged barabas father for thee lamenteth abigail but i will learn to leave these fruitless tears and urgd thereto with my afflictions with fierce exclaims run to the senatehouse and in the senate reprehend them all and rent their hearts with tearing of my hair till they reduce the wrongs done to my father barabas no abigail things past recovery are hardly curd with exclamations be silent daughter sufferance breeds ease and time may yield us an occasion which on the sudden cannot serve the turn besides my girl think me not all so fond as negligently to forgo so much without provision for thyself and me ten thousand portagues besides great pearls rich costly jewels and stones infinite fearing the worst of this before it fell i closely hid abigail where father barabas in my house my girl abigail then shall they neer be seen of barabas for they have seizd upon thy house and wares barabas but they will give me leave once more i trow
