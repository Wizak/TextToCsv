chapter one shelby knew washington was a crazy town thats why she loved it she could have elegance and history if thats what she wanted or dingy clubs and burlesque on a trip from one side of town to the other she could go from grace and style to mean streets there was always a choice gleaming white monuments dignified state buildings old brick row houses steel and glass boxes statues that had oxidized too long ago to remember what theyd oxidized from cobblestoned streets or watergate but the city hadnt been built around one particular structure for nothing the capitol was the core and politics was always the name of the game washington bustled frantically not with the careless ongoing rush of new york but with a wary lookoveryourshoulder sort of frenzy for the bulk of the men and women who worked there their jobs were on the line from election to election one thing washington was not was a blanket of security thats why shelby loved it security equaled complacency and complacency equaled boredom shed always made it her first order of business never to be bored georgetown suited her because it was yet it wasnt dc it had the energy of youth the university boutiques coffee houses halfprice beer on wednesday nights it had the dignity of age residential streets ivied red brick walls painted shutters neat women walking neat dogs because it couldnt be strictly labeled as part of something else she was comfortable there her shop faced out on one of the narrow cobblestoned streets with her living quarters on the second floor she had a balcony so she could sit out on warm summer nights and listen to the city move she had bamboo slats at the windows so she could have privacy if she chose she rarely did shelby campbell had been made for people for conversations and crowds strangers were just as fascinating to talk to as old friends and noise was more appealing than silence still she liked to live at her own pace so her roommates werent of the human sort moshe dayan was a oneeyed tomcat and auntie em was a parrot who refused to converse with anyone they lived together in relative peace in the cluttered disorder shelby called home she was a potter by trade and a merchant by whim the little shop she had called calliope had become a popular success in the three years since shed opened the doors shed found she enjoyed dealing with customers almost as much as she enjoyed sitting at her potters wheel with a lump of clay and her imagination the paperwork was a matter of constant annoyance but then to shelby annoyances gave life its bite so to her familys amusement and the surprise of many friends shed gone into trade and made an undeniable success of it at six she locked the shop from the outset shelby had made a firm policy not to give her evenings to her business she might work with clay or glazes until the early hours of the morning or go out and mix with the streetlife but the merchant in her didnt believe in overtime tonight however she faced something she avoided whenever possible and took completely seriously when she couldnt an obligation switching off lights as she went shelby climbed the stairs to the second floor the cat leapt nimbly from his perch on the windowsill stretched and padded toward her when shelby came in dinner wasnt far behind the bird fluffed her wings and began to gnaw on her cuttlebone hows it going she gave moshe an absent scratch behind the ears where he liked it best with a sound of approval he looked up at her with his one eye tilting his head so that the patch he wore looked raffish and right yeah ill feed you shelby pressed a hand to her own stomach she was starving and the best she could hope for that evening would be liver wrapped in bacon and crackers oh well she murmured as she went into the kitchen to feed the cat shed promised her mother shed make an appearance at congressman writes cocktail party so she was stuck deborah campbell was probably the only one capable of making shelby feel stuck shelby was fond of her mother over and above the basic love of a child for her parent there were times they were taken for sisters despite the twentyfiveyear difference in their ages the coloring was the same bright red hair too fiery for chestnut too dark for titian while her mother wore hers short and sleek shelby let hers curl naturally with a frizz of bangs that always seemed just a tad too long shelby had inherited her mothers porcelain complexion and smoky eyes but whereas the combination made deborah look delicately elegant shelby somehow came across looking more like a waif whod sell flowers on a streetcorner her face was narrow with a hint of bone and hollow she often exploited her image with a clever hand at makeup and an affection for antique clothes she might have inherited her looks from her mother but her personality was hers alone shelby never thought about being freewheeling or eccentric she simply was her background and upbringing were lodged in washington and overtones of politics had dominated her childhood electionyear pressure the campaign trail that had taken her father away from home for weeks at a time lobbying bills to pass or block they were all part of her past thered been careful childrens parties that had been as much a part of the game as a press conference the children of senator robert campbell were important to his image an image that had been carefully projected as suitable for the oval office and a great deal of the image as shelby remembered had been simple fact hed been a good man fairminded affectionate dedicated with a keen sense of the ridiculous that hadnt saved him from a madmans bullet fifteen years before shed made up her mind then that politics had killed her father death came to everyone even at eleven shed understood that but it had come too soon for robert campbell and if it could strike him who shed imagined was invulnerable it could strike anyone anytime shelby had decided with all the fervor of a young child to enjoy every moment of her life and to squeeze it for everything there was to have since then nothing had changed her analysis so shed go to writes cocktail party at his spacious home across the river and find something there to amuse or interest her shelby never doubted shed succeed shelby was late but then she always was it wasnt from any conscious carelessness or need to make an entrance she was always late because she never finished anything as quickly as she thought she would besides the white brick colonial was crowded filled with enough people that a latecomer wasnt noticed the room was as wide as shelbys entire apartment and twice as long it was done in whites and ivories and creams which added to the sense of uncluttered space a few excellent french landscapes hung on the walls in ornate frames shelby approved the ambience though she couldnt have lived with it herself she liked the scent of the place tobaccos mixed perfumes and colognes the faintest trace of light sweat it was the aroma of people and parties conversations were typical of most cocktail parties clothes other parties golf scores but running through it were murmurs on the price index the current nato talks and the secretary of the treasurys recent interview on face to face shelby knew most of the people there dressed in thin silks or in tailored dark suits she evaded capture by any of them with quick smiles and greetings as she worked her way with practiced skill to the buffet food was one thing she took very seriously when she spotted fingersized quiches she decided her evening wasnt going to be a total loss after all why shelby i didnt even know you were here how nice to see you carol write looking quietly elegant in mauve linen had slipped through the crowd without spilling a drop of her sherry i was late shelby told her returning the brief hug with her mouth full you have a beautiful home mrs write why thank you shelby id love to give you a tour a little later if i can slip away she gave a quick satisfied glance around at the crowd the banner of a washington hostess how are things at your shop fine i hope the congressmans well oh yes hell want to see you i cant tell you how much he loves that urn you made for his office though she had a soft georgian drawl carol could talk as quickly as a new york shopkeeper making a pitch he still says it was the best birthday present i ever bought him now you must mingle carol had shelbys elbow before she could grab another quiche no ones better at keeping conversations moving than you are too much shop talk can simply murder a party there are several people here you know of course but ah heres deborah ill just leave you to her a moment and play hostess released shelby eased back toward the buffet hello mama i was beginning to think youd backed out deborah skimmed a glance over her daughter marveling that the rainbowcolored skirt peasant blouse and bolero looked so right on her when it would have been a costume on anyone else umum i promised shelby cast a connoisseurs eye over the buffet before she made her next choice foods better than i expected shelby get your mind off your stomach with a half sigh deborah hooked arms with her daughter in case you havent noticed there are several nice young men here still trying to marry me off shelby kissed her lightly on the cheek id almost forgiven you for the pediatrician you tried to foist on me he was a very personable young man hmmm shelby decided not to mention that the personable young man had had six pairs of hands all very active besides im not trying to marry you off i just want you to be happy are you happy shelby countered with a quick gleam in her eye why yes absently deborah tightened the diamond stud in her left ear of course i am when are you going to get married ive been married deborah reminded her with a little huff ive had two children and who adore you ive got two tickets for the ballet at the kennedy center next week want to come with me the faint frown of annoyance vanished from deborahs brow how many women she thought had a daughter who could exasperate and please so fully at the same time a clever way to change the subject and id love to can i come to dinner first she asked then beamed a smile to her left hi steve she tested a solid upper arm youve been working out deborah watched her offspring spill charm over the assistant press secretary then dole out more to the newly appointed head of the epa without missing a beat effortless genuine deborah mused no one enjoyed or was enjoyed by a crowd so much as shelby then why did she so scrupulously avoid the oneonone entanglements if it had been simply marriage that shelby avoided deborah would have accepted it but for a long time shed suspected it was something else shelby blocked off deborah would never have wished her daughter unhappiness but even that would have relieved her mind shed watched shelby avoid emotional pain one way or another for fifteen years without pain deborah knew there was never true fulfillment yet she sighed when shelby laughed that smoky careless laugh as she drew out various members of the group shed joined yet shelby was so vital so bright perhaps she was worrying over nothing happiness was a very personal thing alan watched the woman with flaming hair who was dressed like a wealthy gypsy he could hear her laugh float across the room at once sensuous and innocent an interesting face he mused more unique than beautiful what was she he wondered eighteen thirty she didnt seem to belong to a washington party god knows hed been at enough of them to know who did there was nothing sleek or cautious about her that dress hadnt come from one of the accepted shops the political wives patronized and her hair certainly hadnt been styled in any sophisticated salon but she fit in despite the touch of la flair and new york savvy she fit right in but who the hell well senator write gave alan a firm slap on the back its good to see you outside the arena we dont lure you out often enough good scotch charlie alan lifted his glass again it always does the trick it usually takes more than that write corrected you burn a lot of midnight oil alan alan smiled easily no ones moves were secret in washington there seems to be a lot to burn at the moment with a nod for agreement write sipped his drink im interested in your views on breidermans bill coming up next week alan met the congressmans eyes calmly knowing write was one of breidermans leading supporters im against it he said simply we cant afford any more cuts in education well alan you and i know things arent so black and white sometimes the gray area gets too large then its best to go back to basics he didnt want a debate and he discovered he didnt want shop talk it was a poor mood to be in for a senator at a political party but alan macgregor was enough politician to evade questions when it suited him you know i thought i knew everyone here alan glanced idly around the room the woman who seems to be a cross between esmeralda and heidi who is she who write repeated intrigued enough by the description to forget his planned retort and follow alans gaze oh dont tell me you havent met shelby he grinned enjoying the description more now that he knew whom it referred to want an introduction i think ill handle it myself alan murmured thanks alan wandered away moving easily through the groups of people stopping when pressed to like shelby he was made for crowds handshakes smiles the right word at the right time a good memory for faces it was stockintrade for a man whose career hinged on public whim as much as on his own skill and he was skilled alan knew the law was familiar with all its shades and angles though unlike his brother caine also a lawyer alan had been drawn to the theory of law more than the individual cases it had been the overview that had fascinated him how the law or the basis for it the constitution worked for the people politics had caught his imagination in college and even now at thirtyfive with a term in congress behind him and his first term in the senate under way he enjoyed exploring its endless possibilities alone alan myra ditmeyer a supreme court justices wife plucked at his arm as he edged away from a group alan grinned and with the privilege of an old friend kissed her cheek is that an offer she gave one of her booming laughs shaking so that the ruby drops at her ears danced oh you devil if it only could be twenty years you scottish heartbreaker all id need would be twenty years a drop in the bucket her smile was genuine her eyes shrewd as she studied him why dont you have one of those polished cosmopolitan types of yours on your arm tonight i was hoping to talk you into a weekend in puerto vallarta this time myra poked a long scarlet nail into his chest as she laughed it would serve you right if i took you up on it you think im safe she sighed her round finely lined face falling into wistful lines unfortunately true we need to find you someone dangerous alan macgregor a man your age still single she clucked her tongue americans like their presidents tidily married my dear alans grin only widened now you sound like my father that old pirate myra sniffed but a gleam of amusement shone in her eyes still youd be wise to take his advice on a thing or two a successful politician is a couple i should get married to advance my career dont try to outsmart me myra ordered then saw his eyes shift in the direction of a low familiar laugh well well she thought wouldnt that be an interesting match the fox and the butterfly im having a dinner party next week she decided on the spot just a few friends my secretary will call your office with the details patting his cheek with a manyringed hand she moved away to find a strategic spot to watch seeing shelby drift away from the trio she was talking with alan moved in her direction when he was near the first thing he noticed was her scent not floral not spicy or musk but a teasing merging of all three it was more an aura than a perfume and unforgettable shelby had crouched down in front of a curio cabinet her nose pressed close eighteenthcentury china she murmured sensing someone behind her teadust glaze spectacular isnt it alan glanced down at the bowl that seemed to fascinate her then at the crown of vivid red hair it certainly draws attention she looked up over her shoulder and smiled as stunning and unique an allure as her scent hello hello he took the hand she held up strong and hard a paradox with her looks and helped her to her feet he didnt relinquish it as he normally would have done without thinking but continued to hold it as she smiled up at him i got distracted on my way to my objective would you do me a favor his brow lifted there was a ring of both finishing school and the streets in her speech what just stand here in a swift move she steered around him slipped a plate off the buffet and began to fill it every time i start to do this someone sees me and hauls me off i missed my dinner there satisfied she nudged alans arm lets go out on the terrace shelby slipped around the table and through the french doors warm air and the scent of early lilacs moonlight fell over grass that had been freshly mowed and tidily raked there was an old willow with tender new branches that dipped onto the flagstone with a sigh of pure sensual greed shelby popped a chilled shrimp into her mouth i dont know what this is she murmured giving a tiny hors doeuvre a close study have a taste and tell me intrigued alan bit into the finger food she held to his mouth pate wrapped in pastry with a touch of chestnut hmm okay shelby devoured the rest of it im shelby she told him setting the plate on a glass table and sitting behind it im alan a smile lingered on his mouth as he sat beside her where did this street waif come from he wondered he decided he could spend the time to find out and the spring air was a welcome relief from the tobacco smoke and hothouse flowers inside are you going to share any of that shelby studied him as she considered shed noticed him across the room perhaps because he was tall with a naturally athletic build you didnt often see at a washington party you saw carefully maintained builds the kind that spoke of workouts three times a week and racquetball but his was more like a swimmers a channel swimmers long and lean hed cut through currents with little resistance his face wasnt smooth there were a few lines of care in it that complemented the aristocratic cast of his face and his long thin mouth his nose was slightly out of alignment which appealed to her the dark hair and dark eyes made her think of a bronte hero heathcliff or rochester she wasnt sure but he had a thoughtful brooding quality about him that was both restful and distracting shelbys lips curved again sure i guess you earned it what are you drinking alan reached toward the plate scotch straight up i knew you could be trusted shelby took the glass from him and sipped her eyes laughed over the rim the faint breeze played with her hair moonlight starlight suited her she looked for a moment like an elf who might vanish with a puff at will what are you doing here he asked her maternal pressure she told him easily have you ever experienced it his smile was wry and appealing paternal pressure is my specialty i dont imagine theres much difference shelby decided over a full mouth swallowing she rested the side of her face on her palm do you live in alexandria no georgetown really where the moonlight glimmered in her eyes showing him they were as pure a gray as hed ever seen p street funny we havent run into each other in the local market my shops only a few blocks from there you run a shop funky dresses velvet jackets he imagined perhaps jewelry im a potter shelby pushed his glass back across the table a potter on impulse alan took her hand turning it over to examine it small and narrow her fingers were long with the nails clipped short and unpainted he liked the feel of her hand and the look of her wrist under a heavy gold bracelet are you any good im terrific for the first time that she could remember she had to suppress the urge to break contact it ran through her mind that if she didnt he was going to hold her there until she forgot she had other places to go youre not a washington native she continued experimenting by letting her hand stay in his what is it new england massachusetts very good sensing the slight resistance in her hand alan kept it in his as he picked up another hors doeuvre and offered it ah the trace of harvard lingers so did a slight disdain in her voice his eyes narrowed fractionally at it not medicine she speculated as she allowed her fingers to lace with his it was already becoming a very comfortable sensation your palms arent smooth enough for medicine perhaps one of the arts she wondered again noticing that romantically brooding expression in his eyes a dreamer she suspected a man who tended to think things through layer by layer before he acted law alan accepted the careful study as well as the faint surprise on her face disappointed surprised although his voice suited the law she decided smooth and clean with undercurrents that might have been drama or humor but then i suppose my conception of lawyers is at fault mine has jowls and wears tortoiseshell glasses dont you think the law tends to get in the way of a lot of ordinary things his brow lifted in direct harmony with the comer of his mouth such as murder and mayhem those arent ordinary things well maybe mayhem shelby corrected as she took another sip from his glass i suppose i mean the endless red tape of bureaucracy do you know all the forms i have to fill out just to sell my pieces then someone has to read those forms someone else has to file them and someone else has to send out more when the time comes wouldnt it be simpler just to let me sell a vase and make my living difficult when youre dealing with millions alan forgot that he hadnt wanted to debate as he idly toyed with the ring she wore on her pinky not everyone would adhere to a fair profit balance no one would pay taxes and the small businessman would have no more protection than the consumer would its hard to believe filling out my social security number in triplicate accomplishes all that his touch moving in a halffriendly halfseductive manner over her skin was distracting enough but when he smiled when he really smiled shelby decided he was the most irresistible male shed ever encountered perhaps it was that touch of sobriety lurking around the edges of humor theres always a large overlap between bureaucracy and necessity he wondered only for a moment what in hell he was doing having this conversation with a woman who looked like a nineteenthcentury waif and smelled like every mans dream the best thing about rules is the infinite variety of ways to break them shelby gave a trickle of the laughter that had first attracted him i suppose thats what keeps you in business a voice drifted through the open window brisk cool and authoritative nadonley might have his finger on the pulse of americanisraeli relations but he isnt making many friends with his current policy and his frumpy touristclass travel look is wearing a bit thin typical shelby murmured with the shadow of a frown in her eyes clothes are as political as beliefs probably more dark suits white shirt youre a conservative loafers and a cashmere sweater a liberal hed heard that slick arrogance toward his profession before quiet or noisy depending on the occasion normally alan ignored it this time it irked him you tend to simplify dont you only what i dont have any patience with she acknowledged carelessly politicsve been an annoying byproduct of society since before moses debated with ramses the smile began to play around his mouth again shelby didnt know him well enough yet to realize it was a challenging one to think hed nearly given in to the urge to stay home and spend a quiet evening with a book you dont care for politicians its one of the few generalizations im prone to they come in several flavors stuffy zealot hungry shaky ive always found it frightening that a handful of men run this strange world so with a shrug she pushed aside her plate i make it a habit to pretend i really do have control over my own destiny she leaned closer again enjoying the way the shadows of the willow played over his face it was tempting to test the shape and feel of it with her fingers would you like to go back in no alan let his thumb trace lightly over her wrist he felt the quick almost surprised increase of her pulse i had no idea how bored i was in there until i came out here shelbys smile was instant and brilliant the highest of compliments glibly stated youre not irish are you he shook his head wondering just how that mobile pixielike mouth was going to taste scottish good god so am i the shadow crossed her eyes again as a trickle of anticipation ran along her skin im beginning to think its fate ive never been comfortable with fate controlling your own destiny giving in to a rare impulse he lifted her fingers to his lips i prefer the drivers seat she agreed but she let her hand linger there pleasing them both the campbell practicality this time it was alans turn to laugh long and with unbridled amusement to old feuds he said lifting his glass to her undoubtedly our ancestors slaughtered one another to the wailing of bagpipes im of the clan macgregor shelby grinned my grandfather would put me on bread and water for giving you the right time a damn mad macgregor alans grin widened while hers slowly faded alan macgregor she said quietly senator from massachusetts guilty shelby sighed as she rose a pity alan didnt relinquish her hand but stood so that their bodies were close enough to brush close enough to transmit the instant complicated attraction why is that i might have risked my grandfathers fury shelby gave his face another quick study intrigued by the unsteady rate of her own heart yes i believe i would have but i dont date politicians really alans gaze lowered to her mouth then came back to hers he hadnt asked her for one he understood and didnt entirely approve that she was the kind of woman whod do her own asking when it suited her is that one of shelbys rules yes one of the few her mouth was tempting small unpainted and faintly curved as if she considered the entire thing a joke on both of them yes her mouth was tempting but the amusement in her eyes was a challenge instead of doing the obvious alan brought her hand up and pressed his lips to her wrist watching her he felt the quick jerk and scramble of her pulse saw the wariness touched with heat flicker in her eyes the best thing about rules alan quoted softly is the infinite variety of ways to break them hoist with my own petard she murmured as she drew her hand away it was ridiculous shelby told herself to be unsteady over an oldfashioned romantic gesture but there was a look in those dark brown eyes that told her hed done it as much for that purpose as to please himself well senator she began with a firmer voice its been nice its time i put in another appearance inside alan let her get almost to the doors before he spoke ill see you again shelby she stopped to glance over her shoulder its a possibility a certainty he corrected she narrowed her eyes a moment he stood near the glass table with the moon at his back tall dark and built for action his face was very calm his stance relaxed yet she had the feeling if she thumbed her nose at him he could be on her before shed drawn a breath that alone nearly tempted her to try it shelby gave her head a little toss to send the bangs shifting on her forehead the halfsmile he was giving her was infuriating especially since it made her want to return it without a word she opened the doors and slipped inside that she told herself would be the end of that she very nearly believed it chapter two contents prev next shelby had hired a parttime shop assistant almost two years before so shed be free to take an hour or a day off when it suited her mood or to spend several days at a time if it struck her with her craft shed found her answer in kyle a struggling poet whose hours were flexible and whose temperament suited hers he worked for shelby regularly on wednesdays and saturdays and for sporadic hours whenever she called him in return shelby paid him well and listened to his poetry the first nourished his body the second his soul shelby invariably set aside saturdays to toss or to turn clay though she would have been amused if anyone had termed her disciplined she still thought she worked then because she chose to not because shed fallen into a routine nor did she fully realize just how much those quiet saturdays at her wheel centered her life her workroom was at the rear of the shop there were sturdy shelves lining two walls crowded with projects that had been fired to biscuit or were waiting for their turn in the kiln there were rows and rows of glazes her palette of color no less important to her than to any artist there were tools long woodenhandled needles variedshaped brushes firing cones dominating the back wall was a large walkin kiln closed now with its shelves stacked with glazed and decorated pottery in their final firing because the vents were open and the room itself wasnt large the high temperature of the kiln kept the room sultry shelby worked at her wheel in a tshirt and cutoffs with a whitebibbed apron designed to protect her from most of the splatters there were two windows both opening out on the alley so she heard little of the weekend street noises she used the radio for company and with her hair pulled back by a leather thong bent over the wheel with the last clay ball she intended to throw that day perhaps she liked this part of her craft the best taking a lump of clay and forming it into whatever her skill and imagination produced it might be a vase or a bowl squat or slender ridged or smooth it might be an urn that would have to wait for her to add the handles or a pot that would one day hold jasmine tea or spiced coffee possibilities shelby never ceased to be fascinated by them the glazing the adding of color and design appealed to a different part of her nature that was finishing work creative certainly and taxing she could be lavish or frugal with color as she chose using careful detail or bold splashes working the clay was more primitive and therefore more challenging with bare hands she would mold and nudge and coax a formless ball of clay to her own will shelby realized people often did that to one another and to their children in particular she didnt like the idea and focused that aspect of her ego on the clay she would mold flatten and remold until it suited her she preferred people to be less malleable molds were for the inanimate anyone who fit into one too neatly was already half dead shed worked the air bubbles out of the clay it was damp and fresh carefully mixed to give her the right consistency she added the grog coarsely ground bits of broken pottery to increase the stiffness and was ready to begin the moistened bat was waiting using both hands shelby pressed the clay down as the wheel began to turn she held the soft cool earth firmly in cupped hands until it ran true on the wheel allowing herself to feel the shape she wanted to create absorbed she worked with the radio murmuring unheard behind her the wheel hummed the clay spun succumbing to the pressure of her hands yielding to the unrelenting demands of her imagination she formed a thickwalled ring pressing her thumb in the center of the ball then slowly very slowly pulled it upward between her thumb and fingers to form a cylinder she could flatten it into a plate now open it into a bowl perhaps close it into a sphere according to her own pleasure she was both in control and driven her hands dominated the clay as surely as her creativity dominated her she felt the need for something symmetrical poised in the back of her mind was a strong image of masculinity something with clean polished lines and understated elegance she began to open the clay her hands deft and sure slick now with the reddishbrown material a bowl became her objective deep with a wide ridge along the lines of a roman krater handleless the rotation and the pressure of her hands forced the clay wall up the shape was no longer only in her mind as she molded the clay inside and out with skilled hands and an experienced eye she molded the shape into proportion tapering it out for the stem of the base then flattening the time and patience she applied here she took for granted and spared for few other aspects of her life only the energy touched all of her shelby could already envision it finished in a dark jade green with hints but only hints of something softer beneath the surface of the glaze no decoration no fluting or scrolled edges the bowl would be judged on its shape and strength alone when the shape was complete she resisted the urge to fuss too much care was as dangerous as too little turning off the wheel shelby gave the bowl one long critical study before taking it to the shelf she reserved for drying the next day when it was leatherhard shed put it back on the wheel and use her tools to refine it shaving off any unwanted clay yes jade green she decided and with careful inglazing she could produce those hints of softness under the rich bold tone absently she arched her back working out the tiny nagging kinks she hadnt noticed while the wheel was on a hot bath shelby decided before she went out to join some friends in that new little club on m street with a sigh that was as much from satisfaction as weariness she turned then gasped that was quite an education alan slipped his hands out of his pockets and crossed to her do you know what shape youre after when you start or does it come as youre working shelby blew her bangs out of her eyes before she answered she wouldnt do the expected and ask him what he was doing there or how hed gotten in it depends she lifted a brow vaguely surprised to see him in jeans and a sweatshirt the man she had met the night before had seemed too polished for such casual clothes especially for denim white at the stress points from wear the tennis shoes were expensive but they werent new neither was the gold watch at the end of a subtly muscled arm wealth suited him and yet he didnt seem the sort of man whod be careless with it hed know his own bank balance something shelby couldnt claim to what stocks he owned and their market value alan didnt fidget during the survey hed grown too used to being in the public eye to be concerned with any sort of dissection and he thought she was entitled to her turn as hed done little else but stare at her for the last thirty minutes i suppose i should say im surprised to see you here senator since i am a hint of amusement touched her mouth and since i imagine you intended for me to be in acknowledgement he inclined his head you work hard he commented glancing down at her claycoated hands ive always thought artists must burn up as much energy as athletes when the adrenalines flowing i like your shop thanks because the compliment had been simple and genuine shelby smiled fully did you come in to browse in a manner of speaking alan resisted the urge to skim a glance over her legs again they were much much longer than he had imagined it seems i hit closing time your assistant said to tell you hed lock up oh shelby looked over at the windows as if to gauge the time she never wore a watch when she worked using her shoulder she rubbed at an itch on her cheek the tshirt shifted over small firm breasts well one of the benefits of owning the place is to open or close when i choose you can go out and take a look around while i wash up if youd like actually he gathered the short tumbling ponytail into his hand as if testing its weight i was thinking more of dinner together you havent eaten no i havent shelby answered though it hadnt been a question but im not going out to dinner with you senator can i interest you in an orientalstyle crock or a bud vase alan took a step closer enjoying her absolute confidence and the idea that hed be able to shake it after all thats why hed come wasnt it he reminded himself to toss back a few of those clever little potshots shed taken at his profession and there fore at him we could eat in he suggested letting his hand slip from her hair to the back or her neck im not picky alan shelby gave an exaggerated sigh and pretended there werent any pulses of pleasure shooting down her spine from the point where his fingers rubbed in your profession you understand policies foreign policies budget policies defense policies unable to resist she stretched a little under his hand all the twinges in her muscles had vanished i told you mine last night mmmhmm how slender her neck was he thought and the skin there was soft enough to give him a hint how she would feel under that apron and tshirt well then there shouldnt be a problem he must do something physical with his hands she thought fleetingly his werent the palms of a paperpusher the edge in her voice was calculated to combat the attraction and the vulnerability that went with it you strike me as too intelligent a man to require repetition with the slightest pressure he inched shelby toward him its standard procedure to review policies from time to time when i do ill to stop her own forward progress shelby pushed a hand against his chest both of them remembered the state of her hands at the same time and looked down her gurgle of laughter had his eyes lifting back to hers you had it coming she told him smiling her eyes lightened as humor replaced the prickles of tension his shirt had a fairly clear imprint of her hand dead center this she said studying the stain might just be the next rage we should patent it quick got any connections a few he looked down at his shirt then back into her face he didnt mind a bit of dirt when the job called for it itd be an awful lot of paperwork youre right and since i refuse to fill out any more forms than i already have to wed better forget it turning away she began to scrub her hands and arms in a large double sink here strip that off she told him as she let the water continue to run youd better get the clay out without waiting for an answer shelby grabbed a towel and drying her hands went to check her kiln he wondered because of the ease of her order if she made a habit of entertaining halfnaked men in her shop did you make everything in the shop alan scanned the shelves after he tugged the shirt over his head everything in here mmmhmm how did you get started probably with the modeling clay my governess gave me to keep me out of trouble i still got into trouble she added as she checked the vents but i really liked poking at the clay i never had the same feeling for wood or stone she bent to make an adjustment alan turned his head in time to see the denim strain dangerously across her hips desire thudded with unexpected force in the pit of his stomach hows the shirt distracted alan looked back to where water pounded against cotton it surprised him that his heartbeat wasnt quite steady he was going to have to do something about this he decided quite a bit of thinking and reassessing tomorrow its fine after switching off the tap he squeezed the excess water out of the material walking homes going to be interesting halfdressed alan mused as he dropped the shirt over the lip of the sink shelby shot a look over her shoulder but the retort she had in mind slipped away from her he was lean enough so she could have counted his ribs but there was a sense of power and endurance in the breadth of his chest and shoulders the streamlined waist his body made her forget any other man shed ever seen it had been he she realized all at once whom shed been thinking of when shed thrown the clay into that cleanlined bowl shelby let the first flow of arousal rush through her because it was as sweet as it was sharp then she tensed against it rendering it a distant throb she could control youre in excellent shape she commented lightly you should be able to make it to p street in under three minutes at a steady jog shelby thats downright unfriendly i thought is was more rude she corrected as she struggled against a grin i suppose i could be a nice guy and throw it in the dryer for you it was your clay it was your move she reminded him but snatched up the damp shirt okay come on upstairs with one hand she tugged off her work apron tossing it aside as she breezed through the doorway i suppose youre entitled to one drink on the house youre all heart alan murmured as he followed her up the stairs my reputation for generosity precedes me shelby pushed open the door if you want scotch its over there motioning in a vague gesture she headed in the opposite direction if youd rather have coffee the kitchens straight ahead theres a percolator on the counter and a halfpound in the cabinet next to the window with this she disappeared with his shirt into an adjoining room alan glanced around the interest hed felt for the woman was only increased now by her living quarters it was a hodgepodge of colors that should have clashed but didnt bold greens vivid blues and the occasional slash of scarlet bohemian perhaps flamboyant was a better description either adjective fit just as either fit the woman who lived there just as neither fit his lifestyle or his taste there were chunky striped pillows crowded on a long armless sofa a huge standing urn deep blue with wild oversize poppies splashed over the surface held a leafy roosevelt fern the rug was a zigzag of color over bare wood a wall hanging dominated one side of the room of a geometric design that gave alan the impression of a forest fire a pair of impossibly high italian heels lay drunkenly next to an ornately carved chair a mint green ceramic hippopotamus of about three feet in length sat on the other side it wasnt a room for quiet contemplation and lazy evenings but a room of action energy and demand alan turned toward the direction shelby had indicated then stopped short when he saw the cat moshe lay stretched on the arm of a chair watching him suspiciously out of his good eye the cat didnt move a whisker so for a moment alan took him to be as inanimate as the hippo the patch should have looked ridiculous but like the colors in the room it simply suited above the cat hung an octagon cage inside it was a rather drablooking parrot like moshe the bird watched alan with what seemed to be a mixture of suspicion and curiosity with a shake of his head for his own fantasies alan walked up to them fix you a drink he murmured to the cat then with an experts touch he scratched under moshes chin the cats eyes narrowed with pleasure well that shouldnt take more than ten or fifteen minutes shelby announced as she came back in she could hear her cat purring from ten feet away so youve met my roommates apparently why the patch moshe dayan lost his eye in the war doesnt like to talk about it because her tone seemed too careless for deliberate humor alan sent her a searching look she didnt notice as she crossed to the liquor cabinet i dont smell any coffee did you decide on scotch i suppose does the bird talk hasnt said a word in two years shelby splashed liquor into glasses thats when moshe came to live with us auntie ems an expert on holding grudges he only knocked over her cage once auntie em you remember theres no place like home follow the yellow brick road ive always thought dorothys aunt em was the quintessential comfortable aunt here you go walking to him shelby offered the glass thanks her choice of names for her pets reminded him that shelby wasnt altogether the type of woman he thought hed always understood how long have you lived here mmm about three years shelby dropped onto the couch drew up her legs and sat like an indian on the coffee table in front of her were a pair of orangehandled scissors a copy of the washington post opened to the comic section a single earring winking with sapphires what must have been several days worth of unopened mail and a wellthumbed copy of macbeth i didnt put it together last night he said as he moved to join her robert campbell was your father yes did you know him of him i was still in college when he was killed ive met your mother of course shes a lovely woman yes she is shelby sipped the scotch was dark and smooth ive often wondered why she never ran for office herself shes always loved the life he caught it the very very faint edge of resentment that was something to explore later alan decided timing was often the ultimate reason for success or failure in any campaign you have a brother dont you grant for a moment her gaze touched on the newspaper yes he steers clear of washington for the most part a siren screamed outside the window echoing then fading he prefers the relative peace of maine a flicker of amusement crossed her face a secret that intrigued alan instinct told him he wouldnt learn it yet then logic reminded him he had no real interest in her secrets in any case neither of us seem to have inherited the public servant syndrome is that what you call it alan shifted the pillow against his back was cool and satin he imagined her skin would feel like that against his doesnt it fit she countered a dedication to the masses a fetish for paperwork a taste for power it was there again that light arrogance touched with disdain you havent a taste for power just over my own life i dont like to interfere with other peoples alan toyed with the leather thong in her hair until hed loosened it perhaps he had come to debate with her after all she seemed to urge him to defend what hed always believed in do you think any of us go through the cycle without touching off ripples in other lives shelby said nothing as her hair fell free it tickled her neck reminding her of the feel of his fingers on almost the same spot she discovered it was as simple as she had thought it would be to sit beside him with those lean muscles naked and within easy reach its up to everyone to ward off or work with the ripples in their own way she said at length well that does in my philosophy for the day ill see if your shirts dry alan tightened his grip on her hair as she started to rise shelby turned her head to find those brooding considering eyes on her face the ripples havent even started between us he said quietly perhaps youd better start working with them alan shelby kept her voice mild and patient as excitement ripped through her ive already told you nothings going to get started between us dont take it personally she added with a halfsmile youre very attractive im just not interested no with his free hand he circled her wrist your pulse is racing her annoyance was quick mirrored in the sudden flare in her eyes the sudden jerk of her chin im always happy to boost an ego she said evenly now ill get your shirt boost it a little higher he suggested and drew her closer one kiss he thought and hed be satisfied flamboyant overly aggressive women held no appeal for him shelby was certainly that one kiss he thought again and hed be satisfied on all counts she hadnt expected him to be stubborn any more than shed expected that fierce tug of longing when his breath fluttered over her lips she let out a quick sigh of annoyance that she hoped would infuriate him so the senator from massachusetts wants to try his luck with a freethinking artist just for variety relaxing she tilted up her chin all right then she decided shed give him a kiss that would knock him flat right before she bundled him up and hauled him out the door but he didnt touch his lips to hers yet only looked at her why wasnt she handling him she wondered as his mouth slowly lowered why wasnt she then his tongue traced a lazy line over her lips and she wasnt capable of wondering there was nothing more she could do other than close her eyes and experience shed never known anyone to take such care with a kiss and his lips had yet to touch hers the tip of his tongue outlined and tested the fullness of her mouth so softly so slowly all sensation all arousal was centered there how could she have known a mouth could feel so much how could she have known a kiss that wasnt a kiss would make her incapable of moving then he captured her bottom lip between his teeth and her breath started to shudder he nibbled then drew it inside his mouth to suck until she felt the answering unrelenting tug deep inside her there was a rhythm he was guiding her to it and shelby had forgotten to resist his thumb was running up then down over the vein in her wrist his fingertips skimmed the base of her neck the points of pleasure spread out until her whole body hummed with them still his lips hadnt pressed onto her she moaned a low throaty sound that was as much of demand as surrender then they were mouth to mouth spinning from arousal to passion at the instant of contact hed known her mouth would taste like this hot and eager hed known her body would be like this against his soft and strong had that been why hed woken thinking of her had that been why hed found himself standing outside her shop as afternoon was waning into evening for the first time in his life alan found that the reasons didnt matter they were pressed close and that was enough for him her hair carried that undefinable scent he remembered he dove his hands into it as if he would have the fragrance seep into his pores it drove him deeper her tongue met his seeking searching until her taste was all the tastes hed ever coveted the pillows rustled with soft whispers as he pressed her between them and himself she hadnt expected this kind of raw consuming passion from him style she would have expected style and a seduction with all the traditional trimmings those she could have resisted or evaded but there was no resisting a need that had so quickly found and tapped her own there was no evading a passion that had already captured her she ran her hands up his naked back and moaned as the feel of him lit new fires this was something too firm to be molded too hard to be changed the man had styled himself as he had chosen shelby knew it instinctively and felt desire rise for this reason alone but with desire came the knowledge that she was growing too soft too pliant came the fear that he might have already changed her shape with a kiss alan she gathered her forces for resistance when every pore every cell was crying out for her to submit enough she managed against his mouth not nearly he corrected trapping her close when she would have struggled away he was taking her deep again where she had no control over the moment or the outcome of it alan she drew back far enough to see his face i want you to stop her breathing wasnt steady her eyes were dark as smoke but the resistance in her body was very real alan felt a hot flash of anger which he expertly controlled and a sharp stab of desire which he had more trouble with all right he loosened his hold why it was rare for her to have to order herself to do something as natural as relax even after she had there was a light band of tension at the base of her neck you kiss very well she said with forced casualness for a politician shelby let out a little hiss of breath and rose damn him for knowing just what rib to punch and for his skill in punching without raising a sweat pompous shelby told herself pompous smug and selfabsorbed the apartment was nearly dark she flicked on a light surprised that so much time had passed when everything had seemed to happen so quickly alan shelby linked her hands together as she did when shed decided to be patient you didnt answer my question he pointed out and made himself relax against the pillows that brought back memories of her skin perhaps i havent made myself clear enough she fought the urge to say something that would erase that mildly interested look in his eyes damn he was clever she thought grudgingly with words with expressions shed like to come up against him again when her heart wasnt thudding i meant everything i said last night so did i he tilted his head as if to study her from a new angle but maybe like your bird youre quite an expert on holding grudges too when she stiffened the hands that were linked fell apart dont press i generally dont on old wounds the hurt was there he saw it and an anger that was well rooted it was difficult for him to remember hed known her for less than a day and had no right to pry or to expect im sorry he added as he rose her rigidness vanished with the apology he had a way of saying simple things with simple genuineness shelby thought and found she liked him for it if for nothing else its all right she crossed the room and came back moments later with his shirt good as new she promised as she tossed it to him well its been nice dont let me keep you he had to grin am i being helped out the door not bothering to disguise a smile she gave a mock sigh ive always been too obvious good night senator look both ways when you cross the street she went to open the side door that led to the outside stairs alan pulled the shirt over his head before he crossed to her hed always thought it had been his brother caine whod never been able to take a simple no with a polite bow perhaps hed been wrong alan mused and it was a basic macgregor trait the scotch can be stubborn he commented as he paused beside her youll remember im a campbell whod know better shelby opened the door a bit wider then we both know where we stand he cupped her chin in his hand to hold her face still as he gave her a last hard kiss that seemed suspiciously like a threat till next time shelby closed the door behind him and stood leaning against it a moment he was going to be trouble she decided alan macgregor was going to be very serious trouble chapter three contents prev next it turned out to be busy for a monday morning by eleven shelby had sold several pieces including three that she had taken out of the kiln only the evening before between customers she sat behind the counter wiring a lamp she had made in the shape of a greek amphora to have simply sat during the idle time would have been impossible for her to have dusted or fiddled with the displays would have bored her to distraction she left such things to kyle to their mutual satisfaction because it was warm she kept the door of the shop open it was shelby knew more tempting to stroll through an open door than to open a closed one spring came in along with the unique sound of cars riding over cobblestone she had a steady stream of browsers who bought nothing shelby didnt mind they were company as much as potential buyers the woman carrying the manicured poodle in a handknit sweater was an interesting diversion the restless teenager who came in to poke around gave her a chance to touch on the problems of youth and unemployment shelby hired him to wash the windows while she wired the boy stood on the street side running a squeegee over the glass while a portable radio bounced out tunes at his feet she enjoyed the sound as it mixed with the occasional snatches of conversations from passersby did you see the price of that dress if he doesnt call me tonight im going to notes on her lecture on prehitler germany idly she finished the conversations in her head as she worked shelby was threading the wire up the inside of the lamp when myra ditmeyer sauntered in she wore a breezy vermilion suit that matched the shade of her lipstick the powerful punch of her scent filled the little shop well shelby always keeping those clever hands busy with a smile of pure pleasure shelby leaned over the counter to kiss myras powdered cheek if you want some acerbic gossip or just plain fun there was no one in shelbys opinion better than myra i thought youd be home planning all the wonderful things youre going to feed me tonight oh my dear thats all seen to myra set down her alligator bag the cooks in a creative spin even as we speak ive always loved eating at your house shelby pulled the wire through the top of the lamp none of those stingy little meals or inedible sauces disguised as exotic absently she tapped her foot to the beat of the radio you did say mama was coming yes with ambassador dilleneau oh yeah the frenchman with the big ears is that any way to talk about a diplomat shes been seeing him quite a bit shelby said casually ive wondered if im going to have a gallic steppapa you could do worse myra pointed out mmm so tell me myra shelby attached the light fixture to the cord with a few deft turns whove you set up for me tonight set up myra repeated wrinkling her nose what an unromantic phrase sorry how about who are you planning to loose cupids arrows on its still unromantic when youre smirking myra watched shelby screw in a light bulb in any case i think you should be surprised youve always been fond of surprises i like giving better than getting how well i know how old were you eight as i recall when you and grant surprised a small rather influential gathering in your mothers parlor with uncomfortably accurate caricatures of the cabinet it was grants idea shelby said with a lingering twinge of regret that she hadnt thought of it first papa laughed about it for days he had a unique sense of humor as i recall you offered grant two thousand for the one of the secretary of state and the scoundrel wouldnt sell it to me good god she mused what it would be worth now it would depend what name he signed to it wouldnt it how is grant i havent seen him since christmas the same brilliant grumpy a laugh stole through the words guarding his lighthouse fortress and his anonymity i think i might sneak up there and bother him for a couple of weeks this summer such a gorgeous young man myra mused what a waste for him to seclude himself on that little bit of coast its what he wants shelby said simply for now excuse me both women looked toward the door where a young man stood in a crisp messengers uniform shelby glanced at the basket over his arm can i help you miss shelby campbell yes im shelby he shifted the basket he carried from his arm to his hand as he walked to her delivery for you miss campbell thanks automatically she reached into the cash drawer for a dollar whos it from cards inside he told her pocketing the bill enjoy she played the game shelby had been known to study and poke at a package on christmas morning for twenty minutes before ripping off the paper there were such possibilities in the unknown she tilted the package from side to side peered at it then cupped her chin on both hands and stared at it oh come on shelby myra shifted her weight from foot to foot with impatience lift off the cover im dying to see in a minute shelby murmured it might be a picnic whod send me a picnic or a puppy she bent her ear close and listened too quiet for a puppy and it smells like closing her eyes she drew in a deep breath and held it thats funny whod send me she opened the lid strawberries the basket was rich with them plump and moistly red their scent drifted up with memories of the sunwarmed field theyd been plucked from shelby lifted one and held it under her nose savoring wonderful she decided really really wonderful myra plucked one out and bit it neatly in half mmm she popped the rest into her mouth arent you going to read the card still holding the berry shelby lifted out the plain white envelope balancing it in her palm as if testing the weight she turned it over held it up to the light then turned it back to the front shelby oh all right she ripped open the seal and drew out the card shelby they made me think of you alan watching her carefully myra saw the surprise the pleasure and something that wasnt regret or wariness but had aspects of both anyone i know she said dryly when shelby didnt speak what she looked up blankly then shook her head yes i suppose you do but she slipped the card back into the envelope without saying myra the name was on a long drawnout sigh i think im in trouble good she gave shelby a smug smile and a nod its about time you were would you like me to drive my cook crazy and add another name to my list for dinner tonight oh it was tempting shelby nearly agreed before she stopped herself no no i dont think it would be wise only the young think they know anything about wisdom myra stated with a sniff very well then ill see you at seven she chose another berry before she picked up her purse oh and shelby pack up that lamp and bring it along just put it on my account shed have to call him shelby told herself when she was alone dammit shed have to call and thank him she bit into a berry so that the juice and sweetness exploded inside her mouth a sensual taste part sun part earth and she remembered how alans taste had exploded inside her mouth why hadnt he sent her something ordinary like flowers flowers she could have passed off and for gotten she looked down into the basket filled with berries brilliantly red and begging to be tasted how did you deal with a man who sent you a basket of strawberries on a spring morning hed known it of course she decided abruptly a man like him would be a quick and clever judge of people she felt simultaneous twinges of annoyance and admiration she didnt like to be read so easily but she couldnt help respecting someone who could leaving the lid open shelby reached for the phone alan calculated he had between fifteen and twenty minutes before the senate was called back to the floor hed use the time to review the proposed budget cuts a deficit that edged uncomfortably close to twohundred billion had to be trimmed but alan viewed the proposed cuts in education as unacceptable congress had already partially rejected the soughtafter domestic spending cuts and he felt he had enough support to influence a modification on the education snipping there was more on his mind than deficits and budgets however though it was the spring following an election year alan had been approached by the senate majority leader hed been carefully felt out by an expert at saying nothing while hardly pausing for breath it didnt take magic for alan to conclude that he was being considered as the partys hope for the next decade but did he want the top rung hed thought about it he wasnt a fool or without ambition still he had believed if he ever decided to take a grab at the presidential brass ring it would be in another fifteen perhaps twenty years the possibility of making his move sooner at his partys urging was something he would have to weigh carefully nevertheless as far as alans father was concerned there had never been any question that his eldest son would run for president and win daniel macgregor liked to think he still held the strings guiding his offsprings lives sometimes they gave him the gift of his illusions alan could still remember his sisters announcement of her pregnancy that past winter daniels attention was centered on that and the marriage of their brother caine so that the pressure had lifted from alan for now he thought wryly it shouldnt be long before he got one of his fathers famous phone calls your mother misses you she worries about you when are you going to take the time to come visit why arent you married yet your sister cant carry on the line by herself you know that might be simplifying it alan thought with a grin but that would be the essence of the call strange hed always been able to shrug off his fathers views on marriage and children but now why was it a woman hed met only a few days before made him think of marriage people didnt bind themselves willingly to someone they didnt know she wasnt even the type of woman whod appealed to him in the past she wasnt sleek and cool she wouldnt be undemanding or make a comfortable hostess for elegant state dinners she wouldnt be gracious and shed be anything but tactful and alan added with a glimmer of a smile she wouldnt even have dinner with him a challenge she would be a challenge and hed always enjoyed working his way through one but that wasnt why a mystery she was a mystery and hed always liked solving them step by step but that wasnt why she had the verve of the very young the skill of an artist and the flash of a rebel she had passion that boiled rather than simmered and eyes as quiet as a foggy evening she had a childs mouth and a womans allure and a mind that would never adhere to the logical onestepatatime structure of his own the chemistry between them was almost absurdly wrong and yet and yet at thirtyfive alan suddenly believed there was such a phenomenon as love at first sight so he would wage his patience and tenacity against her flash and energy and see who won in the end if indeed there could ever be a winner between oil and water the phone rang beside him alan let it go until he remembered his secretary wasnt in the outer office mildly annoyed he pushed the blinking button and answered senator macgregor thanks his lips curved as he leaned back in his chair youre welcome how do they taste shelby brought a berry to her mouth for a nibble fantastic my shop smells like a strawberry patch dammit alan she said with an exasperated sigh strawberries are an unfair tactic youre supposed to fight with orchids or diamonds i could have coped very nicely with a big tacky diamond or fivedozen african orchids he tapped the pen hed been using on the stack of papers on his desk ill be certain not to give you either when are you going to see me shelby she was silent for a moment torn tempted ridiculous she thought shaking her head just because he had a bit of whimsy under the political protocol was no reason to toss aside a lifelong belief alan it simply wouldnt work im saving us both a lot of trouble by saying no you dont strike me as the type to avoid trouble maybe not im making an exception in your case years from now when you have ten grandchildren and bursitis youll thank me do i have to wait that long for you to have dinner with me she laughed cursing him at the same time i really like you he heard another quick sound of frustration dammit alan dont be charming anymore well both end up on thin ice i just cant take it breaking under me again he started to speak then heard the signal the buzzers and lights that warned of a quorum call shelby i have to go were going to talk about this some more no her voice was firm now as she cursed herself for saying more than she had intended i hate repeating myself its boring just consider that ive done you a favor goodbye alan she hung up then slammed the lid closed on the strawberries oh god she asked herself how had he managed to get to her so quickly while she dressed for myras dinner party shelby listened to an old bogart film she listened only because the television had lost its shaky grip on the horizontal hold two weeks before currently she was amused by the situation it was like having a large rather ostentatious radio that took a great deal more imagination than a fullcolor twentyinch screen while bogey spoke in his weary toughguy voice she slipped her narrow beaded vest over her frilled lace shirt shelby had shoved aside her uncertain mood of the afternoon she had always believed if you simply refused to admit you were upset or to acknowledge depression you wouldnt be upset or depressed in any case she was sure that now that she had made herself crystalclear and had refused alan macgregor for the third time he would get the picture if she regretted the fact that there would be no more baskets of strawberries or surprises she told herself she didnt no one could make shelby believe that something that she said was untrue was really more true than shelby would admit to herself she stepped into a pair of foolish evening shoes that had more heel than leather as she dropped a few essentials into her bag keys a wellused lipstick and a halfroll of life savers are you staying in tonight moshe she asked as she passed by the cat who lounged on her bed when he only opened his eye in acknowledgment she breezed out of the room okay dont wait up shelby dropped her purse on top of the box that held myras lamp and prepared to lift both when someone knocked on the door you expecting someone she asked auntie em the bird merely fluttered her wings unconcerned hefting the box shelby went to answer pleasure she had to acknowledge it as well as annoyance when she saw alan another neighborly visit she asked planting herself in the doorway she skimmed a glance down the silk tie and trim dark suit you dont look dressed for strolling the sarcasm didnt concern him hed seen that quick flash of unguarded pleasure as a public servant i feel an obligation to conserve our natural resources and protect the environment reaching over he clipped a tiny sprig of sweet pea into her hair im going to give you a lift to the ditmeyers you might say were carpooling shelby could smell the fragrance that drifted from just above her right ear she had an urge to put her hand up and feel the small blossoms since when she demanded of herself had she been so vulnerable to charm youre going to myras little gettogether yes are you ready shelby narrowed her eyes trying to figure out how myra could have learned the name of the strawberry sender when did she ask you hmm he was distracted by the way the thin lace rose at her neck last week at the writes some of her suspicions eased perhaps it was just coincidence after all well i appreciate the offer senator but ill drive myself see you over the canapés then ill ride with you he said amiably we dont want to put any more carbon monoxide in the air than necessary shall i put that in the car for you shelby took a firmer grip on the box as her hold in other areas started to slip it was that damn serious smile and those thoughtful eyes she decided they made a woman feel as though she were the only one hed ever looked at in quite that way alan she began a bit amused by his persistence what is this this he leaned over and captured her mouth with his lingering until her fingers threatened to dig holes in the stiff cardboard she held is what our ancestors would have called a siege he finished softly and macgregors are notoriously successful at laying siege her breath shuddered out to merge with his you dont do badly at handtohand combat either he chuckled and would have kissed her again if she hadnt managed to step back all right shelby thrust the box into his arms considering it a strategic move well carpool i dont want to be condemned as an airpolluter you drive she decided with a sudden moodswitching grin then i can have an extra glass of wine at dinner you left your tv on alan commended as he stepped aside to let her pass thats all right its broken anyway shelby clattered down the steps heedless of her fragile heels and the steep drop the sun had nearly set sending wild streaks of red into a darkening sober sky shelby laughed turning back to alan when she reached the narrow alleyway carpool my foot but its still not a date macgregor what well call this is a a civilized transit agreement that sounds bureaucratic enough i like your car she added patting the hood of his mercedes very sedate alan opened the trunk and set the box inside he glanced back up at shelby as he closed it you have an interesting way of insulting someone she laughed that free smokeedged laugh as she went to him dammit alan i like you throwing her arms around his neck she gave him a friendly hug that sent jolts of need careening through him i really like you she added tilting back her head with a smile that lit her whole face with a sense of fun i could probably have said that to a dozen other men whod never have realized i was insulting them so his hands settled at her hips i get points for perception and a few other things when her gaze slipped to his mouth she felt the strength of longing weaken all the memories and all the vows im going to hate myself for this she murmured but i want to kiss you again here while the lights fading her eyes came back to his still smiling but darkened with an anticipation he knew had nothing to do with surrender ive always thought you could do mad things at dusk without any consequences tightening her arms around his neck shelby pressed her mouth to his he was careful very careful not to give in to the urgent desire to drag her closer this time hed let her lead him and in doing so lead herself where he wanted them both to go the light was softly dying there was an impatient honking from the street on the other side of the shop through the window of the apartment across the alley came the rich tang of spaghetti sauce and the bluesy sounds of an old gershwin record straining closer shelby felt the fast even beat of alans heart against her own his taste was the same quietly debilitating flavor as she remembered shelby could hardly believe shed lived for so long without knowing that one particular taste it seemed less possible shed be able to live without it now or the feel of those strong steady arms around her the firm body that transmitted safety and danger to her at the same time hed know how to protect her if something threatened he knew how to take her to the brink of an abyss shed so cleverly avoided and shelby was too aware that he could take her over the edge but his mouth was so tempting his taste so enticing and dusk was still holding back the night sky she gave herself to it longer than she should have and not as long as she wanted to alan he felt his name form against his lips before she drew away their gaze held a moment while his arms and hers kept their bodies pressed close there was strength in his face a face she could trust but there was so much between them wed better go shelby murmured its nearly dark the ditmeyers home was lit though there was still color in the western sky shelby could just see the riot of phlox in the rock garden as she stepped from the car her mother was already there shelby discovered when she caught a glimpse of the diplomatic plates on the lincoln in the drive you know ambassador dilleneau shelby offered her hand to alan as they stepped onto the walk slightly hes in love with my mother she brushed her bangs out of her eyes as she turned to him men are typically but i think she has a soft spot for him that amuses you watching her alan pressed the doorbell a little she admitted its rather sweet she blushes shelby added with a quick laugh its a very odd feeling for a daughter to see her mother blush over a man you wouldnt alan skimmed a thumb over her cheekbone shelby forgot her mother altogether wouldnt what blush he said softly tracing her jawline over a man once i was twelve and he was thirtytwo she had to talk just keep talking to remember who she was he uh came to fix the water heater howd he make you blush he grinned at me he had a chipped tooth i thought was really sexy on a quick ripple of laughter alan kissed her just as myra opened the door well well she didnt bother to disguise a selfsatisfied smile good evening i see you two have met what makes you think that shelby countered breezily as she stepped inside myra glanced from one to the other do i smell strawberries she asked sweetly your lamp shelby gave her a bland look and indicated the box alan carried where would you like it oh just set it down there alan its so nice to have just a few friends in myra continued as she tucked an arm through each of theirs gossip is so much more intimate that way herbert pour two more of those marvelous aperitifs you must try it she added to both shelby and alan ive just discovered this marvelous little blackberry liqueur herbert shelby walked over to the justice and gave him a smacking kiss youve been out sailing again she grinned at his sunburned nose when are we going to the beach to windsurf the child almost makes me believe i could do it he commented as he gave her a squeeze good to see you alan his face folded into comfortable grandfatherly lines that made people forget he was one of the top judiciary figures in the country i think you know everyone ill just get those drinks hello mama shelby bent to kiss her mothers cheek when the emerald clusters on deborahs ears caught her eye i havent seen these before id have borrowed them immediately anton gave them to me a delicate color seeped into her cheeks in appreciation for that party i hostessed for him i see shelbys gaze shifted to the trim frenchman beside her mother you have exquisite taste ambassador she told him as she offered her hand his eyes twinkled as he brought it to his lips a trait that made up for the ears as far as shelby was concerned you look lovely as always shelby senator a pleasure to see you in such a relaxed atmosphere senator macgregor deborah smiled up at him i didnt realize you and shelby were acquainted were working on disrupting an old family tradition he accepted the glass the justice offered he means feud shelby explained at her mothers blank look she sipped the liqueur approved it then sat on the arm of myras chair oh oh deborah repeated as she remembered the campbells and the macgregors were blood enemies in scotland though i cant quite remember why they stole our land alan put in mildly thats what you say shelby shot him a look as she sipped again we acquired macgregor land through a royal decree they werent good sports about it alan gave her a thoughtful smile id be interested to hear you debate that issue with my father what a match myra said brightening at the thought herbert can you just see our shelby nosetonose with daniel all that red hair and stubbornness you really should arrange it alan ive been giving it some thought have you shelbys brows lifted to disappear completely under her frizz of bangs quite a bit of thought he said in the same even tone ive been to that wonderful anachronism in hyannis port myra gave shelby a brief pat on the thigh its right up your alley dear shes so fond of the well lets say unique shall we yes deborah sent shelby a fond smile i could never figure out why but then both of my children have always been a mystery perhaps its because theyre so bright and clever and restless im always hoping theyll settle down this time she beamed the smile at alan youre not married either are you senator if youd like shelby said as she studied the color of her liqueur through the crystal i could just step out while you discuss the terms of the dowry shelby really deborah murmured over the sound of the justices chuckle its so difficult for parents to see their children as capable adults the ambassador commented in his light soothing voice for myself i have two daughters with children of their own still i worry how are your children myra you have a new grandson dont you nothing could have been better calculated to change the subject shelby sent him a faint admiring nod and watched his eyes twinkle as myra began an enthusiastic description of her grandsons first tooth hed suit her shelby decided watching her mother from under her lashes she was the type of woman who never felt quite whole without a man and shed been shaped and polished into a political wife years before the gloss was still there elegant manners elegant style elegant patience shelby gave a little sigh she didnt even hear how could she and her mother look so much alike and be so very different elegance had always seemed a silklined cage to shelby and a cage equaled restrictions no matter how it was formed she still remembered too many of them the bodyguards discreet but always there the carefully screened parties the sophisticated alarm systems the intrusion of the press the security hadnt saved her father though a photographer had gotten an awardwinning picture of the gunman seconds too late to do any good shelby knew what was behind the elegance the state dinners the speeches the galas there were a hundred tiny fears a millennium of doubts the memory of too many political assassinations and assassination attempts in hardly more than twenty years no her mother was made for the life patient with a rod of steel beneath the fragile skin shelby wouldnt choose it nor would she let it choose her shed love no one who could leave her again so horribly letting the conversation flow around her shelby tilted back her glass her eyes met alans it was there that quietly brooding patience that promised to last a lifetime she could almost feel him calmly peeling off layer after layer of whatever bits and pieces made up her personality to get to the tiny core she kept private you bastard she nearly said it out loud certainly it reflected in her eyes for he smiled at her in simple acknowledgment the siege was definitely under way she only hoped she had enough provisions to outlast him chapter four contents prev next shelby put in a very full week dominated by the creative overload she experienced every few months kyle managed the shop for three days running while she closeted herself in her workroom to sit for hours at the wheel or with her glazes if she started at am shelby still had enough juice to toss clay until late into the night she knew herself well enough to understand and to accept that this sort of mood struck her when she was having trouble blocking out something that worried her when she worked she would focus both mind and emotion on the project in her hands and in that way whatever problem she had simply ceased to be a problem for that amount of time normally when shed run out of steam shed come up with a solution not this time the impetus that had driven her most of the week dried up late friday night alan was still lodged in her mind he shouldnt have been shelby could tell herself that as impatiently as she liked but it didnt change the fact that he was as firmly in her thoughts as he had been when theyd last been together it hadnt mattered that shed managed to keep the rest of the evening at the ditmeyers casual alan had still stopped her in her tracks with one of those slow devastating kisses at her side door he hadnt insisted on coming in shelby might have been grateful for that if she hadnt suspected it was just part of his planned siege confuse the enemy assail her with doubts leave her with her nerve ends tingling very clever strategy hed been in boston for several days shelby knew because hed called to tell her he was going though shed given him no encouragement she told herself it was a respite if he was a few hundred miles away he couldnt be popping up on her doorstep unexpectedly she told herself when and if he popped up again shed keep the door locked she wanted badly to believe she could then halfway through the week the pig had come a big lavender stuffed pig with a foolish grin and velvet ears shelby had tried to toss it into a closet and forget it he seemed to know that the way to get to her was through her sense of the ridiculous she hadnt thought he had one he shouldnt have but there it was what was a man who had such stuffy straightline views on rules and order doing buying stuffed animals anyway shed nearly softened it was nice to know he was capable of such a gesture particularly since it was so out of character it was nice to know that she was the one who brought out that side of him but there was no way alan was going to weaken her resolve with a silly toy that was meant for children or softheaded women she called it macgregor and kept it on her bed a joke on both of them she thought the pig was the only macgregor she was going to sleep with but she dreamed of him at night in her big brass bed no matter how hard she had worked no matter how many friends she had been with it always came back to alan once she imagined there were a dozen of him surrounding her town house she couldnt go out without being captured she couldnt stay in without going mad she woke cursing him and his sieges and her own fertile imagination by the end of the week shelby promised herself she wouldnt accept any more deliveries and would simply hang up when she heard alans voice on the phone if reason and patience hadnt gotten through to him downright rudeness would even a macgregor had to have some common sense because of the schedule shed put herself on the week before shelby had given kyle the keys to the shop with instructions that he open up at ten on saturday she was sleeping in there wasnt any need to go into her workroom even if some of the creative juices had still been flowing in the past few days she had accumulated enough inventory to last for weeks now she would put as much thought and energy into being lazy as she had put into slaving shelby heard the knock on the door and shifting under the sheets considered ignoring it still halfasleep she tumbled out of bed it simply wasnt in her makeup to let a ringing phone or a knock go unanswered because she tripped over the robe shed thrown on the floor the night before shelby remembered to tug it on as she walked from the room with her eyes narrowed protectively against the sunlight she opened the door morning miss campbell another delivery the boy who had brought her both the strawberries and the pig stood in the doorway and grinned thanks too disoriented to remember her vow shelby reached out he handed her the boundtogether strings of twodozen pink and yellow balloons he was gone and shelby was back inside before she woke up enough to realize what had happened oh no looking up she watched the balloons dance at the tops of their strings hanging by a ribbon at the end was a little white card she wouldnt even open it she told herself she knew who they were from anyway who else no she wasnt going to open it in fact she was going to find a pin and pop every last balloon what were they but a bunch of hot air it was ridiculous to prove a point shelby let the strings go so the balloons drifted up to the ceiling if he thought he was going to win her over with silly presents and clever little notes he was absolutely right dammit shelby jumped up swearing when she missed the strings by inches hauling over a chair she climbed into it and grabbed the card the yellows for sunshine the pinks for spring share them with me alan you drive me crazy she muttered standing in the chair with the balloons in one hand and the card in the other how did he know how could he know just the sort of thing that would get to her strawberries and pigs and balloons it was hopeless shelby stared up at them wishing she didnt need to smile it was time to be firm very very firm she told herself as she stepped down if she ignored it hed just send her something else so shed call him and tell him no shed demand that he stop shed say he was annoying no boring her boring was unforgivably insulting shelby twisted the balloon strings around her wrist as she reached for the phone hed given her his home number which shed refused to write down of course she remembered every digit as she pushed buttons shelby worked herself into her haughtiest mood hello her mood deflated as if shed been pricked with a pin alan shelby she struggled not to be moved by the quiet serious tone that should never have moved her she liked men with a laugh in their voice alan this has to stop does is it hasnt even started alan she tried to remember her decision to be firm i mean it you have to stop sending me things youre only wasting your time i have a bit to spare he said mildly how was your week busy listen i i missed you the simple statement threw the rest of her lecture into oblivion alan dont every day he continued every night have you been to boston shelby uh yes she managed busy fighting off the weakness creeping into her helplessly she stared up at the balloons how could she fight something so insubstantial it floated id like to take you there in the fall when it smells of damp leaves and smoke shelby told herself her heart was not fluttering alan i didnt call to talk about boston now to put it in very simple terms i want you to stop calling me i want you to stop dropping by and her voice began to rise in frustration as she pictured him listening with that patient serious smile and calm eyes i want you to stop sending me balloons and pigs and everything is that clear perfectly spend the day with me did the man never stop being patient she couldnt abide patient men for gods sake alan well call it an experimental outing he suggested in the same even tone not a date no she said barely choking back a laugh couldnt abide it she tried to remember she preferred the flashy the freewheeling no no no not bureaucratic enough his voice was so calm so so senatorial she decided she wanted to scream but the scream bubbled perilously close to another laugh all right let me think a standard daytime expedition for furthering amiable relations between opposing clans youre trying to be charming again shelby muttered am i succeeding some questions were best ignored i really dont know how to be more succinct alan was that part of the appeal he wondered the fact that the freespirited gypsy could turn into the regal duchess in the blink of an eye he doubted she had any notion she was as much one as the other you have a wonderful speaking voice what time will you be ready shelby huffed and frowned and considered if i agree to spend some time with you today will you stop sending me things alan was silent for a long moment are you going to take a politicians word now she had to laugh all right youve boxed me in on that one its a beautiful day shelby i havent had a free saturday in over a month come out with me she twined the phone cord around her finger a refusal seemed so petty so badnatured he was really asking her for very little and dammit she wanted to see him all right alan every rule needs to be bent a bit now and again to prove its really a rule after all if you say so where would you like to go theres an exhibition of flemish art at the national gallery shelbys lips curved the zoo she said and waited for his reaction fine alan agreed without missing a beat ill be there in ten minutes with a sigh shelby decided he just wasnt an easy man to shake alan im not dressed ill be there in five on a burst of laughter she slammed down the phone i like the snakes theyre so slimily arrogant while alan watched shelby pressed close to the glass to study a boa who looked more bored than disdainful when she had suggested the zoo he hadnt been certain if she had done so because she wanted to go or had wanted to see how he would react it didnt take a great deal of thought to discern it had been a combination of both a visit to the national zoo on a sunny spring saturday promised crowds and hordes of children the snake house was packed echoing with squeals shelby didnt seem to mind the elbowtoelbow proposition as she maneuvered her way to a fat python looks like our representative from nebraska a giggle bubbled up in shelbys throat as she pictured the thicknecked squintyeyed congressman pleased with alans observation she twisted her head to grin at him another inch and their lips would have made contact she could have backed away even though it meant stepping on a few toes she could have simply turned her head back to the python instead shelby tilted her chin so that their eyes stayed in a direct line what was there about him that made her want to tempt fate she wondered for surely thats what she would be doing if she allowed the afternoon to amount to any more than a friendly outing he wasnt a man a woman could disentangle herself from easily after shed taken that last step a man like him could quietly dominate and methodically absorb the people around him before they had any idea what was happening for that reason alone she would have been wary of him treating him with more caution than her other male companions but she couldnt forget who he was an upandcoming young senator whose future all but demanded a bid for the top office no to prevent pain on both sides shed keep it light no matter how much she wanted him its crowded she murmured as her eyes laughed into his the longer were in here his thighs brushed against hers as a toddler wiggled up to the glass the fonder i am of snakes yeah they get to me too its the basic aura of evil thats so appealing her breasts pressed into his chest as people crowded in on all sides the original sin alan murmured easily catching her scent over the mingling aroma of humanity the serpent tempted eve and eve tempted adam ive always thought adam got off too lightly in that business shelby commented her heartbeat was fast and not altogether steady against his but she didnt back away she was going to have to experience this before she understood how to prevent it snakes and women took the real heat and man came off as an innocent bystander or a creature who could rarely resist temptation in the form of a woman his voice had become entirely too soft considering it a strategic retreat shelby grabbed his hand and drew him away lets go outside and look at the elephants shelby wound her way through the people skirting around babies in strollers as she pulled alan outside he wouldve strolled she would always race in the sunshine she pushed a pair of oversize tinted glasses on her nose without slacking pace the aroma of animal drifted everywhere pungent and primitive on the breeze you could hear them the occasional roar screech or bellow she darted along the paths stopping at a cage leaning against a retaining wall taking it all in as though it were her first time around them were families couples old and young and children with dripping ice cream cones a babble of languages flowed from both in front and behind the cages there he reminds me of you shelby indicated a black panther stretched in a path of sunlight calmly watching the river of people who passed by is that so alan studied the cat indolent subdued shelby let out her smokeedged laugh oh no senator patient brooding and arrogant enough to believe this confinement is nothing he cant work with turning she leaned back against the barrier to consider alan as she had considered the panther hes taken stock of the situation and decided he can pretty much have his own way as things are i wonder her brows drew together in concentration i wonder just what hed do if he were really crossed he doesnt appear to have a temper cats usually dont until theyre pushed too far just that one time and then theyre deadly alan gave her an odd smile before he took her hand to draw her toward the path again he normally sees that hes not often crossed shelby tossed her head and met the smile with a bland look lets go look at the monkeys it always makes me think im sitting in the senate gallery nasty he commented and tugged on her hair i know i couldnt help it briefly she rested her head on his shoulder as they walked im often not a nice person grant and i both seem to have inherited a streak of sarcasm or maybe its cynicism probably from my grandfather on my fathers side hes like one of those grizzlies we looked at prowling pacing badtempered and youre crazy about him yeah ill buy you some popcorn in a swift change of mood she motioned toward a vendor you cant wander around the zoo all day without popcorn thats second only to sitting through a double feature without some the big one she told the vendor as she dug a bill from the back pocket of her jeans shelby cradled the bucket in one arm as she stuffed the change back in her pocket alan changing her mind shelby shook her head and began to walk again what casually alan reached across her for some popcorn i was going to make a confession then i remembered i dont make them very well we still need to see the monkeys you dont really think im going to let a provocative statement like that slip by do you well i thought the best way to discourage you was to agree to go out with you to some place like this which i thought would bore you to distraction then be as obnoxious as possible have you been obnoxious his tone was mild and entirely too serious i thought youve been behaving very naturally ouch shelby rubbed at the figurative wound under her heart in any case i get the distinct impression that i havent discouraged you at all really reaching for more popcorn he leaned close and spoke gently in her ear how did you come by that oh she cleared her throat just a hunch he found that tiny show of nerves very rewarding yes the puzzle was coming together piece by careful piece it was the way hed always structured his life odd and not once since weve been here have i mentioned that id like to find a small dim room and make love to you over and over warily shelby slid her eyes to his id just as soon you didnt all right alan slipped an arm around her waist i wont mention it while were here a smile tugged at her mouth but she shook her head its not going to come to that alan it cant we have a fundamental disagreement he paused on a bridge beneath them swans floated haughtily because to my way of thinking it has to you dont understand me shelby turned away to watch the birds on the water because his eyes were tripping some tiny little release she hadnt even been aware was inside her once ive made up my mind im rock hard weve more than ancestry in common he watched the sunlight add more heat to the flames of her hair touching it lightly fingertips only alan wondered how it would look after theyd made love wild strands of fire i wanted you from the minute i saw you shelby i want you more with every minute that passes she turned her head at that surprised and unwillingly excited it hadnt been an empty phrase or cliché alan macgregor said precisely what he meant and when i want something that immediately and that badly he murmured while his fingertips strayed to her jawline i dont walk away from it her lips parted as his thumb brushed over them she couldnt prevent it or the lightningflash thrill of desire so striving to be casual shelby dug out some more popcorn before she set the bucket on a bench you put your energies into convincing me that i want you he smiled slowly irresistibly he circled her neck with his fingers i dont have to convince you of that what i have to convince you of he began as he drew her closer is that the stand youre taking is unproductive selfdefeating and hopeless she found herself weakening wanting to be convinced his lips hovered just above hers yet he was careful even focused on her own vulnerabilities she understood that hed always been circumspect in public shed always be careless it annoyed her it intrigued her too his eyes so serious so calm seemed to cut through every logical defense she could or would have thrown between them before she could make a move toward or away something tugged impatiently at her tshirt confused shelby glanced down and saw a small oriental boy of around eight staring up at her he began a rapid musical spiel complete with gestures and eyerolling shelby understood the frustration if not the content slow down she ordered grinning as she slipped from alans hold to crouch in front of him her first thought was that hed lost his parents his eyes were dark and beautiful but they were annoyed rather than frightened again he went off into a peal of what she suspected was korean then with a very adult sigh he held up two nickels indicating the bird feed dispenser behind him ten cents shelby realized on a chuckle he had the right amount but didnt understand the coinage before she could reach in her pocket alan held out a dime solemnly he went through a few simple gestures showing that the two nickels put together made one dime he saw the boys eyes brighten with understanding before he plucked the dime out of alans hand and offered the two nickels alans initial inclination to refuse the money altered quickly with a scan of the boys face instead he accepted them giving a slight bow the boy gave another quick burst of korean returned alans bow then dashed back to the dispenser another man shelby thought as she watched the child hurl the feed to the swans would have insisted on being magnanimous if for no other reason than to impress the woman he was with but alan had understood that children have pride hed made the exchange of two nickels for a dime into a mantoman business transaction instead of an adulttochild bit of whimsy and all without a word leaning on the rail she watched the swans race after feed bending those slender necks then gobbling greedily now and again one would honk and peck at another who edged into its territory alans hands rested on me rail on either side of her forgetting everything but the moment shelby leaned back against him letting her head find that comfortably intimate spot between his jaw and shoulder its a beautiful afternoon she murmured alan laid his hands over hers where they rested lightly the last time i was at the zoo i was around twelve my father had made one of his rare business trips to new york and insisted we go en masse he brushed his cheek against her hair enjoying the soft intimate feel of it i felt obliged to pretend i was too old to enjoy looking at lions and tigers yet my father had the best time of all its strange that little patch of adulthood we go through when were very young mine lasted about six months shelby remembered his she knew would never have completely dissipated thats about how long i called my mother by her first name how old were you thirteen deborah i would say in the cultured tones i was affecting at the time i believe im quite old enough to have blonde streaks in my hair shed say something about our discussing it very soon then shed go on about how proud she was that i was mature enough to make adult decisions how relieved she was that i wasnt spoiled or frivolous like so many girls my age and naturally you basked in that and forgot the streaks naturally with a laugh shelby hooked her arm through his and began to walk again i dont think i appreciated just how clever she was until i was over twenty grant and i werent easy children is he like you grant like me shelby pondered it a moment in some ways but hes a loner ive never been when grants with people he observes absorbs really he tucks them all away and takes them out again as he chooses he can do without them for weeks or months at a time i cant no but you still take them out again as you choose and i dont think youve ever let anyone any man at any rate he corrected tilting his head to study her profile get too close shelby flirted with an angry retort and decided on a subtler one that sounds like your ego talking she said mildly just because i turned you down put me off alan countered as he brought her hand to his lips one might point out that you are here and so am i mmm shelby glanced around at the flood of people as a wailing baby was carried past by a frustrated parent and in such intimate surroundings too were both used to crowds on an impulse of mischief she stopped in the center of the path to twine her arms around his neck in a manner of speaking senator she expected him to laugh and pull her along again or perhaps to give an exasperated shake of his head before he disentangled himself what she didnt expect was for him to hold her there his lips close hinting of promise his eyes were level with hers telling her very clearly where the promise would lead there was a threat of passion a promise of intimacy no she hadnt expected him to turn her own ploy against her so successfully perhaps for a moment shelby had forgotten he was a man of fundamental strategies against his her heart began to thud lightly though the moment was brief it touched her in every way heart and mind and body she couldnt hold back the regret for what she felt could never be but she hadnt known it would be so sharp when she drew away it echoed in her voice and mirrored in her eyes i think wed better head back he ached and nearly swore from the frustration of it its too damn late for that he muttered as he steered her in the direction of the parking lot shelby lifted a brow at the tone annoyance it was the first time shed heard it from him she thought shed caught a flicker or two in his eyes before but it had been so quickly banked she couldnt be sure well then she mused perhaps that was the key she would annoy him enough that he would go away her skin was still warm too warm and too tender at the rate she was weakening she would find herself involved with him whether she wanted it or not perhaps the real problem was she already was involved the fact that they werent lovers didnt stop him from drawing on her thoughts and her feelings a successful break was going to hurt but it would hurt less if it was quick and soon so she would have to get under his skin shelby gave a smile that was more of a grimace as she stepped into his car if there was one thing she could do well when she put her mind to it it was to get under someones skin well that was fun she said lightly as he maneuvered out of the lot im really glad you talked me into going out my day was a blank page until seven that long quiet moment lingered in his mind even as it lingered in shelbys alan shifted hoping to ease the thudding in the pit of his stomach always happy to help someone fill in a few empty spaces alan controlled the speed of the car through force of will holding her hadnt soothed him but rather had only served to remind him how much time had passed since he had last held her actually youre an easy man to be with alan for a politician easy shelby repeated to herself as she pressed the button to lower her window her blood was still throbbing from a meeting of eyes that had lasted less than ten seconds if he was any easier shed be head over heels in love with him and headed for disaster i mean youre not really pompous he shot her a look long and cool that boosted her confidence no he murmured after a humming silence hardly at all shelby sent him a smile why id probably vote for you myself alan paused at a red light studying it thoughtfully before he turned to her your insults arent as subtle today shelby insults she gave him a bland stare odd i thought it was more flattery isnt a vote what it all comes down to votes and that allencompassing need to win the light stayed green for five full seconds before he cruised through it be careful a nerve she thought hating herself more than a little youre a little touchy thats all right she brushed at the thigh of her jeans i dont mind a little oversensitivity the subject of my sensitivity isnt the issue but youre succeeding in being obnoxious my my arent we all capitol hill all of a sudden deliberately she looked at her watch as he pulled into the alleyway next to her building that was good timing ill have a chance to take a bath and a change before i go out shelby leaned over to give him a careless kiss on the cheek before she slipped from the car thanks alan ciao despising herself shelby made it all the way to the top landing before he caught her arm she fixed a mildly surprised expression on her face before she turned her head what the hell is this all about he demanded there was enough pressure on her arm to make her turn fully around what the hell is all what about dont play games shelby she sighed sharply as if bored it was a nice afternoon a change of pace for both of us i imagine she unlocked her apartment door alan tightened his grip fractionally to prevent her from slipping inside temper he never or rarely gave in to it it was a byproduct of his heritage the stockintrade of his family but hed always been the controlled one the clearheaded one he fought to remember it and and shelby repeated lifting both brows there is no and alan we spent a couple of hours at the zoo had a few laughs that certainly doesnt mean im required to sleep with you she saw the anger volatile and fierce sweep into his eyes a bit stunned at the strength of it shelby took an automatic step back her throat went dry instantly had that been sleeping in there the whole time she wondered do you think thats all i want he asked in a deadly voice as he backed her into the door if i only wanted you in bed youd have been there his hand came up to circle her throat as she stared at the livid fury on his face theres the matter of what i want she managed surprised that her voice was thready and breathless was it fear she asked herself swiftly or was it excitement the hell with what you want when he took a step closer shelby pressed back so the door gave way she would have stumbled if he hadnt been quick enough to grab her then they were just inside with her body crushed close against his her hands on his shoulders for once indecisive she tossed back her head furious that her knees had liquefied with fear while her blood pumped hard and fast with pure desire alan you cant cant his hand was in her hair dragging her head back further it poured into him fluidly anger resentment passion hed never felt all at once i can we both know i can now and could have before and i should have he told himself as fury and frustration took over you want me right now i can see it she shook her head but couldnt dislodge his hand how could she have forgotten the panther so soon no i dont do you think you can take shots at what i do at what i am with impunity shelby the arm around her waist tightened so that she struggled not to gasp do you think you can push me so far and not pay any price she swallowed but her throat stayed dry youre acting as though ive encouraged you when ive done precisely the opposite she told him in what almost succeeded in being a mildly annoyed tone let me go alan when im ready his mouth came down toward hers shelby sucked in her breath whether in protest or anticipation she wasnt sure but he stopped just short of contact so she was trembling all she could see in his eyes was fury and her own reflection yes shed forgotten the panther and that wicked seething temper of the bronte heroes hed first reminded her of do you think youre what i want what i can rationally easily say i want youre everything but what suits me you flout everything thats vital to my life that hurt though it was precisely what shed set out to do it hurt that he could say it im exactly what i am she tossed back exactly what i want to be why dont you leave me alone and go find one of those cool blondes who look so perfect in an oscar de la renta theyre tailormade for a senators companion i dont want any part of it maybe not the anger was building hed never felt anything build so quickly maybe not but tell me his grip tightened tell me you dont want me her breath came quickly short pants that couldnt seem to fill her lungs she wasnt even aware that her fingers had dug into his shoulders or that her tongue in a swift nervous movement darted out to moisten her lips shelby had always known there was a time and a place for lies i dont want you but the denial ended on a moan of shivering excitement as his mouth captured hers this wasnt the patient endless seduction of a kiss hed first treated her to but its antithesis hard ruthless his lips dominated hers as no ones had ever done as no man had ever dared then she was spinning and groping for the guideposts that were no longer there she could taste his anger and met it with a helpless passion that built too quickly to be controlled she could feel his fury and met it with a fire that flamed too high to be banked there was no sharp stab of regret she was where she wanted to be the fingers that gripped his shoulders urged him to demand more and as he demanded she took alan twisted her closer forgetting the gentleness that had always been an innate part of his lovemaking her mouth was wild under his greedy for possession but this time he wasnt content with it his hand snaked under her shirt to find her so slim so soft yet her heart pounded under his roaming palm with the strength of a marathon runners she strained against him moaning what might have been his name her taste was as wild and free as her scent inciting the urgency to drum in him until it was a pounding he could take her on the floor or where they stood in seconds or in an hour just knowing it sent an agony of desire rocketing through him this was no yielding but rather passion to passion fire to fire hed never subdue her but he could have her and if he took her now though she was willing he risked having nothing when it was done he risked making that careless cutting remark of hers no less than the truth on an oath uncharacteristically savage alan yanked her away his eyes when they met hers were no less angry than they had been and no less hard the look held in silence but for the sound of unsteady breathing without a word he turned and strode through the open door chapter five contents prev next one tried not to think about it shelby flipped through the magazine section of the sunday paper with her feet propped up and her second cup of coffee still steaming and really tried not to think about it moshe sprawled across the back of the sofa as if he were reading over her shoulder his nose occasionally twitching from the scent of her coffee shelby sipped and skimmed an article on french cooking on a budget she couldnt help but think about it it had been entirely her fault she couldnt deny it being rude and nasty wasnt something she set out to do often but shed done a good job of it hurting someone else was something she usually did only in the blind heat of rage but she couldnt deny thered been hurt as well as anger in alans eyes even though her purpose had been selfpreservation shelby was having a difficult time forgiving herself do you think youre what i want no shelby sat back cupping her mug in both hands no shed known right from the start that she hadnt suited him his image any more than hed suited hers yet shed sensed something about him and herself that first evening on the writes terrace theyd seen too much in each other too quickly something had been nudging at the back of her mind even then he could be the one silly fancies for a woman whod never considered shed wanted anyone to be the one but she hadnt been able to shake it off she wondered if shed shaken alan off certainly shed deserved his fury and the icy temper in his eyes when hed walked back through her doorway she had the power to bring that out in him it was frightening and somehow yes somehow seducing but she could turn vicious with it that was something else the viciousness came again from selfpreservation when she sensed his power over her was too strong so perhaps shed also deserved though it was no easier to live with today the aching and the wanting hed left her with she circled her tongue over her lips remembering there were two sides of alan macgregor she mused the eventempered and reasonable and the hard and the ruthless it only made him more appealing more dangerous she added grimly setting aside the mug shelby snapped the paper into place and tried to concentrate after all shed pushed him away just as shed set out to do there was no use feeling miserable about it in almost the same breath she tossed the paper aside and leapt up to pace she wasnt going to call and apologize it would only complicate things still if she made it clear it was a formal apology and nothing more no that wasnt smart she reminded herself with a shake of the head worse it was weak and wishywashy shed made her decision shelby had always prided herself on knowing her own mind and sticking to it her gaze alighted on the balloons jumbled on her kitchen table theyd lost the power to hang high in the air and lay comfortably now like a reminder of a happy celebration her breath came out in a sigh she should have popped them and tossed out the corpses shelby ran a finger down a squishy yellow sphere it was too late now if she called and absolutely refused to get involved in a conversation just an apology and nothing more three minutes shelby gnawed on her lip and wondered if she could find her egg timer her conscience would be clear in a few polite sentences what could happen in three minutes over the phone she glanced down at the balloons again a lot she remembered it had been a phone call that had started the whole mess the day before even as she stood irresolute someone knocked at the door she glanced over quickly anticipation shimmering before the knock could sound twice she was jerking the door open i was just oh hello mama im sorry im not who you were hoping for deborah gave shelby a quick peck on the cheek before she strolled inside its better that you werent shelby murmured as she closed the door well ill get you some coffee she said with a flash of a smile its not often you drop in on a sunday morning you can make it a half a cup if youre expecting someone im not shelbys tone was flat and final deborah pondered her daughters back a moment speculating with a rueful shake of her head she wondered why she bothered she hadnt been able to outguess shelby in over ten years if youre not doing anything this afternoon perhaps youd like to go with me to see that new exhibit of flemish art at the national gallery shelby swore ripely then stuck her thumb knuckle into her mouth oh did you burn yourself let me its nothing shelby said too sharply and swore again im sorry she managed in a calmer voice i just spilled a little on me thats all sit down mama in an almost violent gesture she swept the balloons off the table and onto the floor well that hasnt changed deborah observed mildly you still have your own way of tidying up she waited until shelby sat across from her is something wrong wrong shelby nursed her thumb a moment longer no why youre rarely jumpy stirring her coffee deborah leveled one of her long steady stares have you seen the paper this morning of course shelby folded her legs under her i wouldnt miss grants sunday edition no i didnt mean that vaguely interested shelby lifted her brows i glanced at the front page and didnt see anything i wanted to dip into too deeply first thing in the morning did i miss something apparently without another word deborah rose and went over to the sofa she ruffled through the disorder of shelbys paper until she found the section she wanted there was a halfsmile on her lips as she walked over to drop the paper faceup in front of her daughter shelby looked down and said nothing there was a wellframed very clear picture of her and alan as they stood on the bridge overlooking the swans shelby remembered the moment she had leaned back against him resting her head between his shoulder and jaw the photograph had captured that instant and a look of quiet contentment on her face that she wasnt certain had ever been there before the column beneath it was brief giving her name and age a mention of her father and a quick plug for her shop it also touched on alans campaign on housing for the homeless before it drifted into speculation on their relationship there was nothing offensive in the short chatty little slice of washington gossip she was surprised by a sharp stab of resentment as she scanned the story shed been right shelby told herself as her gaze skimmed back to the picture the eighth of a page proved that shed been right from the beginning politics in all its aspects would always be between them theyd had their afternoon as ordinary people but it hadnt lasted it never would deliberately shelby pushed the paper aside before she picked up her coffee well i wouldnt be surprised if i had quite a crowd on monday morning thanks to this i had a woman drive down from baltimore last winter after shed seen a picture of me with myras nephew she made herself sip aware that she was dangerously close to rambling its a good thing i went on a binge last week and stocked the back room do you want a doughnut to go with that coffee i think i might have one somewhere shelby deborah laid both her hands on her daughters before shelby could rise the halfsmile had been replaced by a look of concern ive never known you to mind this kind of publicity thats grants phobia not yours why should i mind shelby countered struggling to keep her fingers from curling into fists if anything it should bring me a few sales some enterprising tourist recognized alan and cashed in thats all its harmless yes with a slow nod deborah soothed the agitated hands beneath hers it is no its not shelby retorted with sudden passion its not harmless none of it she sprang up from the table to whirl around the room as deborah had seen her do countless times before i cant cope with it i wont cope with it she kicked at a sneaker that got in her way why the hell couldnt he be a nuclear physicist or own bowling alleys why does he have to look at me as if hes known me all my life and doesnt mind all the flaws i dont want him to pull at me this way i wont have it on a final burst of rage she swooped the scattered sections of the paper from the sofa to the floor it doesnt matter shelby stopped dragging a hand through her hair as she leveled her breathing it doesnt matter she repeated ive made up my mind in any case so shaking her head she walked back to the stove to fetch the coffeepot shall i heat that up for you too used to shelby to be confused by the outburst deborah nodded just a touch what have you made up your mind about shelby that im not going to get involved with him after replacing the pot shelby came back to sit down why dont we have lunch in the gallery cafeteria all right deborah sipped her coffee did you have a good time at the zoo shelby shrugged and stared into her mug it was a nice day she brought the mug to her lips then set it aside without drinking deborah glanced down at the picture again when was the last time shed seen shelby look serene had she ever oh perhaps she mused with a quick almost forgotten pang when a little girl had sat with her father sharing some private thought deborah held back a sigh and feigned an interest in her coffee i suppose youve made your position clear to senator macgregor i told alan right from the start that i wouldnt even date him you came with him to the ditmeyers last week that was different she toyed restlessly with the edges of the paper and yesterday was just a lapse hes not your father shelby gray eyes lifted so unexpectedly tormented that deborah reached for her hand again hes so much like him shelby whispered its frightening the tranquility the dedication that spark that tells you hes going to reach for the top and probably get it unless she broke off and shut her eyes unless some maniac with an obscure cause and a gun stopped him oh god i think im falling in love with him and i want to run deborah tightened her grip where anywhere taking a long steadying breath shelby opened her eyes i dont want to fall in love with him for dozens of reasons were nothing alike he and i for the first time since she had handed shelby the paper deborah smiled should you be dont confuse me when im trying to be logical settling a bit shelby smiled back mama id drive the man crazy in a week i could never ask him to acclimate to my sort of life id never be able to acclimate to his you only need to talk with him for a few minutes to see that he has an ordered mind the kind that works like a superior chess game hed be accustomed to having his meals at certain times knowing precisely what shirts hed sent to be laundered darling even you must realize how foolish that sounds by itself maybe it would her gaze drifted to the balloons that lay on the floor but when you add in everything else by everything else you meant the fact that hes a politician shelby deborah waited until her daughters eyes met hers you cant specialorder the kind of man you fall in love with im not going to fall in love with him her face settled into stubborn lines i like my life just as it is no ones going to make me change it before im ready come on she was up and moving again well go look at your flemish art then ill treat you to lunch deborah watched as shelby dashed around the apartment looking for shoes no she didnt wish her daughter pain deborah thought again but she knew it was coming shelby would have to deal with it alan sat behind the huge antique desk in his study with the window open at his back he could just smell the lilacs blooming on the bush in the little patch of yard outside he remembered there had been the scent of lilacs the first evening hed met shelby but he wouldnt think of her now spread out on his desk were responses and information on the volunteer shelters he was campaigning for he had a meeting with the mayor of washington the following day and could only hope it went as well as his discussion with the mayor of boston had he had the facts his staff had been working on compiling the information he needed for weeks he had the pictures in front of him alan lifted one of two men sharing the tatters of a blanket in a doorway near th and belmont it wasnt just sad it was inexcusable shelter was the first basic need it was one thing to concentrate on the causes unemployment recession the bugs in the welfare system and another to watch people live without the most elemental needs met while the wheels of social reform slowly turned his idea was to provide the needs shelter food clothing in return for labor and time no free rides no sting of charity but he needed funds and just as important he needed volunteers hed put things in motion in boston after a long at times frustrating battle but it was too soon to show substantial results he was going to have to depend on the information compiled by his staff and his own powers of persuasion if he could add the mayors influence alan thought he might just be able to wrangle the federal funds he wanted eventually stacking the papers alan slipped them inside his briefcase there was nothing more he could do until the following day and he was expecting a visitor he checked his watch in ten minutes alan leaned back in the comfortably worn leather chair and allowed his mind to empty hed always been able to relax in this room the paneling was dark and gleaming the ceiling high in the winter he kept a low fire going in the rosy marble fireplace lining the mantel were pictures in the oddshaped antique frames he collected his family from tintypes of his greatgrandparents whod never stepped off scottish soil to snapshots of his brother and sister hed be adding one of his niece or nephew when his sister rena had the baby alan glanced up at the picture of an elegant fairhaired woman with laughing eyes and a stubborn mouth strange how many shades hair came in he mused renas hair was nothing like shelbys shelbys was all undisciplined curls of fire and flame undisciplined the word suited her and attracted him despite his better judgment handling her would be a lifelong challenge having her would be a constant surprise strange that a man whod always preferred the wellordered and logical would now know his life wouldnt be complete without disruption he glanced around the room walls of books meticulously filed and stacked a palegray carpet that showed signs of wear but no dirt the prim victorian sofa in deep burgundy the room was organized and neat like his life he was asking for a whirlwind alan had no interest in subduing it just in experiencing it when the doorbell rang he glanced at his watch again myra was right on time good morning mcgee myra breezed in with a smile for alans sturdy scottish butler good morning mrs ditmeyer mcgee was sixtwo solid as a brick wall and closing in on seventy hed been alans family butler for thirty years before leaving hyannis port for georgetown at his own insistence mister alan would need him hed said in his graveledged burr that as far as mcgee was concerned had been that i dont suppose you made any of those marvelous scones with clotted cream mcgee told her coming as close as he ever did to cracking a smile ah mcgee i adore you alan myra held out her hand as he came down the hall so sweet of you to let me bother you on a sunday its never a bother myra he kissed her cheek before leading her into the parlor this room was done in quiet masculine colors ecrus and creams with an occasional touch of deep green the furniture was mostly chippendale the carpet a faded oriental it was a calm comfortable room with the surprise of a large oil painting depicting a stormtossed landscape all jagged mountains boiling clouds and threatening lightning on the south wall myra had always considered it an interesting and telling addition with a sigh she sat in a highback chair and slipped out of her shoes skinny heels in the same shocking pink as her bag what a relief she murmured i simply cant convince myself to buy the right size what a price we pay for vanity her toes wriggled comfortably i got the sweetest note from rena she continued rubbing one foot over the other to restore circulation as she smiled at alan she wanted to know when herbert and i are coming up to atlantic city to lose money in her casino i dropped a bit myself the last time i was up there alan sat back knowing myra would get to the point of her visit in her own time hows caine what a naughty boy he always was she went on before alan could answer whoever thought hed turn out to be a brilliant attorney lifes full of surprises alan murmured caine had been the naughty boy and he the disciplined one why should he think of that now oh how true ah here goes my diet thank god she announced as mcgee entered with a tray ill pour mcgee bless you myra lifted the meissen teapot busying herself while alan watched her with amusement whatever she was up to she was going to enjoy her scones and tea first how i envy you your butler she told alan as she handed him a cup did you know i tried to steal him away from your parents twenty years ago no i didnt alan grinned but then mcgees much too discreet to have mentioned it and too loyal to succumb to my clever bribes it was the first time i tasted one of these myra bit into a scone and rolled her eyes naturally i thought it was the cooks doing and considered snatching her but when i found out the scones were mcgees ah well my consolation is that if id succeeded id be as big as an elephant which reminds me she dusted her fingers on a napkin i noticed youve taken an interest in elephants alan lifted a brow as he sipped so this was it im always interested in the opposing party he said mildly im not talking about political symbols myra retorted archly did you have a good time at the zoo youve seen the paper of course i must say the two of you looked very good together i thought you would she took a selfsatisfied sip of tea was shelby annoyed by the picture i dont know alans brows lowered in puzzlement hed lived his life in the public eye too long to give it any more than a passing thought should she be normally no but then shelbys prone to feel and do the unexpected im not prying alan yes i am she corrected with an irresistible grin but only be cause ive known you both since you were children im very fond of both you and shelby giving in to temptation with only a token struggle she helped herself to another scone i was quite pleased when i saw the picture this morning enjoying her healthy appetite as well as her irrepressible meddling alan smiled back at her why actually myra helped herself to a generous spoonful of cream i shouldnt be i was planning to get you two together myself its really put my nose out of joint that you handled matters without me even though i approve of the end result knowing the way her mind worked alan leaned back against the sofa resting one arm over the back an afternoon at the zoo doesnt equal matrimony spoken like a true politician with a sigh of pure gastronomic pleasure myra sat back if i could only wrangle the recipe for these scones out of mcgee alan gave her a smile that was more amused than apologetic i dont think so ah well i happened to be in shelbys shop when a basket of strawberries was delivered she added casually you wouldnt happen to know anything about that would you dear strawberries alan gave another noncommital smile im quite fond of them myself im much too clever to be conned myra told him shaking her finger and i know you entirely too well a man like you doesnt send baskets of strawberries or spend afternoons at the zoo unless hes infatuated im not infatuated with shelby alan corrected mildly as he sipped his tea im in love with her myras planned retort came out as a huff of breath well then she managed that was quicker than even i expected it was instant alan murmured not quite as easy now that hed made the statement lovely myra leaned forward to pat his knee i cant think of anyone who deserves the shock of love at first sight more he had to laugh though his mood was no longer light shelbys not having it what do you mean shes not myra demanded with a frown just that it still hurt alan discovered as he set down his tea the memory of her words that careless tone still slashed him she isnt even interested in seeing me poppycock myra sniffed and set aside a halfeaten scone i was with her when she got those strawberries and i know shelby nearly as well as i know you she punctuated the statement with a quick jab at his knee it was the first time in my life id seen her look quite that way alan stared into middle distance a moment considering shes a very stubborn woman he said thoughtfully shes determined to avoid any sort of personal entanglement with me because of my profession ah i see myra nodded slowly as she began to tap a long red nail against the arm of the chair i should have known shes not indifferent alan murmured thinking aloud as he remembered the way her mouth had heated beneath his just obstinate not obstinate myra corrected bringing him back frightened she was very close to her father i gathered that myra and i understand it must have been hard very hard to lose him the way she did but i cant see what it has to do with us his impatience was edging through and his frustration alan rose no longer able to sit still and paced the room if her father had been an architect would it make sense for her to write architects off he dragged a hand through his hair in a rare gesture of exasperation dammit myra its bloody ridiculous for her to shut me out because her father was a senator youre being logical alan myra said patiently shelby rarely is unless you consider that she uses her own brand of logic she adored robert campbell and i dont use the word lightly she paused again her sympathies aroused for both of them she was only eleven years old when he was shot and killed not twenty feet away from her alan stopped pacing to slowly turn around she was there both her and grant myra set aside her cup wishing her memory werent quite so clear it was a miracle that deborah managed to keep the press from exploiting that angle she used every contact she had he felt a flash of empathy so stunning and sharp it left him dazed oh god i cant even imagine how horrible it must have been for her she didnt speak not a word for days i spent a lot of time with her as deborah was trying to cope with her own grief the childrens the press she shook her head remembering deborahs quietly desperate attempts to reach her daughter and shelbys mute withdrawal it was a dreadful time alan political assassinations add public scope to our private grief a long weary sigh escaped a sound she rarely gave in to shelby didnt break down until the day after the funeral she mourned like like an animal myra said raw wild grief that lasted as long as her silence had then she snapped out of it maybe too well he wasnt certain he wanted to hear more picturing the child that was the woman he loved shattered lost and groping hed have been in his second year at harvard then secure in his world within easy reach of his family even at thirtyfive hed never suffered any devastating loss his father alan tried to imagine the sudden violent loss of the robust and vital daniel macgregor it was too searing a pain to be felt he stared out the window at springgreen leaves and fresh blossoms what did she do she lived using every drop of that surplus of energy shes always had once when she was sixteen myra remembered shelby told me that life was a game called who knows and that she was going to give everything a try before it played a trick on her that sounds like her alan murmured yes and all in all shes the most welladjusted creature i know content with her own flaws per haps proud of a few of them but shelbys a vortex of emotion the more she uses the more she has perhaps shes never really stopped grieving she cant dictate her emotions alan said with fresh frustration as myras words ate at him no matter how much her fathers death affected her no but shelby would think she could she thinks too damn much he muttered no she feels too damn much she wont be an easy woman to love or to live with alan forced himself to sit again i stopped wanting an easy woman when i met shelby things were a bit clearer now and therefore more easily solved specific tangible problems were his specialty he began to play back shelbys words to him of the afternoon before the biting carelessness he remembered as he forced himself to be calm that quick flicker of regret hed seen in her eyes she gave me my walking papers yesterday he said softly myra set down her tea with a snap what nonsense the girl needs she interrupted herself with another huff if youre that easily discouraged i dont know why i bother young people expect everything to be handed to them on a platter i suppose the first stumbling block and its all over your father she continued heating up could find a way to bulldoze through anything and your mother whom ive always thought you took after simply eased her way through any problem without creating a ripple a fine president youll make she finished grumpily im going to reconsider voting for you im not running for president alan said as soberly as his grin would allow yet yet he agreed and im going to marry shelby oh deflated myra sat back again perhaps ill vote for you after all when staring at the ceiling alan considered calculating turning over angles ive always liked hyannis port in the fall he mused shifting his gaze he gave myra his slow serious smile shelby should enjoy getting married in a drafty castle dont you think chapter six contents prev next a week was only seven days shelby made it through almost six of them by pretending she wasnt going crazy by midafternoon on friday she was running low on excuses for her bad temper and absentmindedness she wasnt sleeping well thats why she was listless she wasnt sleeping well because shed been so busy at the shop and with a round of social engagements shelby hadnt turned down any invitation that had come her way all week because she was listless or overtired or whatever she was forgetting things like eating because she had thrown her system off schedule she was cranky and because she was cranky she didnt have any appetite shelby had managed this circular sort of justification for days without once bringing the reason back to alan several times she told herself she hadnt thought of him at all not once as it happened shelby began to tell herself several times a day that she hadnt thought of him once she was so pleased with herself for not giving him a thought she smashed a delftblue flowerpot against her workroom wall this was so blatantly out of character that shelby was forced to resort to her circular route of rationale all over again she worked when she could late at night when she couldnt bear to lie awake in bed early in the morning for the same reason when she went out she was almost desperately bright and cheerful so that a few of her closer friends began to watch her with some concern filling her time became of paramount importance then she would forget that shed made arrangements to meet friends for dinner and bury herself in her workroom it could be the weather shelby mused as she sat behind the counter with her chin on her hand the radio gave her music and welcome noise with regular announcements that the rain would end by sunday to shelby sunday was lightyears away rain depressed a lot of people and just because it had never depressed her before didnt mean it wasnt doing so this time two solid days of streaming soaking rain could make anyone grumpy brooding shelby watched through the shop window as it continued to fall rain wasnt good for business she decided shed had a little more than a trickle of customers that day and the day before normally she would have closed up shop with a philosophical shrug and found some thing else to do but she stayed frowning as gloomy as the rain maybe shed just go away for the weekend she thought hop on a plane and shoot up to maine and surprise grant oh hed be furious shelby thought with the first real smile shed managed in days hed give her hell for dropping in unannounced then theyd have such a good time badgering each other no one made bickering as much fun as grant grant saw too much shelby remembered with a sigh hed know something was wrong and though he was fierce about his own privacy hed pick at her until she told him everything she could tell her mother at least part of it but she couldnt tell grant maybe because he understood too well so shelby gave another long sigh and considered her options she could stay in georgetown and be miserable over the weekend or she could leave it might be fun to just toss a few things in the car and drive until she left the rain behind skyline drive in virginia or the beach at nags head a change of scene she decided abruptly any scene at all impulsively shelby jumped up and prepared to turn over the closed sign the door opened letting in a whoosh of chilled air and a scattering of rain a woman in a yellow slicker and boots closed the door with a slam miserable weather she said cheerfully the worst shelby pushed the impatience back ten minutes before shed considered standing on one foot and juggling to attract a customer is there something in particular i can show you ill just poke around oh sure shelby thought pinning on an amiable smile i could be halfway to sunshine by the time she finishes poking shelby considered telling the woman she had ten minutes take your time she said instead i found out about your shop from a neighbor the woman stopped to study a fat speckled pot suitable for a patio or terrace shed bought a coffee set i admired a very pale blue with pansies dashed over it yes i remember it shelby managed to keep the friendly smile in place as she watched the womans back i dont do duplicates but if youre interested in coffee sets i have one along similar lines scanning the shop she tried to remember where shed set it actually it wasnt the specific set as much as the workmanship that caught my eye she told me you make all your stock yourself thats right shelby forced herself not to fidget and concentrated on the woman attractive midthirties friendly the sleek brunette hair had a subtle and sophisticated frosting of wheattoned blond shelby wished the woman would go back to wherever she came from then was immediately furious with herself i have my wheel in the back room she went on making more of an effort i do all the firing and glazing there as well the customer crouched down beside a standing urn studying it meticulously do you ever use molds once in a while for something like that bull there or the gnome but i prefer the wheel you know you have a marvelous talent and quite a supply of energy rising the woman ran a fingertip down the spout of a coffeepot i can imagine how much time and patience it takes to produce all this over and above the skill thank you i suppose when you enjoy something you dont think about the time it takes mmm i know im a decorator walking over she handed shelby a business card maureen francis interior design im doing my own apartment at the moment and i have to have that pot that urn and that vase she pointed to each of her choices before turning back to shelby can i give you a deposit and have you hold them for me until monday i dont want to cart them around in the rain of course ill have them packed up for you when youre ready for them terrific maureen pulled a checkbook out of the leather hobo bag she carried you know i have a feeling were going to be doing quite a bit of business ive only been in dc about a month but i do have a couple of interesting jobs coming up she glanced up with another smile before she continued to write out the check i like to use handcrafted pieces in my work theres nothing worse than a room that shrieks of professional decorator the statement from someone who made her living at it intrigued shelby she forgot her inclination to rush maureen out the door where are you from chicago i worked for a large firm there ten years she ripped off the check and handed it to shelby i got the itch to strike out on my own nodding shelby finished making out her receipt are you any good maureen blinked at the blunt question then grinned im very good shelby studied her face a moment candid eyes a touch of humor going as always on impulse she scrawled a name and address on the back of the receipt myra ditmeyer shelby told her if anyone whos anyone in the area is toying with redecorating shell know tell her i gave you her name a bit stunned maureen stared down at the receipt shed been in dc long enough to know of myra ditmeyer thanks myrall expect your life history in lieu of a percentage but shelby broke off as the door to the shop opened again she had the unexpected and for her unique experience of going completely blank alan closed the door then calmly stripped out of his wet coat before he crossed to her giving maureen a friendly nod he cupped shelbys chin leaned over the counter and kissed her i brought you a present no the quick panic in her voice infuriated her after shoving at his hand she stepped back go away alan leaned on the counter as he turned to maureen is that any way to act when someone brings you a present well i maureen looked from shelby to alan before she gave a noncommittal shrug of course it isnt he went on as if shed agreed he drew a box out of his coat pocket and set it on the counter im not going to open it shelby looked down at the box only because it prevented her from looking at alan she wouldnt risk having her mind swept clean again so soon and im closed not for fifteen minutes shelbys often rude he told maureen would you like to see what i brought her tom between a desire to run for cover and creeping curiosity maureen hesitated a moment too long alan plucked off the cover of the box and pulled out a small piece of colored glass in the shape of a rainbow shelbys hand was halfway to it before she stopped herself dammit alan how could he have known how badly shed needed to see a rainbow thats her traditional response he told maureen it means she likes it i told you to stop sending me things i didnt send it he pointed out as he dropped the rainbow in her hand i brought it i dont want it she said heatedly but her fingers curled around it if you werent a thickskinned boneheaded macgregor youd leave me alone fortunately for both of us we share some of the same traits he had her hand in his before she could prevent it your pulse is racing again shelby maureen cleared her throat well i think ill just be running along she stuffed the receipt in her bag as shelby stared helplessly at alan ill be back monday she added though neither of them acknowledged her departure if someone gave me a rainbow on a day like today she commented as she headed for the door id be sunk sunk shelby repeated silently it wasnt until the door closed that she snapped back stop it she ordered and snatched her hand away when she flicked off the radio the room fell into silence accentuated by the drumming rain too late she realized shed made her first mistake now it was all too apparent that her breathing wasnt as steady as it should be alan im closing shop good idea he strode over to the door flipped around the sign then shot the bolt now just a minute she began furiously you cant she broke off as he began to come toward her the calmly determined look in his eyes had her taking a step back and swallowing this is my shop and you her back hit the wall as he skirted around the counter and we he began when he stopped directly in front of her are going out to dinner im not going anywhere you are he corrected shelby stared up at him confused and pulsing his voice hadnt been fierce or impatient there wasnt any anger in his eyes shed have preferred anger to that simple unarguable confidence temper made it so easy to defend with temper if he was going to be calm she told herself shed be calm too alan you cant tell me what to do after all i am telling you he countered easily ive come to the conclusion youve been asked too often in your life and not told often enough your conclusions dont interest me in the least she shot back who the hell are you to tell me anything for an answer he pulled her closer im not going shelby began experiencing what she realized must be desperation i have plans for the weekend im im leaving for the beach wheres your coat alan i said spotting the light jacket hanging on the coatrack behind the counter alan slipped it off and handed it to her do you want your purse will you get it through your head that i am not going with you he ignored her and plucked the shoulder bag from behind the counter taking the keys that lay beside it he gripped shelbys arm and pulled her through the rear of the shop dammit alan i said im not going shelby found herself presumptuously shoved into the rain while alan locked her back door i dont want to go anywhere with you too bad he pocketed her keys then slipped into his own coat while shelby stood stubbornly in the downpour she swiped the dripping hair out of her eyes and planted her feet you cant make me he lifted a brow taking a long thoughtful study of her she was livid and drenched and beautiful in her own fashion and he noted with satisfaction just a little unsure of herself it was about time were going to have to start to keep count of how many times you tell me i cant he commented before he grabbed her arm and dragged her to his car if you think shelby broke off as she was shoved unceremoniously inside if you think she began again that im impressed by the caveman routine you couldnt be more mistaken it wasnt often that she was haughtily dignified but when she put her mind to it no one did it better than shelby even soaking wet give me back my keys imperiously she held out her hand palm up alan took it pressed a lingering kiss to the center then started the car shelby curled her hand into a fist as if to subdue the warmth that started in her palm and shot out everywhere alan i dont know whats gotten into you but it has to stop now i want my keys so i can get back inside after dinner he said pleasantly and backed out of the alley how was your week shelby sat back and folded her arms it wasnt until then that she realized she still had alans rainbow in her hand she stuffed it in the pocket of the jacket that lay in a heap beside her then flopped back again im not having dinner with you i thought someplace quiet would be best he turned right keeping pace with the heavy sluggish traffic you look a bit tired love havent you been sleeping well ive been sleeping just fine she lied i was out late last night deliberately she turned to him on a date alan controlled the swift surge of jealousy her ability to push the right buttons to get under his skin was no longer a surprise he met the simmering gray eyes briefly have a good time i had a marvelous time davids a musician very sensitive very passionate she added with relish im crazy about him david might have been surprised as he was engaged to one of shelbys closest friends but she doubted the subject would come up again as a matter of fact she continued with sudden inspiration hes coming by to pick me up at seven so id appreciate it if youd just turn around and take me home instead of obliging as she hoped or raging as she expected alan glanced at his watch thats too bad i doubt well be back by then while shelby sat in stony silence he pulled up to the curb better put on your jacket well have to walk half a block when she neither moved nor spoke he leaned across her as if to open the door his mouth brushed over her ear unless youd like to stay in the car and neck shelby turned her head ready with a furious retort she found her lips against his lightly devastatingly in a quick move she pushed out of her side of the car whipping the jacket over her shoulders theyd play the scenario out she told herself as she worked on leveling her breathing and when she got back her keys she was going to make him suffer for every minute of it alan joined her on the sidewalk took her hands and just looked at her he felt her initial resistance melt before the time could be measured you tasted of the rain he murmured before he gave in to the temptation to finish the promise of that brief meeting of lips the press of bodies the week of staying away from her had nearly driven him mad rain pelted them and shelby thought of waterfalls her jacket slipped off her shoulders and she thought of rainbows all needs all wishes sped through her sweet pangs of longing halfformed dreams how had she gone all her life without him when she could no longer keep sane for a week without being touched like this reluctantly alan drew her away a moment longer he knew and hed forget they were on a public street her face was pale ivory dashed with sweet spring rain drops clung to the lashes surrounding those pure gray eyes they should be alone he thought in some gloomy evening forest or rainsplattered field then thered be no drawing away he slipped the jacket back over her shoulders i like your hair wet in a slow possessive move he ran a hand through it without another word he draped an arm around her and led her down the street shelby knew the restaurant all dim corners and smoky music by ten oclock that night it would be noisy and jammed with people a man like alan would avoid it then while she would seek it out now it was subdued pale wooden floors flickering candles muted conversations good evening senator the maitre d beamed over alan before his gaze shifted to shelby he beamed again nice to see you again ms campbell good evening mario shelby returned searching for her hauteur your tables waiting he guided them through to a back corner table where the candle was burned halfway down there was enough latin in mario that he scented romance and appreciated it a bottle of wine he asked as he held shelbys chair pouilly fuisse bichot alan told him without consulting shelby mario said with a nod of approval your waiter will be with you shortly shelby flipped her damp hair out of her eyes maybe i want a beer next time alan agreed amiably there isnt going to be a next time i mean it alan she said jerkily as he traced a line down the back of her hand with his fingertip i wouldnt be here if you hadnt locked me out of my house dont touch me that way she added in a furious undertone how would you like me to touch you you have very sensitive hands he murmured before she could answer he grazed a thumb over her knuckle and felt the quick tremor tonight he promised himself he was going to feel that tremor again at every pulse point how many times did you think of me this week i didnt think of you shelby tossed back then felt a flash of guilt at the new lie all right what if i did she attempted to snatch her hand away but alan merely slipped his fingers through hers and held it still it was a simple conventional gesture one a civilized man could use in a public place without drawing eyes though she knew it tried to scorn it shelby felt the pleasure ripple down to her toes i felt badly because id been nasty after your behavior tonight i only wish id been nastier i can be she added on a threat alan only smiled as mario brought the wine to the table watching shelby alan tasted it then nodded very good its the sort of flavor that stays with you for hours later when i kiss you the taste will still be there the blood began to hum in her ears im only here because you dragged me to his credit mario didnt spill a drop of the wine he poured as he listened her eyes heated as alan continued to smile and since you refuse to give me my keys ill simply walk to the nearest phone and call a locksmith youll get the bill after dinner alan suggested how do you like the wine scowling shelby lifted the glass and drained half the contents its fine her eyes insolent now stayed level with his this isnt a date you know its becoming more of a filibuster isnt it more wine the patience was back she wanted to pound her fists on the table in the teeth of it that would set the tongues wagging she thought tempted and serve him right then she thought of the chatty little article in the paper and ground her teeth instead shelby shrugged as he topped off her glass wine and candlelight wont do you any good no he decided against pointing out that she was holding his hand now as much as he was holding hers well i thought it was time for something more traditional really she had to smile then i shouldve gotten a box of chocolates or a bouquet of roses thats traditional i knew youd rather have a rainbow you know too damn much she plucked up the menu the waiter set at her elbow and buried her face behind it since hed dragged her out in the rain she might as well eat stuff herself shelby corrected her appetite had returned in full force so had her energy she reluctantly admitted the moment shed seen him again the listlessness had vanished are you ready to order ms campbell shelby glanced up at the waiter and aimed a smile yes i am ill have the seafood salad with avocado the consommé the loin of lamb with béarnaise sauce a baked potato and the artichoke hearts ill look at the pastry cart later the waiter scribbled without flicking an eyebrow at the length of her order senator the house salad he said grinning at shelbys bland expression and the scampi the walk in the rain gave you an appetite i see since im here i might as well choke down a few bites well in one of her lightning changes of moods she rested her folded arms on the table and leaned over them we have to pass the time dont we what shall we talk about senator how are things on the hill busy ah the classic understatement youve been working overtime to block breidermans bill well done im forced to say then theres your current pet project any progress in squeezing out the federal funds you need thereve been a few steps forward he eyed her thoughtfully a moment for a woman who had such an aversion to politics she was well informed the mayors enthusiastic about setting up the same kind of shelters here that we started in boston for now well have to rely mostly on contributions and volunteers well need a lot more before we can count on the support to set them up nationwide youve got a long fight on your hands with the current financial picture and the budget cuts i know ill win eventually a smile touched his lips lightly i can be very patient up to a point and then i can be very insistent not quite trusting the gleam in his eyes shelby remained silent as their salads were served you stepped on a few toes in breidermans case theyll step back thats the name of the game nothing worthwhiles ever without complications i he filled her glass again have a penchant for solving them as they come not bothering to pretend she misunderstood him this time shelby speared a forkful of salad and ate it thoughtfully you cant organize a romance like a campaign senator particularly with someone who knows a great many of the moves it is an interesting concept humor was in his eyes and around the edges of his slow serious smile shelby found that her fingers were itching to touch his face youll admit my statements have been clear i havent made any promises i wont keep shelby im not one of your constituents that doesnt change my platform shelby shook her head halfexasperated halfamused im not going to argue with you on your turf toying with the remains of her salad she glanced back up at him i suppose you saw the picture in the paper yes it had bothered her he realized though she spoke lightly and with a trace of a smile i enjoyed being reminded of that particular moment im sorry it upset you it didnt she said too quickly on a faint sound of annoyance she shook her head not really the waiter removed her salad and replaced it with consommé shelby began to stir it absently i suppose it just reminded me how much youre in the public eye does it ever bother you off and on publicitys an intricate part of my profession it can be a means to an end or a basic nuisance he wanted to see her smile of course im interested to get my fathers reaction when he gets wind i was at the zoo with a campbell the faint tension in her shoulders relaxed when she laughed do you fear for your inheritance alan my skin more he countered my hearing at the least i expect to pick up the phone any day and be bellowed at she grinned as she picked up her wine do you let him think he intimidates you from time to time it keeps him happy shelby picked up a roll broke it in two and offered half to alan if you were smart youd give me a very wide berth you really shouldnt risk a broken eardrum it makes it difficult to hear what the oppositions plotting in the next room i can deal with my father when the time comes nibbling on the roll she gave him a steady look meaning after youve dealt with me he lifted his glass in a small toast precisely alan she smiled again more confident after food and wine youre not going to deal with me well have to see wont we he said easily heres your lamb chapter seven contents prev next shelby might have wished she hadnt enjoyed herself quite so much she might have wished alan hadnt been able to make her laugh quite so easily or that he hadnt been able to charm her into walking down m street in the rain to windowshop and peoplewatch and to have one last glass of wine at a crowded little cafe shelby might have wished it but she didnt for the first time in a week she could laugh and relax and enjoy without effort thered be consequences there were always consequences shed think about them tomorrow more than once someone breezed by their table with a greeting for shelby and a speculative look at alan it reminded her that smoky little clubs were her territory ballet openings were his that was something else shed think about tomorrow hello gorgeous shelby glanced up and around as hands dropped onto her shoulders hello david hi wendy hey you were supposed to give us a call tonight david reminded her the piano player switched to something hot and pulsing david glanced over automatically we caught the new play at fords without you wendy soft and graceful with hair rippling past her waist grinned as she slipped an arm around davids waist you didnt miss anything i got shelby cast a glance at alan sidetracked alan david and wendy nice to meet you alan gave the gangly man with the wisp of beard a slow smile would you like to join us thanks but were just heading out david ruffled shelbys hair before he snitched her wine for a quick sip got to play at a wedding tomorrow davids still trying to figure out how he can play at ours next month hey ive got to call you later about that greek caterer you told me about wendy sent alan a friendly grin shelby says ouzo livens up a reception listen well see you later she added as she tugged on davids arm alan watched them skirt around tables on their way to the door he works fast alan commented as he lifted his wine david shelby sent him a puzzled look actually his fastest speed is crawl unless hes got a guitar in his hands really alans eyes met hers as he sipped but she didnt understand the amusement in them you only stood him up tonight and already hes planning his wedding to someone else stood him she began on a laugh then remembered oh tom between annoyance and her own sense of the ridiculous shelby toyed with the stem of her glass men are fickle creatures she decided apparently reaching over he lifted her chin with a fingertip youre holding up well i dont like to wear my heart on my sleeve exasperated amused she muffled a laugh dammit he would have to pick tonight to show up here of all the gin joints in all the towns this time the laugh escaped fully well done shelby told him i shouldve thought of that line myself i heard the movie not long ago heard it mmmhmm well she lifted her glass in a toast to broken hearts or foolish lies alan countered shelby wrinkled her nose as she tapped her glass against his i usually tell very good ones besides i did date david once three years ago she finished off her wine maybe four you can stop grinning in that smug masculine way any time senator was i rising he offered shelby her damp jacket how rude of me it wouldve been more polite not to acknowledge that youd caught me in a lie she commented as they worked their way through the crowd and back into the rain which you wouldnt have done if you hadnt made me so mad that i couldnt think of a handier name to give you in the first place if i work my way through the morass of that sentence it seems to be my fault alan slipped an arm around her shoulders in so casually friendly a manner she didnt protest suppose i apologize for not giving you time to think of a lie that would hold up it seems fair shelby lifted her face to the rain forgetting how she had cursed it only hours before it was soft and cool and clean on her skin she could have walked in it for hours but im not going to thank you for dinner she added with a flash of laughter in her eyes she turned leaning back against the door of his car when they reached it or the wine and the candlelight alan looked into the insolent rainwashed face and wanted her desperately shed bring touches of that insolence to her passion and touches of the freshness he dipped his hands into his pockets before he could give in to the urge to pull her to him then and there how about the rainbow a smile tilted the corners of her mouth maybe ill thank you for that i havent decided quickly she slipped into the car her knees had gone weak shed discovered with that one long look hed given her before hed spoken it would be wise to keep the mood as light as it had been in the cafe at least until she was safely inside her apartment and he was safely out you know she went on as alan slid behind the wheel i was planning to drive to the beach tonight you mucked up my plans do you like the beach in the rain it might not have been raining there shelby pointed out while the engine purred and anyway i do i like it best in a storm alan steered the mercedes around a corner at dusk when theres just enough light to watch the sky and the water churn really intrigued she studied his profile i would have thought youd prefer quiet winter beaches where you could take long walks and think deep thoughts everything in its time alan murmured she could see it the lightning the thunder the breath of windy excitement something more than wine warmed her blood undercurrents shed known there were undercurrents in him from the first moment shed seen him but now they seemed closer to the surface thered be a time if she wasnt careful when theyd simply sweep her away my sister lives in atlantic city alan said casually i like to shoot up there at odd times during the offseason to spend a couple of days at the beach and lose money in her casino your sister owns a casino shelby turned back to him again shes partners with her husband in a couple of them amused by the surprise in shelbys voice he sent her a quick grin rena used to deal blackjack still does occasionally did you consider that my family would be very staid very proper and very dull shelby not precisely she answered though she had for the most part at least not from what ive heard about your father myra seems very fond of him they like to argue with each other hes every bit as opinionated as she is he parked beside her building then got out before shelby could tell him not to bother to see her to the door youve gotten your share of dunkings tonight senator as they climbed the stairs she automatically reached into her purse for her keys i still have them alan reminded her as he drew them out of his pocket watching her he jiggled them in his palm they should be worth a cup of coffee shelby frowned at him i think thats bribery bribery his stare was mild and reasonable no it was a supposition shelby hesitated then sighed she understood him well enough by now to know that they could end up debating his supposition for an hour on the landing and hed still end up with his cup of coffee stepping aside she gestured for him to unlock the door coffee she said as though stating the boundary lines after she stripped out of her jacket shelby tossed it carelessly over a kitchen chair the cat struggled out from under it leapt to the floor and glared out of his good eye oh sorry shelby poked into a cabinet and came out with an envelope of cat food its his fault she told moshe as the cat attacked his meal shelby looked back at alan he doesnt appreciate it when im late with his dinner hes very regimented alan gave the plump greedy cat a cursory glance he doesnt appear deprived no tossing her bangs out of her eyes shelby turned to the sink to fill the percolator but hes easily annoyed if i she lost her train of thought when alans hands descended to her shoulders if i forget to feed him he the percolator clattered into the sink as alans mouth grazed her ear sulks she finished switching off the tap with a jerk roommates who sulk she managed in an abruptly thready voice as she set the percolator on the counter make things difficult i imagine alan murmured brushing the hair away from the nape of her neck he nibbled on the sensitive skin shelby felt the fire start and fought to get the plug into the wall socket shelby his hands skimmed down her sides to rest at her waist she was going to ignore it she told herself absolutely ignore what he was doing to her what mmm alan trailed his lips around the side of her neck her scent was more vibrant there he discovered just there above the collarbone he skimmed his tongue over it and listened to her quick unsteady inhalation of breath you didnt put any coffee in the pot she shivered then gripped the counter with both hands to keep it from happening again what alan reached around her to pull the plug out you didnt he began and turned her to face him put any coffee in he brushed a kiss at one corner of her mouth then just as lightly at the other for a moment she weakened closing her eyes in where his lips curved against her cheekbone in the percolator itll perk in a minute she murmured when his lips skimmed over her eyelids she heard him laugh softly and wondered why it sounded triumphant it took all her effort to fight off the brushfire that was already getting out of control alan featherlight kisses trailed over her face adding fuel to the blaze youre trying to seduce me no im not he nipped gently at her lips then left them unsatisfied as he journeyed to her throat he wanted to feel that desperately pounding pulse i am seducing you no shelby lifted her hands to his chest to push him away somehow they crept up around his neck were not going to make love alan barely controlled the urgent flare of need as his fingers wound their way into her hair no he teased her lips again why because she fought to remember who she was where she was because its the road to perdition he gave a muffled laugh against her mouth before his tongue slipped in to tempt her try again because it was building too quickly beyond what she understood needs werent supposed to be so painful hunger wasnt supposed to come in waves that enervated you she knew that because shed felt both before this had to be something different and yet it seemed to have no name at all there was weakness such weakness and a driving burning force that threatened to consume everything she thought she knew no panic sharp and real broke through no i want you too much i cant let this happen dont you see too late still roaming her face with kisses he guided her through the apartment much too late shelby he slipped the blouse from her shoulders and let it float to the floor this time the first time he thought it would be a seduction one that both of them would remember in all the years to come soft he murmured much too soft to resist taking his time he trailed his hands up her arms over her shoulders do you know how often ive thought of being with you like this how often ive thought of touching you his fingers brushed over the thin camisole to stroke her breast like this without a sound her skirt dropped to the floor at the doorway to the bedroom do you hear the rain shelby she felt the bedspread brush her shoulders as they eased onto the bed yes im going to make love with you his lips were at her ear again destroying even the pretense of refusal and every time you hear the rain youll remember she wouldnt need the rain to remember shelby thought had her heart ever beat so fast had her skin ever seemed so soft yes she could hear the rain drumming and drumming on the roof against the windowpane but she wouldnt need to hear the sound of it again to remember the way his mouth fit so perfectly against hers the way her body seemed to mold itself to the lines of his she would only have to think of him to remember the way the raindampened freshness clung to his hair or the way the sound of her name came in a whisper through his lips shed never given the gift of her pliancy to a man before though she wasnt aware of it now she yielded letting him guide her where shed been so reluctant or so afraid to go to mindlessness he seemed to want to touch to taste all of her but so slowly so thoroughly she could float insubstantial as a mist on feelings alone with only fingertips with only lips he aroused her to a plane of contentment that was irresistible shelby hadnt understood true languor until she reached for the buttons of his shirt her arms were so heavy her hands always so clever her fingers always so deft fumbled drawing out the process and unwittingly driving him to desperation his mouth grew suddenly greedy on hers his body pressing down to trap her hands between them perhaps it was that unconscious show of dominance or perhaps it was the overload of suppressed needs but she ceased to yield against him and began to take her hunger matched his and when it threatened to surpass him his built to balance it again shelby found those strong subtle muscles freed of the shirt but her hands no longer fumbled it seemed like a race who could drive whom further and faster his mouth sped down her lingering at points of pleasure she hadnt known existed until he found them exploited them then moved on he drew the bare swathe of silk down and further down though his caresses had ceased to be gentle neither of them looked for gentleness what was between them had ignited at the first meeting and had simmered too long alan felt her tremble wherever he touched wherever his tongue flicked over her skin he knew shed left fear far behind this was the passion the pure undiluted passion hed known she would give to him if he waited for her it was the whirlwind hed needed and the whirlwind she brought aggressive all fire all flash she moved with him against him for him until his control was ripped part shredded and forgotten he could taste her with each breath he drew into his lungs everything wild and sweet and tempting neither was leading now but both were led shelby took him into her on a cry that was muffled against his mouth and had nothing to do with surrender thunder and lightning they fed each other the rain still fell the sound was no softer no louder they might have lain together for hours or for moments neither had any thought of time only of place here shelby curled into alan eyes closed breathing steady at last her mind and body so peaceful the storm might never have taken place but it had been the storm her part in it her yielding to it that had given her the serenity she hadnt even known she craved alan alan was her peace her heart her home steady solid whimsical persistent there were too many labels for him perhaps that was why she was drawn to him again and again and why shed continued to step away alan shifted drawing her closer he could still feel the ripples excitement passion emotions too vibrant to name shelby continued to pour through him like a heady breathtaking wind that blew in all directions at once brisk or sultry she was a breeze that whisked away the harshness of the world he knew too much about he needed that kind of magic from her the same way he needed to give her whatever it was in him she was drawn to lazily possessively he ran a hand down her back mmm again shelby murmured with a quiet laugh alan stroked up and down until she was ready to purr shelby she gave another sigh as an answer and snuggled closer shelby theres something warm and fluffy under my feet mmhmm if its your cat hes not breathing macgregor he kissed the top of her head what she gave a muffled laugh against his shoulder macgregor she repeated my pig there was silence for a moment while he tried to digest this i beg your pardon the dry serious tone had more laughter bubbling up would she ever be able to face a day without hearing it oh say that again i love it because she had to see his face shelby found the energy to lean across him and grope for the matches on the nightstand skin rubbed distractingly against skin while she struck one and lit a candle macgregor she said giving alan a quick kiss before she gestured to the foot of the bed alan studied the smiling porcine face you named a stuffed purple pig after me alan is that any way to talk about our child his eyes shifted to hers in an expression so masculine and ironic she collapsed on his chest in a fit of giggles i put him there because he was supposed to be the only macgregor who charmed his way into my bed really alan tugged on her hair until she lifted her face full of amusement and fun to his is that what i did you knew damn well i wouldnt be able to resist balloons and rainbows forever the candlelight flickered over his face shelby traced the shifting light with a fingertip i meant to resist your charms i really did i wasnt going to do this alan took her wrist guiding her hand over so that he could press a kiss to the palm make love with me no shelbys gaze traveled from his mouth to his eyes be in love with you she felt his fingers tighten on her wrist then loosen slowly as his eyes stayed dark and fixed on hers beneath her she felt the change in his heartbeat and are you yes the word hardly audible thundered in his head alan brought her to him cradling her head against his chest feeling her low slow expulsion of air as his arm came around her he hadnt expected her to give him so much so soon when when shelby repeated enjoying the solid feel of his chest under her cheek sometime between when we first stepped out on the writes terrace and when i opened a basket of strawberries it took you that long all i had to do was look at you shelby brought her head up and found her eyes locked with his he wouldnt exaggerate she knew it wasnt his style simple words with simple truth overwhelmed she framed his face in her hands if you had told me that a week ago a day ago i would have thought you were mad on a flow of laughter she pressed her mouth to his maybe you are it doesnt seem to matter with a sigh she melted against him it doesnt seem to matter at all she knew she had tenderness in her for children and small animals shed never felt real tenderness for a man but when she kissed him now with words of love still echoing in her head shelby was swamped with it her hands came back to his face her artists fingers tracing molding the shape until she thought she knew it well enough to conjure it out of air if someone asked her to then she trailed them down over the column of his throat along the shoulders firm with muscle shoulders to depend on strong enough to hold your problems if you needed them to but she wouldnt ask it was enough to know they were there with her mouth still tasting still lingering on his she ran her fingers down his arms as if in the first storm of lovemaking shed been too frantic to really see the whole man she realized as she nuzzled into his neck that she could smell herself on him and thought it was wonderful his arms came around her and they stayed just so for a moment naked entwined content can i tell you something without it going to your head shelby murmured as she ran her fingers down his chest over his ribs probably not his voice had thickened from the pleasure of being touched im easily flattered in my workroom shelby pressed her lips to his chest and felt his heartbeat thud faster against them when i messed up your shirt and you took it off to rinse it i turned around and saw you i wanted to get my hands on you like this she ran her palms up then down again to where his waist narrowed just like this i nearly did alan felt his blood start to pound in his head his heart his loins i wouldnt have put up much of a fight if id decided to have you senator she murmured on a sultry laugh you wouldnt have had a chance is that so shelby ran her tongue down his rib cage mmm she said when she heard the small quick intake of breath just so a macgregor will always buckle under to a campbell alan started to form a retort then her fingers skimmed his thigh as a politician he knew the value of a debate but sometimes they didnt require words she could have the floor first he could float under the strong skilled touch of her hands as the need built in power so did the pleasure of the prolonging she seemed absorbed with the shape of his body the texture of his skin the candlelight flickered pale red against the back of his eyelids as he lay steeped in what she brought him the rain continued its monotonous song but he began to hear only shelbys quiet sighs and murmurs she moved slowly loitering here nibbling there a touch could weaken or excite a kiss could soothe or madden his pulse beat faster then faster still until he knew it was time to present his side in a swift move he rolled her beneath him her face was flushed with heat her breathing unsteady with the edges of passion just begun alan looked at her wanting this memory for cold nights and listless afternoons the wild splash of red that was her hair tumbled over the vivid green of the bedspread shadows from the candle shifted over her face reminding him of the impression hed first had of her the gypsy open fires weeping violins her eyes were dark pure gray and waiting we macgregors he murmured have ways of dealing with campbells his mouth lowered but paused a whisper from hers he saw that her lids had fluttered down yet hadnt closed she watched him through her lashes while her breath came quickly slowly he shifted his head to nibble along her jawline shelby closed her eyes on a moan that was as much in protest as appreciation her lips were aching for his but the feel of that clever mouth teasing over her skin brought such quick such vibrant thrills his hands were already on her moving with a thoroughness she knew he would always bring to her lazy lengthy devastating circles were traced around her breasts with tongue and teeth and lips however he didnt allow her to concentrate on only the sensation there his fingers skimmed low over her stomach taunting promising until she arched against him desperate for that blinding flash of heat but he was in no hurry now and so drew out her pleasure built her needs layer by layer with that intense patience that left her helpless his mouth inched lower his tongue flicking fires his hand fanning them neither knew the moment when the world ceased to exist it might have been winked out in an instant it might have spun slowly to a stop but there was nothing but them flesh against flesh sigh for sigh need for need his mouth came back to hers drawing out that last moment before oblivion would claim them she was trembling when he slipped inside her harnessing the power rushing through him he would pleasure her until they were both mad from it he took her slowly listening to the deep shuddering breaths that mixed with his as their lips clung drinking in the hot moist tastes of her mouth time seemed to hold for them then it came spinning back until it was all speed all whirling urgency alan buried his face at her throat and went with the madness chapter eight contents prev next dingy gloomy mornings tended to make shelby pull the covers over her head and tune out for an extra hour after her mental alarm rang this morning feeling the warmth of alan beside her she snuggled closer and prepared to do the same thing it was obvious after his hand slid down her back and intimately over her bottom that he had other plans are you awake he murmured next to her ear or should i wake you she gave him an mmm for an answer i take that to mean youre undecided alan moved his lips down to her throat where her pulse beat slow and steady how long he wondered idly would it take him to change that maybe i can influence you to take a firmer stand slowly enjoying her drowsy response he began to kiss and fondle it seemed impossible he knew that he could have steeped himself in her the night before and still want her so feverishly this morning but her skin was so warm and soft so was her mouth her movements beneath him remained lazy but not sluggish he felt as he wanted to the gradual increase of her pulse passion slept in her so that she seemed content to let him touch and explore as he chose while she aroused him with her sighs alone the morning grew late but they had forever their lovemaking had a misty dreamy aura that lasted from the first casual touch to the last breathless kiss i think shelby said as alan nuzzled lazily between her breasts that we should stay in bed until it stops raining too soon he murmured you should have thought of that days ago with his eyes closed he could see her lying sleepily beneath him her skin still heated from his are you going to open the shop today she yawned running her hands along the ridge of muscles in his upper back kyle takes care of it on saturdays we can stay right here and sleep he kissed the curve of her breasts then slowly worked up to her throat ive a luncheon meeting this afternoon and some paperwork that has to be taken care of before monday of course she thought biting back a sigh to a man like alan saturday was just another day of the week a glance at the clock showed her it was barely seven in reflex she curled into him time was al ready slipping away that gives us a few hours to stay right here what about breakfast shelby considered for a minute then decided she was lazier than she was hungry can you cook no drawing her brows together she grabbed both of his ears and drew his head up not at all thats remarkably chauvinistic for a man whose policies primarily reflect the feminist viewpoint alan lifted a brow i dont expect you to be able to cook either amusement shot into his eyes can you shelby struggled with a grin barely i find that odd for someone with your appetite i eat out a lot what about you mcgee sees to it mcgee hes what you might term a family retainer alan twined a tumbled curl around his finger he was our butler when i was a boy and when i moved to dc he insisted in his stoic unmovable way on coming with me he gave her the quick flash of grin that came rarely to him ive always been his favorite is that so lazily shelby folded her arms behind her head she could picture him as a boy seeing beyond what other boys saw and storing it why if i werent modest id confess that i was always a wellmannered eventempered child who never gave my parents a moments trouble liar she said easily howd you get the broken nose the grin became rueful rena punched me your sister broke your nose shelby burst out with delighted and unsympathetic laughter the blackjack dealer right oh i love it alan caught shelbys nose between two fingers and gave it a quick twist it was rather painful at the time i imagine she kept right on laughing as he shifted to her side did she make a habit of beating you up she didnt beat me up he corrected with some dignity she was trying to beat caine up because hed teased her about making calfs eyes at one of his friends typical brotherly intimidation in any event alan put in mildly i went to drag her off him she took another swing missed him and hit me a fullpower roundhouse as i remember thats when he continued as shelby gave another peal of laughter i decided against being a diplomat its always the neutral party that gets punched in the face im sure shelby dropped her head on his shoulder im sure she was sorry initially but as i recall after id stopped bleeding and threatening to kill both her and caine her reaction was a great deal like yours insensitive shelby ran apologetic kisses over his face poor baby tell you what ill do penance and see about fixing you breakfast with a quick burst of energy she gave him a last kiss and bounded from the bed come on lets see whats in the kitchen finding a robe that had been tossed over a chair shelby waited until alan slipped into his slacks you can make the coffee she told him while i see if theres anything edible in the fridge sounds promising alan murmured now dont get snotty before you know what might turn up she advised they passed through the living room where the cat simply rolled over on the sofa and ignored them hes still sulking shelby stated with a sigh now ill have to buy him chicken livers or something she stopped to pull the water dish out of auntie ems cage hes a moody creature isnt he she said to the bird auntie em gave one impatient squawk the extent of her vocabulary sounds like she got up on the wrong side of the perch alan commented oh no shes in a good mood if she says anything he gave shelby an interested glance did she for an answer she handed him the water bowl here you can take care of this before you start the coffee without waiting for an assent she went through the kitchen to the side door to bring in the paper alan looked down at the container like a man whod been handed a small dampbottomed child it seems the presidents mideast tour is still the top story she noted before she tossed the paper onto the counter do you like to travel recognizing the meaning behind the query alan switched off the water before he answered at times i enjoy it at times its simply a necessity it isnt always possible to choose when and where i go deliberately she shook off the mood i suppose not shelby opened the refrigerator and stared inside until she heard him move away to see to the bird dont think about it she ordered herself fiercely youre not to think about it today well she began brightly when alan came back into the room what we have here is a quart of milk a couple of leftover cartons of chinese a very small slice of goat cheese half a pack of fig newtons and an egg alan came up to look over her shoulder one egg all right just wait a minute shelby told him while she nibbled on her lower lip you have to consider the possibilities we could consider the restaurant around the corner the man has no vision shelby muttered as she concentrated let me see moving aside she rummaged through a cupboard okay i have three four five slices of bread if you count the heels french toast she smiled triumphantly thats two and a half pieces for each of us alan nodded all right you take the heels picky clucking her tongue shelby went back for the milk and the egg discriminating he corrected and left her to her creation while he made coffee for a few moments they worked in companionable silence alan measured out coffee and water shelby dumped what she thought might be the right amount of milk into a bowl alan watched her rummage through a cupboard pushing aside an empty jar a large plastic container without a lid and a looseleaf notebook so theres where that is she was muttering until she came up with a frying pan as she rose shelby caught his eye and the gleam of amusement i dont do a great deal of this shelby put the pan on a burner and flicked on the flame id remind you of that restaurant around the corner except his gaze flicked over the robe that dipped deep at her breasts and skimmed her thighs youd have to get dressed shelby smiled a slow invitation but when he took a step toward her she dunked bread into the batter get a plate he reached into the cupboard she indicated then drew two plates out before he came to stand behind her leaning over he brushed his lips below her ear pleased with the quick tremor of response the ones i burn shelby warned are all yours he chuckled and set the plates beside the stove got any powdered sugar for what catching her tongue between her teeth shelby flipped the bread over for that alan opened three likely drawers before he located the flatware rubbing her nose with the back of her hand she glanced over as the last piece began to simmer in the pan dont you use syrup no with a careless shrug she slipped the last slice of toast onto a plate well you do today i probably have some in the second cabinet to the left she decided while he looked she meticulously divided one piece in half shelby had poured the coffee and brought the plates and cups to the table before he managed to locate the bottle it looks like we have about a tablespoon alan decided as he tilted the bottle to its side thats one and a half spoonfuls apiece sitting shelby held out her hand for the bottle after pouring carefully she passed the syrup back to him i have a hard time remembering what im nearly out of she told him as she began to eat he fought to squeeze out the last drops from the bottle you must have six boxes of cat food in that cupboard moshe gets cranky if i dont keep a variety after tasting his breakfast alan found it better than he had expected i have a hard time understanding anyone as strongwilled as you being intimidated by a temperamental cat shelby lifted her shoulders and continued to eat we all have our weaknesses besides as roommates go hes perfect he doesnt listen in on my phone calls or borrow my clothes are those your prerequisites theyre certainly in the top ten watching her alan nodded shed plowed her way through the toast in record time if i promised to restrain myself from doing either of those things would you marry me the cup she had lifted froze halfway to her lips for the first time since hed met her alan saw shelby totally and completely stunned she put the coffee down untasted then stared at it while hundreds of thoughts raced through her head dominating them all was the simple and basic emotion of fear shelby quickly she shook her head she rose clattering the flatware onto her plate and scooping it up to take it to the sink she didnt speak didnt dare speak yet what threatened to come out was yes and she feared that most of all there was a pressure in her chest a weight a pain it reminded her to let out the breath shed been holding as she did shelby leaned heavily against the sink and stared into the rain when alans hands came to her shoulders she closed her eyes why hadnt she been prepared she knew that for a man like alan love would lead to marriage and marriage to children she told herself as she tried to calm her nerves if it wasnt what she wanted as well she wouldnt feel this frenzied urge to say yes and to say yes quickly but it wasnt as simple as love to marriage to children not with alan there was the senator in front of his name and that wouldnt be the highest title hed attempt shelby his voice was still gentle though she thought she could feel tiny pulses of impatience and frustration in the fingers that moved on her shoulders i love you youre the only woman ive ever wanted to spend my life with i need mornings like this waking with you so do i he turned her to face him the intensity was back in his eyes that dark seriousness that had first attracted her to him he scanned her face slowly thoroughly then marry me you make it sound so simple no he interrupted not simple necessary vital but not simple dont ask me now shelby wrapped her arms around him and held him close please dont were together and i love you let that be enough for now he wanted to press instinct told him he had only to demand an answer to hear the one he needed and yet hed seen vulnerability when hed looked into her face hed seen a plea in her eyes two things rare in shelby campbell two things that made it impossible for him to demand anything ill want you just as much tomorrow he murmured stroking her hair and a year from tomorrow i can promise to wait to ask you again shelby but i cant promise to wait until youre ready to answer you dont have to promise tilting back her head she put a hand on either side of his face you dont have to give me any promises for now lets just enjoy what we have a rainy weekend with each other we dont need to think about tomorrows alan when we have so much today questions are for later when she pressed her mouth to his shelby felt a wave of love so intense it brought shivers of fear to her skin come back to bed make love with me again when you do theres nothing and no one but you and me he felt her desperation though he didnt fully understand it without a word alan picked her up and carried her back to bed i can still send my regrets alan stated as he pulled the car up in front of his house alan i dont mind going really shelby leaned over to give him a quick kiss before she slid out of the car the rain had slowed to a drizzling evening mist that dampened the shoulders of her short velvet jacket besides these dinner dances can be fun even when theyre disguised political functions alan joined her on the sidewalk to tilt her chin for another kiss i believe youd go anywhere as long as food was on the bill it is an incentive all its own hooking an arm through his shelby started up the walk and i also get the opportunity of poking around your house while youre changing you might find it a bit sedate for your tastes with a smoky laugh shelby bit his ear youre not i think alan considered as he opened the front door wed have a more stimulating evening at home i could be persuaded after stepping inside shelby turned to wind her arms around his neck if youd like to make the effort before alan could oblige he heard a stiff little cough mcgee stood near the parlor doors sturdy as a tree his long lined face was expressionless over the distance of six feet alan felt the waves of disapproval he nearly sighed mcgee could still stand like the perfectly mannered servant and throw off vibrations like a stern uncle since hed been sixteen alan had had to deal with that dignified disapproval whenever hed come home late or not in the most sober of conditions you had several calls senator alans mouth nearly twitched before he controlled it the senator was reserved for use in the presence of company anything urgent mcgee nothing urgent senator he replied rolling the r for emphasis and delighting shelby ill see to them later then shelby this is mcgee hes been with my family since i was a boy hello mcgee with no selfconsciousness shelby released alan to walk to his servant and offer her hand are you a highlander maam from perthshire her smile would have charmed the bark off any tree even such a gnarled one my grandfather came from dalmally do you know it aye alan watched the faded eyes warm its country worth seeing twice i thought so myself though i havent been since i was seven its the mountains i remember most do you go back often every spring to see the heather blooming theres nothing like walking in the heather in june it was the longest and alan mused the most romantic statement he had ever heard mcgee make in the presence of anyone who wasnt family yet it didnt surprise him mcgee if youll make some tea ill go up and change perhaps you could serve ms campbell in the parlor campbell mcgees habitual stone face cracked with surprise as he stared from alan to shelby campbell briefly very briefly shelby thought she caught a look of unholy glee in his eyes theres going tbe a ruckus he murmured before turning on his heel to stride toward the kitchen not everyone would have gotten that much out of him alan commented as he steered shelby into the parlor was that a lot my love for mcgee that was an oratory hmm well i liked him shelby decided as she wandered through the room especially the way he scolded you without saying a word for staying out all night slipping her hands into the deep pockets of her slim skirt she studied the seascape on the wall the room was ordered calm with subtle touches of turbulence it suited the man she mused shelby remembered the jade krater shed made the day after shed met him hed have to have it for this room she reflected strange that she should have made something then that fit so perfectly into his world why couldnt she forcing the thought back she turned around to smile at him i like how you live the simple statement surprised him simple statements werent the norm for shelby hed expected some lighthearted comment with a slick double edge going to her alan ran his hands up the arms of her jacket still damp from the drizzle i like seeing you here she wanted to cling to him then right then desperately if only he could tell her everything would always be as it was at that moment that nothing would change or interfere instead she touched a palm to his cheek and kept her voice light youd better go up and change senator the sooner we get there now she grinned the sooner we can get away he pressed her palm to his lips i like your thought process i wont be long alone shelby closed her eyes and gave in to the panic what was she going to do how could she love him need him like this when her head was screaming with warnings dont be careful remember there were a dozen solid viable reasons why they didnt belong together she could list them all when he wasnt looking at her she didnt even need that shivery misty fear that she kept trapped in the back of her mind she looked at the room again closely there was a basic order here a style she admired the understated wealth she understood fastidiousness without fussiness but it wasnt her style shelby lived in chaos not because she was too lazy or too indifferent to order her life but because she chose chaos there was an innate goodness in alan she wasnt sure she had a tolerance she was sure she didnt alan ran on facts or theories that had been well thoughtout she ran on imagination and possibilities it was crazy shelby told herself as she dragged a hand through her hair how could two people with so little common ground love each other so much she should have run she told herself she should have run fast and far the first minute she set eyes on him with a half laugh shelby paced to the other end of the room it would have done her no good she could have fled like a crazed rabbit alan would have tracked her calmly unhurriedly when she had collapsed out of breath he would just simply have been there waiting for her your tea miss campbell shelby turned to see mcgee enter with a porcelain tea service she simply had to touch oh meissen red stoneware she lifted the delicately painted marbleized cup johann bottger early s wonderful shelby studied the cup as any art student studies the work of a master shed always felt museums had the right to preserve some irreplaceables behind glass while the rest should be handled touched and used he never reached his lifelong aim she murmured to achieve that oriental perfection of color decoration but what marvelous things he produced trying catching the butlers eye shelby realized she was being weighed as a possible gold digger amused she set the cup back on the tray sorry mcgee i get carried away ive an affection for clay clay miss she tapped a finger against the cup it all starts out that way just a lump of different sorts of dirt yes miss he decided it would be undignified to pursue the matter perhaps youd care to sit on the sofa shelby obliged him then watched as he carefully arranged the service on the table in front of her mcgee has alan always been so quietly unbeatable yes miss he answered without thinking the phrase had been so perfectly apt i was afraid so shelby murmured i beg your pardon miss what distracted shelby glanced up then shook her head nothing nothing at all thank you mcgee shelby sipped wondering why she had bothered to ask when she had known the answer alan would always win in whatever aspect of his life he concentrated on for a moment she stared into the pale gold tea that was exactly what she most feared whats the current price for a thought in these days of inflation alan wondered aloud as he paused in the doorway shed looked so beautiful he reflected so distant then she glanced up with a smile that enhanced the first and erased the second that was quick shelby complimented him and avoided the question with equal ease im afraid i admired your tea set a bit too strongly and made your butler nervous he might be wondering if ill slip the saucer into my bag setting down the cup she rose are you ready to go be charming and distinguished you look as though you would be alan lifted a brow i have a feeling distinguished comes perilously close to sedate in your book no youve lots of room yet she told him as she breezed into the hall ill give you a jab of you start teetering toward sedate alan stopped her in the hall by slipping his arms around her waist i havent done this in one hour and twentythree minutes his mouth covered hers slowly confidently as her lips parted and offered he took taking the kiss just to the border but no further of madness i love you he caught her bottom lip between his teeth then released her mouth only to change the angle and deepen the kiss he felt her heartbeat sprint against his felt that long lazy melting of her bones he knew happened just before she went from pliant to avid tonight no matter who you dance with think of me breathless she looked up in his eyes she saw that banked brooding passion she could never resist hed overwhelm her if she let him absorb her he had the power shelby tilted her head so her lips stayed within a whisper of his tonight she said huskily no matter who you dance with youll want me her arms stayed around him when she rested her head on his shoulder and ill know just then she caught a glimpse of them in the long beveled mirror framed on the wall alan sleek and sophisticated was as conventional in black tie as she was unorthodox in the snug velvet jacket and narrow rosehued skirt shed found in a shop that specialized in castoff heirlooms alan shelby nudged him around until he faced the mirror with her what do you see with his arm around her waist he studied their reflections the top of her head came to the base of his jaw he wondered what other redhead could have not only worn that shade of rose but looked so stunning in it she might have stepped out of that antique looking glass in the century in which it had been fashioned but there was no cameo at her neck instead there was a thick twisted gold chain that probably came from a narrow little georgetown shop her hair curled riotously untamedly around her pale angled face the faint shadow of trouble in her eyes made her look more like the waif hed first compared her to i see two people in love he said with his gaze fixed on hers in the glass two very different people who look extraordinarily well together shelby leaned her head on his shoulder again unsure if she was glad or annoyed that he read her so perfectly he would look very good and much more suitable with a cool blonde in a very classic black dress alan seemed to consider for a moment do you know he said mildly thats the first time ive heard you sound like a complete ass she stared back at his image at the faintly interested fully reasonable expression on his face she laughed there seemed to be nothing else for her to do all right just for that im going to be every bit as dignified as you are god forbid alan muttered before he pulled her out the front door elegant lighting and the sparkle of crystal white linen tablecloths and the gleam of silver shelby sat at one of the more than twodozen large round tables with alan on one hand and the head of the ways and means committee on the other she spooned at her lobster bisque and kept up a flowing conversation if you werent so stubborn leo and tried an aluminum racket you might just see an improvement in your game my game has improved the balding bullshouldered statesman shook his spoon at her we havent had a match in six months you wouldnt beat me in straight sets now shelby smiled sipping from her water glass as one course was cleared and replaced by the next well see if i cant squeeze out a couple of hours and get to the club you do that damned if i wouldnt enjoy whipping you youre going to have to watch those foot faults leo she reminded him with the grin still in her eyes she thanked fate for seating her next to leo with him she could be easy natural there were dozens of people in the huge highceilinged room she knew and a handful shed have been genuinely pleased to spend an hour with ambition it wafted through the room like expensive perfume she didnt mind that but the stiff unbending rules and traditions that went hand in hand with it hand in hand with alan she remembered then pushed the thought aside shed promised him shed be on her best behavior god knows she was trying then theres your weak backhand just leave my backhand alone he told her with a sniff leaning forward a bit he frowned at alan you ever played tennis with this hustler macgregor no i havent his eyes skimmed over to shelbys yet well ill warn you this little girl takes a vicious delight in winning no respect for age either he added as he picked up his fork im still not going to spot you points for years leo shelby stated easily you have a habit of adding them indiscriminately when youre behind in sets a smile twitched at his mouth devil he accused you wait until the rematch with a laugh shelby turned back to alan do you play tennis senator now and then he said with the ghost of a smile he didnt add hed lettered in the sport at harvard id imagine chess would be your game plotting longterm strategy his smile remained enigmatic as he reached for his wine well have to have a game shelbys low laugh drifted over him i believe we already have his hand brushed lightly over hers want a rematch shelby gave him a look that made his blood spring hotly no you might not outmaneuver me a second time god but he wished the interminable meal would end he wanted her alone alone where he could peel off those clothes layer by layer and feel her skin warm he could watch those laughing gray eyes cloud until he knew she thought of nothing but him it was her scent that was hammering at his senses not the arrangement of baby roses in the center of the table not the aroma of food as yet another course was served it was her voice he heard low and just a little throaty not the tones and textures of the voices all around him he could talk with the congresswoman on his right talk as if he were vitally interested in everything she told him but he thought about holding shelby and hearing her murmur his name when she touched him this sharpness of need would ease alan told himself it had to a man could go mad wanting a woman this intensely in time it would become a more comfortable sensation a touch in the middle of the night a smile across the room he glanced at her profile as she continued to tease leo those sharp pixie features that tousled flame of hair shed never be comfortable the need would never ease and she was his destiny as much as he was hers neither of them could stop it the conversations ebbed and flowed over the muted dinner music a curtain of smoke rose up toward the ceiling from cigarettes and pipes and afterdinner cigars talk centered around politics edgy at times pragmatic at others whatever other topic that came up was invariably linked to the core of the world they revolved in alan heard shelby give a concise and unflattering opinion of a controversial bill slated to come before congress the following week it infuriated the man she spoke with though he maintained a tightlipped control shelby seemed implacably trying to break though he agreed with her stand her tactics were rebellious he decided after a moment a diplomat she would never be did she know how complex she was he wondered here was a woman dead set against politicians as a group yet she could meet them on their own terms talk to them in their own voice without revealing the slightest discomfort if indeed she felt any alan added no if there was discomfort it was on the op posing side his gaze skimmed over the other people at their table as he continued his conversation with the congresswoman shelby didnt have their polish their gloss and alan knew it was through her own choosing more than that she was dedicatedly opposed to possessing it she didnt exploit the unique she simply was the unique the sleek brunette across from him might be more beautiful the blonde more regal but it was shelby you would remember when the evening was over the representative from ohio might have a wicked wit the assistant secretary of state might be erudite but it was shelby you wanted to talk to why the reason was there was no reason you could name it was simply so he felt her shift before her lips brushed close to his ear are you going to dance with me senator its the only dignified way i can get my hands on you at the moment alan let the first wave of desire take him a rush that blanked everyone else from his sight and hearing for one heady instant carefully he banked it before he rose and took her hand strange how closely our minds work after leading her to the dance floor he gathered her to him and how well he murmured as their bodies melded together we fit shelby tilted her head back we shouldnt her eyes promised hot private secrets her lips tempted just parted just curved the hand on his shoulder moved nearer to his neck so she could brush his skin with her fingertips we shouldnt fit we shouldnt understand each other i cant quite figure out why we do you defy logic shelby and therefore logically theres no reasonable answer she laughed pleased with the structured workings of his mind oh alan youre much too sensible to be argued with which means youll constantly do so exactly still smiling she rested her head on his shoulder you know me too well for my own good alan and perhaps for yours im in danger of adoring you he remembered myra had used that word to describe shelbys feelings for her father ill take the risk will you with her eyes closed she made a slight movement with her head neither of them knew if it was assent or denial as the evening wore on they danced again each thinking of the other as they moved to the music with someone else from time to time if they saw each other across the room a message would pass too strong and too direct not to be observed by people whose livelihoods depended on the interpretation of a look or gesture undercurrents of all kinds were an intimate part of the game in washington some flowed with them others against them but all acknowledged them well alan leo clamped a hand on alans shoulder as shelby was led onto the dance floor again youre making some progress on your personal windmill alan settled back with his wine halfsmiling he didnt mind the allusion to don quixote when it came to his housing project that sort of tag would have certain advantages in the long run it was human nature to at least root for the underdog even if doing nothing tangible to help a bit im beginning to get some positive feedback from boston on the progress of the shelters there it would be to your benefit if you could get and keep the ball rolling during this administration he flipped out a lighter and flicked it at the end of a long fragrant cigar it should bring a lot of support your way if you decide to toss your hat in the ring alan tasted the wine and watched shelby its early days yet for that leo you know better leo puffed smoke toward the ceiling i never wanted that particular race for myself but you a lot of people are willing to swing your way when the time comes if you give the nod alan turned to give his colleague a long look so ive been told he said cautiously i appreciate it it isnt a decision ill make lightly one way or the other let me give you a few pros because bluntly im not enthusiastic about what we have in the bull pen at the moment he leaned a bit closer your records impressive even though it leans a bit to the left for some tastes you had a solid run in congress and your term as senators running smoothly i wont get into a point by point of your policies or your individual bills lets stick with image he puffed on the cigar again as he considered your youth is to your advantage it gives us time your education was slick and impressive and the fact that you did well in sports never hurts people like to think that their leader can handle himself on any playing field your family backgrounds clean and solid the fact that your mother is a highly successful professional works strongly in your favor shell be glad to hear it alan said dryly youre too smart to think it doesnt matter leo reminded him gesturing with his cigar it shows that you can relate and understand professional women a healthy chunk of the voting power your father has a reputation for going his own way but going honestly theres no hornets nest to keep locked in the attic leo alan swirled his wine before he shot leo a direct look who asked you to speak to me and youre perceptive leo returned without missing a beat lets just say i was asked to approach you and touch on some generalities all right generally speaking i havent ruled out the possibility of entering the primaries when the time comes fair enough leo nodded toward shelby im personally fond of the girl but will she be an asset to you i never would have seen the two of you as a couple oh the word was mild but alans eyes narrowed ever so slightly campbells daughter she knows the ropes being on the campaign trail as a child leo pursed his lips cautiously weighing the pros and cons shelby grew up with politics so she wouldnt have to be tutored on protocol or diplomacy of course shes a bit of a maverick he tapped his cigar thoughtfully more than a bit when it comes to it shes put her considerable energy into flouting the washington social scene for years there are those that rather like her for it myself for one but shes put a few noses out of joint in her day leo popped the cigar back into his mouth and chewed on it while alan remained flatly silent but then its possible to polish off a few rough edges shes young the flamboyance could be toned down her education and family background are above reproach theres enough glamour attached to her to attract not enough to alienate she runs her own business successfully and knows how to handle a crowd an excellent choice all in all he decided if you can whip her into shape alan set down his glass to prevent himself from throwing it shelby isnt required to be an asset he said in a deadly controlled voice she isnt required to be anything but what she chooses our relationship isnt grist for the political mill leo leo frowned at the tip of his cigar hed touched a nerve he realized but was rather pleased with the manner in which alan controlled rage it wasnt wise to have a hothead commanding the armed forces i realize you feel entitled to a certain amount of privacy alan but once you toss your hat in the ring you toss your ladys in too were a culture of couples one reflects the other knowing it was true only infuriated him more this was what shelby backed away from what she feared how could he protect her from it and remain what he was whatever i decide to do shelby remains free to be exactly what shelby is alan rose thats the bottom line chapter nine contents prev next with sunshine and the best of spirits shelby opened the doors of calliope monday morning if there had been a monsoon outside the windows it wouldnt have jarred her mood she had spent a long lazy sunday with alan never once venturing outside her apartment never once wanting to now shelby sat behind the counter and decided to allow a little of the outside world into her sphere taking the morning paper she opened it first as always to the comics what characters would appear in macintosh and what would they have to say for themselves with her elbows propped her hands supporting her chin shelby gave a snort of laughter as usual macintosh hit things on the head but at a tilted angle that couldnt be resisted she hoped the vice president kept his sense of humor after hed read his little part in this mornings column from her experience people in the limelight rarely objected to being caricaturized to a point exposure satirical or not was exposure shelby glanced at the signature line the simple gc identifying the cartoonist perhaps when one hit so often and so truly at the ego it was best to opt for anonymity she couldnt do it she realized it simply wasnt in her nature to be clever anonymously reaching absently for her halfcup of cooling coffee shelby continued down the page humor always eased her into the day and affirmed her view that whatever oddities there were in the world there was a place for them still sipping she glanced up as the door to the shop opened hi with a smile for maureen francis she pushed the paper aside the brunette didnt look like a woman whod even own a slicker much less wear one this morning it was silk robins egg blue cut into a slim spring suit hey you look great shelby told her admiring the suit without imagining herself in it thanks maureen set a trim leather briefcase on the counter i came by to pick up my pottery and to thank you ill get the boxes she slipped into the back room where shed instructed kyle to store them what do i get thanked for she called out the contact unable to contain her curiosity maureen slipped around the counter to poke her head into shelbys workroom this is wonderful she decided staring with laymans perplexity at the wheel before she scanned the shelves id love to watch you work sometime catch me in the right mood on a wednesday or saturday and ill give you a quick lesson if youd like can i ask you a stupid question sure shelby glanced back over her shoulder everyones entitled to three a week maureen gestured to encompass the workroom and the shop how do you manage all this by yourself i mean i know what its like to start your own business its difficult and complicated enough but when you add this kind of creativity the hours it takes you to produce something then to switch gears and go into merchandising thats not a stupid question shelby decided after a moment i suppose i like dipping my hands into both elements in here im normally very isolated out there she gestured toward the shop im not and i like calling my own tune with a grin she began shuffling cartons i imagine you do too or youd still be with that firm in chicago yes but i still have moments when im tempted to race back to safety she studied shelbys back i dont imagine you do theres a certain amount of fun in instability isnt there shelby countered especially if you believe theres bound to be a net somewhere to catch you if you slip off the edge with a laugh maureen shook her head thats one way of looking at it enjoy and take the rest on faith in a nutshell shelby handed maureen the first box then hefted the other two herself by the contact you mentioned i suppose you mean myra mmm yes i called her saturday afternoon all i had to do was say shelby and she invited me for brunch this morning myra doesnt believe in wasting time shelby blew her bangs out of her eyes as she set the boxes on the counter will you let me know how it goes youll be the first maureen promised you know not everyones so willing to hand out favors to close friends let alone strangers i really appreciate it you said you were good shelby reminded her with a grin as she started to make out a final receipt i thought you might be in any event you might not consider it so much a favor by this afternoon myras a tough lady som i maureen drew out her checkbook and an insatiably curious one you can tell me to mind my own business she began glancing back up at shelby but i have to ask you how things worked out with senator macgregor im afraid i didnt recognize him at the time i took him for your average lovesick maniac shelby considered the phrase and found it to her liking hes a stubborn man she told maureen and ripped off her copy of the receipt thank god good i like a man who thinks in rainbows well id better get these boxes into the car if i dont want to be late ill give you a hand holding boxes shelby propped the door open so maureen could pass the cars right here she popped open the rear door of a trim little hatchback i might just drop in on you on one of those wednesdays or saturdays fine if i snarl just back off until the mood passes good luck thanks maureen shut the hatch and moved around to the drivers side give the senator my regards will you laughing shelby waved her away before she went back into the shop shed box up that green krater she decided this time shed give alan a surprise he was about to get one in any case though it shouldnt have been a surprise to him alan didnt often feel harassed but this morning had been one continual stream of meetings he didnt often feel pressured by the press but the reporter who had been lying in wait for him outside the new senate office building had been both tenacious and irritating perhaps he still carried a layer of annoyance from his conversation with leo or perhaps he had simply been working too hard but by the time alan stepped off the elevator onto his own floor of the building his patience was strained to the breaking point senator his assistant sprang up from her chair looking nearly as frazzled as he felt the phones hardly stopped all morning she carried a leather ledger with her and was already thumbing through it a ned brewster with the aflcio congresswoman platt shiver at the mayors office in boston in reference to the back bay shelter smith the media adviser a rita cardova a social worker in northeast who insists on speaking to you personally about your housing project and later alan strode through to his office and closed the door ten minutes he promised himself ten minutes as he dropped his briefcase on his desk hed been answering a merrygoround of demands since eightthirty that morning damn if he wouldnt steal ten minutes before he hopped back on again it wasnt like him to need them he thought with a sound of frustration as he frowned out the window he could see the east side of the capitol the white dome symbolizing democracy freedom of thought justice everything alan had always believed in he could see capitol plaza with its huge round pots filled with flowers theyd been put in after the bombing an aesthetic barricade they represented what alan knew was part of the human web some sought to build some sought to destroy terrorism was frighteningly logical if he as leo had put it threw his hat into the ring it was something he would have to deal with every day his decision couldnt be put off much longer oh normally he could bide his time test the waters and in essence he would do so publicly but privately his decision had to come soon thered be no asking shelby to marry him again until he could first tell her what he was considering he would be asking her to share more than name home and family if he eventually sought the presidency he would be asking her to elect to give a section of her life to him to their country to the wheels of protocol and politics alan no longer considered the decision to be his alone shelby was already his wife in all but the legal sense he had only to convince her of that when the buzzer on his desk sounded he eyed it with displeasure hed only had five of his ten minutes annoyed he picked up the phone yes im sorry to disturb you senator but your fathers on line one he dragged a hand through his hair as he sat all right ill take it arlene im sorry its been a rough morning her tone underwent a quick and total change its okay your father sounds characteristically exuberant senator arlene you should have opted for the diplomatic corps he heard her light chuckle before he switched lines hello dad well well well so youre still alive the booming fullbodied voice was not so subtly laced with sarcasm your mother and i thought youd met with some fatal accident alan managed to keep the grin out of his voice i nicked myself shaving last week how are you he asks how i am daniel heaved a sigh that should have been patented for longsuffering fathers everywhere i wonder you even remember who i am but thats all right it doesnt matter about me your mother now shes been expecting her son to call her firstborn alan leaned back how often had he cursed fate for making him the eldest and giving his father that neat little phrase to needle mm with of course he remembered philosophically daniel had phrases for rena and caine as well the only daughter the youngest son it was all relative thingsve been a little hectic is mom there had an emergency at the hospital wild horses wouldnt have made daniel admit that his wife anna would have lectured him for an hour if shed known what he was up to daniel considered it basic strategy not to tell her until it was done since shes been moping and sighing around here he lied without qualm i thought id bury my pride and call you myself its time you took a weekend and came to see your mother alan lifted a wry brow knowing his father all too well id think shed be all wrapped up in her first prospective grandchild how is rena you can see for yourself this weekend daniel informed him i that is rena and justin have decided they want to spend a weekend with the family caine and diana are coming too youve been busy alan murmured what was that dont mumble boy i said youll be busy alan amended prudently for your mothers sake i can sacrifice my peace and quiet she worries about all of you you especially since youre still without wife and family the firstborn he added working himself up and both your brother and sister settled before you the eldest son my own fathers namesake and too busy flitting around to do his duty to the macgregor line alan thought about his grueling morning and nearly smiled the macgregor line seems to be moving along nicely maybe renall have twins hah but daniel considered the idea for a moment he thought he recalled twins a couple of generations back on his mothers side he made a mental note to check the family tree after he hung up well expect you friday night now daniel leaned across his massive desk and miffed on one of his for bidden cigars what the hell is all this i read in the papers narrow it down for me alan suggested i suppose it might have been a misprint daniel considered frowning at the tip of his cigar before he tapped it in the ashtray he kept secreted in the bottom drawer of his desk i think i know my own flesh and blood well enough narrow it just a bit further alan requested though hed already gotten the drift it was simply too good to end it too soon when i read that my own son my heir as things are is spending time fraternizing with a campbell i know its a simple matter of a misspelling whats the girls name along with a surge of affection alan felt a tug of pure and simple mischief which girl is that dammit boy the girl youre seeing who looks like a pixie fetching young thing from the picture i saw good bones holds herself well shelby alan said then waited a beat shelby campbell dead silence leaning back in his chair alan wondered how long it would be before his father remembered to take a breath it was a pity he mused a real pity that he couldnt see the old pirates face campbell the word erupted a thieving murdering campbell yes shes fond of macgregors as well no son of mine gives the time of day to one of the clan campbell daniel bellowed ill take a strap to you alan duncan macgregor the threat was as empty now as it had been when alan had been eight but delivered in the same fullpitched roar ill wear the hide off you youll have the chance to try this weekend when you meet shelby a campbell in my house hah a campbell in your house alan repeated mildly and a campbell in your family before the end of the year if i have my way you emotions warred in him a campbell versus his firmest aspiration to see each of his children married and settled and himself laden with grandchildren youre thinking of marriage to a campbell ive already asked her she wont have me yet he added wont have you paternal pride dominated all else what kind of a nitwit is she typical campbell he muttered mindless pagans daniel suspected theyd had some sorcerers sprinkled among them probably bewitched the boy he mumbled scowling into space always had good sense before this aye you bring your campbell to me he ordered roundly ill get to the bottom of it alan smothered a laugh forgetting the poor mood that had plagued him only minutes earlier ill ask her ask hah you bring the girl that daughter of a campbell here picturing shelby alan decided he wouldnt miss the meeting for twothirds of the popular vote ill see you friday dad give mom my love friday daniel murmured puffing avidly on his cigar aye aye friday as he hung up alan could all but see his father rubbing his huge hands together in anticipation it should be an interesting weekend when he pulled up in the alleyway beside shelbys town house alan forgot his fatigue the tenhour day was behind him with all its reams of paperwork facts and figures but when shelby opened the door to him she saw the weariness and the dregs of annoyance still in his eyes bad day for democracy with a smile she took his face in her hands and kissed him lightly long he corrected and pulled her closer for a more satisfactory embrace and he knew he could face a hundred more like it if he just had her when it was over sorry im late youre not youre here want a drink i wouldnt turn one down come on ill pretend im domestic for a few minutes shelby led him in to the couch after nudging him down she loosened his tie herself drew it off then undid the top two buttons of his shirt alan watched with a halfgrin as she pulled off his shoes i could get used to this well dont she advised on her way to the bar you never know when youll come in and find me collapsed on the couch and refusing to budge then ill pamper you he offered as she handed him a scotch shelby sat down to curl beside him i needed this the drink you when she tilted back her head he gave her a long lingering kiss just you you want to tell me about all the nasty officials or lobbyists or whatever that messed up your day he laughed and let the scotch linger on his tongue i had a rather lengthy goround with congresswoman platt martha platt shelby let out a knowing sigh she was a hardline opinionated pennypinching bureaucrat when i was a girl the description suited to a tee still is my father always said shed have made an excellent cpa she thinks in fiscal dollars and cents laughing he set down his glass who needed scotch when he had shelby what about you how are things in the business world slow this morning hectic this afternoon i had a flood of college students it seems pottery is in speaking of which i have something for you she sprang up and dashed away while alan stretched out his legs and realized he wasnt tired at all just more relaxed than he would have believed possible even twenty minutes before a present shelby told him as she set a box in his lap it might not be as romantic as your style but it is unique she dropped back down beside him as alan flipped the lid from the box in silence he lifted out the krater cupping the bowl in both hands somehow shed pictured him holding it that way as one of the roman leaders might have done seeing it in his hands gave her pleasure alan studied it without speaking it was smooth and deeply green with faint hints of something lighter just beneath the surface the lines were clean and simple exquisite in the very lack of decoration he could think of nothing hed been given that had seemed more important shelby its beautiful really really beautiful shifting it to one hand he took hers with the other its fascinated me right from the start that such small hands hold such large talent he kissed her fingers before his eyes lifted to hers thank you you were making this the day i came into your workroom you dont miss much do you pleased she ran a finger down the side of the bowl i was making it and thinking of you it seemed only right that you should have it when it was finished then when i saw your house i knew it was right for you its right for me he agreed before he settled the krater back in its box setting it carefully on the floor he drew her close again so are you she rested her head on his shoulder it seemed true when he said it lets send out for chinese hmm i thought you wanted to see that movie down the street that was this morning tonight id rather eat sweet and sour pork and neck with you on the couch in fact she considered as she began to nibble on his neck i could probably make do with a few stale crackers and some cheese alan turned so his lips could toy with hers how about we neck first and eat later you have such a wellordered mind shelby commented as she eased back against the jumble of pillows drawing him with her i just love the way it works kiss me alan the way you did when we first sat here it drove me mad her eyes were halfclosed her lips just parted alan tangled his fingers in the hair that tumbled wildly over the bold oddshaped pillows he didnt feel the patience now he had forced himself to feel that first time with shelby imagining what it would be like wasnt nearly as arousing as knowing what it was like she was more titillating than the most pagan fantasy more desirable than any fevered dream and she was here for him alan tasted her lips slowly as she had wanted him to the need to devour could be controlled when he knew there would be a time for it she sighed then trembled the combination nearly pushed him over the edge before hed realized hed been that close to it he hadnt even touched her but for that light teasing play of mouth on mouth he hadnt known torture could be so exquisite but he knew the sweet allure of agony now with his mouth fastened on shelbys with her fingers opening his shirt to explore him she loved the feel of him each time she could touch him freely shelby knew shed never tire of doing so it always brought such pure pleasure such sharp greed always when she saw something she admired she wanted to test the feel of it the weight the texture it was no different with alan yet each time she did it might have been the first the scent of his soap no her soap she remembered lingered on him but with the faint musky fragrance the day had worked on him his heart beat quickly though his mouth still made love to hers with slow enervating thoroughness her fingers slid up to his shoulders to push the shirt away to explore with more liberty his kiss lost its patience with an abruptness that left her breathless now she was spinning through the storm he could conjure like a magician boiling black clouds bold lightning she could have sworn she heard thunder but it was only the thud of her own pulse his hands were quick undressing her in something like a rage then molding her with hard sure strokes that had her passing from one convulsive shudder to another she crested rapidly mindlessly without the control to do any more than spin with the tempest he heard her call to him but he was too tangled in his own web to answer the lazy satiating love of the day before hadnt done this to him there was something wild in him something fierce that had never been given full freedom it came now like the panther would come if it finally tore free of its cage he was ravaging her and even knowing it couldnt stop her body was eager and trembling beneath his everywhere his mouth touched he tasted passion and promise she arched moaning with his tongue he drove her ruthlessly to another peak her body was on fire her mind wiped clean of thought to be ruled only by sensations she didnt know what he asked her though she heard the urgent huskiness of his voice she didnt know what she answered only that nothing he could have demanded would have been too much dimly through the curtain of passion she saw his face above hers his eyes werent brooding that was all that was clear they were dark almost savage i cant live without you he said in a whisper that seemed to echo endlessly in her head i wont then his mouth crushed down on hers and everything was lost in the delirium sure you dont want any more two hours later shelby sat crosslegged on the bed in a skimpy japaneseprint silk robe that left her legs bare she stuck her fork into a little white cardboard carton and scooped out some cooling sweet and sour pork behind her the television played on low volume with no picture at all alan stayed comfortably stretched out his head propped on her pillows no he watched her dig for more shelby why dont you get that set fixed mmm sooner or later she said vaguely before she set the carton aside pushing a hand against her stomach she sighed lustily im stuffed with a considering smile on her face she let her gaze wander down from his face over his leanly muscled body i wonder how many people in the washington metropolitan area know just how terrific senator macgregor looks in his underwear a select few you must have thought about image projection senator she ran a fingertip down the top of his foot you should consider doing some of those ads you know like the ball players i never meet with foreign dignitaries without my bvds one can only be grateful youre not the media adviser stuffy thats the whole problem she dropped fulllength on top of him just think of the possibilities alan slipped a hand under her robe i am discreetly placed ads in national magazines thirtyminute spots in prime time shelby propped her elbows on his shoulders id definitely get my set fixed think of the trend it might start federal official everywhere stripped down to their respective shorts shelbys brows drew together as she pictured it good god it could precipitate a national calamity worldwide alan corrected once the ball got rolling thered be no stopping it all right youve convinced me she gave him a smacking kiss its your patriotic duty to keep your clothes on except in here she added with a gleam in her eye as she toyed with his waistband laughing he drew her mouth back to his shelby her tongue skimmed over his while he cupped the back of her neck more firmly shelby he repeated a moment later there was something i wanted to talk to you about earlier and im in danger of becoming as distracted now as i was then promise she moved her lips to his throat i have a command performance this weekend oh she switched to his ear in selfdefense alan rolled over and pinned her beneath him i got a call from my father this afternoon ah humor danced in her eyes the laird the title would appeal to him alan grasped her wrists to prevent her from clouding his mind as she seemed bent on doing it seems hes planned one of his famous family weekends come with me one brow lifted to the macgregor fortress in hyannis port unarmed well hoist the white flag she wanted to go she wanted to say no a visit to his family home came perilously close to that final commitment she was so carefully sidestepping questions speculation thered be no avoiding them alan heard her thought as clearly as if it had been spoken pushing back frustration he changed tactics i have orders to bring that girl he watched her eyes narrow that daughter of the thieving murdering campbells with me oh is that so just so alan returned mildly shelby lifted her chin when do we leave chapter ten contents prev next shelbys first thought when she saw the house on the cliff was that she couldnt have done better herself it was glorious rough unpampered it sat high with towers rising and turrets jutting it was made of stone and hinted of the sea gloomy and mysterious in the lowering light a fortress a castle an anachronism she wouldnt label it only appreciate when she turned to alan shelby saw that his brow was lifted as he waited for her verdict there was that touch of humor in his eyes shed learned to detect and the irony that went with it on a laugh she leaned on the dash again to look her fill you knew id love it because he couldnt resist alan reached forward just to touch his fingertips to her hair i thought it might appeal to you shelby chuckled at the dry tone and continued to look at the house while alan drove the rented car up the sloping road if id grown up here id have had headless ghosts for playmates and kept my room in a tower alan maneuvered around one of the winding curves that only added to the atmosphere the sea was close enough so its scent and sound drifted in the open windows there arent any ghosts though my father periodically threatened to import a few bloodthirsty ones from scotland with his lips just curved he sent shelby a quick sidelong look he keeps his office in a tower room she turned lifted a brow then leaned on the dash again hmm brows still arched she studied the slit windows of the tower daniel macgregor yes she was looking forward to meeting him she decided even if it was on his home turf but before she did shelby was going to enjoy the view the flowers were a nice touch she reflected rivers of them flowing out from the base of the house in a wild concoction of spring fancy did the macgregor have the last say on the landscaping as well shelby wondered or was this his wifes province perhaps the thoracic surgeon relaxed by planting petunias shelby considered and decided it made sense clever hands and a clever mind would need just that sort of creative outlet if the house had been daniels design and the gardens annas shelby concluded they must suit each other very well both aspects were unique strong and unapologetic meeting them she mused might prove very interesting no sooner had alan stopped the car than shelby was climbing out to dash to the edge of a flower bed where she could stand and take in the whole structure at once she was laughing again her head thrown back the unmanageable curls tossing in the wind in the gloaming she thought the house would be at its best alan leaned against the hood of the car and watched her with shelby sometimes watching was enough he liked the look of her against the backdrop of wildly colored flowers and the dull stone of the house with her hands in the pockets of loosely fitting trousers the thin material of her blouse rippling in the wind the tiny tulips decorating the neckline had been painstakingly stitched more than fifty years before she wore a slim digital watch on her wrist id definitely have had ghosts she decided then held out her hand to him fierce clanking ghosts none of those moony ethereal types her fingers linked with alans and for a moment they looked up at the house together kiss me macgregor she demanded as she tossed windblown hair out of her eyes hard ive never seen a more perfect spot for it even as she spoke her body was pressing against his her free hand running firmly up his back to bring him close when their mouths met she thought she could smell a storm at sea no matter that the skies were clear she could touch him and feel the shivering jolt of lightning if he whispered her name as their lips moved together she could hear thunder then they were straining against each other lost oblivious of the world that had simply come to a halt around them there might have been seabirds coming to nest as night approached the moon might have started its slow slow rise even as the sun descended it didnt matter their world had its center in each other her hands brushed over his cheeks and remained lightly on his skin as they drew apart regret washed over her for what she couldnt yet give him for what she might never be able to give him a commitment that could transcend all fear all doubt and a promise she had made to herself i love you alan she murmured believe it in her eyes he could see the clouds of passion and the struggle yes she loved him but not yet alan ordered himself he could wait just a bit longer before he pressed her for more i believe it he said as he took her wrists gently he kissed both her hands before slipping an arm around her waist come inside shelby tilted her head just enough to rest it briefly on his shoulder as they walked to the door im relying on your word that ill walk out again in one piece at the end of the weekend he only grinned i told you my stand on playing the mediator thanks a lot she glanced up at the door noting the heavy brass crest that served as a door knocker the macgregor lion stared coolly at her with its gaelic motto over its crowned head your father isnt one to hide his light under a bushel is he lets just say he has a strong sense of family pride alan lifted the knocker then let it fall heavily against the thick door shelby imagined the sound would vibrate into every nook and cranny in the house the clan macgregor alan began in a low rolling burr is one of the few permitted to use the crown in their crest good blood strong stock hah shelbys disdainful look turned to one of mild curiosity as alan burst out with a roar of laughter something funny before he could answer the door swung open shelby saw a tall man blond with arresting blue eyes that hinted toward violet he had a lean face that spoke of intelligence and cunning leaning against the door he gave alan a quick grin you can laugh he said dads been ranting and muttering for an hour something about his gaze shifted and lingered on shelby traitors and infidels hello you must be the infidel the friendly irony in his voice had shelbys lips curving i must be shelby campbell my brother caine the first campbell ever to step into the macgregor keep enter at your own risk caine offered his hand as shelby crossed the threshold his first thought was that she had the face of a mermaid not quite beautiful but alluring and not easily forgotten shelby glanced around the wide hall approving the faded tapestries and heavy old furniture she caught the scent of spring flowers a wisp of dust and old polish no she couldnt have done it better herself well the roof didnt cave in she commented as she studied a crested shield on the wall so far so good alan serena came down the stairs quickly despite the encumbrance of pregnancy shelby saw an elegant violeteyed woman with hair somehow both delicate and richly blonde she saw too pleasure love humor before serena threw her arms around alans neck ive missed you you look beautiful rena gently he laid a hand on the mound of her belly his sister he thought as wonder and pride mixed together his baby sister i cant get used to it he murmured serena put her hand on his you dont have a great deal more time to get used to it she felt the baby move under their joined hands and grinned as alans gaze dropped to them he or she is impatient to begin tilting her head she studied alans face dads suddenly gotten it into his head there might be two i wonder who might have planted that seed his eyes smiled as he lifted them to his sisters it was purely a defensive maneuver mmmhmm turning she held out both hands you must be shelby im glad you could come shelby felt the warmth more carefree than alans the welcome less curious than caines so am i ive been wanting to meet the woman who broke alans nose with a muffled chuckle serena jerked her head toward caine it was supposed to be his she narrowed her eyes a moment as caine dipped his hands into his pockets and grinned it should have been his come on in and meet the rest of the family she continued as she tucked her arm through shelbys god i hope alan prepared you in his own way if you start to feel overwhelmed just shoot me a look these days all i have to do is sigh to distract dads attention for an hour and a half alan looked after the two women as they walked down the hall looks like renas taking it from here he murmured caine gave a crooked grin as he draped an arm over his brothers shoulder the truth is weve all been dying to see your campbell since dad made his uh announcement he didnt ask alan if it was serious he didnt have to he cast another speculative look at shelby as they too started down the hall i hope you told her that dads all bark and no bite now why would i do that shelby had a moment to take in the scene in the drawing room as she paused in the doorway there was a dark man smoking calmly in an old bulky chair shelby had the impression that while he hardly seemed to move at all he could move quickly when necessary on the arm of his chair sat a woman with the same coloring her hands were folded neatly on the lap of her vivid green skirt a striking couple shelby mused then it seemed the macgregors were a striking crowd across from them was a woman working serenely with embroidery hoop and needle shelby could see not only where alan got his features but that appealing serious smile in the center of the group was a wide highback chair ornately carved it suited the man who sat in it shelby noted that daniel macgregor was massive a dramaticlooking man with flaming red hair shoulders like a tank and a lined florid face she saw with a twinge of amusement that he wore the macgregor plaid sashed across his suit jacket he was indisputably holding court rena should be getting more rest he stated shoving a wide bluntedged finger at the man in the chair a woman in her conditions got no business being in a casino till all hours justin blew out a long lazy stream of smoke the casino is serenas business when a womans with child daniel paused long enough to shoot diana an inquiring look shelby watched the dark woman struggle with a grin before she shook her head daniel sighed then turned back to justin when a womans with child she can function like any other healthy woman serena finished for him before daniel could bluster out with whatever retort he had in mind he spotted shelby his broad shoulders lifted his wide chin tilted to a stubborn angle well he said briefly and left it at that shelby campbell serena began smoothly as she swept into the room with shelby at her side the rest of our family my husband justin blade shelby found herself fixed with a pair of very calm very shrewd green eyes he took his time about smiling but when he did it was worth it my sisterinlaw diana youre related shelby cut into the introductions as she studied both justin and diana brother and sister diana nodded liking the candor in shelbys eyes thats right what tribe she asked justin smiled again as he blew out another stream of smoke comanche good stock daniel stated with a thump of his hand on the arm of his chair shelby sent him a silent look my mother serena continued swallowing a chuckle were so pleased you could come shelby annas voice was quiet soothing her hand when it took shelbys was firm and strong thank you i was admiring your garden dr macgregor its spectacular anna smiled giving shelbys hand a quick squeeze thank you its one of my vanities when daniel cleared his throat loudly a flicker of amusement crossed annas face did you have a good flight she asked easily yes with her back to daniel shelby grinned very smooth let me get a look at the girl daniel demanded with another thump on the arm of his chair shelby heard serena muffle another chuckle slowly she turned to face daniel her chin was lifted at the same arrogant angle as his own shelby campbell alan said enjoying the moment my father daniel macgregor campbell daniel repeated tapping both wide hands on the arms of his chair shelby moved to him but didnt offer her hand aye she said because her blood seemed to demand it campbell daniel turned the corners of his mouth down and drew his brows together in what he considered his most formidable look shelby didnt blink my kin would sooner have a badger in their house than a campbell alan saw his mother open her mouth and shook his head to silence her he not only knew shelby could hold her own but wanted to see her do it most macgregors were comfortable enough with badgers in the parlor barbarians daniel sucked in his breath the campbells were barbarians each and every one of them shelby tilted her head as if to study him from a new angle the macgregors have a reputation for being sore losers instantly daniels face went nearly as red as his hair losers hah theres never been a campbell born who could stand up to a macgregor in a fair fight backstabbers well have rob roys biography again in a minute shelby heard caine mutter you dont have a drink dad he said hoping to distract him shelby yes she shifted her gaze to him noting he was doing his best to maintain sobriety scotch she told him with a quick irrepressible wink straight up if the macgregors had been wiser she continued without missing a beat perhaps they wouldnt have lost their land and their kilts and the name kings she want on mildly as daniel began to huff and puff have a habit of getting testy when someones trying to overthrow them kings daniel exploded an english king by god no true scotsman needed an english king to tell him how to live on his land shelbys lips curved as caine handed her a glass thats a truth i can drink to hah daniel lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow before he thumped it onto the table at his side cocking a brow shelby eyed the scotch in her glass then proceeded to follow daniels example for a moment he frowned at the empty glass beside his slowly with the room deadly silent he shifted his gaze back to shelby his eyes were fierce hers insolent heaving himself out of his chair he towered over her a great bear of a man with fiery hair she put both hands on her hips a willowslim woman with curls equally dramatic alan wished fleetingly he could paint daniels laugh when he threw back his head and let it loose was rich and loud and long aye by god heres a lass shelby found herself swept off her feet in a crushing hug that held welcome it didnt take long for shelby to sketch a mental outline of the macgregor family daniel was bold dramatic and demanding and an absolute marshmallow when it came to his children anna had eyes and a temperament like her eldest son she could shelby concluded quietly dominate anyone including her husband watching her throughout the evening shelby realized she would have to stay on her toes with alan he had his mothers patience and her insight a formidable combination she liked alans family the similarities and the contrasts individually she would have found them interesting as a group she found them fascinating the house itself was something shelby could never have resisted vaulted ceilings gargoyles odd suits of armor and endless passages they ate dinner in a dining hall as big as the average house spears were crossed over an enormous fireplace now filled with greenery rather than blazing logs windows were high and leaded but light came from an enormous waterford chandelier wealth its eccentricities and ostentations suited daniel macgregor shelby sat on daniels left and ran her finger around the rim of her dinner plate this is a beautiful setting she commented wedgwoods jasperware late eighteenth century the yellows very rare my grandmothers anna told her her one and only prize im afraid i didnt realize the color was rare blues lavenders greens and blacks are produced more commonly by oxide staining ive never seen this tone outside of a museum never understood all the fuss over a plate daniel put in because youre more interested in what goes on it serena commented shelbys a potter alan said mildly before his father could retort a potter daniels brows drew together as he studied her you make pots among other things shelby said dryly our mother made pottery diana murmured i remember her working at a little manual wheel when i was a girl its fascinating to see what can be made out of a little ball of clay do you remember justin yes she sometimes sold her pieces to the little store in town do you sell your work he asked shelby or is it a hobby i have a shop in georgetown she sensed a strong bond between brother and sister a shopkeeper daniel nodded in approval commerce was something he appreciated you sell your own wares then are you clever at it shelby lifted her wine i like to think so tossing her bangs out of her eyes she turned to alan would you say i was clever at it senator amazingly so he returned for someone without any sense of organization you manage to work at your craft run a shop and live precisely as you choose i like odd compliments shelby decided after a moment alans accustomed to a more structured routine hed never run out of gas on the freeway i like odd insults alan murmured into his wine makes a good balance daniel gestured at both of them with his fork know your own mind dont you girl as much as anyone youll make a good first lady shelby campbell shelbys fingers tightened on her wineglass an involuntary gesture noticed only by alan and his mother perhaps she returned calmly if it were one of my ambitions ambition or not its fate when youre paired with this one daniel stabbed his fork toward alan youre a little premature alan cut cleanly through his meat swearing fluidly in his mind only i havent decided to run for president and shelby hasnt agreed to marry me havent decided hah daniel swilled down wine hasnt agreed he set down the glass with a bang the girl doesnt look like a fool to me campbell or no he continued shes good scottish stock no matter what her clan this onell breed true macgregors hed still like me to change my name justin commented deliberately trying to shift the attention onto himself its been done to ensure the line before daniel told him but renas babell be as much macgregor as not as will caines when hes a mind to remember his duty and start making one he sent his younger son a loweredbrow look that was met with an insolent grin but alans the firstborn dutybound to marry and produce and sire alan turned intending on putting an end to the topic when he caught shelbys grin shed folded her arms on the table forgetting her dinner in the pure enjoyment of watching daniel macgregor on a roll having fun alan muttered near her ear wouldnt miss it is he always like this alan glanced over watching his father gesture with his lecture yes shelby sighed i think im in love daniel she interrupted his flow of words by tugging sharply on his sleeve no offense to alan or to your wife but i think if i were going to marry a macgregor hed have to be you still caught up in his own diatribe daniel stared at her abruptly his features shifted and his laugh rang out youre a pistol you are shelby campbell here he lifted a bottle of wine your glass is empty that was welldone alan told her later as he gave shelby a limited tour of the house was it laughing she linked her hand with his hes a difficult man to resist she rose on her toes to nibble his earlobe sos his firstborn that terms to be used reverently alan warned her personally ive always found it a pain in the oh this is fabulous shelby lifted a glassy porcelain vase from a high table french chantilly alan i swear this house is better than a sunken galleon id never get tired of wandering from one corridor to another after setting the vase down she turned to grin at him did you ever climb into one of those suits of armor caine did once it took me over an hour to pry him out shelby gave a murmur of sympathy as she framed his face with her hands you were such a good boy her laugh was muffled against his lips in a sudden searing kiss all heat all fire without a moments warning he climbed in alan continued as he tugged her hair back to deepen the kiss because i suggested it might be an interesting experience breathless shelby stared up at him when would she be prepared for those sudden dangerous turns of his nature an instigator she managed an objective leader he corrected before he released her and i did manage to get him out after hed scared the wits out of rena for a moment she leaned against the wall watching him while the throbbing in her body slowly very slowly lessened i dont believe you were nearly as wellmannered as you once told me you probably deserved that broken nose caine deserved it more shelby laughed again as they moved down another corridor i like your family so do i and you enjoyed watching me go nosetonose with your father ive always been fond of drawingroom comedies drawing room its more like a throne room she leaned her head against his shoulder its wonderful alan where did your father get the idea we were going to be married he flicked on a switch that brought a rather gloomy light into the hallway i told him id asked you he said easily my father has a difficult time understanding that anyone could refuse his firstborn alan turned effectively trapping shelby between the wall and himself the dim light deepened the hollows in his face casting his eyes into shadow she could feel the strength from him though their bodies were barely touching he could be fierce she knew just as easily as he could be gentle alan how long are you going to ask me to wait he hadnt intended to press had promised himself he wouldnt but seeing her in his childhood home with his family with his memories had only intensified his need for her for all of her i love you shelby i know her arms went around him her cheek pressed against his i love you give me a little more time alan just a little more time its too much to ask i know she held on tightly a moment before she drew away far enough to see his face youre more fair than i kinder more patient i have to take advantage of that he didnt feel fair or kind or patient he wanted to back her into a corner and demand insist beg there was too much macgregor in him to allow for the last and the look in her eyes wouldnt permit him to resort to the first two all right but shelby there are things we have to talk about when were back in washington once i make my decision ill have to ask you to make yours she moistened her lips afraid she knew what his decision related to not now she told herself she wouldnt think about it now in washington she would make herself deal with it but here now she wanted alan to herself with no cloud of politics no hints of the future well talk in washington she agreed and i promise you an answer nodding alan circled her throat with his hand make it the one i want he murmured then kissed her with no patience at all its late he added knowing she was both surprised and vulnerable as he continued to take greedy possession of her mouth i imagine everyones gone to bed we should go too he laughed capturing her earlobe between his teeth how about a midnight swim swim on a sigh shelby closed her eyes and let the sensations take her i didnt bring a suit good alan led her down the hall to two large double doors after pulling them open he nudged shelby inside then closed and locked the doors behind them well with her hands on her hips she surveyed the room it was large as was typical of everything in the house one wall was entirely glassed with huge lush plants hung at staggered levels shelby could see the moonlight ripple through the floor was made of tiny mosaic tiles in an intricate pattern of blues and greens centered in the room was an enormous bluetinted pool daniel macgregor doesnt piddle around does he her voice echoed hollowly off the water from the high ceiling with a grin shelby turned back to alan i bet you swam every day of your life the first time i saw you i had this flash of a channel swimmer marathon its the way youre built she gave his shoulder a quick squeeze maybe i wasnt so far off alan only smiled and drew her away from the pool well have a sauna first oh will we yeah he hooked a hand in the waistband of her trousers and drew her closer open the pores a bit in a quick move he unhooked them then drew them over her hips since you insist shelby began undoing his tie have you noticed senator that most of the time you wear a great many more clothes than i as a matter of fact he slipped his hands under her blouse and found her i have her fingers fumbled on his buttons unless you want to take your sauna fully dressed youll have to stop letting out a long breath shelby tugged off his shirt well need towels she added then ran her hands in one long stroke down his chest to his belt slowly alan slid the blouse from her shoulders allowing himself a lengthy look at her before he reached to the shelf behind him for towels she was pale slender alluring and challenging and his keeping her eyes on his shelby draped the towel saronglike around her dry heat rushed over her when alan opened the door to the small room shelby stood still a moment absorbing it before she moved to a bench i havent done this in months she murmured then shut her eyes and leaned back its wonderful im told my father cemented a number of profitable deals in this room alan eased down beside her shelby opened her eyes to slits i imagine he did by the time he was through he couldve reduced most normally built men to puddles idly she trailed a fingertip down alans thigh do you ever use saunas for vital government intrigue senator im inclined to think of other things in small hot rooms bending he brushed his lips over her bare shoulder the touch of a tongue the quick pressure of teeth vital certainly but more personal mmm shelby tilted her head as he trailed his lips closer to her throat how personal highly confidential alan drew her into his lap and began those slow nibbling kisses that always drugged her her mouth moved against his with lazy heatsoaked passion your body fascinates me shelby slender smooth agile his lips trailed down further to linger just above the loose knot in the towel and your mind thats agile too and as clever as your hands ive never been clear which attracted me first perhaps it was both at once she was content to lie back and let him make love to her with words and with the gentle brush of lips her muscles were lax from the heat her skin soft and damp when his lips came back to hers she found she hardly had the strength to lift her arm around his neck and bring him closer but her mouth could move to slant against his to open to invite to entice she concentrated all her power there as her body seemed to melt from the heat and the longing while he kissed her slowly deeply his fingertip nudged the knot of the towel until it loosened leaving her vulnerable to him he felt her moan once against his mouth tasted the trembling breath as it merged with his own her scent always exciting seemed to fill the tiny room until there was nothing else so he touched her first with lazy possession seeing each sensitive curve in his minds eye as his fingertips glided with his arm hooked around her back he drew her closer skin slick from the heat seemed to fuse together their lips still hungry drew more and more in a kiss that hinted of forever there was response wherever he touched response that became more frantic as his hands sought less patiently when she began to shudder he felt a fresh thrill rip through him now it demanded take her now here and now on an unsteady breath he forced the need aside and pleasured himself by shattering her sanity he found her hot and moist when she arched against his hand he felt her passion build then explode mindlessly she moaned his name and only his name it was all he wanted to hear then she was pliant again limp and soft he could have held her just so for hours gathering her closer he stood its dangerous to stay in here too long briefly he rubbed his mouth against hers well cool off impossible shelby murmured and lay back against his shoulder absolutely impossible they left the towels behind the waters cool almost as soft as your skin with a halfsigh she turned to glance at the still surface of the pool i can take it if you can she hooked her arms more securely around his neck but i dont think i even have the strength to tread water well use the buddy system alan suggested then shifting her weight slightly jumped in with her shelby gave a quick gasp at the shock of cold then surfaced drawing in air and tangling with alan its freezing no actually its kept at around seventysix degrees its just the abrupt change in temperature shelby narrowed her eyes and splashed water into his face before she broke away to skim along the bottom of the pool her muscles felt limber ready to flex and stretch when she reached the other end of the pool alan was waiting for her showoff she accused tossing wet hair out of her eyes then with her tongue caught between her teeth she let her gaze roam slowly down him from where the water dripped from his hair to where it lapped gently just below his waist it didnt matter how many times she saw him how often she touched his body would always excite her you look great senator i think i could get used to seeing you wet and naked lazily she dipped back to float if you ever decide to ditch politics i imagine you could have a successful career as a lifeguard at a nude beach its always good to have something to fall back on he watched her a moment her body white and smooth against the darker water moonlight poured through the windows and shivered on the surface the desire hed felt only moments before came back in full force in one stroke he was beside her an arm hooked around her waist shelby gripped his shoulders for balance while her head tilted back her hair streaming into the water he saw it in her eyes the excitement the mutual need then her mouth rushed to meet his and he saw nothing she knew thered be no lazy patient loving now his mouth crushed hers and she tasted the hints of savagery and desperation the hand at her hip molded her to him shelby hadnt known her passion could rise again so swiftly but it sprang up in her as ripe and hot as before desire came in waves fast each higher than the one before until she was submerged in it and struggling for air their bodies pressed together wet and urgent she dove her fingers into his hair murmuring a thousand promises a thousand demands the water slowed their movements seeming to tease them when they both would have hurried neither had the patience for the dreamlike or the languid now when hunger was so sharp and consuming she felt the water lap over her shoulders cool and sensual while alans mouth heated and became more firm more greedy on hers she could smell it on his skin taste it as her lips trailed over him that faint trace of chlorine vying with the scent and flavor she had grown so used to it alone reminded her that they were in a pool and not some sheltered lagoon a thousand miles away but when he took her in a frenzy of passion they might have been anywhere at all chapter eleven contents prev next hi shelby stifled a yawn as she rounded the last bend in the stairs and caught sight of serena hi it looks like you and i are the only ones not already involved with some disgustingly productive activity this morning had breakfast uhuh shelby dropped her hand to her stomach im starving good we usually eat breakfast in a room off the kitchen as all of us have different hours caine serena continued as they started down the hall is always up at the crack of dawn a habit i always wanted to strangle him for as a child alan and my parents are hardly better diana considers am late enough for anyone and justin runs on a clock ive yet to understand anyway ive got this for an excuse now she patted her wellrounded stomach shelby grinned i dont use any more power to you serena swept into a sunfilled breakfast room that would have been considered large and formal by anything but daniel macgregors standards rich royalblue drapes were tied back from high windows with thick tassels the carpet was aubusson in faded blues and golds i cant get over this place shelby wandered to a chippendale server to study a collection of new england pewter neither can i serena said with a laugh how do you feel about waffles shelby grinned over her shoulders i have very warm friendly feelings about waffles i knew i liked you serena said with a nod be right back she disappeared through a side door alone shelby wandered studying a muted french landscape sniffing fresh flowers in a crystal basket it would take her all weekend to see every room she decided and a lifetime to really appreciate everything in them yet she felt at home here she realized while she stared out the window overlooking the south lawn she was as comfortable with alans family as she was with her own it should all be so simple for them to love to marry to have children with a sigh she rested her forehead against the glass if it were only so simple for them shelby straightening she turned to see serena quietly studying her ive brought in some coffee she said after a brief hesitation she hadnt expected to see those candid gray eyes troubled the wafflesll be along in a minute thanks shelby took a seat at the table while serena poured alan tells me you run a casino in atlantic city yes justin and i are partners there and in several other hotels the rest she added as she lifted her cup he owns alone for now shelby grinned liking her youll convince him he needs a partner in the others as well one at a time ive learned how to handle him rather well the last year or so especially since he lost the bet and had to marry me youre going to have to clear that one up hes a gambler so am i we settled on a flip of a coin she smiled remembering heads i win tails you lose laughing shelby set down her cup your coin i take it you bet your life of course he knew but in all this time ive never let him see that quarter in an unconscious gesture she rested a hand on her stomach keeps him on his toes hes crazy about you shelby murmured you can see it in the way he looks at you when you walk into a room weve been through a lot justin and i she lapsed into silence a moment thinking back over the first stormy months after they met the love that grew despite them and the fear of making that final commitment caine and diana too she went on justin and diana had a difficult childhood that made it hard for them to give themselves to a relationship strange i think i loved justin almost from the start though i didnt realize it it was the same for caine with diana she paused with her warm candid eyes on shelbys you macgregors know your minds quickly i wondered if alan would ever love anyone until i saw him with you she reached across the table to touch shelbys hand i was so glad when i saw you werent the kind of woman id been afraid hed fall for what kind was that shelby asked with a halfsmile cool smooth a sleek blonde perhaps with soft hands and impeccably boring manners her eyes lit with humor someone i couldnt bear to have coffee with in the morning though shelby laughed she shook her head as she sipped again she sounds like someone very suited for senator alan macgregor to me suited to the title serena countered not the man and the mans my brother he tends to be too serious at times to work too hard to care too much he needs someone to help him remember to relax and to laugh i wish that were all he needed shelby said quietly seeing the trouble shadow shelbys eyes again serena felt an instant flood of sympathy with difficulty she harnessed it knowing sympathy too often led to interference shelby im not prying well maybe just a bit i really just wanted you to know how i felt i love alan very much shelby stared into her empty cup before lifting her gaze to serenas so do i serena sat back wishing she could say something wise its never just that easy is it shelby shook her head again no no its not so you decided to get up after all alan broke the silence as he came through the doorway though he noticed something pass between shelby and his sister he didnt comment its barely ten shelby stated tilting back her head for the kiss have you eaten hours ago any more coffee plenty serena told him just get a cup from the buffet have you seen justin upstairs with dad ah plotting some new brilliant financial scheme stud poker alan corrected as he poured coffee dads down about five hundred caine down about three serena tried to look disapproving and failed i dont know what to do about justin continuing to fleece my family how much did you lose alan shrugged and sipped about one seventyfive catching shelbys eye he grinned i only play with justin for diplomatic reasons as she continued to stare he leaned back against the buffet and dammit one day im going to beat him i dont believe gamblings legal in this state shelby mused glancing over as the waffles were brought in i imagine the fines rather hefty ignoring her alan eyed her plate are you going to eat all those yes shelby picked up the syrup and used it generously since mensonly clubs are archaic chauvinistic and unconstitutional i suppose i could sit in on a game alan watched the waffles disappear none of us has ever considered money has a gender he twirled one of her curls around his finger are you prepared to lose shelby smiled as she slipped the fork between her lips i dont make a habit of it i believe ill watch for a bit serena considered where are mom and diana in the gardens alan told her diana wanted a few tips for the house she and caine just bought that should give us an hour or two serena said with a nod as she rose doesnt your mother approve of cards my fathers cigars serena corrected as they left the room he hides them from her or she lets him think he does remembering annas calmly observant eyes shelby decided it was probably the latter anna like alan would miss little as they started up the tower steps daniels voice boomed down to them damn your eyes justin blade youve the luck of the devil sore losers those macgregors shelby sighed sliding her gaze to alans well see if the campbells can do any better new blood alan announced from the doorway smoke hung in the air the rich fragrant sting of expensive tobacco they were using daniels huge old desk as a table with chairs pulled up to it the three men looked over as shelby and serena walked in i dont like taking my wifes money justin commented sending her a grin as he clamped a cigar between his teeth you wont have the opportunity of trying serena lowered herself to the arm of his chair with a quiet sigh shelbyd like a game or two a campbell daniel rubbed his hands together aye then well see how the wind blows now have a chair lass three raise tendollar limit jacks or better to open if you think youre going to make up your losses on me macgregor shelby said mildly as she took her seat youre mistaken daniel made a sound of appreciation deal the cards boy he ordered caine deal the cards it took less than ten minutes for shelby to discover that justin blade was the best shed ever come across and shed sat at her share of tables elegant and not so elegant daniel played defiantly caine with a combination of impulse and skill but justin simply played and won because she knew she was up against a more clever gambler than she shelby fell back on what she considered her best asset blind luck standing idly behind her alan watched her discard two hearts choosing to draw for an inside straight with a shake of his head he walked over to the table in the corner to pour himself yet another cup of coffee he liked the way she looked nearly elbowtoelbow with his father their fiery heads bent a bit as they studied their cards it was strange how easily she had slipped into his life making a quiet splash that promised endless fascinating ripples she fit here in the odd tower room playing poker with smoke clogging the air and coffee growing cold and bitter in the cups and she would fit in an elegant washington function in a room that shone with light and glitter sipping champagne from a tulip glass she fit in his arms at night the way no woman ever had or would fit again alan needed her in his life as much as he needed food water and air a pair of aces daniel said with a fierce look in his eye justin set his cards down quietly and faceup two pair jacks and sevens he sat back as caine swore in disgust you son of in frustration daniel broke off shifting his eyes from his daughter to shelby the devil take you justin blade youre sending him off prematurely shelby commented spreading her cards a straight from the five to the nine alan walked over to look at her cards ill be damned she drew the six and seven no one but a bloody witch draws an inside straight daniel boomed glaring at her or a bloody campbell shelby said easily his eyes narrowed deal the cards justin grinned at her as shelby scooped in chips welcome aboard he said quietly and began to shuffle they played for an hour with shelby sticking to a system of illogic that kept her head above water normally she wouldnt have labeled a twentyfivedollar take impressive but considering her competition she was well pleased whether they would have played into the afternoon became academic the minute daniel heard his wifes voice drifting up the stairs immediately he stubbed out the better part of a sevendollar cigar then shoved it and an ashtray under his desk ill raise you five he said leaning on his desk again you havent opened yet shelby reminded him sweetly plucking a peppermint from the bowl on his desk she popped it into his mouth gotta cover all your tracks macgregor daniel grinned and tousled her hair a good lass campbell or not we should have known theyd be busy losing their money to justin anna stated as she stepped inside the room with diana beside her lost a trick to the new kid on the block too caine held out a hand for his wifes about time justin had some competition hooking her arms around caines neck diana rested her chin on the top of his head anna and i were thinking about a swim before lunch anyone interested fine idea daniel eased the ashtray a bit further under his desk with his foot do you swim girl yes shelby set down her cards but i didnt bring a suit theres a closetful in the bathhouse serena told her you wont have any trouble finding one to fit really she shot alan a look isnt that handy a closetful of suits he gave her an easy smile didnt i mention it a swim sounds good he added as he dropped his hands to her shoulders ive never seen shelby in a bathing suit twenty minutes later alan found himself in the relaxing heat of the sauna instead of shelby he was joined by his brother and justin leaning back letting his muscles relax he remembered the damp soft sheen on her skin and the flush of pink that had covered her when hed held her i like your taste caine commented and rested his shoulders against the side wall even though it surprised me alan opened his eyes enough to bring caine into focus did it your shelby isnt anything like the classy blonde with the uh interesting body you were dating a few months ago caine brought up one knee to settle more comfortably she wouldnt have lasted five minutes with dad shelby isnt like anyone i have to respect someone who draws to an inside straight justin added stretching out on his back on the bench above alan serena tells me she suits you its always nice to have family approval alan said dryly justin only laughed and pillowed his head on his folded arms you macgregors have a habit of interfering in this sort of thing he speaks of course from personal experience caine pushed damp hair from his forehead at the moment im rather enjoying the old mans preoccupation with alan it takes the heat off diana and me youd think hed be too involved with rena and his expected grandchild to put energy into anything else alan rested his arms on the upper bench and let the sweat roll off him hell hes not going to be satisfied until hes kneedeep in little macgregors and or blades caine grinned actually ive been giving it some thought myself thinking about it isnt going to produce another comanchescotsman justin said lazily diana and i thought wed test the waters with our niece or nephew first how does it feel to have fatherhood looming before you justin alan asked him justin stared up at the wooden ceiling remembering what it was like to feel life move under his hand inside the woman he loved thrilling he could see how serena looked naked swollen with his child beautiful he knew how he felt sometimes in the early hours of dawn when she was warm and asleep beside him terrified he murmured scares the hell out of me babies add a multitude of what ifs to your life the more i want it the closer it comes the more scared i am he managed to shrug from his prone position and the more i want to see just what that part of me and serena is going to look like strong stock caine stated good blood justin gave a quiet chuckle and closed his eyes apparently daniels decided to feel the same way about campbells are you going to marry her alan here in the fall dammit why didnt you say so caine demanded dad wouldve had an excuse to dip into that vintage champagne he hoards shelby doesnt know it yet alan said easily i thought it wiser to tell her first hmm she doesnt strike me as a woman who takes to being told very observant alan told justin but then ive tried asking sooner or later i might have to change my tactics caines brows drew together she said no alan opened his eyes again god therere times you look just like him she didnt say no or yes shelbys father was senator robert campbell robert campbell caine repeated quietly oh i see shed have an understandably difficult time with your profession her father was campaigning in the presidential primaries when he was assassinated wasnt he yes alan read the unspoken question in his brothers eyes and yes i intend to run when the times right it was the first time he realized that hed said it out loud eight years wasnt so very long to prepare for such a long hard road he let out a long quiet breath its something else shelby and i have to discuss you were born for it alan justin said simply it isnt something you can turn your back on no but i need her if it came down to making a choice youd take shelby caine finished understanding perfectly what it meant to find one love one woman but i wonder if either of you could live with it alan remained silent a moment then closed his eyes again i dont know a choice one way or the other would split him neatly in two on the wednesday following her weekend in hyannis port shelby received her first daniel macgregor phone call holding auntie ems water dish in one hand she picked up the receiver with the other shelby campbell yes her lips curved no one else boomed at you in quite that way hello daniel youve closed down shop for the day i toss clay on wednesdays she told him as she caught the receiver between her ear and shoulder and replaced the birds water dish but yes ive closed down how are you fine fine lass im going to make it a point to take a look at that shop of yours the next time im in washington good she dropped to the arm of a chair and youll buy something daniel gave a wheezy chuckle that i might if youre as clever with your hands as you are with your tongue the family plans to spend the fourth of july weekend at the comanche in atlantic city daniel stated abruptly i wanted to extend the invitation to you myself the fourth of july shelby mused fireworks hot dogs and beer it was less than a month away how had time gone so quickly she wanted to picture herself standing on the beach with alan watching colors explode in the sky and yet her future their future was something she still couldnt see i appreciate it daniel id love to come that much was true shelby told herself whether she would or not was another matter youre right for my son daniel told her shrewd enough to have caught her brief hesitation never thought id hear myself say that about a campbell but im saying it youre strong and bright and you know how to laugh youve good scottish blood in you shelby campbell ill see it in my grandchildren she did laugh because her eyes had filled too abruptly for her to stop the tears youre a pirate daniel macgregor and a schemer aye ill see you at the comanche goodbye daniel when she hung up shelby pressed her fingers to her eyes she wasnt going to fall apart over a few bluff words shed known from the first morning shed woken in alans arms that she was only postponing the inevitable right for him daniel said she was right for him but perhaps he only saw the surface he didnt know what she was holding inside her not even alan knew how deepseated the fear was how real and alive it had remained all these years if she allowed herself she could still hear those three quick explosions that had been bullets and she could see if she let herself see the surprised jerk of her fathers body the way he had fallen to the ground almost at her feet people shouting rushing crying her fathers blood on the skirt of her dress someone had pushed her aside to get to him shelby had sat on the floor alone it had been for perhaps no more than thirty seconds it had been a lifetime she hadnt needed to be told her father was dead shed seen the life spill out of him shed felt it spill out of herself never again shelby thought on a shaky breath she would never could never die so painfully again the knock on the door had to be alan shelby gave herself an extra minute to be certain the tears were under control taking a last deep breath she went to answer the door well macgregor no food she commented with an arched brow too bad i thought his might make up for it he held out a single rose whose petals were the color of her hair a traditional gift she thought trying to take it casually but nothing he gave her would ever be taken casually as her fingers closed around the stem she knew it was a token a traditional seriousminded man was offering her a very serious part of himself one rose is supposed to be more romantic than dozens she said easily enough then the tears backed up behind her eyes it was thank you she threw her arms around him pressing her mouth to his with force and a hint of desperation it was the desperation that had alan holding her gently one hand stroking her wild tangle of hair as his lips soothed hers i love you she whispered burying her face against his neck until she was certain her eyes were dry alan slipped a hand under her chin to lift it then studied her whats wrong shelby nothing she said too quickly i get sentimental when someone brings me a present the quiet intensity in his eyes didnt change the churning emotion inside her didnt ease make love to me alan she pressed her cheek against his come to bed with me now he wanted her she could make his desire springboard from easy to urgent with a look but he knew it wasnt the answer either of them needed then lets sit down its time we talked no i shelby he took her by the shoulders its time her breath came out in a jerk hed given her all the room he would give her shed known hed draw the line sooner or later with a nod she walked to the couch still clutching the rose would you like a drink no with a hand on her shoulder again he eased her down then sat beside her i love you he said simply you know that and that i want you to marry me we havent known each other for long he continued when shelby remained silent if you were a different kind of woman i might be persuaded that you needed time to be certain of your feelings for me but youre not a different kind of woman you know i love you alan she interrupted youre going to be logical and i shelby he could stop an impassioned speech with a whisper i know you have a problem with my profession i understand it maybe only in a limited way but i do understand it its something you and i have to work out from this point on he took her hands and felt the tension well deal with it shelby in whatever way we have to she still didnt speak but stared at him as if she already knew what he would say i think i should tell you now that ive been approached by a few key members of the party and that im seriously considering running for president it wont be for nearly a decade but the nuts and bolts of it have already started shed known it of course shed known it but hearing it out loud had the muscles in her stomach contracting like a fist feeling the pressure building in her lungs she let out a long slow breath if youre asking my opinion she managed in a calm voice you shouldnt consider it you should do it its something you were meant to do alan something you were meant to be the words even as she said them knew them for the truth tore at her i know with you its not simply a matter of power and ambition youd see the hardships as well the strain the impossible responsibility shelby rose knowing if she sat still a moment longer shed explode quickly she set the rose down too quickly the stem nearly snapped between her fingers there is such a thing as destiny she murmured perhaps he watched as she paced the room running her hand over the back of a pillow she snatched from the couch youre aware that its more than just putting my name on the ballot when the time comes itll mean long hard campaigning i need you with me shelby she stopped a moment her back to him to squeeze her eyes tight fighting for composure she turned around i cant marry you alan something flashed in his eyes fury or pain she couldnt be sure but his voice was calm when he spoke why her throat was so dry she wasnt certain she could answer with an effort she swallowed youre fond of logic be logical im not a political hostess im not a diplomat or an organizer thats what you need i want a wife alan returned evenly not a staff dammit alan id be useless worse than useless with a sound of frustration she began to pace again if i tried to fit the mold id go mad i havent the patience for beauty shops and secretaries and being tactful twentyfour hours a day how could i be first lady when im not even a lady half the time she tossed out and damn you youll win id find myself in the white house stifled by elegance and protocol he waited as her ragged breathing filled the room are you saying youd marry me if i chose not to run she whirled around eyes brilliant and tormented dont do that to me youd hate me id hate myself it cant be a choice between what you are and me alan but a choice between what you are and me he countered the anger hed strapped in broke free you can make a choice he sprang up from the couch to grab both of her arms fury poured out of him overwhelming her shed known it would be deadly shed seen hints of it but she had no defense you can choose to push me out of your life with a simple no expect me to accept it knowing you love me what the hell do you think im made of its not a choice she said passionately i cant do anything else id be no good for you alan you have to see that he shook her with enough violence to snap her head back dont lie to me and dont make excuses if youre going to turn your back on me do it with the truth she crumbled so quickly she would have slid to the floor if he hadnt been holding her i cant handle it tears streamed down her face huge fast painful i cant go through it all again alan waiting just waiting for someone to on a sob she covered her face with her hands oh god please i cant stand it i didnt want to love you like this i didnt want you to matter so much that everything could be taken from me again i can see it happening all over again all those people pressing close all those faces and the noise i watched someone i love die in front of my eyes once i cant again i cant alan held her close wanting to soothe needing to reassure what words could he use to penetrate this kind of fear this kind of grief there was no place for logic here no place to be calm and rationalize if it was her love that made her so deadly afraid how could he ask her to change it shelby dont i wont no she cut him off struggling out of his hold dont say it dont please alan i cant bear it you have to be what you are and so do i if we tried to change we wouldnt be the same people each of us fell in love with im not asking for you to change he said evenly as his patience began to strain again im only asking for you to have faith in me youre asking too much please please just leave me alone before he could speak she dashed into the bedroom and slammed the door chapter twelve contents prev next maine was beautiful in june green and wild shelby drove along the coast keeping her mind a blank through the open windows of the car she could hear the water hurl itself against rock passion anger grief the sound expressed all three she understood it from time to time there were wildflowers along the roadside tough little blossoms that could stand up to the salt and the wind for the most part there were rocks worn smooth from the eternal beating of water glistening near the shoreline dry and brooding above it until the tide would rise and claim them as well if she drew deep shelby could breathe again perhaps thats why she had come and come quickly before washington could suffocate her the air here was brisk and clean the summer that had taken over spring so quickly had yet to reach this far north she needed to hold on to spring for just a bit longer she saw the lighthouse on the narrow point of land that jutted arrogantly into the sea and forced her tense fingers to relax on the wheel peace of mind perhaps she would find it here as her brother always sought to do it was barely dawn when her plane had landed it had still been dark she could see the sun rising streaming color into the sea while gulls dipped and floated over rock and sand and water it was still too early for their shadows they called out above the noise of the surf an empty lonely sound shelby shook that off she wouldnt think of emptiness or loneliness now she wouldnt think at all the beach was deserted the air cool and breezy when she stepped from her car the lighthouse was a wide sphere of white solitary and strong against the elements perhaps it was worn and a bit weatherbeaten in places but it held a simple power that remained timeless and real it seemed a good place to shelter from any storm shelby took her bag from the back of the car and approached the door at the base it would be locked she knew grant never gave open invitations she pounded on the wood with the side of her fist wondering just how long hed ignore it before answering hed hear it because grant heard everything just as he saw everything isolating himself from the rest of humanity hadnt changed that shelby pounded again and watched the sun rise it took a bit more than five full minutes before the door creaked open he had the look of their father shelby thoughtdark intelligent good looks a bit rough around the edges the surprisingly deep green eyes were clouded with sleep the thick justabittoolong hair rumpled with it grant scowled at her and rubbed a hand over his unshaven chin what the hell are you doing here a typical grant campbell welcome she stood on her toes to brush his lips with hers what time is it early swearing he dragged a hand through his hair and stepped back to let her through for a moment he leaned against the door to get his bearings one thumb hooked in his only concession to modesty a pair of faded cutoffs then he followed her up the steep creaky flights of stairs to his living quarters straightening he took his sister by the shoulders and studied her quickly and with an intensity she had never quite grown used to she stood passively a halfsmile on her lips and shadows under her eyes whats wrong he asked bluntly wrong she shrugged and tossed her bag on a chair that could have done with reupholstering why does there have to be something wrong for me to pay a visit she glanced back at him noting that he still hadnt put on any weight his build teetered between lean and thin and yet like his home there was a basic strength about him she needed that too you gonna make the coffee yeah grant moved through what served as a living room despite the dust and into a tidy organized kitchen want breakfast always with what might have been a chuckle he pulled out a slab of bacon youre skinny kid youre not exactly husky these days yourself his answer was a grunt hows mom shes fine i think shes going to marry the frenchman dilleneau with the big ears and the cagey brain thats the one shelby dropped into a chair at the round oak table as bacon began to sizzle are you going to immortalize him depends he shot shelby a wicked grin i dont suppose mom would be surprised to see her fiancé in macintosh surprised no pleased she trailed off with a shrug shed really like you to come down for a visit maybe grant plopped a plate of bacon on the table are we going to have eggs too she got up for plates and mugs while grant broke a halfdozen into a pan sure scrambleds fine shelby said wryly to his back getting many tourist these days no the word was so flat and final shelby nearly laughed you could always try land mines and barbed wire it amazes me how anyone so in tune with people could dislike them so much i dont dislike them grant heaped eggs on another plate i just dont want to be around them without standing on ceremony he sat down and began to fill his plate he ate shelby pretended to howre your roommates theyve settled on peaceful coexistence shelby told him as she nibbled on a slice of bacon kyles looking in on them until i get back grant shot her a look over the rim of his mug how long are you staying this time she did laugh always gracious a few days she told him no more than a week no please she held up her hand palm up dont beg me to extend my visit i simply cant stay any longer she knew he would scowl and swear and open his home to her for as long as she needed he finished off the last of his eggs okay you can drive into town for supplies while youre here always happy to be of service shelby muttered how do you manage to get every major newspaper in the country delivered out here i pay for it he said simply they think im odd you are odd just so now he pushed his plate aside and leaned his elbows on the table why are you here shelby i just wanted to get away for a few days she began only to be cut off by a rude fourletter word instead of responding with a joke or an equally rude rejoinder she dropped her gaze to her plate i had to get away she whispered grant my lifes a mess whose isnt he responded but put one long slender finger under her chin to lift it dont do that shelby he murmured when he saw her eyes were brimming over take a deep breath and tell me about it she took the breath though it was a shaky one and struggled to control the tears im in love and i shouldnt be and he wants me to marry him and i cant well that sums things up alan macgregor when shelby sent him a swift look grant shook his head no no one told me youve been linked with him in the papers half a dozen times in the last month well hes one of that tidy little group i can honestly say i respect hes a good man shelby stated blinking back tears maybe a great one so whats the problem i dont want to love a great man she said fiercely i cant marry one grant rose retrieved the coffeepot and filled both mugs again he sat then pushed the cream at shelby why i wont go through it again grant through what her look sharpened the tears dried up damn you dont pull that on me calmly he sipped his coffee pleased that she would snipe at him now rather than weep ive been hearing a rumor or two that the senator might try for the top spot sooner or later maybe sooner than expected you hear correctly as usual he lingered over the coffee black and strong dont you fancy having one of your dresses in the smithsonian shelby your humors always been on the odd side grant thanks annoyed she pushed her plate aside i dont want to be in love with a senator are you he countered or are you in love with the man its the same thing no its not he set down the coffee and plucked a piece of untouched bacon from shelbys plate you better than most know it i cant risk it she said with sudden passion i just cant hell win grant he will if he lives long enough i cant deal with it the possibilities you and your possibilities he flung back the memory hurt but he pushed it aside okay lets take a few of them first do you love him yes yes i love him dammit i just told you i did how much does he mean to you shelby dragged both hands through her hair everything then if he runs for president and something happens to him he paused as the color drained from her face is it going to hurt any less whether you have his ring on your finger or not no she covered her mouth with her hand dont grant youve got to live with it he said harshly weve both had to live with it carry it around with us i was there too and i havent forgotten are you going to shut yourself off from life because of something that happened fifteen years ago havent you direct hit he thought ruefully but didnt acknowledge it were not talking about me lets take an other of your possibilities shelby suppose he loves you enough to chuck it for you id despise myself exactly now the last one suppose and for the first time he linked his hand with hers he runs and wins and lives to a ripe old age writing his memoirs and traveling as an ambassador of goodwill or playing parcheesi on the sun porch youre going to be damned mad he had fifty years without you she let out a long breath yeah but weve already gone through the buts he interrupted of course therere probably several million possibilities in between he could get hit by a car crossing the street or you could he could lose the election and become a missionary or an anchor on the six oclock news all right shelby dropped her forehead to their joined hands nobody makes me see what a fool i am better than you one of my minor talents listen walk out on the beach clear your head when you come back eat something then get about twelvehours sleep because you look like hell then he waited until she lifted her head to smile at him go home ive got work to do i love you you creep yeah he shot her one of his quick grins me too his house was too empty and too quiet but there was nowhere alan wanted to go hed forced himself to give shelby a full day alone then had gone half mad when hed learned on friday that she was no where to be found twentyfour hours later he was still trying to reason with himself she had a right to go when and where she chose he had no reason to expect her to answer or to explain to him if she decided to go off for a few days he had no right to be angry certainly no reason to be worried he rose from the desk in his study to pace where the hell was she how long was she going to stay away why hadnt she at least let him know frustrated he balled his hands into his pockets hed always been able to find the route out of a problem if it didnt work one way it worked another but there was always a viable system it was only a matter of time and patience he had no more patience he was hurting like hed never been aware he could hurt everywhere all at once and unrelentingly when he found her hed what alan demanded of himself force her bully her plead beg what was left he could give up pieces of himself for her and still be whole but without her hed never be more than part of a man shed stolen something from him then shut the door he thought furiously no hed given it to her freely though shed been reluctant to take the love he offered he couldnt take it back now even if she disappeared from his life she was capable of that he realized with a sudden surge of panic shelby could pack her bags and take off without leaving a trace behind damn if she would alan frowned at the phone again hed find her first hed find her then hed deal with her one way or another hed start by calling her mother then work his way through everyone she knew with a brittle laugh alan picked up the receiver with shelby it could take the better part of a week before he could dial the doorbell sounded alan let it ring three times before he remembered that mcgee was in scotland swearing he slammed down the phone and went to answer the messenger grinned at him delivery for you senator he said brightly and handed alan a clear plastic bag you guys are strange he added before he sauntered away while he stared at the bag in his hand alan closed the door swimming around a bit frantically in the trapped water was a brightorange goldfish slowly alan moved into the parlor studying his gift with wary eyes what the hell was he supposed to do with this he wondered impatient with the interruption he pulled out a waterford goblet and breaking the seal on the plastic dumped fish and water inside after setting the bag aside alan opened the little card that had been attached to it senator if you can take life in the goldfish bowl so can i after reading the one sentence three times alan shut his eyes shed come back the card dropped to the table as he turned to head for the door even as he opened it the doorbell rang hi shelby smiled though the greeting had been bright enough to reveal her nerves can i come in he wanted to grab her quickly hold her to be sure she stayed it wasnt the way to keep shelby sure when he wanted to step forward alan stepped back to let her come in on her own youve been away just a quick pilgrimage she thrust her hands into the wide pockets of a pair of baggy denim overalls he looked tired she noted as if he hadnt slept her hands itched to touch his face but she kept them both firmly tucked away come in and sit down alan gestured toward the parlor before they walked both cautious and conscious of the other mcgees away i could fix coffee no not for me shelby wandered the room how was she going to start what was she going to say all the careful speeches the glib ones the passionate ones slipped quietly out of her head hed placed the krater shed made him near the window where it caught the sun she stared at it i suppose i should begin by apologizing for falling apart on you the other day why why shelby turned around to face him again why what why would you apologize she lifted her shoulders then let them fall i hate to cry id rather swear or kick something nerves were jumping inside her something she hadnt expected and something his calm steady gaze did nothing to soothe youre angry with me no you were she moved restlessly around the room you had a right to be i shelby trailed off when she spotted the goldfish swimming in circles inside the waterford well hes come up in the world she said with a jerky laugh i dont think he appreciates it alan when she faced him this time her eyes were huge and questioning and vulnerable do you still want me have i ruined it he would have gone to her then taken her on any terms hers or his but he wanted more than the moment much more why did you change your mind shelby went toward him grabbing his hands does it matter it matters he released her hands only to frame her face with his own his eyes held that brooding serious look that could still turn her knees to jelly i have to know youll be happy have what you want what you can live with i want forever from you all right shelby lifted her hands to his wrists holding them a moment before she backed away i considered the possibilities she began i thought through all the its and the maybes i didnt like all of them but the one i hated the most was life without you youre not going to play parcheesi without me macgregor his brow lifted im not no she brushed at her bangs with another unsteady laugh marry me alan i wont agree with all your policies but ill try to be tactful in print some of the time i wont head any committees and ill only go to luncheons if theres no way out but my own careers an understandable excuse for that i wont give conventional parties but ill give interesting ones if youre willing to take the risk of setting me loose on world politics who am i to argue he hadnt thought he could love her any more than he already did hed been wrong shelby i could go back to law open a practice right here in georgetown no she whirled away from him no dammit youre not going back to law not for me not for anyone i was wrong i loved my father i adored him but i cant let what happened to him control the rest of my life or yours she stopped needed to control her voice to calmness again im not changing for you alan i cant but i can do what you asked and have faith in you she shook her head before he could speak i wont pretend that i wont ever be frightened or that there wont be parts of the way we live that ill hate but ill be proud of what you do calmer she turned back to him im proud of who you are if i still have a few dragons to fight alan ill do it he came to her looking into her eyes before he gathered her close with me she let out a long relieved sigh always when she turned her head her mouth found his as hungry and seeking as her own she felt it had been years rather than days and urged him down with a murmur of his name on the carpet with her there was no patience in either of them only needs alan swore fighting with snaps until shelby laughed and rolled atop him to drive him senseless with her lips on his naked chest he wasnt content only to be touched his hands sought her through the denim causing her strength to sag and her brain to cloud when at last there were no more obstructions he added his mouth to his hands devouring and molding the house was silent except for breathless murmurs and quiet sighs once more he buried his face in her hair to absorb the fragrance to let it absorb him as shelby drew him into her then there was nothing but pleasure the desperate whirling pleasure of being together it was late afternoon with softening light when shelby stirred against him they lay together on the couch tangled and naked and drowsy a bottle of wine grew warm on the table beside them when she opened her eyes she saw that he slept on his face relaxed his breathing even here was the contentment the easy solid contentment she felt each time she lay quiet in his arms tilting her head back shelby watched him until he too stirred and his eyes opened with a smile she leaned closer to touch her lips to his i cant remember when ive spent a more enjoyable saturday she sighed then teased his tongue with hers since i dont intend to move for at least twentyfour hours well see how you like sunday as well i think im going to love it she slid a hand over his shoulder i dont like to be pushy senator but when are you going to marry me i thought september in hyannis port the macgregor fortress he saw by her eyes the idea appealed to her but septembers two and a half months away well make it august he said as he nibbled at her ear in the meantime you and your roommates can move in here or we can start looking for another place would you like to honeymoon in scotland shelby nestled into his throat yes she tilted her head back in the meantime she said slowly as her hands wandered down to his waist ive been wanting to tell you that theres one of your domestic policies im fully in favor of senator really his mouth lowered to hover just above hers you have she nipped at his bottom lip my full support i wonder if you could just run through the procedure for me one more time alan slid a hand down her side its my civic duty to make myself available to all my constituents shelbys fingers ran up his chest to stop his jaw just before he captured her lips as long as its only me senator she hooked her arm around his neck this is the oneman onevote system one mans art chapter one contents prev next gennie knew shed found it the moment she passed the first faded clapboard building the village pragmatically and accurately called windy point at last captured her personal expectations for a coastal maine settlement shed found her other stops along the rugged shifting coastline scenic picturesque at times postcard perfect perhaps the perfection had been the problem when shed decided on this working vacation shed done so with the notion of exploring a different aspect of her talent where before shed always fancified mystified relying on her own bent toward illusions shed made a conscious decision to stick to realism no matter how stark indeed her trunk was laden with her impressions of rock and sea and earth on canvas and sketch pads but there was something more about windy point or perhaps it was something less there was no lushness here or soft edges this was hard country there were no leafy shade trees but a few stunted fir and spruce gnarled and weatherbeaten the road had more than its fair share of bumps the village itself though it wasnt precisely tumbledown had the air of old age with all its aches and pains salt and wind had weathered the buildings picking away at the paint scarring the windows the result wasnt a soft wash but a toughness gennie saw a functional beauty there were no frivolous buildings here no gingerbread each building served its purpose dry goods post office pharmacy the few houses along the main road held that implacable new england practicality in their sturdy shape and tidy size there might be flowers adding a surprisingly gay and smiling color against the stern clapboard but she noted nearly every home had a welltended vegetable patch at the rear or the side the petunias might be permitted to grow a bit unruly but the carrots were tidily weeded with her car window down she could smell the village it smelled quite simply of fish she drove straight through first wanting a complete impression of the main street she stopped by a churchyard where the granite markers were rather stern and the grass was high and wild then turned to drive back through again it wasnt a large town and the road was rather narrow but she had a sense of spaciousness you wouldnt bump into your neighbor here unless you meant to pleased gennie pulled up in front of the dry goods store guessing this would be the hub of windy points communications network the man sitting in an old wooden rocker on the stoop didnt stare though she knew hed seen her drive through and backtrack he continued to rock while he repaired a broken lobster trap he had the tanned brown face of the coast guarded eyes thinning hair and gnarled strong hands gennie promised herself shed sketch him just like that she stepped from the car grabbing her purse as an afterthought and approached him hello he nodded his hands still busy with the wooden slats of the trap need some help yes she smiled enjoying the slow thick drawl that somehow implied briskness perhaps you can tell me where i can rent a room or a cottage for a few weeks the shopkeeper continued to rock while he summed her up with shrewd faded eyes city he concluded not altogether disdainfully and south though he was a man who considered boston south he pegged her as someone who belonged in the humid regions below the masondixon line she was neat and pretty enough though he felt her dark complexion and light eyes had a substantially foreign look then again if you went much farther south than portland you were talking foreign while he rocked and deliberated gennie waited patiently her rich black hair lifting from her shoulders and blowing back in the saltscented breeze her experience in new england during the past few months had taught her that while most people were fair minded and friendly enough they generally took their time about it didnt look like a tourist he thought more like one of those fairy princesses his granddaughter read about in her picture books the delicate face came to a subtle point at the chin and the sweep of cheekbones added hauteur yet she smiled softening the look and her eyes were the color of the sea dont get many summer people he said at length all gone now anyhow he wouldnt ask gennie knew but she could be expansive when it suited her purpose i dont think i qualify as summer people mr failfield joshua fanfield genvieve grandeau she offered a hand which he found satisfactorily firm in his workroughened one im an artist id like to spend some time here painting an artist he mused not that he didnt like pictures but he wasnt sure he completely trusted the people who produced them drawing was a nice hobby but for a job still she had a good smile and she didnt slouch might be theres a cottage bout two miles out widow lawrence aint sold it yet the chair creaked as he moved back and forth could be shell rent it for a time it sounds good where can i reach her cross the road at the post office he rocked for another few seconds tell her i sent you over he decided gennie gave him a quick grin thank you mr fairfield the post office was hardly more than a counter and four walls one of the walls was taken up with slots where a woman in a dark cotton dress deftly sorted mail she even looks like a widow lawrence gennie thought with inner pleasure as she noted the neat circular braid at the back of the womans head excuse me the woman turned giving gennie a quick birdlike glance before she came over to the counter help you i hope so mrs lawrence ayah mr fairfield told me you might have a cottage to rent the small mouth pursed the only sign of facial movement ive a cottage for sale yes he explained that gennie tried her smile again she wanted the town and the two miles distance from it the cottage would give her i wonder if youd consider renting it for a few weeks i can give you references if youd like mrs lawrence studied gennie with cool eyes she made her own references for how long a month six weeks she glanced down at gennies hands there was an intricate gold twist of a ring but it was on the wrong finger are you alone yes gennie smiled again im not married mrs lawrence ive been traveling through new england for several months painting id like to spend some time here at windy point painting the widow finished with another long look yes mrs lawrence decided she liked gennies looks and that she was a young woman who didnt run on endlessly about herself and fact was fact an empty cottage was a useless thing the place is clean and the plumbings good roof was fixed two years back but the stoves got a temperament of its own theres two bedrooms but one of em stands empty this is painful for her gennie realized though the widows voice stayed even and her eyes were steady shes thinking about all the years she lived there got no close neighbors and the phones been taken out could be you could have one put in if youve a mind to it sounds perfect mrs lawrence something in gennies tone made the woman clear her throat it had been sympathy and understanding quietly offered after a moment she named a sum for the months rent far more reasonable than gennie had expected characteristically she didnt hesitate but went with her instincts ill take it the first faint flutter of surprise showed on the widows face without seeing it i dont need to see it with a brisk practicality mrs lawrence admired gennie pulled a checkbook out of her purse and dashed off the amount maybe you can tell me what ill need in the way of linen and dishes mrs lawrence took the check and studied it genevieve she murmured genvieve gennie corrected flowing easily over the french after my grandmother she smiled again softening that rather ruthless fairy look everyone calls me gennie an hour later gennie had the keys to the cottage in her purse two boxes of provisions in the back seat of her car and directions to the cottage in her hand shed passed off the distant wary stares of the villagers and had managed not to chuckle at the open ogling of a scrawny teenager whod come into the dry goods store while she was mulling over a set of earthenware dishes it was dusk by the time she was ready to set out the clouds were low and unfriendly now and the wind had picked up it only added to the sense of adventure gennie set out on the narrow bumpy road that led to the sea with a restless inner excitement that meant something new was on the horizon she came by her love of adventure naturally her greatgreatgrandfather had been a pirate an unapologetic rogue of the sea his ship had been fast and fierce and he had taken what he wanted without qualm one of gennies treasures was his logbook philippe grandeau had recorded his misdeeds with flair and a sense of irony shed never been able to resist she might have inherited a strong streak of practicality from the displaced aristocrats on her mothers side but gennie was honest enough to know shed have sailed with the pirate philippe and loved every minute of it as her car bounced along the ruts she took in the scenery so far removed from her native new orleans it might have been another planet this was no place for long lazy days and riotous nights in this rocky windswept world youd have to be on your toes every minute mistakes wouldnt be easily forgiven here but she saw more than hard land and rock integrity she sensed it in the land that vied continually with the sea it knew it would lose inch by minute inch century after endless century but it wasnt giving in though the shadows lengthened with evening she stopped compelled to put some of her impressions on paper there was an inlet some yards from the road restless now as the storm approached as gennie pulled out a sketchbook and pencil she caught the smell of decaying fish and seaweed it didnt make her wrinkle her nose she understood that it was part of the strange lure that called men forever to the sea the soil was thin here the rocks worn smooth near the road were clumps of wild blueberry bushes pregnant with the last of the summer fruit she could hear the wind a distinctly feminine sound sighing and moaning she couldnt see the sea yet but she could smell it and taste it in the air that swirled around her she had no one to answer to no timetable to keep gennie had long since taken her freedom for granted but solitude was something else she felt it here near the little windswept inlet along the narrow impossible road and she held it to her when she was back in new orleans a city she loved and she soaked up one of those steamy days that smelled of the river and humanity she would remember passing an hour in a cool lonely spot where she might have been the only living soul for miles relaxed but with that throb of excitement just buzzing along her skin she sketched going into much more detail than she had intended when shed stopped the lack of human noises appealed to her yes she was going to enjoy windy point and the little cottage very much finished she tossed her sketchbook back in the car it was nearly dark now or she might have stayed longer wandered closer to the waters edge long days of painting stretched ahead of her and who knew what else a month could bring with a half smile she turned the key in the ignition when she got only a badtempered rattle she tried again she was rewarded with a wheeze and a groan and a distinctly suspicious clunk the car had given her a bit of trouble in bath but the mechanic there had tightened this and fiddled with that it had been running like a top ever since thinking of the jolting road gennie decided that what could be tightened could just as easily be loosened again with a mildly annoyed oath she got out of the car to pop the hood even if she had the proper tools which she didnt think included the screwdriver and flashlight in her glove compartment she would hardly know what to do with them closing the hood again she glanced up and down the road deserted the only sound was the wind it was nearly dark and by her calculations she was at the halfway point between town and the cottage if she hiked back someone was bound to give her a lift but if she went on she could probably be in the cottage in fifteen minutes with a shrug she dug her flashlight out of the glove compartment and did what she usually did she went forward she needed the light almost immediately the road was no better to walk on than to drive on but shed have to take care to keep to it unless she wanted to end up lost or taking a dunking in an inlet ruts ran deeply here rocks worked their way up there so that she wondered how often anyone actually traveled this stretch darkness fell swiftly but not in silence the wind whipped at her hair keeping up its low keening sound there were wisps of fog at her feet now which she hoped would stay thin until she was indoors then she forgot the fog as the storm burst out full of fury under other circumstances gennie wouldnt have minded a soaking but even her sense of adventure was strained in the howling darkness where her flashlight cut a pitiful beam through the slashing rain annoyance was her first reaction as she continued to trudge along the uneven road in thoroughly wet sneakers gradually annoyance became discomfort and discomfort unease a flash of lightning would illuminate a cropping of rocks or stunted bush throwing hard unfriendly shadows even a woman possessing a pedestrian imagination might have had a qualm gennie had visions of nasty little elves grinning out of the cloaking darkness humming tunelessly to stave off panic she concentrated on the beam of her flashlight so im wet gennie told herself as she dragged dripping hair out of her eyes its not going to kill me she gave another uneasy glance at the side of the road there was no dark gennie decided like the dark of the countryside and where was the cottage surely shed walked more than a mile by now half heartedly she swung the light in a circle thunder boiled over her head while the rain slapped at her face it would take a minor miracle to find a dark deserted cottage with only the beam of a household flashlight stupid she called herself while she wrapped her arms tightly around her chest and tried to think it was always stupid to set out toward the unknown when you had a choice and yet she would always do so there seemed to be nothing left but find her way back to the car and wait out the storm there the prospect of a long wet night in a compact wasnt pleasant but it had it all over wandering around lost in a thunderstorm and there was a bag of cookies in the car she remembered while she continued to stroke the flashlight back and forth just in case there was something out there with a sigh she gave one last look down the road she saw it gennie blinked rain out of her eyes and looked again a light surely that was a light up ahead a light meant shelter warmth company without hesitation gennie headed toward it it turned out to be another mile at best while the storm and the road worsened lightning slashed the sky with a wicked purple light tossing out a brief eerie glow that made the darkness only deeper when it faded to keep from stumbling she was forced to move slowly and keep her eyes on the ground she began to be certain shed never be dry or warm again the light up ahead stayed steady and true helping her to resist glancing over her shoulder too often she could hear the sea now beating violently on rocks and shale once in a flash of lightning she thought she saw the crest of angry waves whitecapped and turbulent in the distance even the rain smelled of the sea now an angry vengeful one she wouldnt couldnt allow herself to be frightened though her heart was beating fast from more than the twomile walk if she admitted she was frightened she would give in to the urge to run and would end up over a cliff in a ditch or in some soundless vacuum the sense of displacement was so great she might have simply sat on the road and wept had it not been for the steady beam of light sending out the promise of security when gennie saw the silhouette of the building behind the curtain of rain she nearly laughed aloud a lighthouse one of those sturdy structures that proved man had some sense of altruism the guiding light hadnt come from the high revolving lens but from a window gennie didnt question but quickened her pace as much as she dared someone was there a gnarled old man perhaps a former seaman hed have a bottle of rum and talk in brief salty sentences as a new bolt of lightning slashed across the sky gennie decided she already adored him the structure seemed huge to her a symbol of safety for anyone lost and stormtossed it looked stunningly white under the play of her flashlight as she searched the base for a door the window that was lit was high up the top of three on the side gennie approached she found a door of thick rough wood and beat on it the violence of the storm swallowed the sound and tossed it away nearer to panic than she wanted to admit gennie pounded again could she have come so far got so close and then not be heard the old keeper was in there she thought as she beat on the door probably whistling and whittling perhaps idling away the evening putting a ship into a bottle desperate gennie leaned against the door feeling the hard wet wood against her cheek as well as the side of her fist as she continued to thud against it when the door opened she went with it overbalancing her arms were gripped hard as she pitched forward thank god she managed i was afraid you wouldnt hear me with one hand she dragged her sopping hair out of her face and looked up at the man she considered her savior the one thing he wasnt was old nor was he gnarled rather he was young and lean but the narrow tanned face of planes and angles might have been a seafaring one in her greatgreatgrandfathers line his hair was as dark as hers and as thick with that careless windblown effect a man might get if he stood on the point of a ship his mouth was full and unashamedly sensual the nose a bit aristocratic in the rugged face his eyes were a deep deep brown under dark brows they werent friendly gennie decided not even curious they were simply annoyed how the hell did you get here it wasnt the welcome she had expected but her trek through the storm had left her a bit muddled i walked she told him walked he repeated in this from where a couple of miles back my car stalled she began to shiver either with chill or with reaction hed yet to release her and shed yet to recover enough to demand it what were you doing driving around on a night like this i im renting mrs lawrences cottage my car stalled then i must have missed the turnoff in the dark i saw your light she heaved a long breath and realized abruptly that her legs were shaking can i sit down he stared at her for another minute then with something like a grunt nudged her toward a sofa gennie sank down on it dropped her head back and concentrated on pulling herself together and what the hell was he supposed to do with her grant asked himself brows lowered he stared down at her at the moment she looked like shed keel over if he breathed too hard her hair was plastered to her head curling just a bit and dark as the night itself her face wasnt fine or delicate but beautiful in the way of medieval royalty long bones sharp features a celtic or gallic princess with a compact athletic little body he could see clearly as her clothes clung to it he thought the face and body might be appealing enough under certain circumstances but what had thrown him for an instant when shed looked up at him had been her eyes sea green huge and faintly slanted mermaids eyes hed thought for a heartbeat or perhaps only half of that grant had wondered if shed been some mythical creature whod been tossed ashore in the storm her voice was soft and flowing and though he recognized it as deep south it seemed almost a foreign tongue after the coastal maine cadence hed grown used to he wasnt a man to be pleased with having a magnolia blossom tossed on his doorstep when she opened her eyes and smiled at him grant wished fervently hed never opened the door im sorry gennie began i was barely coherent wasnt i i suppose i wasnt out there for more than an hour but it seemed like days im gennie grant hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans and frowned at her again campbell grant campbell since he left it at that and continued to frown gennie did her best to pick things up again mr campbell i cant tell you how relieved i was when i saw your light he stared down at her another moment thinking briefly that she looked familiar the turnoff for the lawrence places a good mile back gennie lifted a brow at the tone did he actually expect her to go back outside and stumble around until she found it she prided herself on being fairly eventempered for an artist but she was wet and cold and grants unfriendly scowling face tripped the last latch look ill pay you for a cup of coffee and the use of this she thumped a hand on the sofa and a soft plume of dust rose up thing for the night i dont take in lodgers and youd probably kick a sick dog if he got in your way she added evenly but im not going back out there tonight mr campbell and i wouldnt advise trying to toss me out either that amused him though the humor didnt show in his face nor did he correct her assumption that he had meant to shove her back into the storm the statement had been simply meant to convey his displeasure and the fact that he wouldnt take her money if he hadnt been annoyed he might have appreciated the fact that soaking wet and slightly pale she held her own without a word he walked over to the far side of the room and crouched to rummage through a scarred oak cabinet gennie stared straight ahead even as she heard the sound of liquid hitting glass you need brandy more than coffee at the moment grant told her and shoved the glass under her nose thank you gennie said in an icy tone southern women are the champions of she didnt sip but drank it down in one swallow letting the warmth shock her system back to normal distantly polite she handed the empty glass back to him grant glanced down at it and very nearly smiled want another no she said frigid and haughty thank you i have he mused wryly been put in my place princess to peasant considering his option grant rocked back on his heels through the thick walls of the lighthouse the storm could be heard whipping and wailing even the mile ride to the lawrence place would be wild and miserable if not dangerous it would be less trouble to bed her down where she was than to drive her to the cottage with an oath that was more weary than pungent he turned away well come on he ordered without looking back you cant sit there shivering all night gennie considered seriously considered heaving her purse at him the staircase charmed her she nearly made a comment on it before she stopped herself it was iron and circular rising up and up the interior grant stepped off onto the second level which gennie calculated was a good twenty feet above the first he moved like a cat in the dark while she held on to the rail and waited for him to hit the light switch it cast a dim glow and many shadows over the bare wood floor he passed through a door on the right into what she discovered were his sleeping quarters small not particularly neat but with a curvy antique brass bed gennie fell instantly in love with grant went to an old chifforobe that might have been beautiful with refinishing muttering to himself he routed around and unearthed a faded terrycloth robe showers across the hall he said briefly and dumped the robe in gennies arms before he left her alone thank you very much she mumbled while his footsteps retreated back down the stairs chin high eyes gleaming she stalked across the hall and found herself charmed all over again the bath was white porcelain and footed with brass fixtures he obviously took the time to polish the room was barely more than a closet but somewhere in its history it had been paneled in cedar and lacquered there was a pedestal sink and a narrow little mirror the light was above her operated by a pull string stripping gratefully out of her cold wet clothes gennie stepped into the tub and drew the thin circular curtain in an instant she had hot water spraying out of the tiny shower head and warming her body gennie was certain paradise could have felt no sweeter even when it was guarded by the devil in the kitchen grant made a fresh pot of coffee then as an afterthought he opened a can of soup he supposed hed have to feed her here at the back of the tower the sound of the sea was louder it was a sound he was used to not so he no longer heard it but so he expected to if it was vicious and threatening as it was tonight grant acknowledged it then went about his business or he would have gone about his business if he hadnt found a drenched woman outside his door now he calculated hed have to put in an extra hour that night to make up for the time she was costing him with his first annoyance over grant admitted it couldnt be helped hed give her the basic hospitality of a hot meal and a roof over her head and that would be that a smile lightened his features briefly when he remembered how she had looked at him when shed sat dripping on his sofa the lady he decided was no pushover grant had little patience with pushovers when he chose company he chose the company of people who said what they thought and were willing to stand by it in a way that was why grant was off his selfimposed schedule it had barely been a week since his return from hyannis port where hed given away his sister shelby in her marriage to alan macgregor hed discovered uncomfortably that the wedding had made him sentimental it hadnt been difficult for the macgregors to persuade him to stay on for an extra couple of days hed liked them blustery old daniel in particular and grant wasnt a man who took to people quickly since childhood hed been cautious but the macgregors as a group were irresistible and hed been weakened somewhat by the wedding itself giving his sister away something that would have been his fathers place had he lived had brought such a mix of pain and pleasure that grant had been grateful to have the distraction of a few days among the macgregors before he returned to windy point even to the extent of being amused by daniels not so subtle probing into his personal life hed enjoyed himself enough to accept an openended invitation to return an invitation even he was surprised that he intended to act on for now there was work to be done but he resigned himself that a short interruption wouldnt damage his status quo beyond repair as long as it remained short she could bunk down in the spare room for the night then hed have her out and away in the morning he was nearly in an amiable mood by the time the soup started to simmer grant heard her come in though the noise from outside was still fierce he turned prepared to make a moderately friendly comment when the sight of her in his robe went straight to his gut damn she was beautiful too beautiful for his peace of mind the robe dwarfed her though shed rolled the frayed sleeves nearly to the elbow the faded blue accented the honeyrich tone of her skin shed brushed her damp hair back leaving her face unframed but for a few wayward curls that sprung out near her temples with her eyes pale green and the dark lashes wet she looked to him more than ever like the mermaid hed nearly taken her for sit down he ordered furiously annoyed by the flare of unwelcome desire you can have some soup gennie paused a moment her eyes skimming up and down his back before she sat at the rough wooden table why thank you his response was an unintelligible mutter before he thumped a bowl in front of her she picked up the spoon not about to let pride get in the way of hunger though surprised she said nothing when he sat opposite her with a bowl of his own the kitchen was small and brightly lit and very very quiet the only sound came from the wind and restless water outside the thick walls at first gennie ate with her eyes stubbornly on the bowl in front of her but as the sharp hunger passed she began to glance around the room tiny certainly but with no wasted space rough oak cabinets ringed the walls giving generous room for supplies the counters were wood as well but sanded and polished she saw the modern conveniences of a percolator and a toaster he took better care of this room she decided than he did the rest of the house no dishes in the sink no crumbs or spills and the only scents were the kitcheny aromas of soup and coffee the appliances were old and a bit scarred but they werent grimy as her first hunger ebbed so did her anger she had after all invaded his privacy not everyone offered hospitality to a stranger with smiles and open arms he had scowled but he hadnt shut the door in her face and he had given her something dry to wear and food she added as she did her best to submerge pride with a slight frown she skimmed her gaze over the tabletop until it rested on his hands good god she thought with a jolt they were beautiful the wrists were narrow giving a sense not of weakness but of graceful strength and capability the backs of his hands were deeply tanned and unmarred long and lean as were his fingers the nails were short and straight masculine was her first thought then delicate came quickly on the tail of it gennie could picture the hands holding a flute just as easily as she could see them wielding a saber for a moment she forgot the rest of him in her fascination with his hands and her reaction to them she felt the stir but didnt suppress it she was certain any woman who saw those romantic exquisite hands would automatically wonder just what they would feel like on her skin impatient hands clever they were the kind that could either rip the clothes off a woman or gently undress her before she had any idea what was happening when a thrill gennie recognized as anticipation sprinted up her spine she caught herself what was she thinking of even her imagination had no business sneaking off in that direction a little dazed by the feeling that wouldnt be dismissed she lifted her gaze to his face he was watching her coolly like a scientist watching a specimen when shed stopped eating so suddenly hed seen her eyes go to his hands and remain there with her lashes lowered just enough to conceal their expression grant had waited knowing sooner or later shed look up hed been expecting that icy anger or frosty politeness the numb shock on her face puzzled him or more accurately intrigued him but it was the vulnerability that made him want her almost painfully even when she had stumbled into the house wet and lost she hadnt looked defenseless he wondered what she would do if he simply got up hauled her to her feet and dragged her up into his bed he wondered what in the hell was getting into him they stared at each other each battered by feelings neither of them wanted while the rain and the wind beat against the walls separating them from everything civilized he thought again that she looked like some temptress from the sea gennie thought hed have given her rogue of an ancestor a run for his money grants chair legs scraped against the floor as he pushed back from the table gennie froze theres a room on the second level with a bunk his eyes were hard and dark with suppressed anger his stomach knotted with suppressed desire gennie found that her palms were damp with nerves and was infuriated better to be infuriated with him the couch down here is fine she said coldly he shrugged suit yourself without another word he walked out gennie waited until she heard his footsteps on the stairs before she pressed a hand to her stomach the next time she saw a light in the dark she told herself shed run like hell in the opposite direction chapter two contents prev next grant hated to be interrupted hed tolerate being cursed threatened or despised but he never tolerated interruptions it had never mattered to him particularly if he was liked as long as he was left alone to do as he chose hed grown up watching his father pursue the goodwill of others a necessary aspect in the career of a senator who had chosen to run for the highest office in the country even as a child grant knew his father was a man who demanded extreme feelings he was loved by some feared or hated by others and on a campaign trail he could inspire a fierce loyalty he had been a man who would go out of his way to do a favor friend or stranger it had never mattered his ideals had been high his memory keen and his flair for words admirable senator robert campbell had been a man who had felt it his duty to make himself accessible to the public right up to the moment someone had put three bullets into him grant hadnt only blamed the man who had held the gun or the profession of politics as his sister had done in his own way grant had blamed his father robert campbell had given himself to the world and it had killed him perhaps it was as a direct result that grant gave himself to no one he didnt consider the lighthouse a refuge it was simply his place he appreciated the distance it gave him from others and enjoyed the harshness and the harmony of the elements if it gave him solitude it was as necessary to his work as it was to himself he required the hours even the days of aloneness uninterrupted thought was something grant considered his right no one absolutely no one was permitted to tamper with it the night before hed been midway through his current project when gennies banging had forced him to stop grant was perfectly capable of ignoring a knock on the door but since it had broken his train of thought he had gone down to answer with the idea of strangling the intruder gennie might consider herself lucky hed only resorted to rudeness a hapless tourist had once found himself faced with an irate grant who had threatened to toss him into the ocean since it had taken grant the better part of an hour after hed left gennie in the kitchen to get his mind back on his work hed been up most of the night interruptions intrusions intolerable hed thought so then and now as the sun slanted in the window and onto the foot of his bed he thought so again groggy after what amounted to almost four hours sleep grant listened to the voice that drifted up the stairwell she was singing some catchy little tune youd hear every time you turned on the radio something grant did every day of his life just as religiously as he turned on the tv and read a dozen newspapers she sang well in a lowpitched drumming voice that turned the cute phrasing into something seductive bad enough shed interrupted his work the night before now she was interrupting his sleep with a pillow over his head he could block it out but he discovered he couldnt block out his reaction to it it was much too easy in the dark with the sheet warm under his chest to imagine her swearing grant tossed the pillow aside and got out of bed to pull on a pair of cutoffs half asleep half aroused he went downstairs the afghan shed used the night before was already neatly folded on the sofa grant scowled at it before he followed gennies voice into the kitchen she was still in his robe barefoot with her hair waving luxuriously down her back hed like to have touched it to see if those hints of red that seemed to shimmer through the black were really there or just a trick of the light bacon sizzled in a pan on the stove and the coffee smelled like heaven what the hell are you doing gennie whirled around clutching a kitchen fork one hand lifting to her heart in reflex reaction despite the discomfort of the sofa shed woken in the best of moods and starving the sun was shining gulls were calling and the refrigerator had been liberally stocked gennie had decided grant campbell deserved another chance as shed puttered in his kitchen shed made a vow to be friendly at all costs he stood before her now half naked and obviously angry his hair sleeptumbled and a nights growth of beard shadowing his chin gennie gave him a determined smile im making breakfast i thought it was the least i could do in return for a nights shelter again he had the sensation of something familiar about her he couldnt quite catch his frown only deepened i dont like anyone messing with my things gennie opened her mouth then shut it again before anything nasty could slip out the only thing ive broken is an egg she said mildly as she indicated the bowl of eggs she intended to scramble why dont you do us both a favor get a cup of coffee sit down and shut up with an almost imperceptible toss of her head she turned her back on him grants brows rose not so much in surprise as in appreciation not everyone could tell you to shut up in a buttermelting voice and make it work he had the feeling he wasnt the first person shed given the order to with something perilously close to a grin he got a mug and did exactly what she said she didnt sing anymore as she finished making the meal but he had the feeling she wouldve muttered badtemperedly if she hadnt wanted him to think she was unaffected by him in fact he was certain there was a good bit of muttering and cursing going on inside her head as he sipped coffee the grogginess gave way to alertness and hunger for the first time he sat in the tiny kitchen while a woman fixed his breakfast not something hed want to make a habit of grant mused while he watched her but then again it wasnt an unpleasant experience still clinging to silence gennie set plates on the table then followed them with a platter of bacon and eggs why were you going to the old lawrence place he asked as he served himself gennie sent him a narrowedeyed glare so now were going to make polite conversation she thought and nearly ground her teeth im renting it she said briefly and dashed salt on her eggs thought the widow lawrence had it up for sale she does youre a little late in the season for renting a beach cottage grant commented over a mouthful of eggs gennie gave a quick shrug as she concentrated on her breakfast im not a tourist no he gave her a long steady look she found both deft and intrusive louisiana isnt it new orleans baton rouge new orleans gennie forgot annoyance long enough to study him in turn youre not local either no he said simply and left it at that oh no she thought he wasnt going to start a conversation then switch it off when it suited him why a lighthouse she persisted its not operational is it it was the light from the window i followed last night not the beacon coast guard takes care of this stretch with radar this station hasnt been used in ten years did you ran out of gas he asked before she realized hed never answered the why no id pulled off the side of the road for a few minutes then when i tried to start the car again it just made a few unproductive noises she shrugged and bit into a slice of bacon i guess ill have to get a tow truck in town grant made a sound that might have been a laugh you might get a tow track up at bayside but youre not going to find one at windy point ill take a look at it he told her as he finished off his breakfast if its beyond me you can get buck gates from town to come out and get it started she studied him for nearly thirty seconds thank you gennie said warily grant rose and put his plate in the sink go get dressed he ordered ive got work to do for the second time he left gennie alone in the kitchen just once she thought as she stacked her plate on top of his shed like to get in the last word giving the belt of grants robe a quick tug she started out of the room yes shed go get dressed gennie told herself and shed do it quickly before he changed his mind rude or not shed accept his offer of help then as far as she was concerned grant campbell could go to the devil there wasnt any sign of him on the second floor when she slipped into the bathroom to change gennie stripped out of the robe and hung it on a hook on the back of the door her clothes were dry and she thought she could ignore the fact that her tennis shoes were still a bit cold and damp with luck she could be settled into the cottage within the hour that should leave her the best of the afternoon for sketching the idea kept gennies spirits high as she made her way back downstairs again there was no sign of grant after a brief fight with the heavy front door gennie went outside it was so clear she nearly caught her breath whatever fog or fury had visited that place the night before had been swept clean the places on the earth where the air really sparkled were rare she knew and this was one of them the sky was blue and cloudless shot through with the yellow light of the sun there was some grass on this side of the lighthouse tough and as wild as the few hardy flowers that were scattered through it goldenrod swayed in the breeze announcing the end of summer but the sun shone hotly she could see the narrow rat of a road shed traveled on the night before but was surprised by the threestory farmhouse only a few hundred yards away that it was deserted was obvious by the film of dirt on the windows and the waisthigh grass but it wasnt dilapidated it would have belonged to the keeper and his family gennie concluded when the lighthouse was still functional they would have had a garden and perhaps a few chickens and there would have been nights when the wind howled and the waves crashed that the keeper would have stayed at his station while his family sat alone and listened the white paint was faded but the shutters hung true she thought it sat on its hill waiting to be filled again there was a sturdy little pickup near the base of the slope which she assumed was grants because he was nowhere in sight gennie wandered around the side of the lighthouse answering the call of the sea this time gennie did catch her breath she could see for miles down the irregular coastline over to tiny islands and out to the distant horizon there were boats on the water staunch competent little boats of the lobstermen she knew she would see no chrome and mahogany crafts here nor should she this was a place of purpose not idle pleasure strength durability thats what she felt as she looked out into bluegreen water that frothed white as it flung itself at the rocks seaweed floated in the surf gathering and spreading with the movement of the water the sea had its way with everything here the rocks were worn smooth by it and the ledges rose showing colors from gray to green with a few muted streaks of orange shells littered the shoreline flung out by the sea and yet to be trampled under a careless foot the smell of salt and fish was strong she could hear the toll of the bell buoys the hollow hoot of the whistling markers the distant putter of the lobster boats and the mournful cry of gulls there was nothing no sound no sight no smell that came from anything other than that endless timeless sea gennie felt it the pull the tug that had called men and women to it from the dawn of time if humanity had truly sprung from there perhaps that was why they were so easily lured back to it she stood on the ledge above the narrow rocky beach and lost herself in it danger challenge peace she felt them all and was content she didnt hear grant come behind her gennie was too caught up in the sea itself to sense him though he watched her as a minute stretched to two and two into three she looked right there he thought and could have cursed her for it the land was his this small secluded edge of land that hovered over the sea he wouldnt claim to own the sea not even when it rose high at noon to lick at the verge of his land but this slice of rock and wild grass belonged to him exclusively she had no right to look as though she belonged to make him wonder if the cliff would ever be only his again the wind plastered her clothes against her as the rain had done the night before accenting her slim athletic body with its womans roundness her hair danced frantically and free while the sun teased out those touches of fire in the ebony that seemed to hint of things he was nearly ready to test before he realized what he was doing grant took her arm and swung her to face him there was no surprise in her face as she looked at him but excitement and an arousal he knew came from the sea her eyes mirrored it and tempted i wondered last night why anyone would choose to live here she tossed the hair from her eyes now i wonder how anyone lives anywhere else she pointed to a small fishing boat at the end of the pier is that yours grant continued to stare at her realizing abruptly hed nearly hauled her against him and kissed her so nearly he could all but taste her mouth against his with an effort he turned his head in the direction she pointed yes its mine im keeping you from your work for the first time gennie gave him the simple gift of a real smile i suppose youd have been up at dawn if i hadnt gotten in the way with an unintelligible mutter as an answer grant began to propel her toward his pickup sighing gennie gave up her morning vow to be friendly as a bad bet mr campbell do you have to be so unpleasant grant stopped long enough to shoot her a look one gennie would have sworn was laced with amused irony yes you do it very well she managed as he began to pull her along again ive had years of practice he released her when they reached the truck then opened his door and got in without comment gennie skirted the hood and climbed in the passenger side the engine roared into life a sound so closely associated with towns and traffic gennie thought it a sacrilege she looked back once as he started down the bumpy road and knew instantly she would paint had to paint that scene she nearly stated her intention out loud then caught a glimpse of grants frowning profile the hell with him gennie decided shed paint while he was out catching lobsters or whatever he caught out there what he didnt know wouldnt hurt her in this case she sat back in the seat primly folded her hands and kept quiet grant drove a mile before he started to feel guilty the road was hardly better than a ditch and at night it would have been a dark series of ruts and rocks anyone walking over that stretch in a storm had to have been exhausted miserable anyone who hadnt known the way would have been half terrified as well he hadnt exactly dripped sympathy and concern still frowning he took another quick look at her as the truck bounced along she didnt look fragile but he never would have believed shed walked so far in that weather along a dark rutted road he started to form what gennie would have been astonished to hear was an apology when she lifted her chin theres my car her voice was distantly polite again master to servant this time grant swallowed the apology he swung toward her car jostling gennie in her seat a bit more than was absolutely necessary neither of them commented as he switched off the engine and climbed out grant popped the hood of her car while gennie stood with her hands in the back pockets of her jeans he talked to himself she noticed softly just under his breath as he fiddled with whatever people fiddled with under hoods of cars she supposed it was a natural enough thing for someone who lived alone at the edge of a cliff then again she thought with a grin there were times in the thickly populated vieux carre when she found herself the very best person to converse with grant walked back to his truck pulling a toolbox out of the back of the cab he rummaged around chose a couple of differentsized wrenches and returned to dive under her hood again pursing her lips gennie moved behind him to peer over his shoulder he seemed to know what he was about she decided and a couple of wrenches didnt seem so complicated if she could just she leaned in closer automatically resting her hand on his back to keep her balance grant didnt straighten but turned his arm brushing firmly across her breast with the movement it could easily happen to strangers in a crowded elevator and hardly be noticed both of them felt the power of contact and the surge of need gennie would have backed up if she hadnt so suddenly found herself staring into those dark restless eyes feeling that warm quick breath against her lips another inch she thought just another inch and it would be his mouth on hers instead of just the hint of it her hand had slipped to his shoulder and without her realizing it her fingers had tightened there grant felt the pressure but it was nothing compared to what had sprung up at the back of his neck the base of his spine the pit of his stomach to take what was within his reach might relieve the pressure or it might combust it at the moment grant wasnt certain what result hed prefer what are you doing he demanded but this time his voice wasnt edged with anger dazed gennie continued to stare into his eyes she could see herself in there she thought numbly when did she get lost in there what they were still leaning into the car gennie with her hand on his shoulder grant with one hand on a bolt the other on a wrench he had only to shift his weight to bring them together he nearly did before he remembered how uncomfortably right she had looked standing on his land gazing out to sea touch this one campbell and youre in trouble the kind of trouble a man doesnt walk away from whistling a tune i asked what you were doing he said in the same quiet tone but his gaze slid down to her mouth doing what had she been doing iahi wanted to see how you fixed it so his gaze swept up and locked on hers again scattered every coherent thought so grant repeated enjoying the fact that he could confuse her so his breath whispered over her lips she caught herself running her tongue along them to taste it so if it happens again i could fix it grant smiled slowly deliberately insolently gennie wasnt sure but her heart rose to her throat and stuck there however he smiled whatever his intent it added a wicked irresistible charm to his face she thought it was a smile a barbarian might have given his woman before he tossed her over his shoulder and took her into some dark cave just as slowly he turned away to begin working with the wrench again gennie backed up and let out a long quiet breath that had been close too close to what she wasnt precisely sure but to something no smart woman would consider safe she cleared her throat do you think you can fix it hmmm gennie took this for the affirmative then stepped closer this time keeping to the side of the hood a mechanic looked at it a couple weeks ago think youre going to need new plugs soon id have buck gates take a look if i were you is he a mechanic at the service station grant straightened he wasnt smiling now but there was amusement in his eyes theres no service station in windy point you need gas you go down to the docks and pump it you got car trouble you see buck gates he repairs the lobster boats a motors a motor the last was delivered in an easy down east cadence with a hint of a smile that had nothing to do with condescension start her up leaving her door open gennie slid behind the wheel a turn of the key had her engine springing cheerfully to life even as she let out a relieved sigh grant slammed the hood into place gennie cut the engine again as he walked back to his truck to replace his tools the lawrence cottages about three quarters of a mile up on the left you cant miss the turnoff unless youre hiking through a storm in the middle of the night with only a flashlight gennie swallowed a chuckle dont let him have any redeeming qualities she pleaded let me remember him as a rude nasty man who just happens to be fatally sexy ill keep that in mind and i wouldnt mention that youd spent the night at windy point station he added easily as he slipped the toolbox back into place i have a reputation to protect this time she bit her lip to hold back a smile oh yeah grant turned back leaning against the truck a moment as he looked at her again the villagers think im odd id slip a couple notches if they found out i hadnt just shoved you back outside and locked the door this time she did smile but only a little you have my word no one will hear from me what a good samaritan you are if anyone should happen to ask ill tell them youre rude disagreeable and generally nasty id appreciate it when he started to climb back into the truck gennie reached for her wallet wait i havent paid you for forget it she hooked her hand on the door handle i dont want to be obligated to you for tough grant started the engine look move your car i cant turn around with you in my way eyes narrowed she whirled away so much for gratitude she told herself so the villagers thought he was odd she mused as she slammed the car door perceptive people gennie started down the road at a cautious speed making it a point not to look into the rearview mirror when she came to the turnoff she veered left the only sign of grant campbell was the steady hum of his truck as he went on gennie told herself she wouldnt think of him again and she didnt as she drove down the straight little lane with blackeyed susans springing up on either side the sound of his truck was a distant echo soon lost without any trees to block the view gennie saw the cottage almost immediately and was charmed small certainly but it didnt evoke images of seven dwarfs heighhoing gennie immediately had a picture of a tidy woman in a housedress hanging out the wash then a roughfeatured fisherman whittling on the tiny porch it had been painted blue but had weathered to a soft bluegray a onestory boxlike structure it had a modest front porch facing the lane and she was to discover another screened porch looking out over the inlet a pier that looked like it might be a bit shaky stretched out over the glassily calm water someone had planted a willow near the shore but it wasnt flourishing gennie turned off the engine and was struck with silence pleasant peaceful yes she could live with this work with this yet she discovered she preferred the thrash and boom of the sea that grant had outside his front door oh no she reminded herself firmly she vowed not to think of him and she wouldnt after stepping from the car gennie hefted the first box of groceries and climbed the plank stairs to the front door she had to fight with the lock a moment then it gave a mighty groan and yielded the first thing gennie noticed was tidiness the widow lawrence had meant what she said when she had stated the cottage was clean the furniture was draped in dustcovers but there was no dust obviously she came in regularly and chased it away gennie found the idea touching and sad the walls were painted a pale blue and the lighter patches here and there indicated where pictures had hung for years carrying her box of supplies gennie wandered toward the back of the house and found the kitchen the sense of order prevailed here as well formica counters were spotless the porcelain sink gleamed a flick of the tap proved the plumbing was indeed cooperative gennie set down the box and went through the back door onto the screened porch the air was warm and moist tasting of the sea someone had repaired a few holes in the screen and the paint on the floor was cracked but clean too clean gennie realized there was no sign of life in the cottage and barely any echo of the life that had once been there she would have preferred the dusty disorder she had found in grants lighthouse someone lived there someone vital shaking her head she pushed him to the back of her mind someone lived here now and in short order the house would know it quickly she went back to her car to unpack because she traveled light and was inherently organized it took less than two hours for gennie to distribute her things throughout the house both bedrooms were tiny and only one had a bed when gennie made it up with the linens she had bought she discovered it was a feather bed delighted she spent some time bouncing on it and sinking into it in the second bedroom she stowed her painting gear with the dustcovers removed and a few of her own paintings hung on the faded spots she began to feel a sense of home barefoot and pleased with herself she went out to walk the length of the pier a few boards creaked and others shook but she decided the structure was safe enough perhaps she would buy a small boat and explore the inlet she could do as she pleased now go where she liked her ties in new orleans would pull her back eventually but the wanderlust which had driven her north six months before had yet to fade wanderlust she repeated as her eyes clouded no the word was guilt or pain it was still following her perhaps it always would its been more than a year gennie thought as she closed her eyes seventeen months two weeks three days and she could still see angela perhaps she should be grateful for that for the fact that her artists memory could conjure up her sisters face exactly as it had been young beautiful vibrant but on the other side of the coin it was too easy to see angela lifeless and broken the way her sister had looked after shed killed her not your fault how many times had she heard that it wasnt your fault gennie you cant blame yourself oh yes i can she thought with a sigh if i hadnt been driving if my reflexes had been quicker if id only seen that car running the red light there was no going back and gennie knew it the times the helpless guilt and grief flooded her were fewer now but no less painful she had her art and sometimes she thought that alone had saved her sanity after her sisters death all in all this trip had been good for her by taking her away from the memories that were still too close and by letting her concentrate on painting for paintings sake art had become too much like a business to her in the past few years shed nearly lost herself in the selling and showings now it was back to basics she needed that oil acrylic watercolor charcoal and the canvases that waited to be filled perhaps the hard realism of losing her sister had influenced her to seek the same hard realism in her work it might have been her way of forcing herself to accept life and death her abstracts the misty quality of her painting had always given the world she created a gentle hue not quite real but so easy to believe in now she was drawn to the plain the everyday reality wasnt always pretty but there was a strength in it she was just beginning to understand gennie drew in a deep breath yes she would paint this this quiet settled little inlet thered be a time for it but first now she needed the challenge and power of the ocean a glance at her watch showed her it was noon surely he would be out on his boat now making up the time she had cost him that morning she could have three or four hours to sketch the lighthouse from different angles without him even knowing and if he did gennie added with a shrug what difference would it make one woman with a sketch pad could hardly bother him in any case he could just bolt himself up inside and ignore her if he didnt like it just as she intended to ignore him grants studio was on the third level more precisely grants studio was the third level what had been three cubbyhole rooms had been remodeled into one with good natural light strongest from the north glasstopped cabinets called taborets held an assortment of tools completely organized fountain pens ballpoints knives sable brushes a wide variety of pencils and erasers bow compass t square an engineer or architect would have recognized several of the tools and approved the quality matte paper was already taped down to his drawing board on the whitewashed wall he faced hung a mirror and a framed reprint of the yellow kid a cartoon strip nearly a hundred years old on the other side of the room was a sophisticated radio and a small color tv the stack of newspapers and magazines in the corner was waisthigh the room had the sense of practical order grant bothered with in no other aspect of his life he worked without hurry this morning there were times he worked frantically not because of a deadline he was always a month ahead of schedule but because his own thoughts pushed at him at times he would take a week or perhaps two to simply gather ideas and store them other times he would work through the night as those same ideas fretted to be put down with pen and ink hed finished the project hed been working on in the early hours of the morning now a new angle had been pushing at him one he didnt seem to be able to resist grant rarely resisted anything that applied to his art already he had scaled the paper striking diagonal lines with the blue pencil that wouldnt photograph he knew what he wanted but the preparation came first those finite vital details no one would ever notice in the few seconds it took to view his work when the paper was set and scaled divided into five sections double the size they would be when reproduced he began to sketch lightly doodling really he brought his main character to life with a few loops and lines the man was quite ordinary grant had insisted he be when he had created what his sister called his alter ego ten years before an ordinary man perhaps a bit scruffy with a few features the nose the puzzled eyes a bit exaggerated but grants macintosh was easily recognizable as someone you might pass on the street and barely notice he was always too thin so that his attempts at dressing sharply never quite came off he carried the air of someone who knew he was going to be put upon grant had a certain fondness for his general ineptitude and occasional satirical remarks grant knew all of his friends hed created them as well not precisely a motley crew but very close wellmeaning dreamers smart alecks they were the shades of the people grant had known in college friends and acquaintances ordinary people doing ordinary things in an unusual way that was the theme of his craft hed given birth to macintosh in college then had left him in a closet while he had pursued art in a more traditional manner for almost three years perhaps he would have been successful the talent had been there but grant had discovered he was much happier sketching a caricature than painting a portrait in the end macintosh had won grant had hauled him back out of the closet and at the end of seven years the slightly weary blearyeyed character appeared in every major newspaper in the country seven days a week people followed his life and times over coffee on the subway on buses and in bed over a million americans opened their newspapers and looked to see just what he was up to that day before they had to face their own as a cartoonist grant knew it was his responsibility to amuse and to amuse quickly with a few short sentences and simple drawings the strip would be looked at for ten or twelve seconds chuckled over then tossed aside often to line a bird cage grant had few illusions it was the chuckle that was important the fact that for those few seconds he had given people something to laugh at something to relate to in macintosh grant looked for the common experience then twisted it what he wanted what he insisted on having was the right to do so and the right to be left alone to do it he was known to the public only by his initials his contract with united syndicate specifically stated his name would never be used in conjunction with the strip nor would he grant any interviews or do any guest spots his anonymity was as much a part of his price as his annual income still using only the pencil he began on the second section macintosh mumbling as the thudding on the door interrupted his newest hobby stamp collecting grant had gotten two full weeks out of this particular angle macintoshs bumbling attempts his friends caustic comments about his terminal boredom macintosh had fussed with his stamps and wondered if hed finally hit a gold mine as the television had droned on behind him on the latest increase in the firstclass mail service here he would open his door to be faced with a wet badtempered siren grant didnt have any trouble drawing gennie in fact he felt making her a character would put her firmly in perspective shed be just as ridiculous and as vulnerable as the rest of the people in his world hed begin to think of her as a character instead of a woman flesh blood soft fragrant he didnt have any room for a woman but he always had room for a character he could tell them when to come when to go what to say he named her veronica thinking the more sophisticated name suited her deliberately he exaggerated the tilt of her eyes and the lush sensuality of her mouth since the setting was washington dc rather than coastal maine grant gave her a flat tire on the way home from a white house function macintosh goggled at her grant captured this by giving himself several stunned stares in the mirror above the drawing board he worked for two hours perfecting the storyline the situation the setup the punchline after changing her tire and practicing macho lines to impress her macintosh ended up with five dollars a stutter and soaked shoes as veronica zoomed out of his life grant felt better when the sketches were done hed put gennie just where he wanted driving away now he would detail his work with india ink and brush solid black would accent or focus the benday patterns zones of dots or lines would give the gray areas detailing macintoshs room was simple enough grant had been there a thousand times but it still took time and precision balance was crucial the angles and positioning in order to draw the readers attention just where you wanted it for the few seconds they would look at the individual panel his supply of patience was consumed by his work giving him little for the other areas of his life the strip was half finished and the afternoon waning before he stopped to rest his hand coffee he thought stretching his back and shoulders as he noticed the ache and food breakfast had been too long ago hed grab something and take a walk down on the beach he still had two papers to read and a few hours of television too much could happen in a day for him to ignore either form of communication but the walk came first grant decided as he moved idly to the window he needed some fresh air the hand he had lifted to rub at the back of his neck dropped leaning closer he narrowed his eyes and stared down it was bad enough when he had to deal with the occasional stray tourist he thought furiously a few curt words sent them away and kept them away but there was no mistaking even at this height that thick ebony hair veronica had yet to drive out of his life chapter three contents prev next it was beautiful no matter what angle you chose or how the light shifted gennie had a half dozen sketches in her pad and knew she could have a half dozen more without catching all the aspects of that one particular jut of land look at the colors in the rocks would she ever be able to capture them and the way the lighthouse stood there solid indomitable the whitewash was faded here and there the concrete blocks pockmarked with time and salt spray that only added to the humanity of it mans strike for safety against the mercurial sea there would have been times the sea would have won gennie mused because man was fallible there would have been times the lighthouse would have won because man was tenacious pitted together they spoke of harmony perseverance sweat and strength she lost track of the time she had sat there undisturbed disturbing no one yet she knew she could go on sitting as long as the sun gave enough light there were so few places in new orleans where she could go to paint without the distractions of curiosity seekers or art buffs when she chose to paint in the city she was invariably recognized and once recognized watched or questioned even when she went out into the bayou along a country road she was often followed shed grown used to working around that and to saving most of her serious work for her studio over the years shed nearly forgotten the simple freedom of being able to work outdoors having the advantage of smelling and tasting what you drew while you drew it the past six months had given her something she hadnt been aware shed looked for a reminder of what she had been before success had put its limitations on her content half dreaming she sketched what she saw and felt and needed nothing else damn it what do you want now to her credit gennie didnt jolt or drop her sketch pad shed known grant was around somewhere as his boat hadnt been moved and shed already decided he wasnt going to spoil what shed found here she was arrogant enough to feel it her right to be there to paint what her art demanded she paint thinking he was rather casual about his trade as a fisherman she turned to him he was furious she thought mildly but shed hardly seen him any other way she decided he was suited to the outofdoors the sun the wind and the sea perhaps shed do a sketch or two of him before she was finished tilting her head back gennie studied him as she would any subject that interested her good afternoon she said in her best plantation drawl knowing he was being measured and insulted might have amused him under different circumstances at the moment it made him yearn to give her a hefty shove off her rock all he wanted was for her to go away and stay away before he gave in to the urge to touch her i asked you what you wanted no need for you to bother im just taking some preliminary sketches gennie kept her seat on the contorted rock near the verge of the cliff and shifted back to sea you can just go on with whatever you were doing grants eyes narrowed to dark slits oh she was good at this he thought dismissing underlings youre on my land mmmhmm the idea of helping her off the rock became more appealing youre trespassing gennie sent him an indulgent glance over her left shoulder you should try barbed wire and land mines nothing like a land mine to make a statement not that i can blame you for wanting to keep this little slice of the world to yourself grant she added as she began to sketch again but im going to leave it exactly as i found it no pop cans no paper plates no cigarette butts even lifted over the roar of the sea her voice held a mild deliberately placating tone designed to set nerve ends on edge grant came very close to grabbing her by the hair and dragging her to her feet when he was distracted by her pencil moving over the paper what he saw halted the oath on the tip of his tongue it was more than good too true to life for a mere excellent with dashes and shading she was capturing the swirl of the sea on rock the low swoop of gulls and the steady endurance of the lighthouse in the same way shed given the sketch no hint of quiet beauty it was all hard edges chips flaws and simplicity it wouldnt make a postcard nor would it make a soothing touch of art over a mantel but anyone whod ever stood on a point where sea battled shore would understand it frowning in concentration rather than anger grant bent closer hers werent the hands of a student hers wasnt the soul of an amateur in silence grant waited until she had finished then immediately took the sketchbook from her hey gennie was halfway off her rock shut up she did only because she saw he wasnt going to hurl her work into the sea settling back on her rock she watched grant as he flipped through her pages now and again he stopped to study one sketch a bit longer than the others his eyes were very dark now she noted while the wind blew his hair over his forehead and away again there was a line not of temper but of intensity between his brows his mouth was unsmiling set gennie thought to judge it should have amused her to have her work critiqued by a reclusive fisherman somehow it didnt there was a faint ache behind her temple she recognized as tension shed felt that often enough before every one of her showings grants eyes skimmed over the page and met hers for a long moment there was only the crash of the surf and the distant bell of a buoy now he knew why hed had that nagging sense of having seen her before but her newspaper pictures didnt do her justice grandeau he said at length genvieve grandeau at any other time she wouldnt have been surprised to have had her work or her name recognized not in new york california atlanta but it was intriguing to find a man at some forgotten lands end who could recognize her work from a rough sketch in a notepad yes she stood then combing her hair back from her forehead with her hand and holding it there how did you know he tapped the sketchbook on his palm while his eyes stayed on hers technique is technique whether its sketches or oils whats the toast of new orleans doing in windy point the dry tone of the question annoyed her enough that she forgot how easily he had recognized her work im taking a years sabbatical rising she held out her hand for her pad grant ignored the gesture an odd place to find one of the countrys most social artists your works in art papers almost as often as your names in the society section werent you engaged to an italian count last year he was a baron she corrected coolly and we werent engaged do you fill your time between catches reading the tabloids the flash of temper in her eyes made him grin i do quite a bit of reading and you he added before she could think of some retort manage to get yourself in the new york times almost as often as you get yourself in the tabloids and the glossies gennie tossed her head in a gesture so reminiscent of royal displeasure his grin widened it seems some live and others only read about life you do make good copy genvieve he couldnt resist and hooked his thumbs in his pockets as new ideas for veronica raced through his mind it seemed inevitable that she would come back and drive macintosh crazy for a while youre a favorite with the paparazzi her voice remained cool and distant but she began to tap her pencil against the rock i suppose they have to make their living like anyone else i seem to recall something about a duel being fought in brittany a couple of years ago a smile lit her face full of fun when he hadnt expected it if you believe that i have a bridge in new york you might be interested in dont spoil my illusions grant said mildly the smile wasnt easy to resist he discovered not when it was genuine and touched with selfdeprecating humor if youd rather believe tripe she said graciously who am i to argue better to keep digging at her than to dwell too long on that smile some tripes fascinating in its way there was a film director before the count baron gennie reminded him the count youre thinking of was french and one of my first patrons youve had quite a selection of patrons she continued to smile obviously amused yes are you an art buff or do you just like gossip both he told her easily come to think of it there hasnt been a great deal about your adventures in the press for the last few months youre obviously keeping your sabbatical very low key the last thing i recall reading was he remembered then and could have cut out his tongue the car accident her sisters death a beautiful and intrusive wireservice photo of genvieve grandeau at the funeral devastation shock grief that much had been clear even through the veil she had worn she wasnt smiling now but looking at him with a mask of placid blankness im sorry he said the apology nearly buckled her knees shed heard those words so many times before from so many different people but theyd never struck her with such simple sincerity from a stranger gennie thought as she turned toward the sea again it shouldnt mean so much coming from a stranger its all right the wind felt so cool so vital it wasnt the place to dwell on death if she had to think of it she would think of it when she was alone when there was silence now she could breathe deep and drink in the sea and the strength so you spend your leisure time reading all the gossip in this wicked world for a man whos so interested in people you chose a strange place to live interested in them grant agreed grateful that she was stronger than she looked that doesnt mean i want to be around them you dont care for people then when she turned back the smile was there again teasing the tough recluse in a few years you might even make crusty you cant be crusty until youre fifty he countered its an unwritten law i dont know gennie stuck her pencil behind her ear and tilted her head i wouldnt think youd bother with laws unwritten or otherwise depends he said simply on whether theyre useful or not she laughed tell me she glanced down to the sketchbook grant still held do you like the sketches he gave a short laugh i dont think genvieve grandeau needs an unsolicited critique genvieve has a tremendous ego gennie corrected besides its not unsolicited if i ask for it grant gave her a long steady look before answering your works always very moving very personal the publicity attached to it isnt necessary i believe from you thats a compliment gennie considered are you going to give me free rein to paint here or am i going to have to fight you every step of the way he frowned again and his face settled into the lines so quickly gennie swallowed a laugh why here precisely i was beginning to think you were perceptive gennie said with a sigh she made a sweep with her hand wide graceful encompassing cant you see it its life and its death its a war that never ends one well never see the outcome of i can put that on canvas only a part of it a small small slice but i can do it i couldnt resist if i wanted to the last thing i want here is a bunch of eager reporters or a few displaced european noblemen gennie lifted a brow at once haughty and amused it was the casual superiority of the look grant told himself that made him want to drag her to the ground and prove to them both she was only a woman i think you take your reading too seriously she told him in an infuriatingly soft drawl but i could give my word if you like that i wont phone the press or any of the two dozen lovers you seem to think i have dont you his banked temper came out in sarcasm gennie met it coolly thats none of your business however she continued i could sign a contract in blood yours preferably and pay you a reasonable fee since its your lighthouse im going to paint here with your cooperation or without it you seem to have a disregard for property rights genvieve you seem to have a disregard for the rights of art he laughed at that a sound that was appealing masculine and puzzling no he said after a moment as it happens i feel very strongly about the rights of the artist as long as it doesnt involve you he sighed a sound she recognized as frustrated his feelings about art and censorship were too in grained to allow him to bar her way and he knew even as he stood there that she was going to give him a great deal of trouble a pity she hadnt chosen penobscot bay paint he said briefly and stay out of my way agreed gennie stepped up on the rock and looked out to sea again its your rocks i want your house your sea the lazily feminine smile touched her lips as she turned to him again but youre quite safe grant i havent any designs on you it was bait they both knew it but he nibbled anyway you dont worry me genvieve dont i what are you doing her common sense demanded she ignored it he thought she was some kind of twentiethcentury siren why not humor him with the aid of the rock she was a few inches above him his eyes were narrowed against the sun as he looked up at her hers were wide and smiling with a laugh she rested her hands on his shoulders i could have sworn i did grant considered simply yanking her from the rock and into his arms he ignored the stab of desire that came so quickly then left a nagging ache she was taunting him damn her and she would win if he wasnt careful its your ego again he told her youre not the type that appeals to me anger flashed into her eyes again making her nearly irresistible does any i prefer a softer type he said knowing her skin would be soft enough to melt if he gave in and put his hands on her quieter he lied someone a bit less aggressive gennie struggled not to lose her temper completely and slug him ah you prefer women who sit silently and dont think who dont flaunt their attributes this time his smile was taunting i dont have any trouble resisting you the bait was cast again and this time gennie swallowed it whole really lets see about that she brought her mouth down to his before she had a chance to consider the consequences her hands were still on his shoulders his still in his pockets but the contact of lips brought on a fullscale explosion grant felt it rocket through him fierce and fast while his fingers balled into fists what in gods name was this he demanded while he used every ounce of control not to bring her body against his instinctively he knew that would be the end for him he had only to weather this one assault on his system and it would be over why didnt he back away he wasnt chained grant told himself to ordered himself to then stood helpless while her mouth moved over his dozens dozens of images and fantasies rained in his head until he nearly drowned in them witch he thought as his mind hazed hed been right about her all along he felt the ground tilt under his feet the roar of the sea fill his brain her taste warm mysterious spiced with woman seeped into everything and even that wasnt enough for a moment he believed that there could be more than everything a step just beyond what men knew perhaps women understood it he felt his body tense as though hed been shot perhaps this woman did in some part of his brain he knew that for one brief moment he was completely vulnerable gennie drew away quickly grant thought he felt the hands still on his shoulders tremble lightly her eyes were dazed her lips parted not in temptation but in astonishment through his own shock he realized shed been just as moved as he and just as weakened by it ii have to go she began then bit her lip as she realized she was stuttering again a habit she seemed to have developed in the past twentyfour hours forgetting her sketch pad she stepped off the rock and prepared to make an undignified dash for her car in the next instant she was whirled around his face was set his breathing unsteady i was wrong his voice filled her head emptying it of everything else i have a great deal of trouble resisting you what had she done gennie wondered frantically to both of them she was trembling she never trembled frightened oh god yes she could face the storm and the dark now with complete confidence it was nothing compared to this i think wed better so do i he muttered as he hauled her against him but its too late now in the next instant his mouth covered hers hard undeniable but she would deny it gennie told herself she had to or be swallowed up how had she ever thought she understood emotions sensations translating them with paints was nothing compared with an onslaught of experience he poured through her until she wasnt certain shed ever be free of him she lifted her hands to push him away she drew him yet closer his fingers gripped her hair not gently the savageness of the cliff the sea the wind tore into both of them and ruled he tugged her head back perhaps to pretend he was still in command her lips parted and her tongue raced to meet his is this what shed always ached to feel gennie wondered this wild liberation this burning searing need shed never known what it was like to be so filled with anothers taste that you could remember no others shed known he had this kind of strength in him had sensed it from the first but to feel it now to know she was caught up in it was such a conflicting emotion power and weakness that she couldnt tell one from the other his skin was rough scraping against hers as he slanted his mouth to a new angle feeling the small intimate pain she moaned from the sheer pleasure of it his hands were still in her hair roaming gripping tangling while their mouths met in mutual assault let yourself go it was an order that came from somewhere deep inside of her let yourself feel helpless she obeyed she heard the gulls but the sound seemed romantic now no longer mournful the sea beat against the land power power power she knew the full extent of it as her lips clung to grants the edge of the cliff was close she knew one step two and she would be over cartwheeling into space to be brought up short by the hard earth of reality but those few seconds of giddy freedom would be worth the risk her sigh spoke of yielding and of triumph grant swore the sound muffled against her lips be fore he could force himself to break away from her this was exactly what he had sworn wouldnt happen hed done enough fishing to know when he was being reeled in he didnt have time for this thats what he told himself as he looked down at gennie her face was soft flushed with passion her hair trailing down to be tugged at by the wind as she kept her head tilted back his lips ached to press against that slender golden throat it was her eyes half closed and gleaming with the ageless power of woman that helped him resist it was a trap he wouldnt be caught in no matter which of them baited it his voice was low when he spoke and as furious as his eyes i might want you i might even take you but itll be when im damn good and ready you want to call the tune play the games stick with your counts and your barons grant whirled away cursing both of them too stunned to move gennie watched him disappear inside the lighthouse was that all it had meant to him she thought numbly just any man any woman any passion hadnt he felt that quicksilver pain that had meant unity intimacy destiny games how could he talk of games after they had closing her eyes she ran an unsteady hand through her hair no it was her fault she was making something out of nothing there was no unity between two people who didnt even know each other and intimacy was just a handy word to justify the needs of the physical she was being fanciful again turning something ordinary into something special because it was what she wanted let him go she reached down to pick up her sketch pad and found the pencil grant had dislodged from her hair let him go and concentrate on your work she ordered herself it was the scene that carried you away not the content careful not to look back she walked to her car her hands didnt stop trembling until she reached the lane to the cottage this was better she thought as she listened to the quiet lap of water and the gentle sounds of swallows coming back to nest for the evening there was peace here and the light was easy this was what she should paint instead of the turbulence of the ocean and the ruggedness of rocks this was where she should stay soaking up the drifting solitude of still water and calm air when you challenged the tempestuousness of nature odds were you lost only a fool continued to press against the odds suddenly weary gennie got out of the car and wandered down to the pier at the end she sat down on the rough wood to let her feet dangle over the side if she stayed here shed be safe she sat in silence while the sun lowered in the sky it took no effort to feel the lingering pressure of grants lips on hers shed never known a man to kiss like that forceful consuming yet with a trace of vulnerability then again she wasnt as experienced as grant assumed she dated she socialized she enjoyed mens company but as her art had always come first her more intimate relationships were limited classes work showings traveling parties almost everything shed ever done for almost as long as she could remember had been connected with her art and the need to express it certainly she enjoyed the social benefits the touches of glitter and glamour that came her way after days and weeks of isolation she didnt mind the image the press had created because it seemed rather unique and bohemian she didnt mind taking a bit of glitz here and there after working herself to near exhaustion in silence and solitude at times the genvieve the papers tattled about amused or impressed her then it would be time for the next painting shed never had any trouble tucking the socialite away from the artist wouldnt the press be shocked gennie mused to learn that genvieve grandeau of the new orleans grandeaus successful artist established socialite and woman of the world had never had a lover with a half laugh she leaned back on her elbows shed been wedded to her art for so long a lover had seemed superfluous until gennie started to block out the thought then calling herself a coward finished it out until grant campbell staring up at the sky she let herself remember those sensations those feelings and needs hed unlocked in her she would have made love with him without a thought without a moments hesitation hed rejected her no it was more than that gennie remembered as anger began to rise again rejection was one thing painful humiliating but that hadnt been all of it grant had dumped his arrogance on top of rejection that was intolerable hed said hed take her when he was ready as if she were aa chocolate bar on a store counter her eyes narrowed pale green with fury well see about that gennie told herself well just see about that standing she brushed off the seat of her pants with one clean swipe no one rejected genvieve grandeau and no one took her it was games he wanted she thought as she stalked toward the cottage it would be games hed get chapter four contents prev next one wasnt going to be chased away gennie told herself that with a grim satisfaction as she packed her painting gear the next morning no one chased her away especially a rude arrogant idiot grant campbell was going to find her perched on his doorstep in a manner of speaking until she was good and ready to move on the painting gennie mused as she checked her brushes of course the painting was of first importance but while she was about it she thought with a tight smile she would take a bit of time to teach that man a lesson oh he deserved one gennie tossed the hair out of her eyes as she shut the lid on her paint box no one in all of her experience deserved a good dig in the ribs as much as grant campbell and she was just the woman to give it to him so he thought she wanted to play games gennie snapped the locks on the case a bit violently so that the sound echoed like two shots through the empty cottage shed play games all right her games her rules gennie had spent twentysix years watching her grandmother beguile and enchant the male species an amazing woman gennie thought now with an affectionate smile beautiful and vibrant in her seventies she could still twist a man of any age around her finger well she was a genvieve too she stuck her hands on her hips and grant campbell was about to take a short walk off a high cliff take me will he she thought seething all over again with the memory of all the impossible gall when hes ready making a low sound in her throat she grabbed a paint smock shed have grant campbell crawling at her feet before she was through with him the anger and indignation gennie had nursed all night made it easy to forget that sharp sweet surge of response shed felt when his mouth had been on hers it made it easy to forget the fact that shed wanted him blindly urgently as shed never wanted any man before temper was much more satisfying than depression and gennie rolled with it shed take her revenge coolly it would taste better that way satisfied that her gear was in order gennie walked through the cottage to her bedroom critically she studied herself in the mirror over the old bureau she was artist enough to recognize good bone structure and coloring perhaps suppressed anger suited her she considered as it added a faint rose flush to the honey tone of her skin as grimly as a warrior preparing for battle she picked up a pot of muted green eyeshadow when you had an unusual feature she thought as she smudged it on her lids you played it up the result pleased her a bit exotic but not obvious lightly she touched her lips with color not too much she reflected just enough to tempt with a lazy smile she dabbed her scent behind her ears oh she intended to tempt him all right and when he was on his knees shed stroll blithely away a pity she couldnt wear something a bit sexier she thought as she pursed her lips and turned sideways in the mirror but the painting did come first after all one couldnt wear something slinky to sit on a rock the jeans and narrow little top would have to do pleased with the days prospects gennie started back for her gear when the sound of an approaching car distracted her her first thought was grant her first reaction a flood of nerves annoyed gennie told herself it was simply the anticipation of the contest that had her heart pounding when she went to the window she saw it wasnt grants pickup but a small battered station wagon the widow lawrence stepped out neat and prim carrying a covered plate surprised and a bit uncomfortable gennie opened the door to her landlady good morning she smiled trying to ignore the oddness of inviting the woman inside a cottage where she had lived slept and worked for years see youre up and about the widow hovered at the threshold with her tiny dark eyes on gennies face yes gennie would have taken her hand instinctively if the widow hadnt been gripping the plate with both of them please come in mrs lawrence dont want to bother you thought maybe youd like some muffins i would gennie forgot her plans for an early start and opened the door wider especially if youd have some coffee with me wouldnt mind the widow hesitated almost imperceptibly then stepped inside cant stay long im needed at the post office but her gaze skimmed over the room as she stood in front of the door they smell wonderful gennie took the plate and headed back toward the kitchen hoping to dispel some of the awkwardness you know i can never drum up much energy for cooking when its only for me ayah theres more pleasure when youve a family to feed gennie felt another well of sympathy but didnt offer it she faced the stove as she measured out coffee in the little pot shed bought in town the widow would be looking at her kitchen gennie thought and remembering you settled in all right then yes gennie took two plates and set them on the narrow dropleaf table the cottage is just what i needed its beautiful mrs lawrence she hesitated as she took down cups and saucers then turned to face the woman again you must have hated to leave here mrs lawrence shifted her shoulders in what might have been a shrug things change roof hold up all right in the storm the other night gennie gave her a blank look but caught herself before she said she hadnt been there to notice i didnt have any trouble she said instead gennie saw the gaze wander around the room perhaps it would be best if she talked about it everyone had told gennie that about angela but she hadnt believed them then now she began to wonder if it would help to talk about a loss instead of submerging it did you live here long mrs lawrence she brought the cups to the table as she asked then went for the cream twentysix years the woman said after a moment moved in after my second boy was born a doctor he is a resident in bangor stiff new england pride showed in the jut of her chin his brothers got himself a job on an oil rig couldnt keep away from the sea gennie came to join her at the table you must be very proud of them ayah was your husband a fisherman lobsterman she didnt smile but gennie heard it in her voice a good one died on his boat stroke they tell me she added a dab of cream to her coffee hardly enough to change the color hedve wanted to die on his boat she wanted to ask how long ago but couldnt per haps the time would come when she would be able to speak of the loss of her sister in such simple terms of acceptance do you like living in town used to it now there be friends there and this road for the first time gennie saw the wisp of a smile that made the hard lined face almost pretty my matthew could curse this road six ways to sunday i believe it tempted by the aroma gennie removed the checkered dishcloth from the plate blueberry she grinned pleased i saw wild blueberry bushes along the road from town ayah theyll be around a little while more she watched satisfied as gennie bit into one young girl like you might get lonely away out here gennie shook her head as she swallowed no i like the solitude for painting you do the pictures hanging in the front room yes i hope you dont mind that i hung them always had a partiality for pictures you do good work gennie grinned as pleased with the simple statement as she would have been with a rave review thank you i plan to do quite a bit of painting around windy point more than i had expected at first she added thinking of grant if i decided to stay an extra few weeks you just let me know good gennie watched as the widow broke off a small piece of muffin you must know the lighthouse still nibbling gennie toyed with exactly what information she wanted and how to get it charlie dees used to keep that station mrs lawrence told her him and his missus had it since i was a girl use radar now but my father and his father had that light to keep them off the rocks there were stories here gennie thought ones shed like to hear but for now it was the present keeper who interested her i met the man who lives there now she said casually over the rim of her coffee cup im going to do some painting out there its a wonderful spot the widows stiff straight brows rose you tell him so they knew him in town gennie thought with a mental sniff we came to an agreement of sorts young campbells been there near on to five years the widow speculated on the gleam in gennies eyes but didnt comment on it keeps to himself sent a few outoftowners on their way quick enough no doubt gennie murmured hes not a friendly sort stays out of trouble the widow gave gennie a quick shrewd look nicelooking boy hear hes been out with the men on the boats a time or two but does more watching than talking confused gennie swallowed the last of the muffin doesnt he fish for a living dont know what he does but he pays his bills right enough gennie frowned more intrigued than she wanted to be thats odd i got the impression of what she asked herself i dont suppose he gets a lot of mail she hazarded the widow gave her wispy smile again gets his due she said simply i thank you for the coffee miss grandeau she added rising and im happy to have you stay here as you please thank you knowing she had to be satisfied with the bare snips of information gennie rose with her i hope youll come back again mrs lawrence nodding the widow made her way back to the front door you let me know if you have any problems when the weather turns youll be needing the furnace its sound enough mind but noisier than some ill remember thanks gennie watched her walk to her car and thought about grant he wasnt one of them she mused but she had sensed a certain reserved affection for him in mrs lawrences tone he kept to himself and that was something the people of windy point would respect five years she thought as she wandered back for her paints a long time to seclude yourself in a lighthouse doing what with a shrug she gathered her gear what he did wasnt her concern making him crawl a bit was the only meal grant ate with regularity was breakfast after that he grabbed what he wanted when he wanted or when his work permitted hed eaten at dawn only because he couldnt sleep then had gone out on his boat only because he couldnt work gennie tucked into bed two miles away had managed to interfere with his two most basic activities normally he would have enjoyed the early run at sea catching the rosy light with the fishermen and facing the chill dawn air he would try his luck and if it was good have his catch for dinner if it was bad hed broil a steak or open a can he hadnt enjoyed his outing this morning because he had wanted to sleep then hed wanted to work his mood hadnt been tuned to fishing and the diversion hadnt been a success the sun had still been low in the sky when hed returned it was high now but grants mood was little better than it had been only the discipline hed imposed on himself over the years kept him at his drawing board perfecting and refining the strip hed started the day before shed thrown him off schedule he thought grimly and she was running around inside his head grant often let people do just that but they were his people and he controlled them gennie refused to stay in character genvieve he thought as he meticulously inked in veronicas long lush hair hed admired her work its lack of gimmickry its basic class she painted with style and the hint always the hint of a raging passion underneath a misty overlay of fancy her paintings asked you to pretend to imagine to believe in something lovely grant had never found any fault with that he remembered seeing one of her landscapes one of the bayou scenes that often figured prominently in her showings the shadows had promised secrets the dusky blue light a night full of possibilities thered been a fog over the water that had made him think of muffled whispers the tiny house hanging over the river hadnt seemed ramshackle but lovely in a faded yesterday way the serenity of the painting had appealed to him the clever lighting shed used had amused him he could remember being disappointed that the work had already been sold he wouldnt have even asked the price the passion that often lurked around the edges of her works was a subtle contrast to the serenity of her subjects the fancy had always been uppermost she got enough passion in her personal life he remembered as his mouth tightened if he hadnt met her hadnt touched her he would have kept to the opinion that ninety percent of the things printed about her were just what she had said tripe but now all he could think was that any man who could get close to genvieve grandeau would want her and that the passion that simmered in her paintings simmered in her equally she knew she could make a slave out of a man he thought and forced himself to complete his drawing of veronica she knew it and enjoyed it grant set down his brush a moment and flexed his fingers still he had the satisfaction of knowing hed turned her aside turned her aside hell he thought with a mirthless laugh if hed done that he wouldnt be sitting here remembering how shed been like a fire in his arms hot restless dangerous he wouldnt be remembering how his mind had gone blank one instant and then had been filled with only her a siren by god yes he thought savagely it was easy to imagine her smiling and singing and luring a man toward some rocky coast but not him he wasnt a man to be bewitched by a seductive voice and a pair of alluring eyes after his parting shot he doubted shed be back in any case though he glanced toward the window grant refused to go to it he picked up his brush and worked for another hour with gennie teasing the back of his mind satisfied that he had finished the strip on schedule after all grant cleaned his brushes because the next one was already formed in his mind his mood was better with a meticulousness that carried over into no other area of his life he set his studio to rights tools were replaced in a precise manner in and on the glasstopped cabinet beside him bottles and jars were wiped clean tightly capped and stored his copy would remain on the drawing board until well dried taking his time grant went down to rummage in the kitchen for some food while he kept the portable radio on filling him in on whatever was going on in the outside world a mention of the ethics committee and a senator grant could never resist satirizing gave him an angle for another strip it was true that his use of recognizable names and faces often in politics caused some papers to place his work on the editorial page grant didnt care where they put it as long as his point got across caricaturing politicians had become a habit when hed been a child one hed never had the least inclination to break leaning against the counter idly depleting a bag of peanut butter cookies grant listened to the rest of the report an awareness of trends of moods of events was as essential to his art as pen and ink hed remember what hed need when the time came to use it for now it was filed and stored in the back of his mind and he wanted air and sunshine hed go out grant told himself not because he expected to see gennie but because he expected not to of course she was there but he wanted to believe the surge he felt was annoyance it was always annoyance never pleasure that he felt when he found someone infringing on his solitude it wouldnt be much trouble to ignore her the wind had her hair caught in its dragging fingers lifting it from her neck he could simply go the other way and walk north on the beach the sun slanted over the skin of her bare arms and face and had it gleaming if he turned his back and moved down the other side of the cliff hed forget she was even there swearing under his breath grant went toward her gennie had seen him of course the moment he stepped out her brush had only hesitated for a moment before shed continued to paint if her pulse had scrambled a bit she told herself it was only the anticipation of the battle she was looking forward to engaging in and winning because she knew she couldnt afford to keep going now that her concentration was broken she tapped the handle of her brush to her lips and viewed what shed done that morning the sketch on the canvas gave her precisely what she wanted the colors shed already mixed satisfied her she began to hum lightly as she heard grant draw closer so gennie tilted her head as if to study the canvas from a different angle you decided to come out of your cave grant stuck his hands in his pockets and deliberately stood where he couldnt see her work you didnt strike me as the kind of woman who asked for trouble barely moving the angle of her head gennie slid her eyes up to his her smile was very faint and very taunting i suppose that makes you a poor judge of character doesnt it the look was calculated to arouse but knowing it didnt make any difference he felt the first kindling of desire spread low in his stomach or you a fool he murmured i told you id be back grant she allowed her gaze to drift briefly to his mouth generally i try to follow through would you like to see what ive done he told himself he didnt give a hang about the painting or about her no gennie moved her mouth into a pout oh and i thought you were such an art connoisseur she set down her brush and ran a hand leisurely through her hair what are you grant campbell her eyes were mocking and alluring what i choose to be fortunate for you she rose taking her time she drew off the shortsleeved smock and dropped it on the rock beside her she watched his face as his eyes traveled over her then ran a lazy finger down his shirtfront shall i tell you what i see he didnt answer but his eyes stayed on hers gennie wondered if she pressed her hand to his heart if the beat would be fast and unsteady a loner she continued with the face of a buccaneer and the hands of a poet and the manners she added with a soft laugh of a lout it seems to me that the manners are all youve had the choice about it was difficult to resist the gleam of challenge in her eyes or the promise in those soft full lips that smiled with calculated feminine insolence if you like grant said mildly while he kept the hands that itched to touch her firmly in his pockets i cant say i do gennie walked a few steps away close enough to the cliff edge so that the spray nearly reached her then again your manners add a rather roughandready appeal she glanced over her shoulder i dont suppose a woman always wants a gentleman you wouldnt be a man who looks for a lady with the sea behind her reflecting the color of her eyes she looked more a part of it than ever is that what you are genvieve she laughed pleased with the frustration and fury she read in his eyes it depends she said deliberately mimicking him on whether its useful or not grant came to her then but resisted the desire to shake her until her teeth rattled their bodies were close so that little more than the wind could pass between them what the hell are you trying to do she gave him an innocent stare why have a conversation i suppose youre out of practice he glared narrowedeyed then turned away im going for a walk he muttered lovely gennie slipped her arm through his ill go with you i didnt ask you grant said flatly stopping again oh gennie batted her eyes youre trying to charm me by being rude again its so difficult to resist a grin tugged at his mouth before he controlled it there was no one he laughed at more easily than himself all right then there was a gleam in his eyes she didnt quite trust come on grant walked swiftly without deference to the difference in their strides determined to make him suffer before the afternoon was over gennie trotted to keep up after theyd circled the lighthouse grant started down the cliff with the confidence of long experience gennie took a long look at the steep drop at the rock ledges grant walked down with no more care than if theyd been steps below the surf churned and battered at the shoreline she wasnt about to be intimidated gennie reminded herself hed just love that taking a deep breath she started after him for the first few feet her heart was in her throat shed really make him suffer if she fell and broke her neck then she began to enjoy it the sea grew louder with the descent salt spray tingled along her skin doubtless there was a simpler way down but at the moment she wouldnt have looked for it grant reached the bottom in time to turn and see gennie scrambling down the last few feet hed wanted to believe shed still be up on the cliff yet somehow hed known better she was no hothouse magnolia no matter how much hed like to have tossed her in that category she was much too vital to be admired from a distance instinctively he reached for her hand to help her down gennie brushed against him on the landing then stood head tilted back daring him to do something about it her scent rushed to his senses before shed only smelled of the rain this was just as subtle but infinitely more sensuous she smelled of night in the full light of the afternoon and of all those whispering murmuring promises that bloomed after sundown infuriated that he could be lured by such an obvious tactic grant released her without a word he started down the narrow rocky beach where the sea boomed and echoed and the gulls screamed smug and confident with her early success gennie moved with him oh im getting to you grant campbell and i havent even started is this what you do with your time when youre not locked in your secret tower is this what you do with your time when youre not hitting the hot spots on bourbon street tossing back her hair gennie deliberately slipped her arm through his again oh we talked enough about me yesterday tell me about grant campbell are you a mad scientist conducting terrifying experiments under secret government contract he turned his head then gave her an odd smile at the moment im stamp collecting that puzzled her enough that she forgot the game and frowned why do i feel theres some grain of truth in that with a shrug grant continued to walk wondering why he didnt shake her off and go on his way alone when he came here he always came alone walks along this desolate rocky beach were the only time other than sleep that he allowed his mind to empty there where the waves crashed like thunder and the ground was hard and unforgiving was his haven against his own thoughts and selfimposed pressure hed never allowed anyone to join him there not even his own creations he wanted to feel the sense of intrusion hed expected with gennie at his side instead he felt something very close to contentment a secret place gennie murmured distracted grant glanced down at her what this gennie gestured with her free hand this is a secret place bending she picked up a shell pitted by the ocean dried like a bone in the sun my grandmother has a beautiful old plantation house filled with antiques and silk pillows theres a room off the attic upstairs its gloomy and dusty theres a broken rocker in there and a box full of perfectly useless things i could sit up there for hours bringing her gaze back to his she smiled ive never been able to resist a secret place grant remembered suddenly and vividly a tiny storeroom in his parents home in georgetown hed closeted himself in there for hours at a stretch with stacks of comic books and a sketch pad its only a secret if nobody knows about it she laughed slipping her hand into his without any thought oh no it can still be a secret with two sometimes a better secret she stopped to watch a gull swoop low over the water what are those islands out there disturbed because her hand felt as though it be longed in his grant scowled out to sea hunks of rock mostly oh gennie sent him a desolate look no bleached bones or pieces of eight the grin snuck up on him there be talk of a skull that moans when a storms brewing he told her slipping into a thick down east cadence whose gennie demanded ready for whatever story he could conjure a seamans grant improvised he lusted after his captains woman she had the eyes of a seawitch and hair like midnight despite himself grant took a handful of gennies while the rest tossed in the wind she tempted him made him soft wicked promises if hed steal the gold and the longboat when he did because she was a woman who could drive a man to murder with a look she went with him grant felt her hair tangle around his fingers as though it had a life of its own so he rowed for two days and two nights knowing when they came to land hed have her but when they spotted the coast she drew out a saber and lopped off his head now his skull sits on the rocks and moans in frustrated desire amused gennie tilted her head and the woman invested her gold doubled her profits and became a pillar of the community laughing gennie began to walk with him again the moral seems to be never trust a woman who makes you promises certainly not a beautiful one have you had your head lopped off grant he gave a short appreciative laugh no a pity she sighed i suppose that means you make a habit of resisting temptation its not necessary to resist it he countered as long as you keep one eye open theres no romance in that gennie complained ive other uses for my head thanks she shot him a thoughtful look stamp collecting for one they walked in silence again while the sea crashed close beside them on the other side the rocks rose like a wall far out on the water there were dots of boats that one sign of humanity only added to the sense of space and aloneness where did you come from she asked impulsively the same place you did it took her a minute then she chuckled i dont mean biologically geographically he shrugged trying not to be pleased she had caught on so quickly south of here oh well thats specific she muttered then tried again what about family do you have family he stopped to study her why with an exaggerated sigh gennie shook her head this is called making friendly conversation its a new trend thats catching on everywhere im a noncomformist no really you do that wideeyed guileless look very well genvieve thank you she turned the shell over in her hand then looked up at him with a slow smile ill tell you something about my family just to give you a running start she thought for a moment then hit on something she thought hed relate to i have a cousin a few times removed ive always thought he was the most fascinating member of the family tree though you couldnt call him a grandeau what would you call him the black sheep she said with relish he did things his own way never giving a damn about what anyone thought i heard stories about him from time to time though i wasnt meant to and it wasnt until i was a grown woman that i met him im happy to say we took to each other within minutes and have kept in touch over the last couple of years hed lived his life by his wits and done quite well which didnt sit well with some of the more staid members of the family then he confounded everyone by getting married to an exotic dancer no she laughed pleased that he was interested enough to joke to someone absolutely suitable intelligent well bred wealthy she rolled her eyes the black sheep whod spent some time in jail gambled his way into a fortune had outdone them all with a laugh gennie thought of the comanche blade cousin justin had indeed outdone them all and he didnt even bother to thumb his nose i love a happy ending grant said dryly with her eyes narrowed gennie turned to him dont you know that the less you tell someone the more they want to know youre better off to make something up than to say nothing at all im the youngest of twelve children of two south african missionaries he said with such ease she very nearly believed him when i was six i wandered into the jungle and was taken in by a pride of lions i still have a penchant for zebra meat then when i was eighteen i was captured by hunters and sold to a circus for five years i was the star of the sideshow the lion boy gennie put it naturally one night during a storm the tent caught fire in the confusion i escaped living off the land i wandered the country stealing a few chickens now and again eventually an old hermit took me in after id saved him from a grizzly with your bare hands gennie added im telling the story he reminded her he taught me to read and write on his deathbed he told me where hed buried his life savings a quarter million in gold bullion after giving him the viking funeral hed requested i had to decide whether to be a stockbroker or go back to the wilderness so you decided against wall street came here and began to collect stamps thats about it well gennie said after a moment with a boring story like that i can see why you keep it to yourself you asked grant pointed out you might have made something up no imagination she laughed then and leaned her head on his shoulder no i can see you have a very literal mind her laugh rippled along his skin and the casual intimacy of her head against his shoulder shot straight down to the soles of his feet he should shake her off grant told himself he had no business walking here with her and enjoying it ive got things to do he said abruptly we can go up this way it was the change in his tone that reminded gennie shed come there for a purpose and the purpose was not to wind up liking him the way up was easier than the way down she noted as he turned toward what was now a slope rather than a cliff though his fingers loosened on hers she held on shooting him a smile that had him muttering under his breath as he helped her climb thinking quickly she stuck the shell in her back pocket when they neared the top gennie held her other hand out to him with her eyes narrowed a bit against the sun her hair flowing down her back she looked up at him swearing grant grabbed her other hand and hauled her up the last few feet on level ground she stayed close her body just brushing his as their hands remained linked his breath had stayed even during the climb but now it came unsteadily feeling a surge of satisfaction gennie gave him a slow lazy smile going back to your stamps she murmured deliberately she leaned closer to brush her lips over his chin enjoy yourself drawing her hands from his gennie turned shed taken three steps before he grabbed her arm though her heart began to thud she looked over her shoulder at him want something she asked in a low amused voice she could see it on his face the struggle for control and in his eyes she could see a flare of desire that had her throat going dry no she wasnt going to back down now she insisted shed finish out the game when he yanked her against him she told herself it wasnt fear she felt it wasnt passion it was selfgratification it seems you do she said with a laugh and slid her hands up his back when his mouth crushed down on hers her mind spun all thoughts of purpose all thoughts of revenge vanished it was as it had been the first time the passion and over the passion a rightness and with the rightness a storm of confused needs and longings and wishes opening to him was so natural she did so without thought and with a simplicity that made him groan as he drew her closer his tongue skimmed over her lips then tangled with hers as his hands roamed to mold her hips strong hands shed known theyd be strong her skin tingled with the image of being touched without barriers even as her mouth sought to take all he could give her through a kiss alone she strained against him offering demanding and it seemed he couldnt give or take fast enough to satisfy either of them his mouth ravaged but hers wouldnt surrender what she drew out of him excited them both it wasnt until she began to feel the weakness that gennie remembered to fear this wasnt what shed come for was it no she wouldnt believe shed come to feel this terrifying pleasure this aching gnawing need to give what shed never given before panic rose and she struggled against it in a way she knew shed never be able to struggle against desire she had to stop him and herself if he held her much longer she would melt and melting lose drawing on what was left of her strength she pulled back determined not to show either the passion or the fear that raced through her very nice she murmured praying he wouldnt notice how breathless her voice was though your techniques a bit rough for my taste his breath came quick and fast grant didnt speak knowing if he did madness would pour out for the second time shed emptied him out then filled him again with herself need for her raw exclusive penetrating ripped through him as he stared into her eyes and waited for it to abate it didnt he was stronger than she was he told himself as he gathered her shirtfront in his hand her heart thudded against his knuckles there was nothing to stop him from he dropped his hand as though shed scalded him no one pushed him to that he thought furiously while she continued to stare up at him no one youre walking on dangerous ground genvieve he said softly she tossed back her head im very surefooted with a parting smile she turned counting each step as she went back to her canvas perhaps her hands werent steady as she packed up her gear perhaps her blood roared in her ears but shed won the first round she let out a deep breath as she heard the door to the lighthouse slam shut the first round she repeated wishing she wasnt looking forward quite so much to the next one chapter five contents prev next grant managed to avoid gennie for three days she came back to paint every morning and though she worked for hours she never saw a sign of him the lighthouse was silent its windows winking blankly in the sun once his boat was gone when she arrived and hadnt returned when she lost the light she wanted she was tempted to go down the cliff and walk along the beach where he had taken her she found she could have more easily strolled into his house uninvited than gone to that one particular spot without his knowledge even had she wanted to paint there the sense of trespassing would have forbidden it she painted in peace assured that since she had gotten her own back with grant she wouldnt think of him but the painting itself kept him lodged in her mind she would never be able to see that spot on canvas or in reality and not see him it was his as surely as if hed been hewed from the rocks or tossed up by the sea she could feel the force of his personality as she guided her brush and the challenge of it as she struggled to put what should have only been natures mood onto canvas but it wouldnt only be natures she discovered as she painted sea and surf though his form wouldnt be on the canvas his substance would gennie had always felt a particle of her own soul went into each one of her canvases in this one she would capture a part of grants as well neither of them had a choice somehow knowing it drove her to create something with force and muscle the painting excited her she knew shed been meant to paint that view and to paint it well and she knew when it was done she would give it to grant because it could never belong to anyone else it wouldnt be a token of affection she told herself or an offer of friendship it was simply something that had to be done shed never be able in good conscience to sell that canvas and if she kept it herself hed haunt her so before she left windy point she would make him a gift of it perhaps in her way she would then haunt him her mornings were filled with an urgency to finish it an urgency she had to block again and again unless she miss something vital in the process gennie knew it was imperative to move slowly to absorb everything around her and give it to the painting in the afternoons she forced herself to pack up so that she wouldnt work longer than she should and ignore the changing light she sketched her inlet and planned a watercolor she fretted for morning so that she could go back to the sea her restlessness drove her to town it was time to make some sketches there to decide what she would paint and in what medium she told herself she needed to see people again to keep her mind from focusing so continually on grant in the midafternoon windy point was sleepy and quiet boats were out to sea and a hazy summer heat shimmered in the air she saw a woman sitting on her porch stringing the last of the seasons beans while a toddler plucked at the clover in the yard gennie parked her car at the end of the road and began to walk she could sketch the buildings the gardens she could gather impressions that would bring them to life again when she began to paint this was a different world from the force at windy point station different yet from the quiet inlet behind her cottage but they were all connected the sea touched all of them in different ways she wandered glad she had come though the voices she heard were voices of strangers it was a town shed remember more clearly than any of the others shed visited on her tour of new england but it was the sea that continued to tug at her underneath it all and the man who lived there when would she see him again gennie wondered forced to admit that she missed him she missed the scowl and the curt words the quick grin and surprising humor the light of amused cynicism she caught in his eyes from time to time and though it was the hardest to admit she missed that furious passion hed brought to her so suddenly leaning against the side of a building she wondered if there would be another man somewhere who would touch her that way she couldnt imagine one shed never looked for a knight in armor they were simply too much trouble expecting a helpless damsel in return helpless she would never be and chivalry for the most part got in the way of an intelligent relationship grant campbell gennie mused would never be chivalrous and a helpless female would infuriate him remembering their first meeting she chuckled no he didnt care to be put out by a lady in distress anymore than she cared to be one she supposed on both parts it went back to a fierce need for independence no he wasnt looking for a lady and while she hadnt been looking for a knight she hadnt been searching out ogres either gennie thought grant came very close to fitting into that category while she enjoyed mens company she didnt want one tangling up her life at least not until she was ready and she certainly didnt want to be involved with an ogre they were entirely too unpredictable who knew when theyd just swallow you whole shaking her head she glanced down surprised to see that shed not only been thinking of grant but had been sketching him lips pursed gennie lifted the pad for a critical study a good likeness she decided his eyes were narrowed a bit dark and intense on the point of anger his brows were lowered forming that faint vertical line of temper between them shed captured that lean face with its planes and shadows the aristocratic nose and unruly hair and his mouth the little jolt of response wasnt surprising but it was unwelcomed shed drawn his mouth as shed seen it before it came down on hers the sensuousness the ruthlessness yes she could taste that stormy flavor even now standing in the quiet town with the scent of fish and aging flowers around her carefully closing the book gennie reminded herself shed be much better off sticking to the buildings shed come to draw with the pencil stuck behind her ear gennie crossed the road to go into the post office the skinny teenager she remembered from her first trip through the town turned to goggle at her when she entered as she walked up to the counter she smiled at him then watched his adams apple bob up and down will mrs lawrence plunked letters down on the counter youd best be getting mr fairfield his mail before you lose your job yes maam he scooped at the letters while he continued to stare at gennie when he dropped the lot of them on the floor gennie bent to help him and sent him into a blushing attack of stutters will turner mrs lawrence repeated with the pitch of an impatient schoolteacher gather up those letters and be on your way you missed one will gennie said kindly then handed the envelope to him as his jaw went slack face pink eyes glued to hers will stumbled to the door and out mrs lawrence gave a dry chuckle be lucky he doesnt fall off the curb i suppose i should be flattered gennie considered i dont remember having that effect on anyone before awkward age for a boy when he starts noticing females is shaped a bit different with a laugh gennie leaned on the counter i wanted to thank you again for coming by the other day ive been painting out at the lighthouse and havent been into town mrs lawrence glanced down at the sketchbook gennie had set on the counter doing some drawing here yes on impulse gennie opened the book and flipped through it was the town that interested me right away the sense of permanence and purpose cooleyed the widow paged through the book while gennie nibbled on her lip and waited for the verdict ayah she said at length you know what youre about with one finger she pushed back a sheet then studied gennies sketch of grant looks a bit fierce she decided as the wispy smile touched her mouth is a bit for my thinking gennie countered ayah well there be a woman who like a touch of vinegar in a man she gave another dry chuckle and for once her eyes were more friendly than shrewd i be one of them with a glance over gennies shoulder the widow closed the book afternoon mr campbell for a moment gennie goggled at the widow much as will had goggled at her recovering she laid a hand on the now closed book afternoon mrs lawrence when he came to stand at the counter beside her gennie caught the scent of the sea on him genvieve he said giving her a long enigmatic look hed wondered how long he could stand it before he saw her up close again thered been too many times in the past three days that he hadnt been able to resist the urge to go to his studio window and watch her paint all that had stopped him from going down to her was the knowledge that if he touched her again hed be heading down a road hed never turn back from as yet he was uncertain what was at the end of it a picture of the blushing stuttering teenager ran through her mind and straightened gennies spine hello grant when she smiled she was careful to bank down the warmth and make up for it with mockery i thought you were hibernating been busy he said easily didnt know you were still around that gave him the satisfaction of seeing annoyance dart into her eyes before she controlled it ill be around for some time yet mrs lawrence slid a thick bundle of mail on the counter then followed it with a stack of newspapers gennie caught the chicago return address of the top letter and the banner of the washington post before grant scooped everything up thanks with a frown between her brows gennie watched him walk out there must have been a dozen letters and a dozen newspapers letters from chicago a washington paper for a man who lived on a deserted cliff outside a town that didnt even boast a stoplight what in the hell finelooking young man mrs lawrence commented behind gennies back with a mumbled answer gennie started for the door bye mrs lawrence mrs lawrence tapped a finger on the counter thinking there hadnt been such tugging and pulling in the air since the last storm maybe another one was brewing puzzled gennie began to walk again it wasnt any of her business why some odd recluse received so much mail for all she knew he might only come into town to pick it up once a month but that had been yesterdays paper with a brisk shake of her head she struggled against curiosity the real point was that shed been able to get a couple shots in even if hed had a bullseye for her she loitered at the corner doing another quick sketch while she reminded herself that instead of thinking of him she should be thinking what provisions she needed before she headed back to the cottage but she was restless again the sense of order and peace shed found after an hour in town had vanished the moment hed walked into the post office she wanted to find that feeling again before she went back to spend the night alone aimlessly she wandered down the road pausing now and then at a store window she was nearly to the edge of town when she remembered the churchyard shed sketch there until she was tired enough to go home a truck rattled by perhaps the third vehicle gennie had seen in an hour after waiting for it she crossed the road she passed the small uneven plot of the cemetery listening to the quiet the grass was high enough to bend in the breeze overhead a flock of gulls flew by calling out on their way to the sea the paint on the high fence was rusted and peeling queen annes lace grew stubbornly between the posts the church itself was small and white with a single stainedglass panel at the v of the roof other windows were clear glass and paned and the door itself was sturdy and scarred with time gennie walked to the side and sat where the grass had been recently tended she could smell it fleetingly she wondered how it was possible one tiny scrap on the map could have so much that demanded to be painted she could easily spend six months there rather than six weeks and never capture all she wanted to the restlessness evaporated as she began to sketch perhaps she wouldnt be able to transfer everything into oils or watercolor before she left but shed have the sketches in months to come she could use them to go back to windy point when she felt the need for it shed turned over the page to start a second sketch when a shadow fell over her a quick fluctuation of her pulse a swift warmth on her skin she knew who stood behind her shading her eyes she looked up at grant well she said lightly twice in one day small town he gestured toward her pad you finished out at the station no the lights wrong this time of day for what i want there it was annoyance he was supposed to feel not relief casually he dropped to the grass beside her so now youre going to immortalize windy point in my own small way she said dryly and started to sketch again was she glad he had come hadnt she known somehow he would still playing with stamps no ive taken up classical music he only smiled when she turned to study him youd have been reared on that i imagine a little brahms after dinner i favored chopin she tapped her pencil on her chin what did you do with your mail i stowed it i didnt notice your truck i brought the boat taking the sketchbook he flipped through to the front for someone whos so keen on privacy she began heatedly you have little respect when it belongs to someone else yeah unceremoniously he shoved her hand away when she reached for the pad while she simmered grant went through the book pausing then going on until he came to the sketch of himself he studied it a moment wordlessly then surprised gennie by grinning not bad he decided im overwhelmed by your flattery he considered her a moment then acted on impulse one deserves another plucking the pencil out of her fingers he turned the pages over until he came to a blank one to her astonishment he began to draw with the easy confidence of long practice mouth open she stared at him while he whistled between his teeth and looped lines and curves onto the paper his eyes narrowed a moment as he added some shading then he tossed the book back into her lap gennie gave him a long last stare before she looked down it was definitely her in clever merciless caricature her eyes were slanted exaggerated almost predatory her cheekbones an aristocratic slash her chin a stubborn point with her mouth just parted and her head tilted back hed given her the expression of royalty mildly displeased gennie studied it for a full ten seconds before she burst into delighted laughter you pig she said and laughed again i look like im about to have a minion beheaded he might have been saved if shed gotten angry been insulted then he could have written her off as vain and humorless and not worth his notice at least he could have tried now with her laughter bouncing on the air and her eyes alive with it grant stepped off the cliff gennie he murmured her name as his hand reached up to touch her face her laughter died what she would have said if her throat hadnt closed she didnt know she thought the air went very still very suddenly the only movement seemed to be the fingers that brushed the hair back from her face the only sound her own uneven breath when he lowered his face toward hers she didnt move but waited he hesitated though the pause was too short to measure before he touched his mouth to hers gentle questioning it sent a line of fire down her spine for him too she realized as his fingers tightened briefly convulsively on her neck before they relaxed again he must be feeling as she did that sudden urgent thrust of power that was followed by a dazed kind of weakness floating were people meant to float like this limitless mindless how could she have known one mans lips could bring such an endless variety of sensations when touched to hers perhaps shed never been kissed before and only thought she had perhaps she had only imagined another man casually brushing her mouth with his because this was real she could taste warm breath she could feel lips soft yet firm and knowing she could smell that subtle scent on him that meant wind and sea she could see his face blurred and close when her lashes drifted up to assure her and when he moaned her name she heard him her answer was to melt slowly luxuriously against him with the melting came a pain unexpected and sharp enough to make her tremble how could there be pain she wondered dazedly when her body was so truly at peace yet it came again on a wave that rocked her some lucid part of her mind reminded her that love hurt but no she tried to shake off the pain and the knowledge it brought her even as her lips clung to his she wasnt falling in love not now not with him that wasnt what she wanted what did she want him the answer came so clearly so simply it drove her into panic grant no she drew away but the hand on her face slid to the back of her neck and held her still no what his voice was very quiet with rough edges i didnt intend we shouldnt be i didnt oh she shut her eyes frustrated that she could be reduced to stammering confusion why dont you run that by me again the trace of humor in his voice had her springing to her feet she wasnt lightheaded she told herself shed simply sat too long and rose too quickly look this is hardly the place for this kind of thing what kind of thing he countered rising too but with a lazy ease that moved muscle by muscle we were only kissing thats more popular than making friendly conversation kissing yous become a habit he reached out for her hair then let it drift through his spread fingers i dont break them easily in this case she paused to even her breathing i think you should make an exception he studied her trying to make light of something that had struck him down to the bone youre quite a mix genvieve the practiced seductress one minute the confused virgin the next you know how to fascinate a man pride moved automatically to shield her some men are more easily fascinated than others true enough grant wasnt sure just what emotion was working through him but he knew it wasnt comfortable damn if i wont be glad to see the last of you he muttered listening to the sound of his retreating footsteps gennie bent to pick up her sketchbook by some malicious coincidence it had fallen open to grants face gennie scowled at it and ill be glad to see the last of you she closed the book made a business of brushing off her jeans and started to leave the churchyard with quiet dignity the hell with it grant she raced down the steps to the sidewalk and tore after him grant wait with every sign of impatience he turned and did so what a little breathless she stopped in front of him and wondered what it was she wanted to say no she didnt want to see the last of him if she didnt understand why yet she felt she was at least entitled to a little time to find out truce she decided and held out a hand when he only stared at her she gave a quick huff and swallowed another morsel of pride please trapped by the single word he took the offered hand all right when she would have drawn her hand away he tightened his grip why i dont know gennie told him with fresh impatience just a wild urge to see if i can get along with an ogre at the ironic lift of his brow she sighed all right that was just a quick slip i take it back idly he twisted the thin gold chain she wore around his finger so what now what now indeed gennie thought as even the brush of his knuckles had her skin humming she wasnt going to give in to it but she wasnt going to jump like a scared rabbit either listen i owe you a meal she said impulsively ill pay you back that way well have a clean slate how ill cook you dinner youve already cooked me breakfast that was your food gennie pointed out already planning things out she looked past him into town ill need to pick up a few things grant studied her considering you going to bring them to the lighthouse oh no she thought immediately she knew better than to trust herself with him there that close to the sea and the power to my cottage theres a little brick barbecue out back if you like steaks whats going on in her mind he wondered as he watched secret thoughts flicker in her eyes he knew hed never be able to resist finding out ive been known to choke down a bite or two in my time okay she gave a decisive nod and took his hand lets go shopping wait a minute grant began as she pulled him down the sidewalk oh dont start complaining already where do i buy the steaks bayside grant said dryly and brought her up short oh grinning at her expression he draped an arm around her shoulder once in a while leemans market gets in a few good cuts of meat gennie shot him a suspicious look from where still grinning grant pushed open the market door i love a mystery gennie wasnt certain she was amused until she found there was indeed a steak only one but sizable enough for two people and that it was from a nearby farm authorized and licensed satisfied with this and a bag of fresh salad greens gennie drew grant outside again okay now where can i buy a bottle of wine fairfields he suggested he carries the only spirits in town if youre not too particular about the label as they started across the road a boy biked by shooting grant a quick look before he ducked his chin on his chest and pedaled away one of your admirers gennie asked dryly i chased him and three of his friends off the cliffs a few weeks back youre a real sport grant only grinned remembering his first reaction had been fury at having his peace interrupted then fear that the four careless boys would break their necks on the rocks ayah he said recalling with pleasure the acid tonguelashing hed doled out do you really kick sick dogs she asked as she caught the gleam in his eye only on my own land heaving a hefty sigh gennie pushed open the door of fairfields store across the room will immediately dropped the large pot hed been about to stock on a shelf red to the tips of his ears he left it where it was help you his voice cracked painfully on the last word i need a bag of charcoal gennie told him as she crossed the room and a bottle of wine charcoals in the back he managed then took a step in retreat as gennie came closer his elbow caught a stack of cans and sent them crashing what what size torn between laughter and sympathy gennie swallowed five poundsll be fine ill get it the boy disappeared and gennie caught fairfields voice demanding what the devil ailed him before she was forced to press a hand to her mouth to hold back the laughter thinking of macintoshs reaction to veronica grant felt a wave of empathy poor kids going to be mooning like a puppy for a month did you have to smile at him really grant he cant be more than fifteen old enough to break out in a sweat he commented hormones she murmured as she found fairfields sparse selection of wine they just need time to balance grants gaze drifted down and focused as she bent over it should only take thirty or forty years he muttered gennie found a domestic burgundy and plucked it from the bottom shelf looks like we feast after all will came back with a bag of charcoal and almost managed not to trip over his own feet brought you some starter too in case he broke off as his tongue tied itself into knots oh thanks gennie set the wine on the counter and reached for her wallet you gotta be of age to buy the wine will began gennies smile widened and his blush deepened guess you are huh unable to resist gennie gestured to grant he is enraptured will stared at gennie until she gently asked what the total was he came to long enough to punch out numbers on the little adding machine send it into clanking convulsions and begin again it be fiveohseven with a long sigh escaped tax gennie resisted the urge to pat his cheek and counted out the change into his damp palm thank you will wills fingers closed over the nickel and two pennies yes maam for the first time the boys eyes left gennies grant was struck with a look of such awe and envy he wasnt sure whether to preen or apologize in a rare gesture of casual affection he reached over and squeezed wills shoulder makes a man want to sit up and beg doesnt she he murmured when gennie reached the door will sighed ayah before grant could turn will plucked at his sleeve you gonna have dinner with her and everything grant lifted a brow but managed to keep his composure everything he reminded himself meant different things to different people at the moment it conjured up rather provocative images in his brain things are presently unsettled he murmured using one of macintoshs stock phrases catching himself he grinned yeah were going to have dinner and something he added as he strolled out after gennie what was all that about she demanded man talk oh i beg your pardon the way she said it very antebellum and disdainful made him laugh and pull her into his arms to kiss her in full view of all of windy point as the embrace lingered on grant caught the muffled crash from inside fairfields poor will he murmured i know just how he feels humor flashed into his eyes again i better start around in the boat if were going to have dinner and everything confused by his uncharacteristic lightheartedness gennie gave him a long stare all right she said after a moment ill meet you there chapter six contents prev next it was foolish to feel like a girl getting ready for a date gennie told herself that as she unlocked the door to the cottage shed told herself the same thing as shed driven away from town and as shed turned down the quiet lane it was a spur of the moment cookout two adults a steak and a bottle of burgundy that may or may not have been worth the price a person would have to look hard to find any romance in charcoal lighter fluid and some freshly picked greens from a patch in the backyard not for the first time gennie thought it a pity her imagination was so expansive it had undoubtedly been imagination that had brought on that rush of feeling in the churchyard a little unexpected tenderness a soft breeze and she heard bells silly gennie set the bags on the kitchen counter and wished shed bought candles candlelight would make even that tidy practical little kitchen seem romantic and if she had a radio there could be music catching herself gennie rolled her eyes to the ceiling what was she thinking of shed never had any patience with such obvious conventional trappings in the first place and in the second place she didnt want a romance with grant shed go halfway toward making a friendship a very careful friendship with him but that was it shed cook dinner for him because she owed him that much theyd have conversation because she found him interesting despite the thorns and shed make very very certain she didnt end up in his arms again whatever part of her longed for a repeat of what had happened between them in the churchyard would have to be overruled by common sense grant campbell was not only basically unpleasant he was just too complicated gennie considered herself too complex a person to be involved with anyone who had so many layers to him gennie grabbed the bag of charcoal and the starter and went into the side yard to set the grill it was so quiet she mused looking around as she ripped the bag open shed hear grant coming long before she saw him it was the perfect time for a ride on the water with the late afternoon shadows lengthening and the heat draining from the day the light was bland as milk now and as soothing she could hear the light lapslap of water against the pier and the rustle of insects in the high grass on the bank then barely she heard the faint putt of a distant motor her nerves gathered together so quickly gennie nearly dropped the five pounds of briquettes on the ground when shed finished being exasperated with herself she laughed and poured a neat pile of charcoal into the barbecue pit so this was the coolly sophisticated genvieve grandeau she thought wryly established member of the art world and genteel new orleans society about to drop five pounds of charcoal on her toes because a rude man was going to have dinner with her how the mighty have fallen with a grin she rolled the bag up and dropped it on the ground so what she asked herself before she strolled down to the pier to wait for him grant took the turn into the inlet at a speed that sent water spraying high laughing gennie stretched on her toes and waved wishing he were already there she hadnt realized not until just that moment how much shed dreaded spending the evening alone and yet there was no one she wanted to spend it with but him hed infuriate her before it was over she was certain she was looking forward to it he cut back the motor so that it was a grumble instead of a roar then guided the boat alongside the pier when the engine shut off completely silence snapped back water lapping and wind in high grass when are you going to take me for a ride gennie demanded when he tossed her a line grant stepped lightly onto the pier and watched as she deftly secured the boat was i going to maybe you werent but you are now straightening she brushed her hands on the back of her jeans i was thinking about renting a little rowboat for the inlet but id much rather go out to sea a rowboat he grinned trying to imagine her manning oars i grew up on a river she reminded him sailings in my blood is that so idly grant took her hand turning it over to examine the palm it was smooth and soft and strong this doesnt look as if its hoisted too many mainsails ive done my share for no reason other than she wanted to gennie locked her fingers with his thereve always been seamen in my family my greatgreatgrandfather was a freelancer a pirate intrigued grant caught the tip of her hair in his hand then twirled a lock around his finger i get the feeling you think more of that than the counts and dukes scattered through your family tree naturally almost anyone can find an aristocrat somewhere if they look hard enough and he was a very good pirate goodhearted successful she corrected with a wicked smile he was almost sixty when he retired in new orleans my grandmother lives in the house he built there with money plucked from hapless merchants grant finished grinning again the seas a lawless place gennie said with a shrug you take your chances you might get what you want now she grinned as well or you could get your head lopped off it might be smarter to keep you landlocked grant murmured then tugging on the hair he held brought her closer gennie put a hand to his chest for balance but found her fingers straying up his mouth was tempting very tempting as it lowered toward hers it would be smarter to resist she knew but she rose on her toes to meet it with her own with barely any pressure he kept his lips on hers as if unsure of his moves unsure just how deeply he dared plunge this time he could have swept her against him she could have drawn him closer with no more than a sigh yet both of them kept that slight tangible distance between them as a barrier or a safety hatch it was still early enough for them to fight the current that was drawing them closer and closer to the point of no return they moved apart at the same moment and took a small perceptible step back id better light the charcoal gennie said after a moment i didnt ask before grant began as they started down the pier but do you know how to cook one of those things my dear mr campbell gennie said in a fluid drawl you appear to have several misconceptions about southern women i can cook on a hot rock and wash shirts in a fast stream every bit as well as you could gennie tossed back you might have some advantage on me in mechanical areas but id say were about even otherwise a strike for the womans movement gennie narrowed her eyes are you about to say something snide and unintelligent no picking up the can of starter fluid he handed it to her as a sex youve had a legitimate gripe for several hundred years which has been handled one way as a group and another individually unfortunately theres still a number of doors that have to be battered down by women as a whole while the individual woman occasionally unlocks one with hardly a sound ever hear of winnie winkle fascinated despite herself gennie simply stared at him as in wee willie grant laughed and leaned against the side of the barbecue no winnie winkle the breadwinner a cartoon strip from the twenties it touched on womens liberation several decades before it became a household word got a match hmmm gennie dug in her pocket wasnt that a bit before your time i did some research on social commentary in college really again she sensed a grain of truth that only hinted at the whole gennie lit the soaked charcoal then stepped back as the fire caught and flames rose where did you go grant caught the first whiff a summer smell he associated with his childhood georgetown theyve an excellent art department there gennie said thoughtfully yeah you did study art there gennie persisted grant watched the smoke rise and the haze of heat that rippled the air why because its obvious from that wicked little caricature you drew of me that you have talent and that youve had training what are you doing with it with what gennie drew her brows together in frustration the talent and the training id have heard of you if you were painting im not he said simply then what are you doing what i want werent you going to make a salad damn it grant all right dont get testy ill make it as he started toward the back door gennie swore again and grabbed his arm i dont understand you he lifted a brow i didnt ask you to he saw the frustration again but more he saw hurt quickly concealed why should he suddenly feel the urge to apologize for his need for privacy gennie let me tell you something in an uncharacteristic gesture he stroked his knuckles gently over her cheek i wouldnt be here right now if i could stay away from you is that enough for you she wanted to say yes and no if she hadnt been afraid of what the words might trigger she would have told him she was already over her head and sinking fast love or perhaps the first stirrings of love that she had felt only a short time before was growing swiftly instead she smiled and slipped her hands into his ill make the salad it was as simple as shed told herself it could be in the kitchen they tossed together the dewy fresh greens and argued over the science of salad making meat smoked and sizzled on the grill while they sat on the grass and enjoyed the last light of the afternoon of one of the last days of summer lazy smells wet weeds cook smoke a few words an easy silence gennie bound them up and held them close knowing theyd be important to her on some rainy day when she was crowded by pressures and responsibilities for now she felt as she had when shed been a girl and august had a few precious days left and school was lightyears away summer always seemed to have more magic near its end enough magic gennie mused to make her fall in love where there was no rhyme or reason whatre you thinking grant asked her she smiled and stretched her head back to the sky one last time that id better tend to that steak he grabbed her arm toppling her onto her back before she could rise uhuh you like it burnt uhuh thats not what you were thinking he corrected he traced a finger over her lips and though the gesture was absent gennie felt the touch in every pore i was thinking about summer she said softly and that it always seems to end before youre finished with it when she lifted her hand to his cheek he took her wrist and held it there the best things always do as he stared down at her she smiled in that slow easy way she had that sent ripples of need flurries of emotion through him all thought fled as he lowered his mouth to hers soft warm ripe her lips answered his then drew and drew until everything he was felt wished for was focused there bewitched beguiled bedazed he went deeper no longer sure what path he was on only that she was with him he could smell the grass beneath them sweet and dry a scent of summer like the smoke that curled above their heads he wanted to touch her every inch of that slimly rounded body that had tormented his dreams since the first moment hed seen her if he did once grant knew his dreams would never be peaceful again if her taste alone wild fruit warm honey could so easily take over his mind what would the feel of her do to him his need for her was like summer or so he told himself it had to end before he was finished lifting his head he looked down to see her eyes faintly slanted barely open without guards shed bring him to his knees with a look cautiously he drew away then pulled her to her feet wed better get that steak off before we have to make do with salad her knees were weak gennie would have sworn such things happened only in fiction yet here she was throbbingly alive with joints that felt like water turning she stabbed the steak with a kitchen fork to lift it to the platter the fats in the fire she murmured i was thinking the same thing myself grant said quietly before they walked back into the house by unspoken agreement they kept the conversation light as they ate whatever each had felt during that short enervating kiss was carefully stored away im not looking for a relationship their minds rationalized separately were not suited to each other in the first place there isnt time for this good god im not falling in love shaken gennie lifted her wine and drank deeply while grant scowled down at his plate hows your steak she asked him for lack of anything else what oh its good pushing away the uncomfortable feeling grant began to eat with more enthusiasm you cook almost as well as you paint he decided whered you learn gennie lifted a brow why at my mammys knee he grinned at the exaggerated drawl youve got a smart mouth genvieve lifting the bottle he poured more wine into the sturdy water glasses shed bought in town i was thinking it odd that a woman who grew up with a house full of servants could grill a steak he grinned thinking of shelby whod considered cooking a last resort in the first place she told him cookouts were always considered a family affair and in the second when you live alone you learn or you live in restaurants he couldnt resist poking at her a bit as he sat back with his wine youve been photographed in or around every restaurant in the free world not to be baited gennie mirrored his pose watching him over the rim as she drank is that why you get a dozen newspapers so you can read how people live while you hibernate grant thought about it a moment yeah he didnt suppose he could have put it better himself dont you consider that an arrogant sort of attitude again he pondered on it studying the dark red wine in his water glass yeah gennie laughed despite herself grant why dont you like people surprised he looked back at her i do individually in some cases and as a whole i just dont want them crowding me he meant it she realized as she rose to stack the plates there was just no understanding him dont you ever have the need to rub elbows listen to a babble of voices hed had his share of elbows and voices before hed been seventeen grant thought ruefully but no he supposed it wasnt quite true there were times he needed a heavy dose of humanity with all its flaws and complications for his work and for himself he thought of his week with the macgregors hed needed that and them though he hadnt fully realized it until hed settled back into his own routine i have my moments he murmured he automatically began to clear the table as gennie ran hot water in the sink no dessert she looked over her shoulder to see that he was perfectly serious he packed away food like a truck driver yet there wasnt an ounce of spare flesh on him nervous energy metabolism with a shake of her head gennie wondered why she persisted in trying to understand him i have a couple of fudge bars in the freezer grant grinned and took her at her word want one he asked as he ripped the thin white paper from the ice cream stick no are you eating that because you want it or because it gets you out of drying these she stacked a plate into the drainer works both ways leaning on the counter he nibbled on the bar i could eat a carton of these when i was a kid gennie rinsed another plate and now grant took a generous bite you only have two a polite man would share yeah he took another bite with a laugh gennie flicked some water into his face come on be a sport he held out the bar pausing a half inch in front of her lips up to her elbows in soapy water gennie opened her mouth grant drew the bar away just out of reach dont get greedy he warned sending him an offended look gennie leaned forward enough to nibble delicately on the chocolate then still watching him took a bite large enough to chill her mouth nasty grant decided frowning at what was left of his fudge bar as gennie laughed you can have the other one she said kindly after shed swallowed and then dried her hands i just dont have any willpower when someone puts chocolate under my nose deliberately grant ran his tongue over the bar any other weaknesses as the heat expanded in her stomach she wandered toward the porch door a few she sighed as the call of swallows announced dusk the days are getting shorter she murmured already the lowering sun had the white clouds edged with pink and gold the smoke from the grill struggled skyward thinning near the bank of the inlet was a scrawny bush its sparse leaves hinting of autumn red when grants hands came to her shoulders she leaned back toward him instinctively together in silence they watched the approach of evening he couldnt remember the last time hed shared a sunset with anyone when hed felt the desire to now it seemed so simple so frighteningly simple would he think of her now whenever he watched the approach of evening tell me about your favorite summer he asked abruptly she remembered a summer spent in the south of france and another on her fathers yacht in the aegean smiling she watched the clouds deepen to rose i stayed with my grandmother for two weeks once while my parents had a second honeymoon in venice long lazy days with bees humming around honeysuckle blossoms there was a big old oak outside my bedroom window just dripping with moss some nights id climb out the window to sit on a branch and look at the stars i must have been twelve she remembered there was a boy down at the stables she laughed suddenly with her back comfortably nestled against grants chest oh lord he was a bit like will all sharp awkward edges you were crazy about him id spend hours mucking out stalls and grooming horses just to get a glimpse of him i wrote pages and pages about him in my diary and one very mushy poem and kept it under your pillow apparently youve had a nodding acquaintance with twelveyearold girls he thought of shelby and grinned resting his chin on the top of her head her hair smelled as though shed washed it with raindrenched wildflowers how long did it take you to get him to kiss you she laughed ten days i thought id discovered the answer to the mysteries of the universe i was a woman no females more sure of that than a twelveyearold she smiled into the dimming sky more than a nodding acquaintance it appears she commented one afternoon i found angela giggling over my diary and chased her all over the house she was gennie stiffened as the grief washed over her wave after tumultuous wave before grant could tighten his hold she had moved away from him to stare through the patched screen into twilight she was ten gennie continued in a whisper i threatened to shave her head if she breathed a word about what was in that diary gennie she shook her head as she felt his hand brush through her hair itll be dark soon you can already hear the crickets you should start back he couldnt bear to hear the tears in her voice it would be easier to leave her now just back away he told himself he had no skill when it came to com foiling his hands massaged gently on her shoulders theres a light on the boat lets sit down ignoring her resistance grant drew her to the porch glider my grandmother had one of these he said conversationally as he slipped an arm around her and set it into creaking motion she had a little place on marylands eastern shore a quiet little spot with land so flat it looked like itd been laid out with a ruler ever been to the chesapeake no deliberately gennie relaxed and closed her eyes the motion was easy his voice curiously soothing she hadnt known he could speak in such quiet gentle tones softshell crabs and fields of tobacco already he could feel the tautness in her shoulders easing we had to take a ferry to get to her house it wasnt much different than this cottage except it was two stories my father and i could go across the street and fish i caught a trout once using a piece of longhorn cheese as bait grant continued to talk ramble really recounting things hed forgotten things hed never spoken of aloud before unimportant things that droned quietly on the air while the light softened for the moment it seemed to be the right thing the thing she needed he wasnt certain he had anything else to give he kept the motion of the glider going while her head rested against his shoulder and wondered how hed never noticed just how peaceful dusk could be when you shared it with someone gennie sighed listening more to his tone than his words she let herself drift as the chirp of crickets grew more insistent dreams are often no more than memories oh gennie you should have been there angela golden and vibrant turned in her seat to laugh while gennie maneuvered through the traffic of downtown new orleans the streets were damp with a chilly february rain but nothing could dampen angela she was sunlight and spring flowers id rather have been there than freezing in new york gennie returned you cant freeze when youre basking in the limelight angela countered twisting a bit closer to her sister wanna bet you wouldnt have missed that showing for a dozen parties no she wouldnt have gennie thought with a smile but angela tell me about it it was so much fun all that noise and music it was so crowded you couldnt take a step without bumping into someone the next time cousin frank throws a bash on his houseboat you have to come gennie sent angela a quick grin it doesnt sound like i was missed angela laughed the quick bubble that was irresistible well i got a little tired of answering questions about my talented sister gennie gave a snort as she stopped at a light she could see the hazy red glow as the windshield wipers moved briskly back and forth they just use that as a line to get to you well there was someone when angela trailed off gennie turned to look at her so beautiful she thought gold and cream with eyes almost painfully alive and vivid someone oh gennie excitement brought a soft pink to her cheeks hes gorgeous i could hardly make a coherent sentence when he started to talk to me you me angela agreed laughing again it felt like someone had drained off half my brain and now well ive been seeing him all week i think tada this is it after a week gennie countered after five seconds oh gennie dont be practical im in love you have to meet him gennie shifted into first as she waited for the light to change do i get to size him up angela shook back her rich gold hair and laughed as the light turned green oh i feel wonderful gennie absolutely wonderful the laugh was the last thing gennie heard before the squeal of brakes she saw the car skidding toward them through the intersection in the dream it was always so slow second by terrifying second closer and closer water spewed out from the tires and seemed to hang in the air there wasnt time to breathe there wasnt time to react or prevent before there was the sound of metal striking metal the explosion of blinding lights terror pain and darkness no she jerked upright rigid with fear and shock there were arms around her holding her close safe crickets where had they come from the light the car angela gasping for breath gennie stared out at the darkened inlet while grants voice murmured something comforting in her ear im sorry pushing away she rose lifting nervous hands to her hair i must have dozed off poor company she continued in a jerky voice you should have given me a jab and gennie he stood grabbing her arm stop it she crumbled he hadnt expected such complete submission and had no defense against it dont he murmured stroking her hair as she clung to him gennie dont cry its all right now oh god it hasnt happened in weeks she buried her face against his chest as the grief washed over her as fresh as the first hour at first right after the accident id go through it every time i closed my eyes come on he kissed the top of her head sit down no i cant i need to walk she held him tight another moment as if gathering her strength can we walk sure bringing her to his side grant opened the screen door for a time he was silent his arm around her shoulders as they skirted the inlet and walked aimlessly but he knew he needed to hear as much as she needed to tell gennie talk to me i was remembering the accident she said slowly but her voice was calmer now sometimes when id dream of it id be quick enough swerve out of the way of that car and everything was so different then id wake up and nothing was different at all its a natural reaction he told her though the thought of her being plagued by nightmares began to gnaw at his gut hed lived through a few of his own theyll fade after a while i know it hardly ever happens anymore she let out a long breath and seemed steadier for it when it does its so clear i can see the rain splattering on the windshield right before the wipers whisk it away therere puddles near the curbs and angelas voice is so vital she was so beautiful grant not just her face but her she never outgrew sweetness she was telling me about a party shed been to where shed met someone she was in love bubbling over with it the last thing she said was that she felt wonderful absolutely wonderful then i killed her grant took her shoulders shaking her hard what the hell kind of craziness is that it was my fault gennie returned with deadly calm if id seen that car if id seen it just seconds earlier or if id done something hit the brakes the gas anything the impact was all on her side i had a mild concussion a few bruises and she would you feel better if youd been seriously injured he demanded roughly you can mourn for her cry for her but you cant take the blame i was driving grant how do i forget that you dont forget it he snapped back unnerved by the dull pain in her voice but you put it in perspective there was nothing you could have done you know that you dont understand she swallowed because the tears were coming and shed thought she was through with them i loved her so much she was part of me a part of me i needed very badly when you lose someone who was vital to your life it takes a chunk out of you he did understand the pain the need to place blame gennie blamed herself for exposing her sister to death grant blamed his father for exposing himself neither way changed the loss then you have to live without that chunk you cant know what its like she began my father was killed when i was seventeen he said saying the words he would rather have avoided i needed him gennie let her head fall against his chest she didnt offer sympathy knowing he wanted none what did you do hated for a long time that was easy without realizing it he was holding her against him again gaining comfort as well as giving it acceptings tougher everyone does it in different ways how did you by realizing there was nothing i could have done to stop it drawing her away a little he lifted her chin with his hand just as there was nothing you could have done its easier isnt it to tell yourself you could have done something than to admit you were helpless hed never thought about it perhaps refused to think about it yeah thank you i know you didnt want to tell me that even more than i didnt want to tell you we can get very selfish with our grief and our guilt he brushed the hair away from her temples he kissed her cheeks where tears were still drying and felt a surge of tenderness that left him shaken defenseless she made him vulnerable if he kissed her now really kissed her shed have complete power over him with more effort than hed realized it would take grant drew away from her i have to get back he said deliberately putting his hands in his pockets will you be all right yes but id like you to stay the words were out before she realized shed thought them but she wouldnt take them back something flared in his eyes even in the dim light she saw it desire need and something quickly banked and shuttered not tonight the tone had her brows drawing together in puzzlement grant she began and reached for him not tonight he repeated stopping the motion of her outstretched hand gennie put it behind her back as if hed slapped it all right her pride surged forward to cover the hurt of fresh rejection i appreciated the company turning she started back to the house grant watched her go then swore taking a step after her gennie good night grant the screen door swung shut behind her chapter seven contents prev next she was going to lose it gennie cast a furious look at the clouds whipping in from the north and swore damn she was going to lose the light and she wasnt ready the energy was pouring through her flowing from her mind and heart to her hand in one of the rare moments an artist recognizes as right everything everything told her that something lasting something important would spring onto the canvas that morning she had only to let herself go with it but to go with it now she had to race against the storm gennie knew she had perhaps thirty minutes before the clouds would spoil her light an hour before the rain closed out everything already a distant thunder rumbled over the sound of crashing waves she cast a defiant look at the sky by god she would beat it yet the impetus was with her an urgency that said today its going to happen today whatever shed done before the sketches the preliminary work the spread of paint on canvas was just a preparation for what she would create today excitement rippled across her skin with the wind and a frustration she seemed to need them both to draw from maybe a storm was brewing in her as well it had seemed so since the night before when her mood had fluctuated and twisted with grant without him the last rejection had left her numb ominously calm now her emotions were raging free again fury passion pride and torment gennie could pour them into her art liberating them so that they wouldnt fester inside her need him no she needed neither him nor anyone she told herself as she streaked her brush over the canvas her work was enough to fill her life cleanse her wounds it was always fresh always constant as long as her eyes could see and her fingers could lift pencil or brush it would be with her it had been her friend during her childhood a solace during the pangs of adolescence it was as demanding as a lover and as greedy for her passion and it was passion she felt now a vibrant physical passion that drove her forward the moment was ripe and the electricity in the air only added to the sense of urgency that shimmered inside her now it shouted at her the time for merging soul and heart and mind was now if not now it would be never the clouds raced closer she vowed to beat them skin cool with anticipation blood hot grant came outside like a wolf hed scented something in the air and had come in search of it hed been too restless to work to tense too relax something had been driving at him all morning urging him to move to look to find hed told himself it was the approach of the storm the lack of sleep but hed known without understanding that each of those things was only a part of the whole something was brewing brewing in more than that cauldron of a sky he was hungry without wanting to eat dissatisfied without knowing what he would change restless reckless hed fretted against the confines of his studio all walls and glass instinct had led him out to seek the wind and the sea and gennie hed known shed be there though hed been convinced that hed closed his mind to even the thought of her but now seeing her he was struck just as surely as the north sky was struck with the first silver thread of lightning hed never seen her like this but hed known she stood with her head thrown back in abandon to her work her eyes glowing green with power there was a wildness about her only partially due to the wind that swept up her hair and billowed the thin smock she wore there was strength in the hand that guided the brush so fluidly and yet with such purpose she might have been a queen overlooking her dominion she might have been a woman waiting for a lover as his blood quickened with need grant thought she was both where was the woman whod wept in his arms only hours before where was the fragility the defenselessness that had terrified him hed given her what comfort he could though he knew little of soothing tearful women hed spoken of things he hadnt said aloud in fifteen years because shed needed to hear them and he for some indefinable reason had needed to say them and hed left her because hed felt himself being sucked into something unknown and inevitable now she looked invulnerable magnificent this was a woman no man would ever resist a woman who could choose and discard lovers with a single gesture it wasnt fear he felt now but challenge and with the challenge a desire so huge it threatened to swallow him she stopped painting on a roll of thunder then looked up to the sky in a kind of exaltation he heard her laugh once with an arousing defiance that had him struggling with a fresh slap of desire who in gods name was she he demanded and why in heaven and hell couldnt he stay away the excitement that had driven her to finish the painting lingered it was done gennie thought with a breathless triumph and yet there was something more her passion hadnt been diffused by the consummation of woman and art but spun in her still restless waiting then she saw him with the sea and the storm at his back the wind blew wilder her blood pounded with it for a long moment they only stared at each other while thunder and lightning inched closer ignoring him and the flash of heat that demanded she close the distance between them gennie turned back to the canvas this and only this was what called to her she told herself this and only this was what she needed grant watched her pack her paints and brushes there was something both regal and defiant about the way she had turned her back on him and gone about her business yet there was no denying that jolt of recognition he had felt when their gazes had locked under his feet the ground shook with the next roll of thunder he went to her the light shifted dimming as clouds rolled over the sun the air was so charged sparks could be felt along the skin gennie packed up her gear with deft steady hands shed beaten the storm that morning she could beat anything genvieve she wasnt gennie now hed seen gennie in the churchyard laughing with young fresh delight it had been gennie who had clung to him weeping this womans laugh would be low and seductive and she would shed no tears at all whichever whoever she was grant was drawn to her irrevocably grant gennie closed the lid on her paint case before she turned youre out early youve finished yes the wind blew his hair wildly around his face and while the face was set his eyes were dark and restless gennie knew her own emotions matched his like two halves of the same coin ive finished youll go now he could see the flush of triumph on her face and the moody unpredictable green of her eyes from here she tossed her head as her gaze shifted to the sea the waves were swelling higher and no boat dared test them now yes i have other things i want to paint it was what he wanted hadnt he wanted to be rid of her from the very first but grant said nothing as the grumbling thunder rolled closer youll have your solitude back gennies smile was light and mocking thats whats most important to you isnt it and ive gotten what i needed here his eyes narrowed but he wasnt certain of the origin of his temper have you have a look she invited with a gesture of her hand he hadnt wanted to see the painting had deliberately avoided even a glance at it now her eyes dared him and the flick of her wrist was too insolent to deny hooking his thumbs in his pockets grant turned toward the canvas she saw too much of what he needed there what he felt the power of limitless sea the glory of space and unending challenge shed scorned muted colors and had chosen bold shed forsaken delicacy for muscle what had been a blank canvas was now as full of force as the turbulent atlantic and as full of secrets the secrets there were natures as the strength and solidity of the lighthouse were mans shed captured both pitting them against each other even while showing their timeless harmony the painting moved him disturbed him pulled at him as much as its creator gennie felt the tension build up at the base of her neck as grant only frowned at the painting she knew it was everything shed wanted it to be felt it was perhaps the best work shed ever done but it was his his world his force his secrets that had dominated the emotions shed felt when shed painted it even as shed finished the painting had stopped being hers and had become his grant took a step away from the painting and looked out to sea the lightning was closer he saw it shimmer dangerously behind the dark angry clouds he seemed to have lost the words the phrases that had always come so easily to him he couldnt think of anything but her and the need that had risen up to work knots in his stomach its fine he said flatly he could have struck her and hurt her no less her small gasp was covered by the moan of the wind for a moment gennie stared at his back while pain rocketed through her rejection would she never stop setting herself up for his rejection pain altered to anger in the space of seconds she didnt need his approval his pleasure his understanding she had everything she needed within herself in raging silence she slipped the canvas into its carrying case then folded her easel gathering her things together she turned toward him slowly before i go id like to tell you something her voice was cool over flowing vowels it isnt often one finds ones first impression was so killingly accurate the first night i met you i thought you were a rude arrogant man with no redeeming qualities the wind blew her hair across her eyes and with a toss of her head she sent it flying back so that she could keep her icy gaze on his its very gratifying to learn just how right i was and to be able to dislike you so intensely chin high gennie turned and walked to her car she jerked up the trunk of her car and put her equipment and canvas in perversely glad to flow with the fury that consumed her when grants hand closed over her arm she slammed the trunk closed and whirled around ready to battle on any terms any grounds blind with her own emotions she didnt notice the heat in his eyes or the raggedness of his breathing do you think im just going to let you walk away he demanded do you think you can walk into my life and take and not leave anything behind her chest was heaving her eyes brilliant with calculated disdain she looked down at the ringers that circled her arm take your hand off me she told him spacing her words with insolent precision lightning shot across the sky as they stared at each other cold white heat against boiling gray and angry purple the deafening roar of thunder drowned out grants oath the moment stood poised crackling then swirled like the wind that screamed in triumph you should have taken my advice he said between his teeth and stuck with your counts and barons then he was pulling her across the tough grass against the wind what the hell do you think youre doing what i should have done the minute you barged into my life murder gennie stared at the cliffs and the raging sea below god knew he looked ready for it at that moment and perhaps he would have liked her to believe he was capable of tossing her over the edge but she knew what the violence in him meant where it would lead them both she fought him wildly as he pulled her toward the lighthouse you must be mad let me go i must be he agreed tightly lightning forked again opening the sky rain spewed out i said take your hands off me he whirled to her then his face sculptured and shadowed in the crazed light of the storm its too late for that he shouted at her damn it you know it as well as i do it was too late from the first minute rain poured over them pounding and warm i wont be dragged into your bed do you hear me she grabbed his soaking shirt with her free hand while her body vibrated with fury and with wanting i wont be dragged anywhere do you think you can just suddenly decide you need a lover and haul me off his breath was raging in and out of his lungs the rain pouring down his face only accented the passionate darkness of his eyes she was sleek and wet a siren maybe she was but hed already wrecked on the reef not any lover he swung her against him so that their wet clothes fused then seemed to melt away you damn it gennie you know its you their faces were close their eyes locked each had forgotten the storm around them as the tempest within took over heart pounded against heart need pounded against need full of fear and triumph she threw her head back show me grant crushed her closer so that not even the wind could have forced its way between here he said roughly by god here and now his mouth took hers madly and she answered unleashed the passion drove them far past sanity beyond the civilized and into the dark tunnel of chaotic desire his lips sped across her face seeking to devour all that could be consumed and more when his teeth scraped over the cord of her neck gennie moaned and drew him with her to the ground raw keening wind hard driving rain the pound and crash of the stormy sea they were nothing in the face of this tempest grant forgot them as he pressed against her feeling every line and curve as though hed already torn the clothes from her her heart pounded it seemed as if it had worked its way inside his chest to merge with his her body felt like a furnace he hadnt known there could be such heat from a living thing but alive she was moving under him hands seeking mouth greedy the rain sluicing over them should have cooled the fire yet it stoked it higher so that the water might have sizzled on contact he knew only greed only ageless need and primitive urges shed bewitched him from the first instant and now at last he succumbed her hands were in his hair bringing his mouth back to hers again and again so that her lips could leave him breathless arouse more hunger they rolled on the wet grass until she was on top of him her mouth ravaging his with a strength and power only he could match in a frenzy she dragged at his shirt yanking and tugging until it was over his head and discarded with a long low moan she ran her hands over him grants reason shattered roughly he pushed her on her back cutting off her breath as lightning burst overhead ignoring buttons he pulled the blouse from her desperate to touch what he had denied himself for days his hands slid over her wet skin kneading possessing hurrying in his greed for more and when she arched against him agile and demanding he buried his mouth at her breast and lost himself he tasted the rain on her laced with summer thunder and her own night scent like a drowning man he clung to her as he sank beneath the depths he knew what it was to want a woman but not like this desire could be controlled channeled guided so what was it that pounded in him his fingers bruised her but he was unaware in his desperation to take all and take it quickly when he dragged the jeans down her hips he felt both arousal and frustration as they clung to her skin and those smooth narrow curves struggling with the wet denim he followed its inching progress with his mouth thrilling as gennie arched and moaned his teeth scraped over her hip down her thigh to the inside of her knee as he pulled the jeans down her then left them in a heap mindlessly he plunged his tongue into her and heard her cry out with the wind heat suffused him rain fell on his back unfelt ran from his hair onto her skin but did nothing to wash away the passion that drove them both closer and closer to the peak then they were both fighting with his jeans hands tangling together while their lips fused again the sounds coming low from her throat might have been his name or some new spell she was weaving over him he no longer cared lightning illuminated her face once brilliantly the slash of cheekbone the eyes slanted and nearly closed the soft full lips parted and trembling with her breathing at that moment she was witch and he willingly bewitched with his mouth against the hammering pulse in her throat he plunged into her taking her with a violent kind of worship he didnt understand when she stiffened and cried out grant struggled to find both his sanity and the reason then she was wrapped around him drawing him into the satincoated darkness breathless dazed empty grant lay with his face buried in gennies hair the rain still fell but until that moment he didnt realize that it had lost its force the storm was passed consumed by itself like all things of passion he felt the hammertrip beat of her heart beneath him and her trembles shutting his eyes he tried to gather his strength and the control that meant lucidity oh god his voice was rough and raw the apology wouldnt come he thought it less than useless why didnt you tell me he murmured as he rolled from her to lie on his back against the wet grass damn it gennie why didnt you tell me she kept her eyes closed so that the rain fell on her lids over her face and throbbing body was this how it was supposed to be she wondered should she feel so spent so enervated while her skin hummed everywhere everywhere his hand had touched it should she feel as though every lock she had had been bro ken by whom him or her it didnt matter but her privacy was gone and the need for it yet now hearing the harsh question accusation she felt a ripple of pain sharper than the loss of innocence she said nothing gennie you let me think you were what she demanded opening her eyes the clouds were still dark she saw but the lightning was gone cursing himself grant dragged a hand through his hair gennie you should have told me you hadnt been with a man before and how was it possible he wondered that shed let no man touch her before that he was the first the only why she said flatly wishing he would go wishing she had the strength to leave it was my business swearing he shifted leaning over her his eyes were dark and angry but when she tried to pull away he pinned her i dont have much gentleness he told her and the words were unsteady with feeling but i would have used all i had i would have tried to find more for you when she only stared at him grant lowered his forehead to hers gennie her doubts her fears melted at that one softly murmured word i wasnt looking for gentleness then she whispered framing his face with her hands she lifted it but now she smiled and watched the frown fade from his eyes he dropped a kiss on her lips soft more like a whisper then rising lifted her into his arms gennie laughed at the feeling of weightlessness and ease whatre you doing now taking you inside so you can warm up dry off and make love with me again maybe not in that order gennie curled her arms around his neck im beginning to like your ideas what about our clothes we can salvage whats left of them later he pushed open the door of the lighthouse we wont be needing them for quite a while definitely liking your ideas she pressed her mouth against his throat are you really going to carry me up those stairs yeah gennie cast a look at the winding staircase and tightened her hold id just like to mention it wouldnt be terribly romantic if you were to trip and drop me the woman casts aspersions on my machismo on your balance she corrected as he started up she shivered as her wet skin began to chill then abruptly laughed grant did it occur to you what those assorted piles of clothes would look like if someone happened by theyd probably look a great deal like what they are he considered and it should discourage anyone from trespassing i should have thought of it before much better than a killerdog sign she sighed partially from relief as they reached the landing youre hopeless anyone would think you were clark kent grant stopped in the doorway to the bathroom to stare at her come again you know concealing a secret identity though youre anything but mildmannered she added as she toyed with a damp curl that hung over his ear youve set up this lighthouse as some kind of fortress of solitude the long intense look continued what was clark kents earth mothers name is this a quiz do you know she arched a brow because his eyes were so suddenly serious martha ill be damned he murmured he laughed then gave her a quick kiss that was puzzlingly friendly considering they were naked and pressed together you continue to surprise me genvieve i think im crazy about you the light words went straight to her heart and turned it over because i know supermans adoptive mothers first name grant nuzzled his cheek against her the first wholly sweet gesture shed ever seen in him in that one instant she was lost as shed never been lost before for one thing feeling her tremble grant drew her closer come on into the shower youre freezing he stepped into the tub before he set her down then still holding her close pressed his mouth to hers in a long lingering kiss with the storm with the passion shed felt invulnerable now no longer innocent no longer unaware the nerves returned only a short time before she had given herself to him perhaps demanded that he take her but now she could only cling while her mind reeled with the wonder of it when the water came on full and hot she jolted gasping with a low laugh grant stroked a hand intimately over her hip feel good it did after the initial shock but gennie tilted back her head and eyed him narrowly you might have warned me lifes full of surprises like falling in love she thought when you hadnt the least intention of doing so gennie smiled finding her arms had wound around his neck you know he traced his tongue lightly over her mouth im getting used to the taste and the feel of you wet its tempting just to stay right here for the next couple of hours she nuzzled against him when he ran his hands down her back strong hands toughened in contrast to the elegance of their shape there were no others she could ever imagine touching her with the steam rising around him and gennie soft and giving in his arms grant felt that rushing heady desire building again his muscles contracted with it tightening preparing no not this time he murmured pressing his mouth to her throat this time he would remember her fragility and the wonder of being the only man to ever possess her whatever tenderness he had or could find in himself would be for her you should dry off he nibbled lightly at her lips before he drew her away she was smiling but her eyes were uncertain as he turned off the water he tried to ignore the very real fear her vulnerability brought to him taking a towel from the rack he stroked it over her face here lift your arms she did laying her hands on his shoulders as he wrapped the towel around her slowly running soft undemanding kisses over her face he drew the towel together to knot it loosely at her breasts gennie closed her eyes the better to soak up the sensation of being pampered using a fresh towel grant began to dry her hair gently lazily while her heart began to race he rubbed the towel over it warm he murmured dipping his head to nibble at her ear youre trembling how could she answer when her heart was hammering in her throat heat was creeping into her yet her body shivered with anticipation uncertainties longings he had only to touch his mouth to hers to know that for that moment for always she was his i want you he said softly i wanted you right from the start he skimmed his tongue over her ear you knew that yes the word came out breathlessly like a sigh do you know how much more i want you now than i did even an hour ago his mouth covered hers before she could answer come to bed gennie he didnt carry her but took her hand so that they could walk together into the thin gray light of his room her pulses pounded the first time there had been no thought no doubts desire had ruled her and the power had flowed now her mind was clear and her nerves jumping she knew now where he could take her with a touch with a taste the journey was as much feared as it was craved grant but he barely touched her only cupping her face as they stood beside the bed youre beautiful his eyes were on hers intense searching the first time i saw you you took my breath away you still do as moved by the long look and soft words as she had been by the tempestuous kisses she reached up to take his wrists i dont need the words unless you want to give them i just want to be with you whatever i tell you will be the truth or i wont tell you at all he leaned toward her touching his mouth to hers but nibbling only testing the softness lingering over that honeysteeped taste as he took her deep with tenderness his fingers moved over her face skimming stroking gennies head went light while her body grew heavy she barely felt the movement when they lowered to the bed then it seemed she felt everything the tiny nubs in the bedspread the not quite smooth not quite rough texture of grants palms the thin mat of hair on his chest all she felt them all as if her skin had suddenly become as soft and sensitive as a newborns and he treated her as though she were that precious with the slow whisperlight kisses he brushed over her face and the hands that touched her arousing but stopping just short of demand the floating weightlessness she had experienced in the churchyard drifted back over her but now with the shivering excitement of knowledge aware of where they could lead each other gennie sighed this time the journey would be luxurious lazy and loving the light through the window was thin misty gray from the clouds that still hid the sun it cast shadows and mysteries she could hear the sea not the deafening titanic roar but the echo and the promise of power and when he murmured to her it was like the sea with its passionate pull and thrust the urgency she had felt before had become a quiet enjoyment though the needs were no less there was a comfort here an unquestioning trust shed never expected to feel he would protect if she needed him cherish in his own fashion beneath the demands and impatience was a man who would give unselfishly where he cared discovering that was discovering everything touch me dont ever stop touching me and he seemed to hear her silent request as he caressed lingered explored the pleasure was liquid and light like a lazy river like rain misting her mind was so clouded with him only him she no longer thought of her body as separate but a part of the two that made one whole soft murmurs and quiet sighs the warmth that only flesh can bring to flesh gennie learned of him the man he showed so rarely to anyone sensitivity because it was not his way was all the sweeter gentleness so deeply submerged was all the more arousing she hardly knew when her pliancy began to kindle to excitement but he did the subtle change in her movements her breathing had a shiver of pleasure darting down his spine and he drew yet more pleasure in the mere watching of her face in the gloomy light a flicker of passion reminded him that no one had ever touched her as he did and no one would for so long hed taken such care not to allow anyone to get too close to block off any feelings of possession to avoid being possessed though the proprietary sensation disturbed him he couldnt fight it she was his grant told himself it didnt yet mean he was hers yet he could think of no one else he ran kisses over her slowly until his mouth brushed then loitered at her shoulder and when he felt her yield completely unquestioningly he took her once gasping to the edge on her moan he pressed his lips to hers wanting to feel the sound as well as hear it mindless boneless burning gennie moved with him responding to the agonizingly slow pace by instinct alone she wanted to rush she wanted to stay in that cloudy world of dreams forever now and only now did she fully understand why the coming together of two separate beings was called making love she opened to him offering everything when he slipped inside her she felt his shudder heard the groan that was muffled against her throat his breath rasped against her ear but he kept the pace exquisitely slow there couldnt be so much shed never known there could be but he showed her she drifted down a tunnel with soft melting edges deeper and lusher it grew until her whole existence was bound there in the velvet heat that promised forever reason peeled away layer by layer so that her body was guided by senses alone he was trembling was she as her hands glided over his shoulders she could feel the hard tense muscles there while his movements were gentle and easy through the mists of pleasure she knew he was blocking off his own needs for hers a wave of emotion struck her that was a hundred times greater than passion grant his name was only a whisper as her arms tightened around him now take me now gennie he lifted his face so that she had a glimpse of dark dark eyes before his mouth met hers his control seemed to snap at the contact and he swallowed her gasps as he rushed with her to the peak there were no more thoughts nor the need for any chapter eight contents prev next with a slow stretch and a long sigh gennie woke ingrained habit woke her early and quickly her first feeling of disorientation faded almost at once no the sunwashed window wasnt hers but she knew whose it was she knew where she was and why the morning warmth had a new texture body to body man to woman lover to lover simultaneous surges of contentment and excitement swam through her to chase away any sense of drowsiness turning her head gennie watched grant sleep he sprawled taking up gennie discovered to her amusement about threefourths of the bed during the night he had nudged her to within four inches of the edge his arm was tossed carelessly across her body not loverlike she thought wryly but because she just happened to be in his space he had most of her pillow against the plain white his face was deeply tanned shadowed by the stubble that grew on his jaw looking at him gennie realized he was completely relaxed as she had seen him only once before on their walk along the beach what drives you grant she wondered as she gave in to the desire to toy with the tips of his rumpled hair what makes you so intense so solitary and why do i want so badly to understand and share whatever secrets you keep with a fingertip carefully delicately gennie traced down the line of his jaw a strong face she thought almost hard and yet occasionally unexpectedly the humor and sensitivity would come into his eyes then the hardness would vanish and only the strength would remain rude remote arrogant he was all of those things and she loved him despite it perhaps because of it it had been the gentleness he had shown her that had allowed her to admit it accept it but it had been true all along she longed to tell him to say those simple exquisite words shed shared her body with him given her innocence and her trust now she wanted to share her emotions love she believed was meant to be given freely without conditions yet she knew him well enough to understand that step would have to be taken by him first his nature demanded it another man might be flattered pleased even relieved to have a woman state her feelings so easily grant gennie reflected would feel cornered lying still watching him she wondered if it had been a woman who had caused him to isolate himself gennie felt certain it had been pain or disillusionment that had made him so determined to be unapproachable there was a basic kindness in him which he hid a talent he apparently wasnt using and a warmth he hoarded why with a sigh she brushed the hair from his forehead they were his mysteries she only hoped she had the patience to wait until he was ready to share them warm content gennie snuggled against him murmuring his name grants answer was an unintelligible mutter as he shifted onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow the movement cost gennie a few more precious inches of mattress hey laughing she shoved against his shoulder move over no response youre a romantic devil gennie thought wryly then pressing her lips to that unbudgeable shoulder slipped out of the bed grant immediately took advantage of all the available space a loner gennie thought studying him as he lay crosswise over the twisted sheets he wasnt a man used to making room for anyone with a last thoughtful glance gennie walked across the hall to shower gradually the sound of running water woke him hazy grant lay still sleepily debating how much effort it would take to open his eyes it was his ingrained habit to put off the moment of waking until it could no longer be avoided with his face buried in the pillow he could smell gennie it brought dreamy images to him images sultry but not quite formed there were soft fuzzyedged pictures that both aroused and soothed barely half awake grant shifted enough to discover he was alone in bed her warmth was still there on the sheets on his skin he lay steeped in it a moment not certain why it felt so right not trying to reason out the answers he remembered the feel of her the taste the way her pulse would leap under the touch of his finger had there ever been a woman who had made him want so badly who could make him comfortable one moment and wild the next how close was he to the border between want and need or had he already crossed it they were more questions he couldnt deal with not now while his mind was still clouded with sleep and with gennie he needed to shake off the first and distance himself from the second before he could find any answers groggy grant sat up running a hand over his face as gennie came back in morning with her hair wrapped in a towel and grants robe belted loosely at her waist gennie dropped onto the edge of the bed linking her hands behind his neck she leaned over and kissed him she smelled of his soap and shampoo something that made the easy kiss devastatingly intimate even as this began to soak into him she drew away to give him a friendly smile awake yet nearly because he wanted to see her hair grant pulled the towel from her head and let it drop to the floor have you been up long only since you pushed me out of bed she laughed when his brows drew together thats not much of an exaggeration want some coffee yeah as she rose grant took her hand holding it until her smile became puzzled what did he want to say to her grant wondered what did he want to tell her or himself he wasnt certain of anything except the knowledge that whatever was happening inside him was already too far advanced to stop grant ill be down in a minute he mumbled feeling foolish ill fix breakfast this time all right gennie hesitated wondering if he would say whatever hed really meant to say then she left him alone grant remained in bed a moment listening to the sound of her footsteps on his stairs her footsteps his stairs somehow the line of demarcation was smearing he wasnt certain hed be able to lie in his bed again without thinking of her curled beside him but hed had other women grant reminded himself hed enjoyed them appreciated them forgotten them why was it he was so certain there was nothing about gennie hed forget nothing down to that small faint birthmark hed found on her hip a half moon he could cover with his pinkie foolishly it had pleased him to discover it something he knew no other man had seen or touched he was acting like an idiot he told himself enchanted by the fact that he was her first lover obsessed with the idea of being her last her only he needed to be alone for a while that was all to put his feelings back in perspective the last thing he wanted was to start tying strings on her and in turn on himself rising he rummaged in his drawers until he found a pair of cutoffs hed fix breakfast send her on her way then get back to work but when he reached the bottom of the stairs he smelled the coffee heard her singing grant was struck with a powerful wave of deja vu he could explain it he told himself he could explain it because it had been just like this the first morning after hed met her but it wasnt that that was much much too logical for the strength of the feeling that swamped him it was more than an already seen it was a sensation of rightness of always of pleasure so simple it stung if he walked into that kitchen a hundred times year after year it would never seem balanced never seem whole unless she was waiting for him grant paused in the doorway to watch her the coffee was hot and ready as she stretched up for the mugs that he could reach easily the sun shot light into her hair teasing out those deep red hints until they shimmered flame on velvet she turned catching her breath in surprise when she saw him then smiling i didnt hear you come down she swung her hair behind her shoulder as she began to pour coffee its gorgeous out the rains got everything gleaming and the oceans more blue than green you wouldnt know thered ever been a storm taking a mug in each hand she turned back to him though shed intended to cross to him the look in his eyes stopped her puzzlement quickly became tension was he angry she wondered why perhaps he was already regretting what had happened why had she been so foolish as to think what had been between them had been as special as unique for him as it had been for her her fingers tightened on the handles she wouldnt let him apologize make excuses she wouldnt cause a scene the pain was real physically real but she told herself to ignore it later when she was alone she would deal with it but now she would face him without tears without pleas is something wrong was that her voice so calm so controlled yeah somethings wrong her fingers held the mugs so tightly she wondered that the handles didnt snap off still it kept her hands from shaking maybe we should sit down i dont want to sit down his voice was sharp as a slap but she didnt flinch she watched as he paced to the sink and leaned against it muttering and swearing another time the grantlike gesture would have amused her but now she only stood and waited if he was going to hurt her let him do it quickly at once before she fell apart he whirled almost violently and stared at her accusingly damn it gennie ive had my head lopped off it was her turn to stare her fingers went numb against the stoneware her pulse seemed to stop long enough to make her head swim before it began to race the color drained from her face until it was like porcelain against the glowing green of her eyes on another oath grant dragged a hand through his hair youre spilling the coffee he muttered then stuck his hands in his pockets oh gennie looked down foolishly at the tiny twin puddles that were forming on the floor then set down the mugs ill ill wipe it up leave it grant grabbed her arm before she could reach for a towel listen i feel like someones just given me a solid right straight to the gut the kind that doubles you over and makes your head ring at the same time i feel that way too often when i look at you when she said nothing he took her other arm and shook in the first place i never asked to have you walk into my life and mess up my head the last thing i wanted was for you to get in my way but you did so now im in love with you and i can tell you im not crazy about the idea gennie found her voice though she wasnt quite certain what to do with it well she managed after a moment that certainly puts me in my place oh she wants to make jokes disgusted grant released her to storm over to the coffee lifting a mug he drained half the contents perversely pleased that it scalded his throat well laugh this off he suggested as he slammed the mug down again and glared youre not going anywhere until i figure out what the hell im going to do about you struggling against conflicting emotions of amusement annoyance and simple wonder she put her hands on her hips the movement shifted the toobig robe so that it threatened to slip off of one shoulder oh really so youre going to figure out what to do about me like i was an inconvenient head cold damned inconvenient he muttered you may not have noticed but im a grown woman with a mind of my own accustomed to making my own decisions youre not going to do anything about me she told him as her temper began to overtake everything else she jabbed a finger at him and the gap in the robe widened if youre in love with me thats your problem i have one of my own because im in love with you terrific he shouted at her thats just terrific wed both have been better off if youd waited out that storm in a ditch instead of coming here youre not telling me anything i dont already know gennie retorted then spun around to leave the room just a minute grant had her arm again and backed her into the wall youre not going anywhere until this is settled its settled tossing her hair out of her face she glared at him were in love with each other and i wish youd go jump off that cliff if you had any finesse i dont any sensitivity she continued you wouldnt announce that you were in love with someone in the same tone youd use to frighten small children im not in love with someone he shouted at her infuriated because she was right and he couldnt do a thing about it im in love with you and damn it i dont like it youve made that abundantly clear she straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin dont pull that regal routine on me grant began her eyes sharpened to dagger points her skin flushed majestically abruptly he began to laugh when she tossed her head back in fury he simply collapsed against her oh god gennie i cant take it when you look at me as though you were about to have me tossed in the dungeon get off of me you ass incensed insulted she shoved against him but he only held her tighter only quick reflexes saved him from a wellaimed knee at a strategic point hold on still chuckling he pressed his mouth to hers then as abruptly as his laughter had begun it stilled with the gentleness he so rarely showed his hands came up to frame her face and she was lost gennie with his lips still on hers he murmured her name so that the sound of it shivered through her i love you he combed his fingers through her hair drawing her head back so that their eyes met i dont like it i may never get used to it but i love you with a sigh he brought her close again you make my head swim with her cheek against his chest gennie closed her eyes you can take time to get used to it she murmured just promise you wont ever be sorry it happened not sorry he agreed on a long breath a little crazed but not sorry as he ran a hand down her hair grant felt a fresh need for her softer calmer than before but no less vibrant he nuzzled into her neck because he seemed to belong there are you really in love with me or did you say that because i made you mad both i decided this morning id have to bend to your ego and let you tell me first is that so with his brows drawn together he tilted her head back again my ego it tends to get in the way because its rather oversized she smiled sweetly in retaliation he crushed his mouth to hers you know he managed after a moment ive lost my appetite for breakfast smiling again she tilted her face back to his have you really mmmm and i dont like to mention it he took his fingertips to the lapel of the robe toying with it before he slid them down to the belt but i didnt say you could use my robe oh that was rude of me the smile became saucy would you like it back now no hurry he slipped his hand into hers and started toward the steps you can wait until we get upstairs from his bedroom window grant watched her drive away it was early afternoon now and the sun was brilliant he needed some distance from her perhaps she needed some from him as well thats what he told himself even while he wondered how long he could stay away there was work waiting for him in the studio above his head a routine he knew was directly connected to the quality and quantity of his output he needed that one strict discipline in his life the hours out of the day and night that were guided by his creativity and his drive yet how could he work when his mind was so full of her when his body was still warm from hers love hed managed to avoid it for so many years then he had thoughtlessly opened the door it had barged in on him grant reflected uninvited unwelcomed now he was vulnerable dependent all the things hed once promised himself hed never be again if he could change it he was sure he would he had lived by his own rules his own judgment ms own needs for so long he wasnt certain he was willing or able to make the compromises love entailed he would end up hurting her grant thought grimly and the pain would ricochet back on him that was the inevitable fate of all lovers what did they want from each other shaking his head grant turned from the window for now time and affection were enough but that would change what would happen when the demands crept in the strings would he bolt he had no business falling in love with someone like gennie whose lifestyle was lightyears away from the one he had chosen whose very innocence made her that much more susceptible to hurt shed never be content to live with him there on his isolated finger of land and hed never ask her to he couldnt give up his peace for the parties the cameras the social whirl if hed been more like shelby grant thought of his sister and her love for crowds people noise each of them had compensated in their own way for the trauma of losing their father in such a hideous public fashion but after fifteen years the scars were still there perhaps shelby had healed more cleanly or perhaps her love for alan macgregor was strong enough to overcome that nagging fear the fear of exposure of losing of depending he remembered shelbys visit to him before she made her decision to marry alan shed been miserable afraid hed been rough on her because hed wanted to hold her to let her weep out the memories that haunted them both hed spoken the truth be cause the truth was what shed needed to hear but grant wasnt certain he could live by it are you going to shut yourself off from life because of something that happened fifteen years ago hed asked her that scathingly when shed sat in his kitchen with her eyes brimming over and he remembered her angry intuitive havent you in his own way he had though his work and the love of it kept him permanently connected with the world he drew for people for their pleasure and entertainment because in a fashion perhaps only he himself understood he liked them their flaws and strengths their foolishness and sanity he simply wouldnt be crowded by them and hed refused successfully until gennie to be too deeply involved with anyone on a one to one level it was so simple to deal with humanity on a general scope the pitfalls occurred when you narrowed it down pitfalls he thought with a snort hed fallen into a big one he was already impatient to have her back with him to hear her voice to see her smile at him shed be setting up now for the watercolor shed told him she was going to begin maybe shed still be wearing the shirt grant had lent her her own had been torn beyond repair without effort he could picture her setting up her easel near the inlet her hair would be brushed away from her face to fall behind her his shirt would be hanging past her hips and while she was getting her work done he was standing around mooning like a teenager on a sound of frustration grant strode into the hall just as the phone began to ring he started to ignore it something he did easily then changed his mind and loped down the stairs he kept only one phone in the kitchen because he refused to be disturbed by anything while he was in his studio or in his bed grant snatched the receiver from the wall and leaned against the doorway yeah grant campbell though hed only met the man once grant had no trouble identifying the voice it was distinctive even without the slight slur it cast on the campbell hello daniel youre a hard man to reach been out of town no grant grinned i dont always answer the phone the snort daniel gave caused grants grin to widen he could imagine the big macgregor sitting in his private tower room smoking one of his forbidden cigars behind his massive desk grant had caricatured him just that way then had slipped the sketch to shelby during her wedding reception absently he reached for a bag of corn chips on the counter and ripped them open how are you fine more than fine daniels booming voice took on hints of pride and arrogance im a grandfather two weeks ago congratulations a boy daniel informed him taking a satisfied puff on his thick cuban cigar seven pounds four ounces strong as a bull robert macgregor blade theyll be calling him mac good stock he took a deep breath that strained the buttons on his shirt the boy has my ears grant listened to the rundown on the newest macgregor with a mixture of amusement and affection his sister had married into a family that he personally found irresistible he knew pieces of them would be popping up in his strip for years to come hows rena came through like a champ daniel bit down on his cigar of course i knew she would her mother was worried females he didnt mention it was he who had insisted on chartering a plane the minute hed learned serena had gone into labor or that he had paced the waiting room like a madman while his wife anna had calmly finished the embroidery on a baby blanket justin stayed with her the whole time there was just a touch of resentment in the words enough to tell grant the hospital staff had barred the macgregors way into the delivery room and probably hadnt had an easy time of it has shelby seen her nephew yet off on their honeymoon during the birthing daniel told him with a wheezy sigh it was difficult for him to understand why his son and daughterinlaw hadnt canceled their plans to be on hand for such a momentous occasion but then she and alan are making up for it this weekend thats why i called we want you to come down boy the whole familys coming the new babe too annas fretting to have all the children around again you know how women are he knew how daniel was and grinned again mothers need to fuss i imagine aye thats it and with a new generation started shell be worse than ever daniel cast a wary eye at his closed door you never knew when someone might be listening now then youll come friday night grant thought of his schedule and did some quick mental figuring he had an urge to see his sister again and the macgregors more he felt the need to take gennie to the people whom without knowing why he considered family i could come down for a couple of days daniel but id like to bring someone someone daniels senses sharpened he leaned forward with the cigar smoldering in his hand who might this someone be recognizing the tone grant crunched on a corn chip an artist i know whos doing some painting in new england in windy point at the moment i think shed be interested in your house she daniel thought with an irrepressible grin just because hed managed to comfortably establish his children didnt mean he had to give up the satisfying hobby of matchmaking young people needed to be guided in such matters or shoved along and grant though he was a campbell was by way of being family an artist aye thats interesting always room for one more son bring her along an artist he repeated tapping out his cigar young and pretty too im sure shes nearly seventy grant countered easily crossing his ankles as he leaned against the wall a little dumpy has a face like a frog her paintings are timeless tremendous emotional content and physicality im crazy about her he paused imagining daniels wide face turning a deep puce genuine emotion transcends age and physical beauty dont you agree daniel choked then found his voice the boy needed help a great deal of help you come early friday son well need some time to talk he stared hard at the bookshelf across the room seventy you say close but then true sensuality is ageless why just last night she and i no dont tell me daniel interrupted hastily well have a long talk when you get here a long talk he added after a deep breath has shelby met no never mind he decided friday daniel said in a firmer tone well see about all this on friday well be there grant hung up then leaning against the doorjamb laughed until he hurt that should keep the old boy on his toes until friday grant thought still grinning he headed for the stairs hed work until dark until gennie chapter nine contents prev next gennie had never known herself to be talked into anything so quickly before she knew what was happening she was agreeing to pack her painting gear and a suitcase and fly off to spend a weekend with people she didnt know part of the reason she realized when she had a moment to sort it out was that grant was enthusiastic about the macgregors she learned enough about him in little more than a week to know that he rarely felt genuine affection for anyone enough affection at any rate to give up his precious privacy and his time she had agreed primarily because she simply wanted to be where he was next because she was caught up in his pleasure and finally because she wanted to see him under a different set of circumstances interacting with people away from his isolated spot on the globe she would meet his sister the fact that he had one had come as a surprise though she admitted it was foolish gennie had had a picture of grant simply popping into the world as an adult by himself already prepared to fight for the right to his place and his privacy now she began to wonder about his childhood what had formed him what had made him into the grant campbell she knew had he been rich or poor outgoing or introverted had he been happy loved ignored he rarely talked about his family his past for that matter of his present oddly because the answers were so important she couldnt ask the questions gennie found she needed that step to come from him as proof of the love he said he felt no perhaps proof was the wrong word she mused she believed he loved her in his way but she wanted the seal to her there was no separating trust from love because one without the other was just an empty word she didnt believe in secrets from childhood until her sisters death gennie had had that one special person to share everything with all her doubts insecurities wishes dreams losing angela had been like losing part of herself a part she was only beginning to feel again it was the most natural thing in the world for her to give that trust and affection to grant where she loved she loved without boundaries beneath the joy she felt was a quiet ache that came from knowing he had yet to open to her until he did gennie felt their future extended no further than the moment she forced herself to accept that because the thought of the moment without him was unbearable grant glanced over as he turned onto the narrow cliff road that led to the macgregor estate he glimpsed gennies profile the quiet expression the eyes dreamy and not quite happy whatre you thinking she turned her head and with her smile the wisp of sadness vanished that i love you it was so simple it made his knees weak needing to touch her grant pulled onto the shoulder of the road and stopped she was still smiling when he cupped her face in his hands and her lashes lowered in anticipation of the kiss softly with a reverence he never expected to feel he brushed his lips over her cheeks first one then the other her breath caught in her throat to lodge with her heart his rare spurts of gentleness never failed to undo her anything everything he might have asked of her at that moment she would have given without hesitation the whisper of his lashes against her skin bound her to him more firmly than any chain her name was only a sigh as he trailed kisses over her closed lids with her tremble his thoughts began to swirl what was this magic she cast over him it glittered one instant then pulsed the next was it only his imagination or had she always been there waiting to spring into his life and make him a slave was it her softness or her strength that made him want to kill or to die for her did it matter he knew it should when a man got pulled in too deeply by a woman an ideal a goal he became vulnerable then the instinct for survival would take second place grant had always understood this was what had happened to his father but now all he could grasp was that she was so soft so giving his lightly grant touched his lips to hers gennie tilted back her head and opened to him his fingers tightened on her his breath quickened rushing into her mouth just before his tongue the transition from gentle to desperate was too swift to be measured her fingers tangled in his hair to drag him closer while he ravished a mouth more demanding than willing caught in the haze gennie thought her passion rose higher and faster each time he touched her until one day she would simply explode from a mere look i want you she felt the words wrench from her as they slipped from her mouth into his he crushed her against him in a grip that left all gentleness behind his lips savaged warred absorbed until they were both speechless with an inarticulate murmur grant buried his face in her hair and fought to find reason good god in another minute ill forget its still daylight and this is a public road gennie ran her fingers down the nape of his neck i already have grant forced the breath in and out of his lungs three times then lifted his head be careful he warned quietly i have a more difficult time remembering to be civilized than doing what comes naturally at this moment id feel very natural dragging you into the back seat tearing off your clothes and loving you until you were senseless a thrill rushed up and down her spine daring her urging her she leaned closer until her lips were nearly against his one should never go against ones nature gennie his control was so thinly balanced he could already feel the way her body would heat and soften beneath his her scent contradicted the lowering sun and whispered of midnight when she slid her hands up his chest he could hear his own heartbeat vibrate against her palm her eyes were clouded yet somehow they held more power grant couldnt look away from them he saw himself a prisoner exulting in the weight of the chains just as the scales tipped away from reason the sound of an approaching engine had him swearing and turning his head gennie looked over her shoulder as a mercedes pulled to a halt beside them the driver was in shadows so that she had only the impression of dark masculine looks while the passenger rolled down her window a cap of wild red hair surrounding an angular face poked out the opening the woman leaned her arms on the base of the window and grinned appealingly you people lost grant sent her a narroweyed glare then astonished gennie by reaching out and twisting her nose between his first two fingers scram some people just arent worth helping the woman stated before she gave a haughty toss of her head and disappeared back inside the mercedes purred discreetly then disappeared around the first curve grant torn between amusement and disbelief gennie stared at him even for you that was unbelievably rude cant stand busybodies he said easily as he started the car again she let out a gusty sigh as she flopped back against the cushions you certainly made that clear enough im beginning to think it was a miracle you didnt just slam the door in my face that first night it was a weak moment she slanted a look at him then gave up how close are we you might want to run off the cast of characters for me so ill have an idea who she trailed off oh god it was incredible impossible wonderful stark gray in the last lights of the sun it was the fairy castle every little girl imagined herself trapped in it would take a valiant knight to free her from the high stone walls of the tower that it was here in this century of rockets and rushing was a miracle in itself the structure jutted and spread and quite simply dominated the cliff on which it stood no ivy clung to its walls what ivy would dare encroach but there were flowers wild roses blooms in brambles haunting colors that stubbornly shouted of summer while the nearby trees were edged with the first breath of fall gennie didnt simply want to paint it she had to paint it in essentially the same way she had to breathe i thought so grant commented dazed gennie continued to stare what you might as well have a brush in your hand already i only wish i did if you paint this with half the insight and the power you used in your study of the cliffs and lighthouse youll have a magnificent piece of work gennie turned to him then confused but i you didnt seem to think too much of the painting he snorted as he negotiated the last curve dont be an idiot it never occurred to him that she would need reassurance grant knew his own skills and accepted with a shrug the fact that he was considered one of the top in his field what others thought mattered little because he knew his own capabilities he assumed gennie would feel precisely the same about herself if he had known the agony she went through before each of her showings he would have been flabbergasted if he had known just how much he had hurt her by his casual comment the day she had finished the painting he would have been speechless gennie frowned at him concentrating you did like it then like what the painting she snapped impatiently the painting i did in your front yard with their minds working at cross purposes grant didnt hear the insecurity in the demand just because i dont paint he began curtly doesnt mean i have to be slugged over the head with genius to recognize it they lapsed into silence neither one certain of the others mood or their own if he liked the painting gennie fumed why didnt he just say so instead of making her drag it out of him grant wondered if she thought serious art was the only worthwhile medium what the hell would she have to say if he told her he made his living by depicting people as he saw them through cartoons funny papers would she laugh or throw a fit if she caught a glimpse of his veronica in the new york daily in a couple of weeks they pulled up in front of the house with a jerk of brakes that brought them both back to the moment wait until we get inside he began picking up the threads of their earlier conversation i only believed half of what i saw myself apparently everything ive ever read or heard about daniel macgregors true gennie stepped out of the car with her eyes trained on the house again forceful eccentric a man who makes his own deals his own way but im vague on personal details his wifes a doctor surgeon therere three children and as youll be hearing innumerable times over the weekend one grandson my sister married the eldest son alan alan macgregor hes senator macgregor and in a few years with a shrug he trailed off ah yes youd have a direct line into the white house if the murmurs about alan macgregors aspirations become fact she grinned at the man in khakis leaning against the hood of the rented car while the wind played games with his hair how would you feel about that grant gave her an odd smile thinking of macintosh things are presently unsettled he murmured but ive always had a ratherwry affection for politics in general grabbing her hand he began to walk toward the rough stone steps then theres caine son number two a lawyer who recently married another lawyer who as it happens is the sister of daniels youngest offsprings husband im not sure im keeping up gennie studied the brasscrowned lions head that served as a door knocker you have to be a quick study grant lifted the knocker and let it fall resoundingly rena married a gambler she and her husband own a number of casinos and live in atlantic city gennie gave him a thoughtful glance for someone who keeps to himself so much youre well informed yeah he grinned at her as the door opened the redhead that gennie recognized from the mercedes leaned against the thick panel and looked grant up and down still lost this time grant tugged her against him and gave her a hard kiss apparently youve survived a month of matrimony but youre still skinny and compliments still roll trippingly off your tongue she retorted drawing back after a moment she laughed and hugged him fiercely damn i hate to say it out loud but its good to see you grinning over grants shoulder she pinned gennie with a curious not unfriendly glance hi im shelby grants sister gennie realized thrown off by the total lack of any familial resemblance she had the impression of hordes of energy inside a long lean body unruly fiery curls and smoky eyes while grant had a ragged unkempt attractiveness his sister was a combination of porcelain and flame im gennie she responded instinctively to the smile shelby shot her before she untangled herself from her brother im glad to meet you pushing seventy hmmm shelby said cryptically to grant before she clasped gennies hand well have to get to know each other so you can tell me how you tolerate this jerks company for more than five minutes at a time alans in the throne room with the macgregor she continued before grant could retort has grant given you a rundown on the inmates an abbreviated version gennie replied instantly charmed typical she hooked her arm through gennies well sometimes its best to jump in feet first the most important thing to remember is not to let daniel intimidate you what extraction are you french mostly why itll come up how was the honeymoon grant demanded wanting to veer away from the subject that would indeed come up shelby beamed at him ill let you know when its over hows your cliff still standing he glanced to his left as justin started down the main stairs justins expression of mild curiosity changed to surprise something rarely seen on his face then pleasure gennie he took the rest of the stairs in quick long strides then whirled her into his arms justin laughing she hooked her arms around his neck while grants eyes narrowed to slits whatre you doing here they asked together chuckling he took both of her hands drawing back for a long thorough study youre beautiful he told her always grant watched her flush with pleasure and experienced the first genuine jealousy of his life he found it a very unpleasant sensation it seems he said in a dangerously mild voice that had shelbys brows lifting you two have met yes of course gennie began before realization dawned the gambler she exclaimed oh i never put it together rena serena hearing you were getting married was a shock in itself i hated to miss the wedding and a father she threw her arms around him again laughing good god im surrounded by cousins cousins grant echoed on my french side justin said wryly a distant connection carefully overlooked by all but a he tilted gennies face to his select few aunt adelaides a stuffy old bore gennie said precisely are you following this shelby asked grant barely he muttered with another laugh gennie held out her hand to him to keep it simple justin and i are cousins third i think we happened to meet about five years ago at one of my shows in new york i wasnt ah close to that particular end of my family justin continued some chance comment led to another until we ferreted out the connection when justin smiled down at gennie grant saw it the eyes the green eyes man woman they were almost identical to the shade for some obscure reason that more than the explanations had him relaxing the muscles that had gone taut the moment justin had scooped her up the black sheep he realized whod outdone them all fascinating shelby decided all those clichés about small worlds are amazingly apt gennies here with grant oh justin glanced over meeting grants dark appraising eyes as a gambler he habitually sized up the people he met and stored them into compartments at shelbys wedding the month before justin had found him a man with wit and secrets who refused to be stored anywhere theyd gotten along easily perhaps because the need for privacy was inherent in both of them now remembering daniels blustering description of grants weekend companion justin controlled a grin daniel mentioned you were bringing an artist grant recognized as few would have the gleam of humor in justins eyes im sure he did he returned in the same conversational tone i havent congratulated you yet on ensuring the continuity of the line and saving the rest of us from the pressure to do so immediately shelby finished dont count on it a smooth voice warned gennie looked up to see a blond woman descending the steps carrying a bundle in a blue blanket hello grant its nice to see you again serena cradled her son in one arm as she leaned over to kiss grants cheek it was sweet of you to answer the royal summons my pleasure unable to resist he nudged the blanket aside with a finger so little babies had always held a fascination for him their perfection in miniature this one was smoothcheeked and wide awake staring back at him with dark blue eyes he thought already hinted of the violet of his mothers perhaps mac had daniels ears and serenas eyes but the rest of him was pure blade he had the bones of a warrior grant thought and the striking black hair of his comanche blood looking beyond her son serena studied the woman who was watching grant with a quiet thoughtfulness it surprised her to see her husbands eyes in a feminine face waiting until those eyes shifted to hers she smiled im rena gennies a friend of grants justin announced easily slipping an arm around his wifes shoulders she also happens to be my cousin before serena could react to the first surprise he hit her with the second genvieve grandeau oh those marvelous paintings she exclaimed while shelbys eyes widened damn it grant after giving him a disgusted look shelby turned to gennie our mother had two of your landscapes i badgered her into giving me one as a wedding present evening she elaborated i want to build a house around it pleased gennie smiled at her then maybe youll help me convince mr macgregor that i should paint his house just watch how you have to twist his arm serena said dryly what is this a summit meeting alan demanded as he strode down the hall its one thing to be the advance man he continued as he cupped a hand around the back of his wifes neck and another to be the sacrificial lamb dads doing a lot of moaning and groaning about this family scattering off in all directions with caine getting the worst of it serena put in yeah alan grinned once appealingly too bad hes late his gaze shifted to gennie then dark intense eyes a slow serious smile weve met he hesitated briefly as he flipped through his mental file of names and faces genvieve grandeau a little surprised gennie smiled back at him a very quick meeting at a very crowded charity function about two years ago senator alan he corrected so youre grants artist he sent grant a look that had lights of humor softening his eyes i must say you outshine even grants description of you shall we all go in and join the macgregor before he starts to bellow here justin took the baby from serena in an expert move macll soften him up what description gennie murmured to grant as they started down the wide hall she saw the grin tug at his mouth before he slipped an arm around her shoulders later gennie immediately saw why shelby had referred to it as the throne room the expansive floor space was covered with a scarlet rug all the woodwork was lushly carved while magnificent paintings hung in ornate frames there was the faint smell of candlewax though no candles were lit lamps glowed to aid the soft light of dusk that trailed in the many mullioned windows she saw at a glance that the furniture was ancient and wonderful all largescaled and perfect in the enormous room logs were laid and ready in the huge fireplace in anticipation of the chill that could come during the evenings when summer warred with autumn but the room superb in its unique fashion was nothing compared to the man holding court from his highbacked gothic chair massive with red hair thick and flaming he watched the procession file into the room with narrowed sharp blue eyes in a wide lined face to gennie he looked like a general or a king both perhaps in the way of centuries past where the monarch led his people into battle one huge hand tapped the wooden arm of his chair while the other held a glass halffilled with liquid he looked fierce enough to order executions arbitrarily her fingers itched for a pad and a pencil well he said in a deep rumbling voice that made the syllable an accusation shelby was the first to go to him bravely gennie thought to give him a smacking kiss on the mouth hi grandpa he reddened at that and struggled with the pleasure the title gave him so you decided to give me a moment of your time i felt duty bound to pay my respects to the newest macgregor first as if on cue justin strode over to arrange mac in the crook of daniels arm gennie watched the fierce giant turn into a marshmallow theres a laddie he crooned holding out his glass to shelby then chucking the baby under the chin when the baby grabbed his thick finger he preened like a rooster strong as an ox he grinned foolishly at the room in general then zeroed in on grant well campbell so youve come you see here he began jiggling the baby why the macgregors could never be conquered strong stock good blood serena murmured taking the baby from the proud grandfather get a drink for the campbell he ordered now wheres this artist his eyes darted around the room landed on gennie and clung she thought she saw surprise quickly veiled then amusement as quickly suppressed tug at the corners of his mouth daniel macgregor grant said with wry formality genvieve grandeau a flicker of recognition ran across daniels face before he rose to his rather amazing height and held out his hand welcome gennies hand was clasped then enveloped she had simultaneous impressions of strength compassion and stubbornness you have a magnificent home mr macgregor she said studying him candidly it suits you he gave a great bellow of a laugh that might have shook the windows aye and three of your paintings hang in the west wing his eyes slid briefly to grants before they came back to hers you carry your age well lass she gave him a puzzled look as grant choked over his scotch thank you get the artist a drink he ordered then gestured for her to sit in the chair next to his now tell me why youre wasting your time with a campbell gennie happens to be a cousin of mine justin said mildly as he sat on the sofa beside his son on the aristocratic french side a cousin daniels eyes sharpened then an expression that could only be described as cunning pleasure spread over his face aye we like to keep things in the family grandeau a good strong name youve the look of a queen with a bit of sorceress thrown in that was meant as a compliment serena told her as she handed gennie a vermouth in crystal so ive been told gennie sent grant an easy look over the rim of her glass one of my ancestors had an encounter with a gypsy resulting in twins gennie has a pirate in her family tree as well justin put in daniel nodded in approval strong blood the campbells need all the help they can get watch it macgregor shelby warned as grant gave him a brief fulminating look there were undercurrents here to confuse a newcomer but not so subtle gennie didnt catch the drift hes trying to arrange a betrothal she thought and struggled with a chuckle seeing grants dark annoyed look only made it more difficult to maintain her composure the game was irresistible the grandeaus can trace their ancestry back to a favored courtesan of philip iv e bel she caught shelbys look of amused respect in the time it took for eyes to meet a bond was formed though he was enjoying the signals being flashed around the room alan remembered all too well being in the position grant was currently enjoying i wonder whats keeping caine he said casually aware how the comment would shift his fathers focus hah daniel downed half his drink in one swallow the boys too bound up in his law to give his mother a moments thought at gennies lifted brows serena curled her legs under her my mothers still at the hospital she explained a smile lurking around her mouth im sure shell be devastated if she arrives before caine does she worries about her children daniel put in with a sniff i try to tell her that they have lives of their own to lead but a mothers a mother serena rolled her eyes and said something inarticulate into her glass it was enough however to make daniels face flush before he could retort the sound of the knocker thudding against wood vibrated against the walls ill get it alan said feeling that would give him a moment to warn caine of their fathers barometer because he felt a certain kinship with caine at that moment grant turned to daniel in an attempt to shift his mood gennie was fascinated by the house he began shes hoping to persuade you into letting her paint it daniels reaction was immediate not unlike his reaction to his grandson he preened well now we should be able to arrange something that suits us both a grandeau of the macgregor fortress he knew the financial value of such a painting not to mention the value to his pride the legacy for his grandchildren well talk he said with a decisive nod just as the latest macgregors came into the room daniel cast a look in their direction hah gennie saw a tall lean man with the air of an intelligent wolf stroll in were all the macgregors such superb examples of the human species she wondered there was power there the same as she had sensed in alan and serena because it wasnt wholly the same as daniels gennie speculated on their mother just what sort of woman was she then her attention was caught by the woman who entered with caine justins sister gennie glanced at her cousin to see him eyeing his sister with a slight frown and she understood why the tension caine and diana had brought into the room was palpable we got held up in boston caine said easily shrugging off his fathers scowl before he walked over to look at his nephew the rather hard lines of his face softened when he glanced up at his sister good job rena you might call when youre going to be late daniel stated so your mother wouldnt worry caine took in the room with a sweeping glance noticing his mothers absence then lifted an ironic brow of course its my fault diana said in a low voice an appointment ran over you remember grant serena began hoping to smooth over what looked like very rough edges yes of course diana managed a smile that didnt reach her large dark eyes and grants guest serena continued with the wish that she could have a few moments alone with diana who turns out to be a cousin of yours genvieve grandeau diana stiffened instantly her face cool and expressionless when she turned to gennie cousin caine said curiously as he moved to stand beside his wife yes gennie spoke up wanting to ease something she didnt understand we met once she went on offering a smile when we were children at a birthday party i think my family was in boston visiting i remember diana murmured though she tried gennie could remember nothing she had done at the silly little party to warrant the cool remote look diana gave her her reaction was instinctive her chin angled slightly her brows arched with the regal look settling over her she sipped her vermouth as shelby pointed out its a small world caine recognized dianas expression and though it exasperated him he laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder welcome cousin he said to gennie giving her an unexpectedly charming smile he turned to grant then and the smile tilted mischievously id really like to talk to you about frogs grant responded with a lightning fast grin anytime before gennie could even begin to sort this out or the laughter that followed it a small dark woman came into the room here was the other end of the power gennie sensed it immediately as the woman became the center of attention there was a strength about her and the serious attractive looks that she had passed on to her eldest son she carried a strange dignity though her hair was slightly mussed and her suit just a bit wrinkled im so glad you could come she said to gennie when they were introduced her hands were small and capable and gennie discovered chilled im sorry i wasnt here when you arrived i was detained at the hospital shes lost a patient without knowing how she understood it gennie was certain instinctively she covered their joined hands with her free one you have a wonderful family mrs macgregor a beautiful grandson anna let out a tiny sigh that was hardly audible thank you she moved to brush a kiss over her husbands cheek lets go in to dinner she said when he patted her hair you all must be starving by now the cast of characters was complete gennie mused as she rose to take grants hand it was going to be a very interesting weekend chapter ten contents prev next it was late when gennie lounged in an oversized tub filled with hot fragrant water the macgregors from daniel down to mac were not an earlytobed group she liked them their boisterousness their contrasts their obvious and unapologetic unity and with the exception of diana they had given her a sense of welcome into their family boundaries thinking of diana now gennie frowned and soaped her leg perhaps diana blade macgregor was withdrawn by nature it hadnt taken any insight to see that there was tension between caine and his wife and that diana drew closer into herself because of it but gennie felt there had been something more personal in dianas attitude toward her leave me alone the signal had been clear as crystal and gennie had obliged not everyone was inherently friendly not everyone had to like her on sight still it disturbed her that diana had been neither friendly nor particularly hostile but simply remote shaking off the mood she pulled on the oldfashioned chain to let the water drain tomorrow shed spend some time with her new cousins by marriage and do as many sketches as she could of the macgregor home perhaps she and grant would walk along the cliffs or take a dip in the pool shed heard was at one of the endless echoing corridors shed never seen grant so relaxed for such a long period of time oddly though he was still the remote arrogant man shed reluctantly fallen in love with hed been comfortable with the numerous loud macgregors in one evening shed discovered yet something more about him he enjoyed people being with them talking with them as long as it remained on his terms gennie had caught the tail end of a conversation grant had been having with alan after dinner it had been political and obviously in depth which had surprised her that had surprised her no more however than watching him jiggle serenas baby on his knee while he carried on a debate with caine involving a controversial trial waging in the boston courts then he had badgered shelby into a heated argument over the social significance of the afternoon soap opera with a shake of her head gennie patted her skin dry why did a man with such eclectic tastes and opinions live like a recluse why did a man obviously at ease in a social situation scare off stray tourists an enigma gennie slipped into a short silk robe yes he was that but knowing it and accepting it were entirely different things the more she learned about him the more quick peeks she had into the inner man the more she longed to know patience just a little more patience gennie warned herself as she walked into the adjoining bedroom the room was huge the wallpaper old and exquisite there was an ornate daybed upholstered in rich rose satin and a vanity carved with cupids it had all the ostentatious charm of the eighteenth century down to the fussy framed embroidery that must have been annas work pleasantly tired gennie sat on the skirted stool in front of the triplemirrored vanity and began to brush her hair when grant opened the door he thought she looked like some fairy princess part ingenue part seductress her eyes met his in the glass and she smiled while following through with the last stroke of the brush take the wrong turn i took the right one he closed the door behind him then flicked the lock is that so tapping the brush against her palm gennie arched a brow i thought you had the room down the hall the macgregors forgot to put something in there he stood where he was for a moment pleased just to look at her oh what you crossing to her grant took the brush from her hand the scent of her bath drifted through the room with his eyes on hers in the glass he began to draw the brush through her hair soft he murmured everything about you is just too soft to resist he could always make her blood heat with his passion with his demands but when he was gentle when his touch was tender she was defenseless her eyes grew wide and cloudy and remained fixed on his do you want to she managed there was a slight smile on his face as he continued to sweep the brush through her hair in long slow strokes it wouldnt make any difference but no i dont want to resist you genvieve what i want to do he followed the path of the brush with his fingers is touch you taste you to the absence of everything else youre not my first obsession he murmured with an odd expression in his eyes but youre the only one ive been able to touch with my hands taste with my mouth youre not the only woman ive loved he let the brush fall so that his hands were free to dive into her hair but youre the only woman ive been in love with she knew he spoke no more no less than the truth the words filled her with a soaring power she wanted to share it with him give back some of the wonder hed brought to her life rising she turned to face him let me make love to you she whispered let me try the sweetness of the request moved him more than he would have thought possible but when he reached for her she put her hands to his chest no she slid her hands up to his neck fingers spread let me carefully watching his face she began to unbutton his shirt her eyes reflected confidence her fingers were steady yet she knew she would have to rely on instinct and what he had only begun to teach her did you make love to a man as you wanted him to make love to you she would see his wants could be no less than hers she thought as her fingers skimmed over his skin would they be so much different with a sound that was both of pleasure and approval she ran her hands down his rib cage then back up again before she pushed the loosened shirt from his shoulders he was lean almost too lean but his skin was smooth and tight over his bones already it was warming under the passage of her hands leaning closer gennie pressed her mouth to his heart and felt the quick unsteady beat experimentally she used the tip of her tongue to moisten she heard him suck in his breath before the arms around her tightened gennie no i just want to touch you for a little while she traced the breathless kisses over his chest and listened to the sound of his racing heartbeat grant closed his eyes while the damp light kisses heated his skin he fought the urge to drag her to the bed or to the floor and tried to find the control she seemed to be asking him for her curious fingers roamed with the uncanny ability to find and exploit weaknesses hed been unaware he had all the while she murmured sighed promised grant wondered if this was the way people quietly lost their sanity when she trailed her fingers down slowly to the snap of his jeans the muscles in his stomach trembled then contracted she heard him groan as he lowered his face to the top of her head her throat was dry her palms damp as she loosened the snap it was as much from uncertainty as the wish to seduce that she loitered over the process his briefs ran low at his hips snug and to gennie fascinatingly soft in her quest to learn she touched him and felt the swift convulsive shudder that wracked his body so much power she thought so much strength yet she could make him tremble lie down with me she whispered then tilted back her head to look into eyes dark and opaque with need for her his mouth rushed down to hers taking as though he were starving even as her senses began to swim the knowledge of her hold over him expanded she knew what he wanted from her and she would give it willingly but she wanted to give much much more and she would with her hands on either side of his face she drew him away his quick labored breaths fluttered over her face lie down with me she repeated and moved to the bed she waited until he came to her then urged him down the old mattress sighed as she knelt beside him i love to look at you combing the hair back from his temples she replaced it with her lips and so she began roaming wandering with a laziness that made him ache he felt the satin smoothness of her lips the rustling silkiness of her robe as she slowly seduced him into helplessness his skin grew damp from the flick and circle of her tongue and his own need around him seeping into the very air he breathed was the scent she had bathed in she sighed then laid her lips on his nipping and sucking until he heard nothing but the roaring in his own head her body merged with his as she lay down on him and began to do torturous things to his neck with her teeth and tongue he tried to say her name but could manage only a groan as his hands always so sure fumbled for her her skin was as damp as his and drove him mad as it slid over him lower and lower so that her lips could taste and her hands enjoy shed never known anything so heady as the freedom power and passion gave when joined together it had a scent musky secret she drew it in its flavor was the same and she devoured it as her tongue dipped lower she had the dizzying pleasure of knowing her man was absorbed in her he seemed no longer to be breathing but moaning only she was unaware that her own sighs of pleasure joined his how beautifully formed he was was all she could think how incredible it was that he belonged to her she was naked now without having felt him tug off her robe gennie knew only that his hands stroked over her shoulders warm rough desperate then dipped to her breasts in a kind of crazed worship how much time passed was unknown neither of them heard a clock chime the hour from somewhere deep in the house boards settled outside a bird perhaps a nightingale set up a long pleading call for a lover a few harmless clouds blew away from the moon neither of them was aware of any sound any movement outside of that wide soft bed her mouth found his again greedy and urgent warm breath merged tongues tangled minds clouded he murmured into her mouth a husky plea his hands gripped her hips as if he were falling gennie slid down and took him inside her then gasped at the rocketing terrifying thrill she shuddered her body flinging back as she peaked instantly then clung clung desperately to delirium he tried to hold on to that last light of reason as she melted against him spent but it was too late shed stolen his sanity all that was animal in him clawed to get out with more of a growl than a groan he tossed her onto her back and took her like a madman when she had thought herself drained she revitalized filled with him her body went wild matching the power and speed of his higher and higher faster and faster hot and heady and dark they rushed from one summit to a steeper one until sated they collapsed into each other still joined with the light still shining beside the bed they fell asleep it was one of those rare perfect days the air was mild just a bit breezy while the sun was warm and bright gennie had nibbled over the casual comewhenyouwant breakfast while grant had eaten enough for both of them hed wandered away talking vaguely of a poker game leaving gennie free to take her sketch pad outdoors alone though as it happened she had little solitary time she wanted a straighton view of the house first the same view that could be seen first when traveling up the road whether daniel had planned it that way or not and she felt he had it was awesome she moved past the thorny rose bushes to sit on the grass near a chestnut tree for a time it was quiet with only the sound of gulls land birds and waves against rock the sketch began with rough lines boldly drawn then unable to resist gennie began to refine it shading perfecting nearly a half hour had passed before a movement caught her eye shelby had come out of a side door while gennie was concentrating on the tower and was already halfway across the uneven yard hi am i going to bother you no gennie smiled as she let the sketchbook drop into her lap ill spend days sketching here if someone doesnt stop me fabulous isnt it with a limber kind of grace that made gennie think of grant shelby sat beside her she studied the sketch in gennies lap sos that she murmured and she too thought of grant as a child it had infuriated her that she couldnt match his skill with a pencil or crayon as they had grown older envy had turned to pride almost exclusively you and grant have a lot in common pleased at the idea gennie glanced down at her own work he has quite a bit of talent doesnt he of course ive only seen one impromptu caricature but its so obvious i wonder why hes not doing anything with it it was a direct probe they both knew it the statement also told shelby that grant hadnt yet confided in the woman beside her the woman shelby was certain he was in love with impatience warred with loyalty why the hell was he being such a stubborn idiot but the loyalty won grant does pretty much as he pleases have you known him long no not really just a couple of weeks idly she plucked a blade of grass and twirled it between her fingers my car broke down during a storm on the road leading to the lighthouse she chuckled as a perfectly clear image of his scowling face flashed through her mind grant wasnt too pleased to find me on his doorstep you mean he was rude surly and impossible shelby countered answering gennies grin at the very least thank god some things are consistent hes crazy about you i dont know who that shocked more him or me shelby she shouldnt pry gennie thought but found she had to know something anything that might give her a key to the inner man what was he like as a boy shelby stared up at the clouds that drifted harmlessly overhead grant always liked to go off by himself occasionally when i hounded him hed tolerate me he always liked people though he looks at them in a rather tilted way his way she said with a shrug shelby thought of the security theyd lived with as children the campaigns the press and she thought briefly that with alan she had stepped right back into the whirlpool with a little sigh gennie didnt understand shelby leaned back on her elbows he had a monstrous temper a firm opinion on what was right and what was wrong for himself and society in general they werent always the same things still for the most part he was easygoing and kind i suppose for an older brother she was frowning up at the sky still and remaining silent gennie watched her grant has a large capacity for love and kindness shelby continued but he doles it out sparingly and in his own way he doesnt like to depend on anyone she hesitated then looking at gennies calm face and expressive eyes felt she had to give her something we lost our father grant was seventeen between being a boy and being a man it devastated me and it wasnt until a long time after that i realized it had done the same to him we were both there when he was killed gennie closed her eyes thinking of grant remembering angela this was something she could understand all too well the guilt the grief the shock that never quite went away how was he killed grant should tell you about that shelby said quietly yes gennie opened her eyes he should wanting to dispel the mood and her own memories shelby touched her hand youre good for him i could see that right away are you a patient person gennie im not sure anymore dont be too patient she advised with a smile grant needs someone to give him a good swift punch once in a while you know when i first met alan i was absolutely determined not to have anything to do with him sounds familiar she chuckled and he was absolutely determined i would he was patient but she grinned at the memory not too patient and im not half as nasty as grant gennie laughed then flipped over a page and began to sketch shelby how did you meet alan oh at a party in washington is that where youre from i live in georgetown we live in georgetown she corrected my shops there too gennies brow lifted as she drew the subtle line of shelbys nose what kind of a shop im a potter really interested gennie stopped sketching you throw your own clay grant never mentioned it he never does shelby said dryly theres a bowl in his bedroom gennie remembered in a henna shade with etched wildflowers is that your work i gave it to him for christmas a couple of years ago i didnt know what hed done with it it catches the light beautifully gennie told her noting that shelby was both surprised and pleased there isnt much else in that lighthouse he even bothers to dust hes a slob shelby said fondly do you want to reform him not particularly im glad though id hate to have him hear me say it i like him the way he is she stretched her arms to the sky im going to go in and lose a few dollars to justin ever played cards with him only once gennie grinned it was enough i know what you mean she murmured as she rose but i can usually bluff daniel out of enough to make it worthwhile with a last lightning smile she was off thoughtfully gennie glanced down at the sketch and sorted through the snatches of information shelby had given her frogfaced caine asked when he met grant in the hall beautys in the eye of the beholder grant said easily with an appreciative grin caine leaned against one of the many archways you had dad going we all got one of his phone calls telling us the campbell was in a bad way and it was our duty he being by way of family to help him the grin became wolfish you seem to be getting along all right on your own grant acknowledged this with a nod the last time i was here he was trying to match me up with some judson girl i didnt want to take any chances dads a firm believer in marriage and procreation caines grin faded a bit when he thought of his wife its funny about your gennie being dianas cousin a coincidence grant murmured noting the troubled expression i havent seen diana this morning neither have i caine said wryly then shrugged we disagree on a case shes decided to take the cloud of trouble crossed his face again its difficult being married and in the same profession particularly when you look at that profession from different angles grant thought of himself and gennie could two people look at art from more opposing views i imagine it is it seemed to me that gennie made her uncomfortable diana had it rough as a kid dipping his hands in his pockets caine brooded into space shes still adjusting to it im sorry you dont have to apologize to me and gennies well able to take care of herself i think ill take a look for diana he pulled himself back then grinning jerked his head toward the tower steps justins on a streak as usual if you want to risk it outside diana moved around the side of the house and into the front garden before she spotted gennie her first instinct was simply to turn away but gennie glanced up their eyes met stiffly diana moved across the grass but unlike shelby she didnt sit good morning gennie gave her an equally cool look good morning the roses are lovely arent they yes they wont last much longer diana slipped her hands into the deep pockets of her jadegreen slacks youre going to paint the house i plan to on impulse she held the sketch pad up to her cousin what do you think diana studied it and saw all the things that had first impressed her about the structure the strength the fairytale aura the superb charm it moved her it made her uncomfortable somehow the drawing made a bond between them she wanted to avoid youre very talented she murmured aunt adelaide always sang your praises gennie laughed despite herself aunt adelaide wouldnt know a rubens from a rembrandt she only thinks she does she could have bitten her tongue this woman she reminded herself had been raised by adelaide and she had no right denigrating her to someone who might be fond of her have you seen her recently no diana said flatly and handed gennie back the sketch annoyed gennie shaded her eyes and gave diana a long thorough study casually gennie turned over a page and as she had done with shelby began to sketch her you dont like me i dont know you diana returned coolly true which makes your behavior all the more confusing i thought you would be more like justin infuriated because the easily spoken words stung diana glared down at her justin and i have different ways because we led different lives whirling she took three quick strides away before she stopped herself why was she acting like a shrew she demanded then placed a hand to her stomach diana straightened her shoulders and turned back ill apologize for being rude because justins fond of you oh thank you very much gennie said dryly though she began to feel a slight stir of compassion at the struggle going on in dianas eyes why dont you tell me why you feel you have to be rude in the first place im simply not comfortable with the grandeau end of the family thats a narrow view for an attorney gennie mused and for a woman who only met me once before when we were what eight ten years old you fit in so perfectly diana said before she could think adelaide must have told me a dozen times that i was to watch you and behave as you behaved adelaide has always been a foolish selfimportant woman gennie returned diana stared at her yes she knew that now she simply hadnt thought anyone else in that part of the family did you knew everyone there she continued though she was beginning to feel like a fool and had your hair tied back in a ribbon that matched your dress it was mintgreen organdy i didnt even know what organdy was because her sympathies were instantly and fully aroused gennie rose she didnt reach out yet it wouldnt be welcomed id heard you were comanche i waited through that whole silly party for you to do a war dance i was terribly disappointed when you didnt diana stared at her again for a full thirty seconds she felt the desperate urge to weep that was coming over her too often lately instead she found herself laughing i wish id known how and had had the courage to do it aunt adelaide would have swooned she stopped hesitated then held out her hand im glad to meet you again cousin gennie accepted the hand then took it one step further and pressed her lips to dianas cheek perhaps if you give us a chance youll find there are some of the grandeaus who are almost as human as the macgregors diana smiled the feeling of family always overwhelmed her just a little yes perhaps when dianas smile faded gennie followed the direction of her gaze and saw caine standing among the roses the tension returned swiftly but had nothing to do with her i need to get a new angle for my sketches she said easily caine waited until gennie was some distance away before he went to his wife you were up early he said while his eyes roamed over her face you look tired diana im fine she said too quickly stop worrying about me she told him as she turned away frustrated caine grabbed her arm damn it youre tying yourself in knots over that case and will you drop that she shouted at him i know what im doing maybe caine said evenly too evenly the point is youve never taken on murder one before and the prosecution has a textbook case built up its a pity you dont have any more confidence in my capabilities its not that furious he grabbed her arms and shook you know its not thats not what this is all about his voice grew more frustrated than angry now while his eyes searched her face for the secrets she was keeping from him i thought wed come farther than this but youve shut me out i want to know what its all about diana i want to know what the hell is wrong with you im pregnant she shouted at him then pressed her hand to her mouth stunned he released her arms and stared at her pregnant over the wave of shock came a wave of pleasure so steep so dizzying for a moment he couldnt move diana when he reached for her she backed away so that pleasure was sliced away by pain very deliberately he put his hands in his pockets how long have you known she swallowed and struggled to keep her voice from shaking two weeks this time he turned away to stare at the wild roses without seeing them two weeks he repeated you didnt think it necessary to tell me i didnt know what to do the words came out in a rush of nerves and feelings we hadnt planned not yet and i thought it must be a mistake but she trailed off helplessly as he kept his back to her youve seen a doctor yes of course of course he repeated on a humorless laugh how far along are you she moistened her lips nearly two months two months caine thought two months their child had been growing and he hadnt known have you made any plans plans she thought wildly what plans could she make i dont know she threw her hands up to her face this wasnt like her where was her control her logic what kind of a mother would i make she demanded as her thoughts poured out into words i dont know anything about children i hardly had a chance to be one the pain shimmered through him very sharp and very real he made himself turn to face her diana are you telling me you dont want the baby not want she thought frantically what did he mean not want it was already real she could almost feel it in her arms it scared her to death its part of us she said jerkily how could i not want part of us its your baby im carrying your baby and i love it so much already it terrifies me oh diana he touched her then gently his hands on her face youve let two weeks go by when we could have been terrified together she let out a shuddering sigh caine afraid he was never afraid are you yeah he kissed a teardrop from her cheek yeah i am a couple months before mac was born justin told alan and me how he felt about becoming a father smiling he lifted both her hands and pressed his lips to the palms now i know ive felt so tied up her fingers tightened on his i wanted to tell you but i wasnt sure how youd feel it happened so fast we havent even finished the house yet and i thought i just wasnt sure how youd feel with their hands still joined he laid them on her stomach i love you he murmured both caine and his name was muffled against his mouth i have so much to learn in only seven months we have a lot to learn in seven months he corrected why dont we go upstairs he buried his face in her hair and drew in the scent expectant mothers should lie down he lifted his head to grin at her often with expectant fathers diana agreed laughing when he swept her into his arms it was going to be all right she thought her family was going to be just perfect gennie watched them disappear into the house whatever was between them she thought with a smile was apparently resolved what a relief surprised gennie turned to see serena and justin behind her serena carried the baby in a sling that strapped across her breasts intrigued by it gennie peeped down to see mac cradled snugly against his mother sleeping soundly serena hasnt been able to get close enough to diana to pry out what was troubling her justin put in i dont pry serena retorted then grinned very much youre sketching the house may i see obligingly gennie handed over the sketchbook as serena studied justin took gennies hand how are you she knew his meaning the last time she had seen him had been at angelas funeral the visit had been brief unintrusive and very important to her in the relatively short time theyd known each other justin had become a vital part of her family better she told him really i had to get away from the family for a while and their quiet continuous concern its helped she thought of grant and smiled a lot of things have helped youre in love with him justin stated now whos prying serena demanded i was making an observation he countered thats entirely different does he make you happy he asked then tugged on his wifes hair that was prying he pointed out gennie laughed and stuck her pencil behind her ear yes he makes me happy and he makes me unhappy thats all part of it isnt it oh yes serena leaned her head against her husbands shoulder she spotted grant as he came out the front door gennie she said laying a hand on her arm if hes too slow as some men are she added with a meaningful glance at justin i have a coin ill lend you at gennies baffled look she chuckled ask me about it sometime she hooked her arm through justins and wandered away making the suggestion that they see if anyone was using the pool gennie heard him murmur something that had serena giving a low delicious laugh family she thought it was wonderful to have stumbled on family this way her family and grants there was a bond here that might inch him closer to her happy she ran across the grass to meet him he caught her when she breathlessly launched herself into his arms whats all this i love you she said on a laugh is there anything else his arms tightened around her no chapter eleven contents prev next gennies life had always been full of people a variety of people from all walks of life but shed never met anyone quite like the clan macgregor before the end of the weekend drew near she felt shed known them forever daniel was loud and blustering and shrewd and so soft when it came to his family that he threatened to melt quite clearly they adored him enough to let him think he tugged their strings anna was as warm and calm as a summer shower and gennie knew intuitively strong enough to hold her family together in any crisis she with the gentlest of touches led her husband by the nose and he with all his shouts and wheezes knew it of the second generation she thought caine and serena the most alike volatile outspoken emotional they had their sires temperament yet when she speculated on alan she thought that the serious calm exterior hed inherited from anna covered a tremendous power and a temper that might be wicked when loosed hed found a good match in shelby campbell the macgregors had chosen contrasting partners justin with his gamblers stillness and secrets diana reserved and emotional shelby freewheeling and clever they made a fascinating group with interesting eddies and currents it didnt take much effort for gennie to persuade them to sit for a family sketch though they agreed quickly and unanimously it was another matter to settle them gennie wanted them in the throne room some seated some standing and this entailed a great deal of discussion on who did what ill hold the baby daniel announced then narrowed his eyes in case anyone wanted to argue the point you can do another next year lass he added to gennie when there was no opposition and ill be holding two he beamed at diana before he shifted his look to shelby or three you should have dad sitting in his throne chair alan amended quickly giving gennie one of his rare grins thatd make the clearest statement exactly her eyes danced as she kept her features sober and anna youll sit beside him perhaps youd hold your embroidery because it looks so natural the wives should sit at their husbands feet caine said smoothly thats natural there was general agreement among the men and definite scorn among the women i think well mix that up just a bit for esthetic purposes gennie said dryly over the din that ensued with the organization and brevity of a drill sergeant she began arranging them to her liking alan here she took him by the arm and stood him between his parents chairs and shelby she nudged shelby beside him caine you sit on the floor she tugged on his hand until grinning he obliged her and diana caine pulled his wife down on his lap before gennie could finish yes thatll do justin over here with rena and grant im not he began do as youre told boy daniel bellowed at him then spoke directly to his grandson leave it to a campbell to make trouble grumbling grant strolled over behind daniels chair and scowled down at him a fine thing when a campbells in a macgregor family portrait two campbells shelby reminded her brother with alacrity and how is gennie going to manage to sketch and sit at the same time even as gennie glanced at her in surprise daniels voice boomed out shell draw herself in shes a clever lass all right she agreed pleased with the challenge and her inclusion into the family scene now relax it wont take terribly long and its not like a photo where you have to sit perfectly still she perched herself on the end of the sofa and began using the small portable easel shed brought with her quite a colorful group she decided as she chose a pastel charcoal from her box well have to do this in oils sometime aye well want one for the gallery wont we anna a big one daniel grinned at the thought then settled back with the baby in the crook of his arm then alanll need his portrait done once hes settled in the white house he added complacently as gennie sketched alan sent his father a mild glance its a little premature to commission that just yet his arm went around shelby and stayed there hah daniel tickled his grandsons chin did you always want to paint gennie anna asked while she absently pushed the needle through her embroidery yes i suppose i did at least i can never remember wanting to do anything else caine wanted to be a doctor serena recalled with an innocent smile at least thats what he told all the little girls it was a natural aspiration caine defended himself lifting his hand to his mothers knee while his arm held diana firmly against him grant used a different approach shelby recalled i think he was fourteen when he talked deedee obrian into modeling for him in the nude that was strictly for the purpose of art he countered when gennie lifted a brow at him and i was fifteen life studies are an essential part of any art course gennie said as she started to draw again i remember one male model in particular she broke off as grants eyes narrowed ah that scowls very natural grant try not to lose it so you draw do you boy daniel sent him a speculative look it interested him particularly because he had yet to wheedle out of either grant or shelby how grant made his living ive been known to an artist eh i dont paint grant said as he leaned against daniels chair its a fine thing for a man and a woman to have a common interest daniel began in a pontificating voice makes a strong marriage i cant tell you how many times daniels assisted me in surgery anna put in mildly he huffed ive washed a few bloody knees in my time with these three and there was the time rena broke alans nose caine put in it was supposed to be yours his sister reminded him that didnt make it hurt any less alan shifted his eyes to his sister while his wife snorted unsympathetically why did rena break alans nose instead of yours diana wanted to know i ducked caine told her gennie let them talk around her while she sketched them quite a group she thought again as they argued and drew almost imperceptibly closer together grant said something to shelby that had her fuming then laughing he evaded another probe of daniels with a nonanswer then made a particularly apt comment on the press secretary that had alan roaring with laughter all in all gennie thought as she chose yet another pastel he fit in with them as though hed sprung from the same carton witty social amenable yet she could still see him alone on his cliff snarling at anyone who happened to make a wrong turn hed changed to suit the situation but he hadnt lost any of himself in the process he was amenable because he chose to be and that was that with a last glance at what she had done she looped her signature into the corner done she stated and turned her work to face the group the macgregors and company they surrounded her laughing each having a definite opinion on the others likenesses gennie felt a hand on her shoulder and knew without looking that it was grants its beautiful he murmured studying the way she had drawn herself at his side he bent over and kissed her ear so are you gennie laughed and the precious feeling of belonging stayed with her for days september hung poised in indian summer a glorious golden time when wildflowers still bloomed and the blueberry bushes flamed red gennie painted hour after hour discovering all the nooks and crannies of windy point grants routine had altered so subtly he never noticed he worked shorter hours but more intensely for the first time in years he was greedy for company gennies company she painted he drew and then they would come together some nights they spent in the big feather bed in her cottage sunk together in the center other mornings they would wake in his lighthouse to the call of gulls and the crash of waves occasionally he would surprise her by popping up unexpectedly where she was working sometimes with a bottle of wine sometimes with a bag of potato chips once hed brought her a handful of wildflowers shed been so touched shed wept on them until in frustration he had pulled her into the cottage and made love to her it was a peaceful time for both of them warm days cool nights cloudless skies added to the sense of serenity or perhaps of waiting this is perfect gennie shouted over the motor as grants boat cut through the sea it feels like we could go all the way to europe he laughed and ruffled her windtossed hair if youd mentioned it before id have put in a full tank of gas oh dont be practical imagine it she insisted we could be at sea for days and days and nights he bent over to catch the lobe of her ear between his teeth fullmooned sharkinfested nights she gave a low laugh and slid her hands up his chest wholl protect whom we scots are too tough sharks probably prefer more tender his tongue dipped into her ear french delicacies with a shiver of pleasure she rested against him and watched the boat plow through the waves the sun was sinking low the wind whipped by full of salt and sea but the warmth remained they skirted around one of the rocky deserted little islands and watched the gulls flow into the sky in the distance gennie could see some of the lobster boats chug their way back to the harbor at windy point the bell buoys clanged with sturdy precision perhaps summer would never really end she thought though the days were getting shorter and that morning thered been a hint of frost perhaps they could ride forever without any responsibilities calling them back with no vocation nagging she thought of the showing shed committed herself to in november new york was too far away the gray skies and naked trees of november too distant for some reason gennie felt it was of vital importance to think of now that moment so much could happen in two months hadnt she fallen in love in a fraction of that time shed planned to be back in new orleans by now it would be hot and humid there the streets would be crowded the traffic thick the sun would stream through the lacework of her balcony and shoot patterns onto the ground there was a pang of homesickness she loved the city its rich smells its oldworld charm and newworld bustle yet she loved it here as well the stark spaciousness the jagged cliffs and endless sea grant was here and that made all the difference she could give up new orleans for him if that was what he wanted a life here with him would be so easy to build and children she thought of the old farmhouse empty yet waiting within sight of the lighthouse there would be room for children in the big airy rooms she could have a studio on the top floor and grant would have his lighthouse when he needed his solitude when it was time to give a showing shed have his hand to hold and maybe those nerves would finally ease shed plant flowers high bushy geraniums softpetaled pansies and daffodils that would come back and multiply every spring at night she could listen to the sea and grants steady breathing beside her whatre you doing falling asleep he bent to kiss the top of her head just dreaming she murmured they were still just dreams i dont want the summer to end he felt a chill and drew her closer it has to sometime i like the sea in winter would she still be here with him then he wondered he wanted her and yet he didnt feel he could hold her he didnt feel he could go with her his life was so bound up in his need for solitude he knew hed lose part of himself if he opened too far she lived her life in the spotlight how much would she lose if he asked her to shut it off how could he ask and yet the thought of living without her was impossible to contemplate grant told himself he should never have let it come so far he told himself he wouldnt give back a minute of the time hed had with her the tugofwar went on within him hed let her go hed lock her in hed settle back into his own life hed beg her to stay as he turned the boat back toward shore he saw the sun spear into the water no summer should never end but it would youre quiet gennie murmured as he cut the engine and let the boat drift against the dock i was thinking he jumped out to secure the line then reached for her that i cant imagine this place without you gennie started nearly losing her balance as she stepped onto the pier its its nearly become home to me he looked down at the hand he held that beautiful capable artists hand tell me about your place in new orleans he asked abruptly as they began walking over the shaky wooden boards its in the french quarter i can see jackson square from the balcony with the artists stalls all around and the tourists and students roaming its loud she laughed remembering ive had my studio soundproofed but sometimes ill go downstairs so i can just listen to all the people and the music they climbed up the rough rocks and there was no sound but the sea and the gulls sometimes at night i like to go out and walk just listen to the music coming out of the doorways she took a deep breath of the tangy salty air it smells of whiskey and the mississippi and spice you miss it he murmured ive been away a long time they walked toward the lighthouse together i went away maybe ran away nearly seven months ago there was too much of angela there and i couldnt face it strange id gotten through a year though id made certain i was swamped with work then i woke up one morning and couldnt bear being there knowing she wasnt would never be she sighed perhaps it had taken that long for the shock to completely wear off when it got to the point where i had to force myself to drive around that city i knew i needed some distance youll have to go back grant said flatly and face it i already have she waited while he pushed open the door faced it yes though i still miss her dreadfully new orleans will only be that much more special because i had so much of her there places can hold us i suppose as they stepped inside she smiled at him this one holds you yes he thought he could feel winter creeping closer and drew her against him it gives me what i need her lashes lowered so that her eyes were only slits with the green light and glowing do i he crushed his mouth to hers so desperately she was shaken not by the force but by the emotion that seemed to explode from him without warning she yielded because it seemed to be the way for both of them and when she did he drew back struggling for control she was so small it was difficult to remember that when she was in his arms he was cold and god he needed her come upstairs he murmured she went silently aware that while his touch and his voice were gentle his mood was volatile it both intrigued and excited her the tension in him seemed to grow by leaps and bounds as they climbed toward the bedroom its like the first time she thought trembling once in anticipation or the last grant dont talk he nudged her onto the bed then slipped off her shoes when his hands wanted to rush to take he forced them to be slow and easy sitting beside her grant put them on her shoulders then ran them down her arms as he touched his mouth to hers the kiss was light almost teasing but gennie could feel the rushing pulsing passion beneath it his body was tense even as he nibbled drawing her bottom lip into his mouth stroking his thumb over her wrists he wasnt in a gentle mood yet he strove to be gentle she could smell the sea on him and it brought back memories of that first tumultuous lovemaking on the grass with lightning and thunder thats what he needed now and she discovered as her pulse began to thud under his thumbs it was what she needed her body didnt melt but coiled the sound wasnt a sigh but a moan as she dragged him against her and pressed her open mouth aggressively against his then he was like the lightning white heat cold fury as he crushed her beneath him on the bed his hands went wild seeking finding tugging at her clothes as though he couldnt touch her quickly enough his control snapped and in a chain reaction hers followed until they were tangled together in an embrace that spoke of loves violence demand after unrelenting demand they placed on each other fingers pressed mouths ravaged clothes were yanked away in a fury of impatience to possess hot damp skin it wasnt enough to touch they hurried to taste what was smooth and moist and salty from the sea and their mutual passion dark driving needs an inferno of wanting they gave over to both and took from each other and what was taken was replenished over and over as they loved with the boundless energy that springs from desperation urgent fingers possessed her an avid mouth conquered him the command belonged to neither but to the primitive urges that pounded through them shallow gasping breaths skin that trembled to the touch flavors dark and heated the scent of the sea and desire these clouded their minds to leave them victims as well as conquerers their eyes met once and each saw themselves trapped in the others mind then they were moving together racing toward delirium it was barely dawn when she woke the light was rosy and warm but there was a faint skim of frost on the window gennie knew immediately she was alone touching the sheets beside her she found them cold her body was sated from a long night of loving but she sat up and called his name the simple fact that he was up before her worried her she always woke first thinking of his mood the night before she wasnt certain whether to frown or smile his urgency had never depleted time and time again he had turned to her and their loving had retained that wild desperate flavor once when his hands and mouth had raced over her everywhere she thought he seemed bent on implanting all that she was onto his mind as if he were going away and taking only the memory of her with him shaking her head gennie got out of bed she was being foolish grant wasnt going anywhere if he had gotten up early it was because he couldnt sleep and hadnt wanted to disturb her how she wished he had hes only downstairs she told herself as she stepped into the hall hes sitting at the kitchen table having coffee and waiting for me but when she reached the stairwell she heard the radio low and indistinct puzzled she glanced up the sound was coming from above her not below odd she thought she hadnt imagined he used the third floor hed never mentioned it drawn by her curiosity gennie began the circular climb the radio grew louder as she approached though the news broadcast was muted and sounded eerily out of place in the silent lighthouse until that moment she hadnt realized how completely she had forgotten the outside world but for that one weekend at the macgregors her summer had been insular and bound up in grant alone she stopped in the doorway of a sunwashed room it was a studio hed cultivated the north light and space fleetingly her gaze skimmed over the racks of newspapers and magazines the television and the one sagging couch no easels no canvases but it was the den of an artist grants back was to her as he sat at his drawing board she smelled ink she realized and perhaps a trace of glue the glasstopped cabinet beside him held a variety of organized tools an architect she wondered confused no that didnt fit and surely no architect would resist using his skills on that farmhouse so close at hand he muttered to himself hunched over his work she might have smiled at that if she hadnt been so puzzled when he moved his hand she saw he held an artists brush sable and expensive and he held it with the ease of long practice but hed said he didnt paint gennie remembered baffled he didnt appear to be and what would a painter need with a compass and a t square one wouldnt paint facing a wall in any case but what was he doing before she could speak grant lifted his head in the mirror in front of him their eyes met he hadnt been able to sleep he hadnt been able to lie beside her and not want her somehow during the night hed convinced himself that they had to go their separate ways and that he could cope with it she lived in another world more than in another part of the country glamour was part of her life glamour and crowds and recognition simplicity was part of his simplicity and solitude and anonymity there was no mixing them hed gotten up in the dark deluding himself that he could work after nearly two hours of frustration he was beginning to succeed now she was here a part of that last portion of himself hed been determined to keep separate when she went away hed wanted to have at least one sanctuary too intrigued to notice his annoyance gennie crossed the room whatre you doing he didnt answer as she came beside him and frowned down at the paper attached to his board it was crisscrossed with lightblue lines and sectioned even when she saw the pen and ink drawings taking shape in the first section she wasnt certain what she was looking at not a blueprint surely she mused a mechanical some kind of commercial art perhaps fascinated she bent a bit closer to the first section then she recognized the figure oh cartoons pleased with the discovery she inched closer why ive seen this strip hundreds of times i love it she laughed and pushed the hair back over her shoulder youre a cartoonist thats right he didnt want her to be pleased or impressed it was simply what he did and no more and he knew if he didnt push her away then today hed never be able to do it again deliberately he set down his brush so this is how you set one of these up she continued caught up in the idea enchanted with it these blue lines youve struck on the paper are they for perspective how do you come up with something like this seven days a week he didnt want her to understand if she understood it would be nearly impossible to push her away its my job he said flatly im busy gennie i work on deadline im sorry she began automatically then caught the cool remote look in his eye it struck her suddenly that hed kept this from her this essential part of his life he hadnt told her more had made a point in not telling her it hurt she discovered as her initial pleasure faded it hurt like hell why didnt you tell me hed known she would ask but was no longer certain he had the real answer instead he shrugged it didnt come up didnt come up she repeated quietly staring at him no i suppose you made certain it didnt why could he explain that it was ingrained habit could he tell her the essential truth was that hed grown so used to keeping it and nearly everything else to himself he had done it without thinking then he had continued to do so in automatic defense if he kept this to himself he wouldnt have given her everything because to give her everything terrified him no it was too late for explanations it was time he remembered his policy of not giving them to anyone why should i have told you he countered this is my job it doesnt have anything to do with you the color drained dramatically from her face but as he turned to get off the stool grant didnt see nothing to do with me gennie echoed in a whisper your works important to you isnt it of course it is grant snapped its what i do what i am yes it would be she felt the cold flow over her until she was numb from it i shared your bed but not this stung he whirled back to her the wounded look in her eyes was the hardest thing hed ever faced what the hell does one have to do with the other what difference does it make what i do for a living i wouldnt have cared what you do i wouldnt have cared if you did nothing at all you lied to me i never lied to you he shouted perhaps i dont understand the fine line between deception and dishonesty listen my work is private thats the way i want it the explanation came tumbling out despite him angry and hot i do this because i love to do it not because i have to not because i need recognition recognitions the last thing i want he added while his eyes grew darker with temper i dont do lectures or workshops or press interviews because i dont want people breathing down my neck i choose anonymity just as you choose exposure because its what works for me this is my art this is my life and i intend to keep it just that way i see she was stiff from the pain shattered by the cold gennie understood grief well enough to know what she was feeling and telling me sharing this with me wouldve equaled exposure the truth is you didnt trust me you didnt trust me to keep your precious secret or to respect your precious lifestyle the truth is our lifestyles are completely opposite the hurt tore at him he was pushing her away he could feel it and even as he pushed he ached to pull her back theres no mixing what you need and what i need and coming out whole it has nothing to do with trust it always has to do with trust she countered he was looking at her now as he had that first time the angry remote stranger who wanted nothing more than to be left alone she was the intruder here as she had been a lifetime ago in a storm then at least she hadnt loved him you should have understood the word love before you used it grant or perhaps we should have understood each others conception of the word her voice was steady again rock steady as it only was when she held herself under rigid control to me it means trust and compromise and need those things dont apply for you damn it dont tell me how i think compromise he tossed back pacing the room what kind of compromise could we have made would you have married me and buried yourself here hell we both know the press would have sniffed you out even if you couldve stood it would you expect me to live in new orleans until my work fell apart and i was half mad to get out he whirled back to her his back to the east window so that the rising sun shot in and shimmered all around him how long would it take before someone got curious enough to dig into my life i have reasons for keeping to myself damn it and i dont have to justify them no you dont she wouldnt cry she told herself because once she began shed never stop but youll never know the answer to any of those questions will you because you never bothered to share them with me you didnt share them and you didnt share the reasons i suppose thats answer enough she turned and walked from the room and down the long winding stairs she didnt start to run until she was outside in the chill of the morning chapter twelve contents prev gennie looked at her cards and considered a nine and an eight she should play it safe with seventeen another card would be a foolish risk life was full of them she decided and signaled the dealer the four she drew made her smile ironically lucky at cards what was she doing sitting at a blackjack table at sevenfifteen on a sunday morning well she thought it was certainly a convenient way to pass the time more productive then pacing the floor or beating on a pillow shed already tried both of those yet somehow the streak of luck shed been enjoying for the past hour hadnt lightened her mood perversely she would have preferred it if shed lost resoundingly that way she would have had some new hook to hang her depression on restless she cashed in her chips and stuffed the winnings in her bag maybe she could lose them at the dice table later there was only a handful of people in the casino now a very small elderly lady sat on a stool at a slot machine and systematically fed in quarters occasionally gennie would hear the jingle of coins spill into the tray later the huge rather elegant room would fill then gennie could lose herself in the smoke and noise but for now she wandered out to the wide glass wall and looked out at the sea was this why she had come here instead of going home as she had intended when she had tossed her suitcase and painting gear into the car her only thought had been to get back to new orleans and pick up her life again shed made the detour almost before shed been aware of it yet now that she was here had been here for over two weeks she couldnt bring herself to walk out on that beach she could look at it yes and she could listen but she couldnt go to it why was she tormenting herself like this she wondered miserably why was she keeping herself within reach of what would always remind her of grant because she admitted no matter how many times shed told herself she had she had yet to accept the final break it was just as impossible for her to go back to him as it was for her to walk down to that bluegreen water hed rejected her and the hurt of it left her hollow i love you but no she couldnt understand that love meant anything was possible love meant making anything possible if his love had been real hed have understood that too shed have been better off resisting the urge to look up macintosh in the paper she wouldnt have seen that ridiculous and poignant strip where veronica had walked into his life it had made her laugh then remembering had made her cry what right did he have to use her in his work when he wouldnt share himself with her and hed used her again and again in dozens of papers across the country where readers were following macintoshs growing romance his overhishead dazedeyed involvement with the sexy alluring veronica it was funny and the touches of satire and cynicism made it funnier it was human hed taken the foolishness and the pitfalls of falling in love and had given them the touch every man or woman whod ever been there would understand each time she read the strip gennie could recognize something theyd done or something shed said though he had a way of tilting it to an odd angle with his penchant for privacy grant still vicariously shared his own emotional roller coaster with the public it made her ache to read it day after day day after day she read it up early gennie as a hand touched her shoulder she turned to justin ive always been a morning person she evaded then smiled at him i cleaned up at your tables he returned the smile while behind guarded eyes he assessed her she was pale still as pale as she had been when shed so suddenly checked into the comanche the pallor only accented the smudges of sleeplessness under her eyes she had a wounded look that he recognized because he too was deeply in love whatever had come between her and grant had left its mark on her how about some breakfast he slipped an arm over her shoulders before she could answer and began leading her toward his office im not really hungry justin she began you havent really been hungry for two weeks he guided her through the outer office into his private one then pushed the button on his elevator youre the only cousin i have whom i care about genvieve im tired of watching you waste away in front of my eyes im not she said indignantly then leaned her head against his arm theres nothing worse than having someone moping around feeling sorry for themselves is there a damned nuisance he agreed lightly as he drew her into the private car how much did you take me for in there it took her a minute to realize hed changed the subject oh i dont know five six hundred ill put breakfast on your tab he said as the doors opened to his and serenas suite her laugh pleased him as much as the hug she gave him just like a man serena stated as she came into the room waltzing in with a beautiful woman at the crack of dawn while the wife stays home and changes the baby she held a gurgling mac over her shoulder justin grinned at her nothing worse than a jealous woman lifting her elegant brows serena walked over and shifted the baby into his arms your turn she said smiling then collapsed into an armchair macs teething she told gennie and not being a terribly good sport about it you are justin told her as his son began to soothe sore gums on his shoulder serena grinned tucked up her feet and yawned hugely im assured this too shall pass have you two eaten ive just invited gennie to have some breakfast serena caught her husbands dry look and understood it railroaded would have been a more apt word she imagined good she said simply and picked up the phone one of the nicest things about living in a hotel is room service while serena ordered breakfast for three gennie wandered she liked this suite of rooms so full of warmth and color and personality if it had ever held the aura of a hotel room it had long since lost it the baby cooed as justin sat on the couch to play with him serenas low melodious voice spoke to the kitchen far below if you love enough gennie thought as she roamed to the window overlooking the beach if you want enough you can make a home anywhere rena and justin had wherever they decided to live and in whatever fashion they were family it was just that basic she knew they worked together to care for their child to run the casino and hotel they were a unit there were rough spots she was sure there had to be in any relationship particularly between two strongwilled personalities but they got through them because each was willing to bend when it was necessary to bend hadnt she been new orleans would have become a place to visit to see her family to stir old memories if the need arose she could have made her home on that rough coast of maine for him with him shed have been willing to give so much if only hed been willing to give in return perhaps it wasnt a matter of his being willing perhaps grant had simply not been able to give thats what she should accept once she did she could finally close the door the oceans beautiful isnt it serena said from behind her yes gennie turned her head ive gotten used to seeing it of course ive always lived with the river is that what youre going back to gennie turned back to the window in the end i suppose its the wrong choice gennie serena justin said warningly but she turned on him with her eyes flashing and her voice low with exasperation damn it justin shes miserable theres nothing like a stubborn pigheaded man to make a woman miserable is there gennie with a half laugh she dragged a hand through her hair no i dont guess there is that works both ways justin reminded her and if the mans pigheaded enough serena went on precisely its up to the woman to give him a push he didnt want me gennie said in a rush then stopped the words hurt but she could say them maybe it was time she did not really or at any rate not enough he simply wasnt willing to believe that there were ways we could have worked out whatever problems we had he wont share its as though hes determined not to it seemed we got close for that short amount of time in spite of him he didnt want to be in love with me he doesnt want to depend on anyone while she spoke justin rose and took mac into another room the tinkling music of his mobile drifted out gennie justin began when he came back in do you know about grant and shelbys father she let out a long sigh before she sank into a chair i know he died when grant was about seventeen was assassinated justin corrected and watched the horror cloud in her eyes senator robert campbell youd have been a child but you might remember she did vaguely the talk the television coverage the trial and grant had been there hadnt shelby said both she and grant had been there when their father was killed murdered right in front of their eyes oh god justin it mustve been horrible for them scars dont always heal cleanly he murmured touching an absent hand to his own side in a gesture his wife understood from what alans told me shelby carried around that fear and that pain for a long time i cant imagine it would be any different for grant sometimes his gaze drifted to serena youre afraid to get too close because then you can lose serena went to him to slip her hand into his dont you see he kept that from me too gennie grabbed the back of the armchair and squeezed she hurt for him for the boy and the man he wouldnt confide in me he wouldnt let me understand as long as therere secrets theres distance dont you believe he loves you serena asked gently not enough gennie said with a violent shake of her head id starve needing more shelby called last night serena said as the knock on the door announced breakfast as justin went to answer she gestured gennie toward the small dining area in front of the window grant surprised her and alan with a visit a few days ago is he no serena interrupted sitting hes back in maine now she did say he badgered her with questions of course she didnt have the answer until she spoke to me and found out you were here gennie frowned at the sea and said nothing she wondered if you were following macintosh in the papers it took me over two hours to figure why she would have asked that gennie turned back with a speculative look which serena met blandly perhaps im not following you she said automatically guarding grants secret serena took the pot the waiter placed on the table coffee veronica gennie let out an admiring laugh and nodded her head youre very quick rena i love puzzles she corrected and the pieces were all there that was the last thing we argued about gennie glanced at justin as he took his seat after adding cream to her coffee she simply toyed with the handle of the cup all the time we were together he never told me what he did then when i stumbled across it he was so angry as if i had invaded his privacy i was so pleased when i thought he simply wasnt doing anything with his talent i couldnt understand then to learn what he was doing something so clever and demanding she trailed off shaking her head he just never let me in maybe you didnt ask loud enough serena suggested if he rejected me again rena id fall apart its not a matter of pride really its more a matter of strength ive seen you making yourself sick with nerves before a showing justin reminded her but you always go through with it its one thing to expose yourself your feelings to the public and another to risk them with one person knowing there wouldnt be anything left if he didnt want them i have a showing coming up in november she said as she toyed with the eggs on her plate thats what i have to concentrate on now maybe youd like to glance at this while you eat justin slipped the comics section out of the paper the waiter had brought up gennie stared at it not wanting to see unable to resist after a moment she took it from his hand the sunday edition was large and brightly colored this macintosh was rather drab however and lostlooking in one glance she could see the hues were meant to indicate depression and loneliness she mused that grant knew how to immediately engage the readers attention and guide their mood in the first section macintosh himself was sitting alone his elbows on his knees his chin sunk in his hands no words or captions were needed to project the misery the readers sympathies were instantly aroused whod dumped on the poor guy this time at a knock on the door he mumbled it had to be mumbled come in but he didnt alter his position as ivan the russian émigré strolled in wearing his usual fanatically american attire western this time cowboy hat and boots included hey macintosh i got two tickets for the basketball game lets go check out the cheerleaders no response ivan pulled up a chair and tipped back his hat you can buy the beer its an american way of life well take your car no response but ill drive ivan said cheeringly nudging macintosh with the toe of his pointed boot oh hello ivan macintosh settled back into his gloom again hey man got a problem veronica left me ivan crossed one leg over the other and was obviously jiggling his foot oh yeah for some other guy huh no how come macintosh never altered positions and the very absence of action made the point because i was selfish rude arrogant dishonest stupid and generally nasty ivan considered the toe of his boot is that all yeah women ivan said with a shrug never satisfied gennie read the strip twice then looked up helplessly without a word serena took the paper from her hand and read it herself she chuckled once then set it back down want me to help you pack where the hell was she grant knew hed go mad if he asked himself the question one more time where the hell was she from the lookout deck of his lighthouse he could see for miles but he couldnt see gennie the wind slapped at his face as he stared out to sea and wondered what in gods name he was going to do forget her he might occasionally forget to eat or to sleep but he couldnt forget gennie unfortunately his memory was just as clear on the last ten minutes they had been together how could he have been such a fool oh it was easy grant thought in disgust hed had lots of practice if he hadnt spent those two days cursing her and himself stalking the beach one minute shut up in his studio the next he might not have been too late by the time hed realized hed cut out his own heart shed been gone the cottage had been closed up and the widow lawrence knew nothing and was saying less hed flown to new orleans and searched for her like a madman her apartment had been empty her neighbors hadnt heard a word even when hed located her grandmother by calling every grandeau in the phone book hed learned nothing more than that gennie was traveling traveling he thought yes she was traveling away from him just as fast as she could oh you deserve it campbell he berated himself you deserve to have her skip out of your life without a backward glance hed called the macgregors thank god hed gotten anna on the phone instead of daniel they hadnt heard from her not a sound she might have been anywhere nowhere if it hadnt been for the painting shed left behind he might have believed shed been a mirage after all shed left the painting for him he remembered the one shed finished the afternoon theyd become lovers but thered been no note hed wanted to fling it off the cliff hed hung it in his bedroom perhaps it was his sackcloth and ashes for every time he looked at it he suffered sooner or later he promised himself hed find her her name her picture would be in the paper hed track her down and bring her back bring her back hell grant thought dragging a hand through his hair hed beg plead grovel whatever it took to make her give him another chance it was her fault he decided with a quick switch back to fury her fault that he was acting like a maniac he hadnt had a decent nights sleep in over two weeks and the solitude hed always prized was threatening to smother him if he didnt find her soon hed lose what was left of his mind infuriated he swung away from the rail if he couldnt work he could go down to the beach maybe hed find some peace there everything looked the same gennie thought as she came to the end of the narrow bumpy road though summer had finally surrendered to fall nothing had really changed the sea still crashed and roared eating slowly at the rock the lighthouse still stood solitary and strong it had been foolish for her to have worried that she would find that something important perhaps essential had altered since shed left grant wouldnt have changed either on a deep breath she stepped from the car more than anything she didnt want him to change what made him uniquely grant campbell shed fallen in love with the rough exterior the reluctant sensitivity yes even the rudeness perhaps she was a fool she didnt want to change him all she wanted was his trust if shed misinterpreted that strip if he turned her away no she wasnt going to think about that she was going to concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other until she faced him again it was time she stopped being a coward about the things most vital to her life as soon as she touched the door handle gennie stopped he wasnt in there without knowing how or why she was absolutely certain of it the lighthouse was empty glancing back she saw his truck parked in its spot near the farmhouse was he out in his boat she wondered as she started around the side it was at the dock swaying gently at low tide then she knew and wondered she hadnt known from the first without hesitation she started for the cliff with his hands in his pockets and the wind tugging at his jacket grant walked along the shoreline so this was loneliness he thought hed lived alone for years without feeling it it was one more thing to lay at gennies feet how was it possible that one lone female could have changed the essence of his life with a calculated effort he worked himself into a temper anger didnt hurt when he found her and by god he would shed have a lot to answer for his life had been moving along exactly as hed wanted it before shed barged in on it love oh she could talk about love then disappear just because hed been an idiot he hadnt asked to need her shed hammered at him until hed weakened then shed taken off the minute he hurt her grant turned to the sea but shut his eyes god he had hurt her hed seen it on her face heard it in her voice how could he ever make up for that hed rather have seen anger or tears than that stricken look hed put in her eyes if he went back to new orleans she might be there now he could go back and if he couldnt find her he could wait she had to go back sooner or later the city meant too much to her damn it what was he doing standing there when he should be on a plane going south grant turned and stared now he was seeing things gennie watched him with a calmness that didnt reveal the thudding of her heart hed looked so alone not in that chosen solitary way he had but simply lonely perhaps shed imagined it because she wanted to believe hed been thinking of her gathering all her courage gennie crossed to him i want to know what you meant by this she reached in her pocket and pulled out the clipping of his sunday strip he stared at her he might see things he might even hear things but slowly he reached out and touched her face gennie her knees went weak resolutely gennie stiffened them she wasnt going to fall into his arms it would be so easy and it would solve nothing i want to know what this means she shoved the clipping into his hand off balance grant looked down at his work it hadnt been easy to get that into the papers so quickly hed had to pull all the strings at his disposal and work like a maniac himself if that was what brought her it had all been worth it it means what it says he managed staring at her again theres not a lot of subtlety in this particular strip she took the paper back from him and stuck it in her pocket it was something she intended to keep forever youve used me rather lavishly in your work recently she had to tilt back her head in order to keep her eyes level with his grant thought she looked more regal than ever if she turned her thumb down she could throw him to the lions didnt it occur to you to ask permission first artists privilege he felt the light spray hit his back saw it dampen her hair where the hell did you go he heard himself demand where the hell have you been her eyes narrowed thats my business isnt it oh no he grabbed her arms and shook oh no its not youre not going to walk out on me gennie set her teeth and waited until hed stopped shaking her if memory serves you did the walking figuratively before i did it literally all right i acted like an idiot you want an apology he shouted at her ill give you any kind you want ill he broke off his breath heaving oh god first and his mouth crushed down on hers his fingers digging into her shoulders the groan that was wrenched from him was only one more sign of a desperate need she was here she was his hed never let her go again his mind started to clear so that his own thoughts jabbed at him this wasnt how he wanted to do it this wasnt the way to make up for what hed done or hadnt done and it wasnt the way to show her how badly he wanted to make her happy with an effort grant drew her away and dropped his hands to his sides im sorry he began stiffly i didnt intend to hurt you not now not before if youd come inside we could talk what was this she wondered who was this she understood the man who had shaken her shouted at her the man who had dragged her into his arms full of need and fury but she had no idea who this man was who was standing in front of her offering a stilted apology gennies brows drew together she hadnt come all this way to talk to a stranger what the hells the matter with you she demanded ill let you know when you hurt me she shoved a finger into his chest and when i want an apology well talk all right she added flinging back her head and well talk right here what do you want in exasperation grant threw up his hands how was a man supposed to crawl properly when someone was kicking at him ill tell you what i want gennie shouted right back i want to know if you want to work this out or sneak back into your hole youre good at hiding out if thats what you want to keep doing just say so i am not hiding out he said evenly and between his teeth i live here because i like it here because i can work here without having someone knocking on the door or ringing the phone every five minutes she gave him a long level look edged with fury thats not what im talking about and you know it yes he knew it frustrated he stuck his hands in his pockets to keep from shaking her again okay i kept things from you im used to keeping things to myself its habit and then and then i kept things from you because the harder i fell in love with you the more terrified i was look damn it i didnt want to depend on anyone for he broke off to drag a hand through his hair for what for being there when i needed them he said on a long breath where had that been hiding he wondered a great deal more surprised by his words than gennie was i should tell you about my father she touched him then her eyes softening for the first time justin told me grant stiffened instantly and turned away were you going to keep that from me too grant i wanted to tell you myself he managed after a moment explain make you understand i do understand she told him enough at least weve both lost people we loved very much and depended on in our own ways it seems to me weve compensated for the loss in our own ways as well i do understand what its like to have someone you love die suddenly right in front of your eyes grant heard her voice thicken and turned he couldnt handle tears now not when he was so tightly strung himself dont its something you have to put aside never away but aside i thought i had but it crept back up on me when i got involved with you she nodded and swallowed this wasnt the time for tears or a time to dwell on the past you wanted me to go that day maybe yes he looked past her to the top of the cliff i thought it was the only way for both of us maybe it still is i just cant live with it confused she put a hand on his arm why do you think being apart might be the best thing weve chosen to live in two totally different worlds gennie and both of us were content before we met now now she said firing up again now what are you still so stubborn you wont consider compromise he looked at her blankly why was she talking about compromises when he was about to fold up everything and go with her anywhere compromise you dont even know the meaning of the word for someone as clever and astute as you are youre a closedminded fool furious she turned to stalk away wait grant grabbed her arm so quickly she stumbled back against him youre not listening to me ill sell the land give it away if you want well live in new orleans damn it ill take out a front page ad declaring myself as macintoshs artist if itll make you happy we can have our picture plastered on every magazine in the country is that what you think i want shed thought hed already made her as angry as she was capable of getting a dozen times during their relationship nothing had ever compared to this you simple egotistical ass i dont care whether you write your strip in blood under the cover of darkness i dont care if you pose for a hundred magazines or snarl at the paparazzi sell the land she continued while he tried to keep up why in gods name would you do that everythings black and white to you compromise gennie raged at him it means give and take do you think i care where i live i dont know what little patience he had snapped i only know youve lived a certain way you were happy youve got roots in new orleans family ill always have roots and family in new orleans it doesnt mean i have to be there twelve months out of the year she dragged both hands through her hair holding it back from her face a moment as she wondered how such an intelligent man could be so dense and yes ive lived a certain way and i can live a different way to a point i couldnt stop being an artist for you because id stop being me i have a show to deal with in november i need the shows and i need you to be with me but there are other things i can give back if youd only meet me halfway if i made the ridiculous move of falling in love with you why would i want you to give up everything you are now he stared at her willing himself to be calm why was she making so much sense and he so little what do you want he began then held up a hand before she could shout at him compromise he finished more she lifted her chin but her eyes were more uncertain than arrogant i need you to trust me gennie he took her hand and linked fingers i do thats what ive been trying to tell you you havent been doing a good job of it no he drew her closer let me try again he kissed her telling himself to be gentle and easy with her but his arms locked and tightened his mouth hungered the spray shimmered over both of them as they stood entangled youre the whole focus of my world he murmured after you left i went crazy i flew down to new orleans and you did stunned she drew back to look at him you went after me with various purposes in mind he muttered first i was going to strangle you then i was going to crawl then i was going to just drag you back and lock you upstairs smiling she rested her head on his chest and now now he kissed her hair we compromise ill let you live good start with a sigh she closed her eyes i want to watch the sea in winter he tilted her face to his we will there is something else before or after i make love to you laughing she pulled away from him it better be before since you havent mentioned marriage yet it falls to me gennie no this is one time well do it all my way she drew out the coin serena had given her before shed left the comanche and in a way its a kind of compromise heads we get married tails we dont grant grabbed her wrist before she could toss youre not going to play games with something like that genvieve unless thats a twoheaded coin she smiled it certainly is surprise came first then his grin toss it i like the odds
