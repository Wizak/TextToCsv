barbox brothers i guard what place is this mugby junction sir a windy place yes it mostly is sir and looks comfortless indeed yes it generally does sir is it a rainy night still pours sir open the door ill get out youll have sir said the guard glistening with drops of wet and looking at the tearful face of his watch by the light of his lantern as the traveller descended three minutes here more i thinkfor i am not going on thought you had a through ticket sir so i have but i shall sacrifice the rest of it i want my luggage please to come to the van and point it out sir be good enough to look very sharp sir not a moment to spare the guard hurried to the luggage van and the traveller hurried after him the guard got into it and the traveller looked into it those two large black portmanteaus in the corner where your light shines those are mine name upon em sir barbox brothers stand clear sir if you please one two right lamp waved signal lights ahead already changing shriek from engine train gone mugby junction said the traveller pulling up the woollen muffler round his throat with both hands at past three oclock of a tempestuous morning so he spoke to himself there was no one else to speak to perhaps though there had been any one else to speak to he would have preferred to speak to himself speaking to himself he spoke to a man within five years of fifty either way who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire a man of pondering habit brooding carriage of the head and suppressed internal voice a man with many indications on him of having been much alone he stood unnoticed on the dreary platform except by the rain and by the wind those two vigilant assailants made a rush at him very well said he yielding it signifies nothing to me to what quarter i turn my face thus at mugby junction at past three oclock of a tempestuous morning the traveller went where the weather drove him not but what he could make a stand when he was so minded for coming to the end of the roofed shelter it is of considerable extent at mugby junction and looking out upon the dark night with a yet darker spiritwing of storm beating its wild way through it he faced about and held his own as ruggedly in the difficult direction as he had held it in the easier one thus with a steady step the traveller went up and down up and down up and down seeking nothing and finding it a place replete with shadowy shapes this mugby junction in the black hours of the fourandtwenty mysterious goods trains covered with palls and gliding on like vast weird funerals conveying themselves guiltily away from the presence of the few lighted lamps as if their freight had come to a secret and unlawful end half miles of coal pursuing in a detective manner following when they lead stopping when they stop backing when they back red hot embers showering out upon the ground down this dark avenue and down the other as if torturing fires were being raked clear concurrently shrieks and groans and grinds invading the ear as if the tortured were at the height of their suffering ironbarred cages full of cattle jangling by midway the drooping beasts with horns entangled eyes frozen with terror and mouths too at least they have long icicles or what seem so hanging from their lips unknown languages in the air conspiring in red green and white characters an earthquake accompanied with thunder and lightning going up express to london now all quiet all rusty wind and rain in possession lamps extinguished mugby junction dead and indistinct with its robe drawn over its head like csar now too as the belated traveller plodded up and down a shadowy train went by him in the gloom which was no other than the train of a life from whatsoever intangible deep cutting or dark tunnel it emerged here it came unsummoned and unannounced stealing upon him and passing away into obscurity here mournfully went by a child who had never had a childhood or known a parent inseparable from a youth with a bitter sense of his namelessness coupled to a man the enforced business of whose best years had been distasteful and oppressive linked to an ungrateful friend dragging after him a woman once beloved attendant with many a clank and wrench were lumbering cares dark meditations huge dim disappointments monotonous years a long jarring line of the discords of a solitary and unhappy existence yours sir the traveller recalled his eyes from the waste into which they had been staring and fell back a step or so under the abruptness and perhaps the chance appropriateness of the question o my thoughts were not here for the moment yes yes those two portmanteaus are mine are you a porter on porters wages sir but i am lamps the traveller looked a little confused who did you say you are lamps sir showing an oily cloth in his hand as further explanation surely surely is there any hotel or tavern here not exactly here sir there is a refreshment room here but lamps with a mighty serious look gave his head a warning roll that plainly addedbut its a blessed circumstance for you that its not open you couldnt recommend it i see if it was available ask your pardon sir if it was open it aint my place as a paid servant of the company to give my opinion on any of the companys toepics he pronounced it more like toothpicks beyond lampile and cottons returned lamps in a confidential tone but speaking as a man i wouldnt recommend my father if he was to come to life again to go and try how hed be treated at the refreshment room not speaking as a man no i would not the traveller nodded conviction i suppose i can put up in the town there is a town here for the traveller though a stayathome compared with most travellers had been like many others carried on the steam winds and the iron tides through that junction before without having ever as one might say gone ashore there o yes theres a town sir anyways theres town enough to put up in but following the glance of the other at his luggage this is a very dead time of the night with us sir the deadest time i might amost call it our deadest and buriedest time no porters about well sir you see returned lamps confidential again they in general goes off with the gas thats how it is and they seem to have overlooked you through your walking to the furder end of the platform but in about twelve minutes or so she may be up who may be up the three fortytwo sir she goes off in a sidin till the up x passes and then she here an air of hopeful vagueness pervaded lamps doos all as lays in her power i doubt if i comprehend the arrangement i doubt if anybody do sir shes a parliamentary sir and you see a parliamentary or a skirmishun do you mean an excursion thats it sira parliamentary or a skirmishun she mostly doos go off into a sidin but when she can get a chance shes whistled out of it and shes whistled up into doin all as lamps again wore the air of a highly sanguine man who hoped for the best all as lays in her power he then explained that porters on duty being required to be in attendance on the parliamentary matron in question would doubtless turn up with the gas in the meantime if the gentleman would not very much object to the smell of lampoil and would accept the warmth of his little roomthe gentleman being by this time very cold instantly closed with the proposal a greasy little cabin it was suggestive to the sense of smell of a cabin in a whaler but there was a bright fire burning in its rusty grate and on the floor there stood a wooden stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps ready for carriage service they made a bright show and their light and the warmth accounted for the popularity of the room as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on a form by the fire and many rounded smears and smudges of stooping velveteen shoulders on the adjacent wall various untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and oilcans and also a fragrant collection of what looked like the pockethandkerchiefs of the whole lamp family as barbox brothers so to call the traveller on the warranty of his luggage took his seat upon the form and warmed his now ungloved hands at the fire he glanced aside at a little deal desk much blotched with ink which his elbow touched upon it were some scraps of coarse paper and a superannuated steel pen in very reduced and gritty circumstances from glancing at the scraps of paper he turned involuntarily to his host and said with some roughness why you are never a poet man lamps had certainly not the conventional appearance of one as he stood modestly rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so exceedingly oily that he might have been in the act of mistaking himself for one of his charges he was a spare man of about the barbox brothers time of life with his features whimsically drawn upward as if they were attracted by the roots of his hair he had a peculiarly shining transparent complexion probably occasioned by constant oleaginous application and his attractive hair being cut short and being grizzled and standing straight up on end as if it in its turn were attracted by some invisible magnet above it the top of his head was not very unlike a lampwick but to be sure its no business of mine said barbox brothers that was an impertinent observation on my part be what you like some people sir remarked lamps in a tone of apology are sometimes what they dont like nobody knows that better than i do sighed the other i have been what i dont like all my life when i first took sir resumed lamps to composing little comicsongslike barbox brothers eyed him with great disfavour to composing little comicsongslikeand what was more hardto singing em afterwards said lamps it went against the grain at that time it did indeed something that was not all oil here shining in lampss eye barbox brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted looked at the fire and put a foot on the top bar why did you do it then he asked after a short pause abruptly enough but in a softer tone if you didnt want to do it why did you do it where did you sing them publichouse to which mr lamps returned the curious reply bedside at this moment while the traveller looked at him for elucidation mugby junction started suddenly trembled violently and opened its gas eyes shes got up lamps announced excited what lays in her power is sometimes more and sometimes less but its laid in her power to get up tonight by george the legend barbox brothers in large white letters on two black surfaces was very soon afterwards trundling on a truck through a silent street and when the owner of the legend had shivered on the pavement half an hour what time the porters knocks at the inn door knocked up the whole town first and the inn last he groped his way into the close air of a shutup house and so groped between the sheets of a shutup bed that seemed to have been expressly refrigerated for him when last made ii you remember me young jackson what do i remember if not you you are my first remembrance it was you who told me that was my name it was you who told me that on every twentieth of december my life had a penitential anniversary in it called a birthday i suppose the last communication was truer than the first what am i like young jackson you are like a blight all through the year to me you hardlined thinlipped repressive changeless woman with a wax mask on you are like the devil to me most of all when you teach me religious things for you make me abhor them you remember me mr young jackson in another voice from another quarter most gratefully sir you were the ray of hope and prospering ambition in my life when i attended your course i believed that i should come to be a great healer and i felt almost happyeven though i was still the one boarder in the house with that horrible mask and ate and drank in silence and constraint with the mask before me every day as i had done every every every day through my schooltime and from my earliest recollection what am i like mr young jackson you are like a superior being to me you are like nature beginning to reveal herself to me i hear you again as one of the hushed crowd of young men kindling under the power of your presence and knowledge and you bring into my eyes the only exultant tears that ever stood in them you remember me mr young jackson in a grating voice from quite another quarter too well you made your ghostly appearance in my life one day and announced that its course was to be suddenly and wholly changed you showed me which was my wearisome seat in the galley of barbox brothers when they were if they ever were is unknown to me there was nothing of them but the name when i bent to the oar you told me what i was to do and what to be paid you told me afterwards at intervals of years when i was to sign for the firm when i became a partner when i became the firm i know no more of it or of myself what am i like mr young jackson you are like my father i sometimes think you are hard enough and cold enough so to have brought up an unacknowledged son i see your scanty figure your close brown suit and your tight brown wig but you too wear a wax mask to your death you never by a chance remove itit never by a chance falls offand i know no more of you throughout this dialogue the traveller spoke to himself at his window in the morning as he had spoken to himself at the junction overnight and as he had then looked in the darkness a man who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire so he now looked in the sunlight an ashier grey like a fire which the brightness of the sun put out the firm of barbox brothers had been some offshoot or irregular branch of the public notary and billbroking tree it had gained for itself a griping reputation before the days of young jackson and the reputation had stuck to it and to him as he had imperceptibly come into possession of the dim den up in the corner of a court off lombardstreet on whose grimy windows the inscription barbox brothers had for many long years daily interposed itself between him and the sky so he had insensibly found himself a personage held in chronic distrust whom it was essential to screw tight to every transaction in which he engaged whose word was never to be taken without his attested bond whom all dealers with openly set up guards and wards against this character had come upon him through no act of his own it was as if the original barbox had stretched himself down upon the officefloor and had thither caused to be conveyed young jackson in his sleep and had there effected a metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him the discoveryaided in its turn by the deceit of the only woman he had ever loved and the deceit of the only friend he had ever made who eloped from him to be married togetherthe discovery so followed up completed what his earliest rearing had begun he shrank abashed within the form of barbox and lifted up his head and heart no more but he did at last effect one great release in his condition he broke the oar he had plied so long and he scuttled and sank the galley he prevented the gradual retirement of an old conventional business from him by taking the initiative and retiring from it with enough to live on though after all with not too much he obliterated the firm of barbox brothers from the pages of the postoffice directory and the face of the earth leaving nothing of it but its name on two portmanteaus for one must have some name in going about for people to pick up he explained to mugby highstreet through the innwindow and that name at least was real once whereas young jacksonnot to mention its being a sadly satirical misnomer for old jackson he took up his hat and walked out just in time to see passing along on the opposite side of the way a velveteen man carrying his days dinner in a small bundle that might have been larger without suspicion of gluttony and pelting away towards the junction at a great pace theres lamps said barbox brother and bytheby ridiculous surely that a man so serious so selfcontained and not yet three days emancipated from a routine of drudgery should stand rubbing his chin in the street in a brown study about comic songs bedside said barbox brothers testily sings them at the bedside why at the bedside unless he goes to bed drunk does i shouldnt wonder but its no business of mine let me see mugby junction mugby junction where shall i go next as it came into my head last night when i woke from an uneasy sleep in the carriage and found myself here i can go anywhere from here where shall i go ill go and look at the junction by daylight theres no hurry and i may like the look of one line better than another but there were so many lines gazing down upon them from a bridge at the junction it was as if the concentrating companies formed a great industrial exhibition of the works of extraordinary groundspiders that spun iron and then so many of the lines went such wonderful ways so crossing and curving among one another that the eye lost them and then some of them appeared to start with the fixed intention of going five hundred miles and all of a sudden gave it up at an insignificant barrier or turned off into a workshop and then others like intoxicated men went a little way very straight and surprisingly slued round and came back again and then others were so chockfull of trucks of coal others were so blocked with trucks of casks others were so gorged with trucks of ballast others were so set apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cottonreels while others were so bright and clear and others were so delivered over to rust and ashes and idle wheelbarrows out of work with their legs in the air looking much like their masters on strike that there was no beginning middle or end to the bewilderment barbox brothers stood puzzled on the bridge passing his right hand across the lines on his forehead which multiplied while he looked down as if the railway lines were getting themselves photographed on that sensitive plate then was heard a distant ringing of bells and blowing of whistles then puppetlooking heads of men popped out of boxes in perspective and popped in again then prodigious wooden razors set up on end began shaving the atmosphere then several locomotive engines in several directions began to scream and be agitated then along one avenue a train came in then along another two trains appeared that didnt come in but stopped without then bits of trains broke off then a struggling horse became involved with them then the locomotives shared the bits of trains and ran away with the whole i have not made my next move much clearer by this no hurry no need to make up my mind today or tomorrow nor yet the day after ill take a walk it fell out somehow perhaps he meant it should that the walk tended to the platform at which he had alighted and to lampss room but lamps was not in his room a pair of velveteen shoulders were adapting themselves to one of the impressions on the wall by lampss fireplace but otherwise the room was void in passing back to get out of the station again he learnt the cause of this vacancy by catching sight of lamps on the opposite line of railway skipping along the top of a train from carriage to carriage and catching lighted namesakes thrown up to him by a coadjutor he is busy he has not much time for composing or singing comic songs this morning i take it the direction he pursued now was into the country keeping very near to the side of one great line of railway and within easy view of others i have half a mind he said glancing around to settle the question from this point by saying ill take this set of rails or that or tother and stick to it they separate themselves from the confusion out here and go their ways ascending a gentle hill of some extent he came to a few cottages there looking about him as a very reserved man might who had never looked about him in his life before he saw some six or eight young children come merrily trooping and whooping from one of the cottages and disperse but not until they had all turned at the little garden gate and kissed their hands to a face at the upper window a low window enough although the upper for the cottage had but a story of one room above the ground now that the children should do this was nothing but that they should do this to a face lying on the sill of the open window turned towards them in a horizontal position and apparently only a face was something noticeable he looked up at the window again could only see a very fragile though a very bright face lying on one cheek on the windowsill the delicate smiling face of a girl or woman framed in long bright brown hair round which was tied a light blue band or fillet passing under the chin he walked on turned back passed the window again shyly glanced up again no change he struck off by a winding branchroad at the top of the hillwhich he must otherwise have descendedkept the cottages in view worked his way round at a distance so as to come out once more into the main road and be obliged to pass the cottages again the face still lay on the windowsill but not so much inclined towards him and now there were a pair of delicate hands too they had the action of performing on some musical instrument and yet it produced no sound that reached his ears mugby junction must be the maddest place in england said barbox brothers pursuing his way down the hill the first thing i find here is a railway porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside the second thing i find here is a face and a pair of hands playing a musical instrument that dont play the day was a fine bright day in the early beginning of november the air was clear and inspiriting and the landscape was rich in beautiful colours the prevailing colours in the court off lombardstreet london city had been few and sombre sometimes when the weather elsewhere was very bright indeed the dwellers in those tents enjoyed a pepperandsaltcoloured day or two but their atmospheres usual wear was slate or snuff colour he relished his walk so well that he repeated it next day he was a little earlier at the cottage than on the day before and he could hear the children upstairs singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their hands still there is no sound of any musical instrument he said listening at the corner and yet i saw the performing hands again as i came by what are the children singing why good lord they can never be singing the multiplicationtable they were though and with infinite enjoyment the mysterious face had a voice attached to it which occasionally led or set the children right its musical cheerfulness was delightful the measure at length stopped and was succeeded by a murmuring of young voices and then by a short song which he made out to be about the current month of the year and about what work it yielded to the labourers in the fields and farmyards then there was a stir of little feet and the children came trooping and whooping out as on the previous day and again as on the previous day they all turned at the garden gate and kissed their handsevidently to the face on the windowsill though barbox brothers from his retired post of disadvantage at the corner could not see it but as the children dispersed he cut off one small stragglera brown faced boy with flaxen hairand said to him come here little one tell me whose house is that the child with one swarthy arm held up across his eyes half in shyness and half ready for defence said from behind the inside of his elbow phbes and who said barbox brothers quite as much embarrassed by his part in the dialogue as the child could possibly be by his is phbe to which the child made answer why phbe of course the small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely and had taken his moral measure he lowered his guard and rather assumed a tone with him as having discovered him to be an unaccustomed person in the art of polite conversation phbe said the child cant be anybobby else but phbe can she no i suppose not well returned the child then why did you ask me deeming it prudent to shift his ground barbox brothers took up a new position what do you do there up there in that room where the open window is what do you do there cool said the child eh coool the child repeated in a louder voice lengthening out the word with a fixed look and great emphasis as much as to say whats the use of your having grown up if youre such a donkey as not to understand me ah school school said barbox brothers yes yes yes and phbe teaches you the child nodded good boy tound it out have you said the child yes i have found it out what would you do with twopence if i gave it you pend it the knockdown promptitude of this reply leaving him not a leg to stand upon barbox brothers produced the twopence with great lameness and withdrew in a state of humiliation but seeing the face on the windowsill as he passed the cottage he acknowledged its presence there with a gesture which was not a nod not a bow not a removal of his hat from his head but was a diffident compromise between or struggle with all three the eyes in the face seemed amused or cheered or both and the lips modestly said good day to you sir i find i must stick for a time to mugby junction said barbox brothers with much gravity after once more stopping on his return road to look at the lines where they went their several ways so quietly i cant make up my mind yet which iron road to take in fact i must get a little accustomed to the junction before i can decide so he announced at the inn that he was going to stay on for the present and improved his acquaintance with the junction that night and again next morning and again next night and morning going down to the station mingling with the people there looking about him down all the avenues of railway and beginning to take an interest in the incomings and outgoings of the trains at first he often put his head into lampss little room but he never found lamps there a pair or two of velveteen shoulders he usually found there stooping over the fire sometimes in connexion with a clasped knife and a piece of bread and meat but the answer to his inquiry wheres lamps was either that he was tother side the line or that it was his offtime or in the latter case his own personal introduction to another lamps who was not his lamps however he was not so desperately set upon seeing lamps now but he bore the disappointment nor did he so wholly devote himself to his severe application to the study of mugby junction as to neglect exercise on the contrary he took a walk every day and always the same walk but the weather turned cold and wet again and the window was never open iii at length after a lapse of some days there came another streak of fine bright hardy autumn weather it was a saturday the window was open and the children were gone not surprising this for he had patiently watched and waited at the corner until they were gone good day he said to the face absolutely getting his hat clear off his head this time good day to you sir i am glad you have a fine sky again to look at thank you sir it is kind of you you are an invalid i fear no sir i have very good health but are you not always lying down o yes i am always lying down because i cannot sit up but i am not an invalid the laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great mistake would you mind taking the trouble to come in sir there is a beautiful view from this window and you would see that i am not at all illbeing so good as to care it was said to help him as he stood irresolute but evidently desiring to enter with his diffident hand on the latch of the garden gate it did help him and he went in the room upstairs was a very clean white room with a low roof its only inmate lay on a couch that brought her face on a level with the window the couch was white too and her simple dress or wrapper being light blue like the band around her hair she had an ethereal look and a fanciful appearance of lying among clouds he felt that she instinctively perceived him to be by habit a downcast taciturn man it was another help to him to have established that understanding so easily and got it over there was an awkward constraint upon him nevertheless as he touched her hand and took a chair at the side of her couch i see now he began not at all fluently how you occupy your hands only seeing you from the path outside i thought you were playing upon something she was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making lace a lacepillow lay upon her breast and the quick movements and changes of her hands upon it as she worked had given them the action he had misinterpreted that is curious she answered with a bright smile for i often fancy myself that i play tunes while i am at work have you any musical knowledge she shook her head i think i could pick out tunes if i had any instrument which could be made as handy to me as my lacepillow but i dare say i deceive myself at all events i shall never know you have a musical voice excuse me i have heard you sing with the children she answered slightly colouring o yes i sing with the dear children if it can be called singing barbox brothers glanced at the two small forms in the room and hazarded the speculation that she was fond of children and that she was learned in new systems of teaching them very fond of them she said shaking her head again but i know nothing of teaching beyond the interest i have in it and the pleasure it gives me when they learn perhaps your overhearing my little scholars sing some of their lessons has led you so far astray as to think me a grand teacher ah i thought so no i have only read and been told about that system it seemed so pretty and pleasant and to treat them so like the merry robins they are that i took up with it in my little way you dont need to be told what a very little way mine is sir she added with a glance at the small forms and round the room all this time her hands were busy at her lacepillow as they still continued so and as there was a kind of substitute for conversation in the click and play of its pegs barbox brothers took the opportunity of observing her he guessed her to be thirty the charm of her transparent face and large bright brown eyes was not that they were passively resigned but that they were actively and thoroughly cheerful even her busy hands which of their own thinness alone might have besought compassion plied their task with a gay courage that made mere compassion an unjustifiable assumption of superiority and an impertinence he saw her eyes in the act of rising towards his and he directed his towards the prospect saying beautiful indeed most beautiful sir i have sometimes had a fancy that i would like to sit up for once only to try how it looks to an erect head but what a foolish fancy that would be to encourage it cannot look more lovely to any one than it does to me her eyes were turned to it as she spoke with most delighted admiration and enjoyment there was not a trace in it of any sense of deprivation and those threads of railway with their puffs of smoke and steam changing places so fast make it so lively for me she went on i think of the number of people who can go where they wish on their business or their pleasure i remember that the puffs make signs to me that they are actually going while i look and that enlivens the prospect with abundance of company if i want company there is the great junction too i dont see it under the foot of the hill but i can very often hear it and i always know it is there it seems to join me in a way to i dont know how many places and things that i shall never see with an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined himself to something he had never seen he said constrainedly just so and so you see sir pursued phbe i am not the invalid you thought me and i am very well off indeed you have a happy disposition said barbox brothers perhaps with a slight excusatory touch for his own disposition ah but you should know my father she replied his is the happy dispositiondont mind sir for his reserve took the alarm at a step upon the stairs and he distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome intruder this is my father coming the door opened and the father paused there why lamps exclaimed barbox brothers starting from his chair how do you do lamps to which lamps responded the gentleman for nowhere how do you do sir and they shook hands to the greatest admiration and surprise of lampss daughter i have looked you up half a dozen times since that night said barbox brothers but have never found you so ive heerd on sir so ive heerd on returned lamps its your being noticed so often down at the junction without taking any train that has begun to get you the name among us of the gentleman for nowhere no offence in my having called you by it when took by surprise i hope sir none at all its as good a name for me as any other you could call me by but may i ask you a question in the corner here lamps suffered himself to be led aside from his daughters couch by one of the buttons of his velveteen jacket is this the bedside where you sing your songs lamps nodded the gentleman for nowhere clapped him on the shoulder and they faced about again upon my word my dear said lamps then to his daughter looking from her to her visitor it is such an amaze to me to find you brought acquainted with this gentleman that i must if this gentleman will excuse me take a rounder mr lamps demonstrated in action what this meant by pulling out his oily handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball and giving himself an elaborate smear from behind the right ear up the cheek across the forehead and down the other cheek to behind his left ear after this operation he shone exceedingly its according to my custom when particular warmed up by any agitation sir he offered by way of apology and really i am throwed into that state of amaze by finding you brought acquainted with phbe that ithat i think i will if youll excuse me take another rounder which he did seeming to be greatly restored by it they were now both standing by the side of her couch and she was working at her lacepillow your daughter tells me said barbox brothers still in a half reluctant shamefaced way that she never sits up no sir nor never has done you see her mother who died when she was a year and two months old was subject to very bad fits and as she had never mentioned to me that she was subject to fits they couldnt be guarded against consequently she dropped the baby when took and this happened it was very wrong of her said barbox brothers with a knitted brow to marry you making a secret of her infirmity well sir pleaded lamps in behalf of the longdeceased you see phbe and me we have talked that over too and lord bless us such a number on us has our infirmities what with fits and what with misfits of one sort and another that if we confessed to em all before we got married most of us might never get married might not that be for the better not in this case sir said phbe giving her hand to her father no not in this case sir said her father patting it between his own you correct me returned barbox brothers with a blush and i must look so like a brute that at all events it would be superfluous in me to confess to that infirmity i wish you would tell me a little more about yourselves i hardly know how to ask it of you for i am conscious that i have a bad stiff manner a dull discouraging way with me but i wish you would with all our hearts sir returned lamps gaily for both and first of all that you may know my name stay interposed the visitor with a slight flush what signifies your name lamps is name enough for me i like it it is bright and expressive what do i want more why to be sure sir returned lamps i have in general no other name down at the junction but i thought on account of your being here as a firstclass single in a private character that you might the visitor waved the thought away with his hand and lamps acknowledged the mark of confidence by taking another rounder you are hardworked i take for granted said barbox brothers when the subject of the rounder came out of it much dirtier than he went into it lamps was beginning not particular sowhen his daughter took him up o yes sir he is very hardworked fourteen fifteen eighteen hours a day sometimes twentyfour hours at a time and you said barbox brothers what with your school phbe and what with your lacemaking but my school is a pleasure to me she interrupted opening her brown eyes wider as if surprised to find him so obtuse i began it when i was but a child because it brought me and other children into company dont you see that was not work i carry it on still because it keeps children about me that is not work i do it as love not as work then my lacepillow her busy hands had stopped as if her argument required all her cheerful earnestness but now went on again at the name it goes with my thoughts when i think and it goes with my tunes when i hum any and thats not work why you yourself thought it was music you know sir and so it is to me everything is cried lamps radiantly everything is music to her sir my father is at any rate said phbe exultingly pointing her thin forefinger at him there is more music in my father than there is in a brass band i say my dear its very fillyillially done you know but you are flattering your father he protested sparkling no i am not sir i assure you no i am not if you could hear my father sing you would know i am not but you never will hear him sing because he never sings to any one but me however tired he is he always sings to me when he comes home when i lay here long ago quite a poor little broken doll he used to sing to me more than that he used to make songs bringing in whatever little jokes we had between us more than that he often does so to this day o ill tell of you father as the gentleman has asked about you he is a poet sir i shouldnt wish the gentleman my dear observed lamps for the moment turning grave to carry away that opinion of your father because it might look as if i was given to asking the stars in a molloncolly manner what they was up to which i wouldnt at once waste the time and take the liberty my dear my father resumed phbe amending her text is always on the bright side and the good side you told me just now i had a happy disposition how can i help it well but my dear returned lamps argumentatively how can i help it put it to yourself sir look at her always as you see her now always workingand after all sir for but a very few shillings a weekalways contented always lively always interested in others of all sorts i said this moment she was always as you see her now so she is with a difference that comes to much the same for when its my sunday off and the morning bells have done ringing i hear the prayers and thanks read in the touchingest way and i have the hymns sung to meso soft sir that you couldnt hear em out of this roomin notes that seem to me i am sure to come from heaven and go back to it it might have been merely through the association of these words with their sacredly quiet time or it might have been through the larger association of the words with the redeemers presence beside the bedridden but here her dexterous fingers came to a stop on the lacepillow and clasped themselves round his neck as he bent down there was great natural sensibility in both father and daughter the visitor could easily see but each made it for the others sake retiring not demonstrative and perfect cheerfulness intuitive or acquired was either the first or second nature of both in a very few moments lamps was taking another rounder with his comical features beaming while phbes laughing eyes just a glistening speck or so upon their lashes were again directed by turns to him and to her work and to barbox brothers when my father sir she said brightly tells you about my being interested in other people even though they know nothing about mewhich bytheby i told you myselfyou ought to know how that comes about thats my fathers doing no it isnt he protested dont you believe him sir yes it is he tells me of everything he sees down at his work you would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every day he looks into the carriages and tells me how the ladies are drestso that i know all the fashions he looks into the carriages and tells me what pairs of lovers he sees and what newmarried couples on their wedding tripso that i know all about that he collects chance newspapers and booksso that i have plenty to read he tells me about the sick people who are travelling to try to get betterso that i know all about them in short as i began by saying he tells me everything he sees and makes out down at his work and you cant think what a quantity he does see and make out as to collecting newspapers and books my dear said lamps its clear i can have no merit in that because theyre not my perquisites you see sir its this way a guard hell say to me hallo here you are lamps ive saved this paper for your daughter how is she agoing on a headporter hell say to me here catch hold lamps heres a couple of wollumes for your daughter is she pretty much where she were and thats what makes it double welcome you see if she had a thousand pound in a box they wouldnt trouble themselves about her but being what she isthat is you understand lamps added somewhat hurriedly not having a thousand pound in a boxthey take thought for her and as concerning the young pairs married and unmarried its only natural i should bring home what little i can about them seeing that theres not a couple of either sort in the neighbourhood that dont come of their own accord to confide in phbe she raised her eyes triumphantly to barbox brothers as she said indeed sir that is true if i could have got up and gone to church i dont know how often i should have been a bridesmaid but if i could have done that some girls in love might have been jealous of me and as it is no girl is jealous of me and my pillow would not have been half as ready to put the piece of cake under as i always find it she added turning her face on it with a light sigh and a smile at her father the arrival of a little girl the biggest of the scholars now led to an understanding on the part of barbox brothers that she was the domestic of the cottage and had come to take active measures in it attended by a pail that might have extinguished her and a broom three times her height he therefore rose to take his leave and took it saying that if phbe had no objection he would come again he had muttered that he would come in the course of his walks the course of his walks must have been highly favourable to his return for he returned after an interval of a single day you thought you would never see me any more i suppose he said to phbe as he touched her hand and sat down by her couch why should i think so was her surprised rejoinder i took it for granted you would mistrust me for granted sir have you been so much mistrusted i think i am justified in answering yes but i may have mistrusted too on my part no matter just now we were speaking of the junction last time i have passed hours there since the day before yesterday are you now the gentleman for somewhere she asked with a smile certainly for somewhere but i dont yet know where you would never guess what i am travelling from shall i tell you i am travelling from my birthday her hands stopped in her work and she looked at him with incredulous astonishment yes said barbox brothers not quite easy in his chair from my birthday i am to myself an unintelligible book with the earlier chapters all torn out and thrown away my childhood had no grace of childhood my youth had no charm of youth and what can be expected from such a lost beginning his eyes meeting hers as they were addressed intently to him something seemed to stir within his breast whispering was this bed a place for the graces of childhood and the charms of youth to take to kindly o shame shame it is a disease with me said barbox brothers checking himself and making as though he had a difficulty in swallowing something to go wrong about that i dont know how i came to speak of that i hope it is because of an old misplaced confidence in one of your sex involving an old bitter treachery i dont know i am all wrong together her hands quietly and slowly resumed their work glancing at her he saw that her eyes were thoughtfully following them i am travelling from my birthday he resumed because it has always been a dreary day to me my first free birthday coming round some five or six weeks hence i am travelling to put its predecessors far behind me and to try to crush the dayor at all events put it out of my sightby heaping new objects on it as he paused she looked at him but only shook her head as being quite at a loss this is unintelligible to your happy disposition he pursued abiding by his former phrase as if there were some lingering virtue of selfdefence in it i knew it would be and am glad it is however on this travel of mine in which i mean to pass the rest of my days having abandoned all thought of a fixed home i stopped as you heard from your father at the junction here the extent of its ramifications quite confused me as to whither i should go from here i have not yet settled being still perplexed among so many roads what do you think i mean to do how many of the branching roads can you see from your window looking out full of interest she answered seven seven said barbox brothers watching her with a grave smile well i propose to myself at once to reduce the gross number to those very seven and gradually to fine them down to onethe most promising for meand to take that but how will you know sir which is the most promising she asked with her brightened eyes roving over the view ah said barbox brothers with another grave smile and considerably improving in his ease of speech to be sure in this way where your father can pick up so much every day for a good purpose i may once and again pick up a little for an indifferent purpose the gentleman for nowhere must become still better known at the junction he shall continue to explore it until he attaches something that he has seen heard or found out at the head of each of the seven roads to the road itself and so his choice of a road shall be determined by his choice among his discoveries her hands still busy she again glanced at the prospect as if it comprehended something that had not been in it before and laughed as if it yielded her new pleasure but i must not forget said barbox brothers having got so far to ask a favour i want your help in this expedient of mine i want to bring you what i pick up at the heads of the seven roads that you lie here looking out at and to compare notes with you about it may i they say two heads are better than one i should say myself that probably depends upon the heads concerned but i am quite sure though we are so newly acquainted that your head and your fathers have found out better things phbe than ever mine of itself discovered she gave him her sympathetic right hand in perfect rapture with his proposal and eagerly and gratefully thanked him thats well said barbox brothers again i must not forget having got so far to ask a favour will you shut your eyes laughing playfully at the strange nature of the request she did so keep them shut said barbox brothers going softly to the door and coming back you are on your honour mind not to open your eyes until i tell you that you may yes on my honour good may i take your lacepillow from you for a minute still laughing and wondering she removed her hands from it and he put it aside tell me did you see the puffs of smoke and steam made by the morning fasttrain yesterday on road number seven from here behind the elmtrees and the spire thats the road said barbox brothers directing his eyes towards it yes i watched them melt away anything unusual in what they expressed no she answered merrily not complimentary to me for i was in that train i wentdont open your eyesto fetch you this from the great ingenious town it is not half so large as your lacepillow and lies easily and lightly in its place these little keys are like the keys of a miniature piano and you supply the air required with your left hand may you pick out delightful music from it my dear for the presentyou can open your eyes nowgoodbye in his embarrassed way he closed the door upon himself and only saw in doing so that she ecstatically took the present to her bosom and caressed it the glimpse gladdened his heart and yet saddened it for so might she if her youth had flourished in its natural course have taken to her breast that day the slumbering music of her own childs voice barbox brothers and co with good will and earnest purpose the gentleman for nowhere began on the very next day his researches at the heads of the seven roads the results of his researches as he and phbe afterwards set them down in fair writing hold their due places in this veracious chronicle from its seventeenth page onward but they occupied a much longer time in the getting together than they ever will in the perusal and this is probably the case with most reading matter except when it is of that highly beneficial kind for posterity which is thrown off in a few moments of leisure by the superior poetic geniuses who scorn to take prose pains it must be admitted however that barbox by no means hurried himself his heart being in his work of goodnature he revelled in it there was the joy too it was a true joy to him of sometimes sitting by listening to phbe as she picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrument and as her natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries besides being a pleasure this was an occupation and in the course of weeks it consumed hours it resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon him before he had troubled himself any more about it the matter was made more pressing by the unforeseen circumstance that the councils held at which mr lamps beaming most brilliantly on a few rare occasions assisted respecting the road to be selected were after all in no wise assisted by his investigations for he had connected this interest with this road or that interest with the other but could deduce no reason from it for giving any road the preference consequently when the last council was holden that part of the business stood in the end exactly where it had stood in the beginning but sir remarked phbe we have only six roads after all is the seventh road dumb the seventh road o said barbox brothers rubbing his chin that is the road i took you know when i went to get your little present that is its story phbe would you mind taking that road again sir she asked with hesitation not in the least it is a great high road after all i should like you to take it returned phbe with a persuasive smile for the love of that little present which must ever be so dear to me i should like you to take it because that road can never be again like any other road to me i should like you to take it in remembrance of your having done me so much good of your having made me so much happier if you leave me by the road you travelled when you went to do me this great kindness sounding a faint chord as she spoke i shall feel lying here watching at my window as if it must conduct you to a prosperous end and bring you back some day it shall be done my dear it shall be done so at last the gentleman for nowhere took a ticket for somewhere and his destination was the great ingenious town he had loitered so long about the junction that it was the eighteenth of december when he left it high time he reflected as he seated himself in the train that i started in earnest only one clear day remains between me and the day i am running away from ill push onward for the hillcountry tomorrow ill go to wales it was with some pains that he placed before himself the undeniable advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation for his senses from misty mountains swollen streams rain cold a wild seashore and rugged roads and yet he scarcely made them out as distinctly as he could have wished whether the poor girl in spite of her new resource her music would have any feeling of loneliness upon her nowjust at firstthat she had not had before whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke that he saw as he sat in the train thinking of her whether her face would have any pensive shadow on it as they died out of the distant view from her window whether in telling him he had done her so much good she had not unconsciously corrected his old moody bemoaning of his station in life by setting him thinking that a man might be a great healer if he would and yet not be a great doctor these and other similar meditations got between him and his welsh picture there was within him too that dull sense of vacuity which follows separation from an object of interest and cessation of a pleasant pursuit and this sense being quite new to him made him restless further in losing mugby junction he had found himself again and he was not the more enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time in better company but surely here not far ahead must be the great ingenious town this crashing and clashing that the train was undergoing and this coupling on to it of a multitude of new echoes could mean nothing less than approach to the great station it did mean nothing less after some stormy flashes of town lightning in the way of swift revelations of redbrick blocks of houses high redbrick chimneyshafts vistas of redbrick railway arches tongues of fire blots of smoke valleys of canal and hills of coal there came the thundering in at the journeys end having seen his portmanteaus safely housed in the hotel he chose and having appointed his dinnerhour barbox brothers went out for a walk in the busy streets and now it began to be suspected by him that mugby junction was a junction of many branches invisible as well as visible and had joined him to an endless number of byways for whereas he would but a little while ago have walked these streets blindly brooding he now had eyes and thoughts for a new external world how the many toiling people lived and loved and died how wonderful it was to consider the various trainings of eye and hand the nice distinctions of sight and touch that separated them into classes of workers and even into classes of workers at subdivisions of one complete whole which combined their many intelligences and forces though of itself but some cheap object of use or ornament in common life how good it was to know that such assembling in a multitude on their part and such contribution of their several dexterities towards a civilising end did not deteriorate them as it was the fashion of the supercilious mayflies of humanity to pretend but engendered among them a selfrespect and yet a modest desire to be much wiser than they were the first evinced in their wellbalanced bearing and manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question the second in the announcements of their popular studies and amusements on the public walls these considerations and a host of such made his walk a memorable one i too am but a little part of a great whole he began to think and to be serviceable to myself and others or to be happy i must cast my interest into and draw it out of the common stock although he had arrived at his journeys end for the day by noon he had since insensibly walked about the town so far and so long that the lamplighters were now at their work in the streets and the shops were sparkling up brilliantly thus reminded to turn towards his quarters he was in the act of doing so when a very little hand crept into his and a very little voice said o if you please i am lost he looked down and saw a very little fairhaired girl yes she said confirming her words with a serious nod i am indeed i am lost greatly perplexed he stopped looked about him for help descried none and said bending low where do you live my child i dont know where i live she returned i am lost what is your name polly what is your other name the reply was prompt but unintelligible imitating the sound as he caught it he hazarded the guess trivits o no said the child shaking her head nothing like that say it again little one an unpromising business for this time it had quite a different sound he made the venture paddens o no said the child nothing like that once more let us try it again dear a most hopeless business this time it swelled into four syllables it cant be tappitarver said barbox brothers rubbing his head with his hat in discomfiture no it aint the child quietly assented on her trying this unfortunate name once more with extraordinary efforts at distinctness it swelled into eight syllables at least ah i think said barbox brothers with a desperate air of resignation that we had better give it up but i am lost said the child nestling her little hand more closely in his and youll take care of me wont you if ever a man were disconcerted by division between compassion on the one hand and the very imbecility of irresolution on the other here the man was lost he repeated looking down at the child i am sure i am what is to be done where do you live asked the child looking up at him wistfully over there he answered pointing vaguely in the direction of his hotel hadnt we better go there said the child really he replied i dont know but what we had so they set off hand in hand he through comparison of himself against his little companion with a clumsy feeling on him as if he had just developed into a foolish giant she clearly elevated in her own tiny opinion by having got him so neatly out of his embarrassment we are going to have dinner when we get there i suppose said polly well he rejoined iyes i suppose we are do you like your dinner asked the child why on the whole said barbox brothers yes i think i do i do mine said polly have you any brothers and sisters no have you mine are dead oh said barbox brothers with that absurd sense of unwieldiness of mind and body weighing him down he would have not known how to pursue the conversation beyond this curt rejoinder but that the child was always ready for him what she asked turning her soft hand coaxingly in his are you going to do to amuse me after dinner upon my soul polly exclaimed barbox brothers very much at a loss i have not the slightest idea then i tell you what said polly have you got any cards at your house plenty said barbox brothers in a boastful vein very well then ill build houses and you shall look at me you mustnt blow you know o no said barbox brothers no no no no blowing blowings not fair he flattered himself that he had said this pretty well for an idiotic monster but the child instantly perceiving the awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level utterly destroyed his hopeful opinion of himself by saying compassionately what a funny man you are feeling after this melancholy failure as if he every minute grew bigger and heavier in person and weaker in mind barbox gave himself up for a bad job no giant ever submitted more meekly to be led in triumph by allconquering jack than he to be bound in slavery to polly do you know any stories she asked him he was reduced to the humiliating confession no what a dunce you must be mustnt you said polly he was reduced to the humiliating confession yes would you like me to teach you a story but you must remember it you know and be able to tell it right to somebody else afterwards he professed that it would afford him the highest mental gratification to be taught a story and that he would humbly endeavour to retain it in his mind whereupon polly giving her hand a new little turn in his expressive of settling down for enjoyment commenced a long romance of which every relishing clause began with the words so this or and so this as so this boy or so this fairy or and so this pie was four yards round and two yards and a quarter deep the interest of the romance was derived from the intervention of this fairy to punish this boy for having a greedy appetite to achieve which purpose this fairy made this pie and this boy ate and ate and ate and his cheeks swelled and swelled and swelled there were many tributary circumstances but the forcible interest culminated in the total consumption of this pie and the bursting of this boy truly he was a fine sight barbox brothers with serious attentive face and ear bent down much jostled on the pavements of the busy town but afraid of losing a single incident of the epic lest he should be examined in it byandby and found deficient thus they arrived at the hotel and there he had to say at the bar and said awkwardly enough i have found a little girl the whole establishment turned out to look at the little girl nobody knew her nobody could make out her name as she set it forthexcept one chambermaid who said it was constantinoplewhich it wasnt i will dine with my young friend in a private room said barbox brothers to the hotel authorities and perhaps you will be so good as let the police know that the pretty baby is here i suppose she is sure to be inquired for soon if she has not been already come along polly perfectly at ease and peace polly came along but finding the stairs rather stiff work was carried up by barbox brothers the dinner was a most transcendent success and the barbox sheepishness under pollys directions how to mince her meat for her and how to diffuse gravy over the plate with a liberal and equal hand was another fine sight and now said polly while we are at dinner you be good and tell me that story i taught you with the tremors of a civil service examination on him and very uncertain indeed not only as to the epoch at which the pie appeared in history but also as to the measurements of that indispensable fact barbox brothers made a shaky beginning but under encouragement did very fairly there was a want of breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks as well as the appetite of the boy and there was a certain tameness in his fairy referable to an undercurrent of desire to account for her still as the first lumbering performance of a goodhumoured monster it passed muster i told you to be good said polly and you are good aint you i hope so replied barbox brothers such was his deference that polly elevated on a platform of sofacushions in a chair at his right hand encouraged him with a pat or two on the face from the greasy bowl of her spoon and even with a gracious kiss in getting on her feet upon her chair however to give him this last reward she toppled forward among the dishes and caused him to exclaim as he effected her rescue gracious angels whew i thought we were in the fire polly what a coward you are aint you said polly when replaced yes i am rather nervous he replied whew dont polly dont flourish your spoon or youll go over sideways dont tilt up your legs when you laugh polly or youll go over backwards whew polly polly polly said barbox brothers nearly succumbing to despair we are environed with dangers indeed he could descry no security from the pitfalls that were yawning for polly but in proposing to her after dinner to sit upon a low stool i will if you will said polly so as peace of mind should go before all he begged the waiter to wheel aside the table bring a pack of cards a couple of footstools and a screen and close in polly and himself before the fire as it were in a snug room within the room then finest sight of all was barbox brothers on his footstool with a pint decanter on the rug contemplating polly as she built successfully and growing blue in the face with holding his breath lest he should blow the house down how you stare dont you said polly in a houseless pause detected in the ignoble fact he felt obliged to admit apologetically i am afraid i was looking rather hard at you polly why do you stare asked polly i cannot he murmured to himself recall whyi dont know polly you must be a simpleton to do things and not know why mustnt you said polly in spite of which reproof he looked at the child again intently as she bent her head over her cardstructure her rich curls shading her face it is impossible he thought that i can ever have seen this pretty baby before can i have dreamed of her in some sorrowful dream he could make nothing of it so he went into the building trade as a journeyman under polly and they built three stories high four stories high even five i say who do you think is coming asked polly rubbing her eyes after tea he guessed the waiter no said polly the dustman i am getting sleepy a new embarrassment for barbox brothers i dont think i am going to be fetched tonight said polly what do you think he thought not either after another quarter of an hour the dustman not merely impending but actually arriving recourse was had to the constantinopolitan chambermaid who cheerily undertook that the child should sleep in a comfortable and wholesome room which she herself would share and i know you will be careful wont you said barbox brothers as a new fear dawned upon him that she dont fall out of bed polly found this so highly entertaining that she was under the necessity of clutching him round the neck with both arms as he sat on his footstool picking up the cards and rocking him to and fro with her dimpled chin on his shoulder o what a coward you are aint you said polly do you fall out of bed nnot generally polly no more do i with that polly gave him a reassuring hug or two to keep him going and then giving that confiding mite of a hand of hers to be swallowed up in the hand of the constantinopolitan chambermaid trotted off chattering without a vestige of anxiety he looked after her had the screen removed and the table and chairs replaced and still looked after her he paced the room for half an hour a most engaging little creature but its not that a most winning little voice but its not that that has much to do with it but there is something more how can it be that i seem to know this child what was it she imperfectly recalled to me when i felt her touch in the street and looking down at her saw her looking up at me mr jackson with a start he turned towards the sound of the subdued voice and saw his answer standing at the door o mr jackson do not be severe with me speak a word of encouragement to me i beseech you you are pollys mother yes yes polly herself might come to this one day as you see what the rose was in its faded leaves as you see what the summer growth of the woods was in their wintry branches so polly might be traced one day in a careworn woman like this with her hair turned grey before him were the ashes of a dead fire that had once burned bright this was the woman he had loved this was the woman he had lost such had been the constancy of his imagination to her so had time spared her under its withholding that now seeing how roughly the inexorable hand had struck her his soul was filled with pity and amazement he led her to a chair and stood leaning on a corner of the chimneypiece with his head resting on his hand and his face half averted did you see me in the street and show me to your child he asked yes is the little creature then a party to deceit i hope there is no deceit i said to her we have lost our way and i must try to find mine by myself go to that gentleman and tell him you are lost you shall be fetched byandby perhaps you have not thought how very young she is she is very selfreliant perhaps because she is so young he asked after a short pause why did you do this o mr jackson do you ask me in the hope that you might see something in my innocent child to soften your heart towards me not only towards me but towards my husband he suddenly turned about and walked to the opposite end of the room he came back again with a slower step and resumed his former attitude saying i thought you had emigrated to america we did but life went ill with us there and we came back do you live in this town yes i am a daily teacher of music here my husband is a bookkeeper are youforgive my askingpoor we earn enough for our wants that is not our distress my husband is very very ill of a lingering disorder he will never recover you check yourself if it is for want of the encouraging word you spoke of take it from me i cannot forget the old time beatrice god bless you she replied with a burst of tears and gave him her trembling hand compose yourself i cannot be composed if you are not for to see you weep distresses me beyond expression speak freely to me trust me she shaded her face with her veil and after a little while spoke calmly her voice had the ring of pollys it is not that my husbands mind is at all impaired by his bodily suffering for i assure you that is not the case but in his weakness and in his knowledge that he is incurably ill he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one idea it preys upon him embitters every moment of his painful life and will shorten it she stopping he said again speak freely to me trust me we have had five children before this darling and they all lie in their little graves he believes that they have withered away under a curse and that it will blight this child like the rest under what curse both i and he have it on our conscience that we tried you very heavily and i do not know but that if i were as ill as he i might suffer in my mind as he does this is the constant burdeni believe beatrice i was the only friend that mr jackson ever cared to make though i was so much his junior the more influence he acquired in the business the higher he advanced me and i was alone in his private confidence i came between him and you and i took you from him we were both secret and the blow fell when he was wholly unprepared the anguish it caused a man so compressed must have been terrible the wrath it awakened inappeasable so a curse came to be invoked on our poor pretty little flowers and they fall and you beatrice he asked when she had ceased to speak and there had been a silence afterwards how say you until within these few weeks i was afraid of you and i believed that you would never never forgive until within these few weeks he repeated have you changed your opinion of me within these few weeks yes for what reason i was getting some pieces of music in a shop in this town when to my terror you came in as i veiled my face and stood in the dark end of the shop i heard you explain that you wanted a musical instrument for a bedridden girl your voice and manner were so softened you showed such interest in its selection you took it away yourself with so much tenderness of care and pleasure that i knew you were a man with a most gentle heart o mr jackson mr jackson if you could have felt the refreshing rain of tears that followed for me was phbe playing at that moment on her distant couch he seemed to hear her i inquired in the shop where you lived but could get no information as i had heard you say that you were going back by the next train but you did not say where i resolved to visit the station at about that time of day as often as i could between my lessons on the chance of seeing you again i have been there very often but saw you no more until today you were meditating as you walked the street but the calm expression of your face emboldened me to send my child to you and when i saw you bend your head to speak tenderly to her i prayed to god to forgive me for having ever brought a sorrow on it i now pray to you to forgive me and to forgive my husband i was very young he was young too and in the ignorant hardihood of such a time of life we dont know what we do to those who have undergone more discipline you generous man you good man so to raise me up and make nothing of my crime against youfor he would not see her on her knees and soothed her as a kind father might have soothed an erring daughterthank you bless you thank you when he next spoke it was after having drawn aside the windowcurtain and looked out a while then he only said is polly asleep yes as i came in i met her going away upstairs and put her to bed myself leave her with me for tomorrow beatrice and write me your address on this leaf of my pocketbook in the evening i will bring her home to youand to her father hallo cried polly putting her saucy sunny face in at the door next morning when breakfast was ready i thought i was fetched last night so you were polly but i asked leave to keep you here for the day and to take you home in the evening upon my word said polly you are very cool aint you however polly seemed to think it a good idea and added i suppose i must give you a kiss though you are cool the kiss given and taken they sat down to breakfast in a highly conversational tone of course you are going to amuse me said polly oh of course said barbox brothers in the pleasurable height of her anticipations polly found it indispensable to put down her piece of toast cross one of her little fat knees over the other and bring her little fat right hand down into her left hand with a businesslike slap after this gathering of herself together polly by that time a mere heap of dimples asked in a wheedling manner what are we going to do you dear old thing why i was thinking said barbox brothers but are you fond of horses polly ponies i am said polly especially when their tails are long but horsesnnotoo big you know well pursued barbox brothers in a spirit of grave mysterious confidence adapted to the importance of the consultation i did see yesterday polly on the walls pictures of two longtailed ponies speckled all over no no no cried polly in an ecstatic desire to linger on the charming details not speckled all over speckled all over which ponies jump through hoops no no no cried polly as before they never jump through hoops yes they do o i assure you they do and eat pie in pinafores ponies eating pie in pinafores said polly what a storyteller you are aint you upon my honourand fire off guns polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting to firearms and i was thinking pursued the exemplary barbox that if you and i were to go to the circus where these ponies are it would do our constitutions good does that mean amuse us inquired polly what long words you do use dont you apologetic for having wandered out of his depth he replied that means amuse us that is exactly what it means there are many other wonders besides the ponies and we shall see them all ladies and gentlemen in spangled dresses and elephants and lions and tigers polly became observant of the teapot with a curledup nose indicating some uneasiness of mind they never get out of course she remarked as a mere truism the elephants and lions and tigers o dear no o dear no said polly and of course nobodys afraid of the ponies shooting anybody not the least in the world no no not the least in the world said polly i was also thinking proceeded barbox that if we were to look in at the toyshop to choose a doll not dressed cried polly with a clap of her hands no no no not dressed full dressed together with a house and all things necessary for housekeeping polly gave a little scream and seemed in danger of falling into a swoon of bliss what a darling you are she languidly exclaimed leaning back in her chair come and be hugged or i must come and hug you this resplendent programme was carried into execution with the utmost rigour of the law it being essential to make the purchase of the doll its first featureor that lady would have lost the poniesthe toyshop expedition took precedence polly in the magic warehouse with a doll as large as herself under each arm and a neat assortment of some twenty more on view upon the counter did indeed present a spectacle of indecision not quite compatible with unalloyed happiness but the light cloud passed the lovely specimen oftenest chosen oftenest rejected and finally abided by was of circassian descent possessing as much boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme feebleness of mouth and combining a skyblue silk pelisse with rosecoloured satin trousers and a black velvet hat which this fair stranger to our northern shores would seem to have founded on the portraits of the late duchess of kent the name this distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the glowing skies of a sunny clime was on pollys authority miss melluka and the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper from the barbox coffers may be inferred from the two facts that her silver teaspoons were as large as her kitchen poker and that the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her fryingpan miss melluka was graciously pleased to express her entire approbation of the circus and so was polly for the ponies were speckled and brought down nobody when they fired and the savagery of the wild beasts appeared to be mere smokewhich article in fact they did produce in large quantities from their insides the barbox absorption in the general subject throughout the realisation of these delights was again a sight to see nor was it less worthy to behold at dinner when he drank to miss melluka tied stiff in a chair opposite to polly the fair circassian possessing an unbendable spine and even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due decorum the prevailing glorious idea to wind up there came the agreeable fever of getting miss melluka and all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with polly to be taken home but by that time polly had become unable to look upon such accumulated joys with waking eyes and had withdrawn her consciousness into the wonderful paradise of a childs sleep sleep polly sleep said barbox brothers as her head dropped on his shoulder you shall not fall out of this bed easily at any rate what rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket and carefully folded into the bosom of pollys frock shall not be mentioned he said nothing about it and nothing shall be said about it they drove to a modest suburb of the great ingenious town and stopped at the forecourt of a small house do not wake the child said barbox brothers softly to the driver i will carry her in as she is greeting the light at the opened door which was held by pollys mother pollys bearer passed on with mother and child into a groundfloor room there stretched on a sofa lay a sick man sorely wasted who covered his eyes with his emaciated hands tresham said barbox in a kindly voice i have brought you back your polly fast asleep give me your hand and tell me you are better the sick man reached forth his right hand and bowed his head over the hand into which it was taken and kissed it thank you thank you i may say that i am well and happy thats brave said barbox tresham i have a fancycan you make room for me beside you here he sat down on the sofa as he said words cherishing the plump peachy cheek that lay uppermost on his shoulder i have a fancy tresham i am getting quite an old fellow now you know and old fellows may take fancies into their heads sometimes to give up polly having found her to no one but you will you take her from me as the father held out his arms for the child each of the two men looked steadily at the other she is very dear to you tresham unutterably dear god bless her it is not much polly he continued turning his eyes upon her peaceful face as he apostrophised her it is not much polly for a blind and sinful man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than himself as a little child is but it would be muchmuch upon his cruel head and much upon his guilty soulif he could be so wicked as to invoke a curse he had better have a millstone round his neck and be cast into the deepest sea live and thrive my pretty baby here he kissed her live and prosper and become in time the mother of other little children like the angels who behold the fathers face he kissed her again gave her up gently to both her parents and went out but he went not to wales no he never went to wales he went straightway for another stroll about the town and he looked in upon the people at their work and at their play here there everywhere and where not for he was barbox brothers and co now and had taken thousands of partners into the solitary firm he had at length got back to his hotel room and was standing before his fire refreshing himself with a glass of hot drink which he had stood upon the chimneypiece when he heard the town clocks striking and referring to his watch found the evening to have so slipped away that they were striking twelve as he put up his watch again his eyes met those of his reflection in the chimneyglass why its your birthday already he said smiling you are looking very well i wish you many happy returns of the day he had never before bestowed that wish upon himself by jupiter he discovered it alters the whole case of running away from ones birthday its a thing to explain to phbe besides here is quite a long story to tell her that has sprung out of the road with no story ill go back instead of going on ill go back by my friend lampss up x presently he went back to mugby junction and in point of fact he established himself at mugby junction it was the convenient place to live in for brightening phbes life it was the convenient place to live in for having her taught music by beatrice it was the convenient place to live in for occasionally borrowing polly it was the convenient place to live in for being joined at will to all sorts of agreeable places and persons so he became settled there and his house standing in an elevated situation it is noteworthy of him in conclusion as polly herself might not irreverently have put it there was an old barbox who lived on a hill and if he aint gone he lives there still here follows the substance of what was seen heard or otherwise picked up by the gentleman for nowhere in his careful study of the junction main line the boy at mugby i am the boy at mugby thats about what i am you dont know what i mean what a pity but i think you do i think you must look here i am the boy at what is called the refreshment room at mugby junction and whats proudest boast is that it never yet refreshed a mortal being up in a corner of the down refreshment room at mugby junction in the height of twentyseven cross draughts ive often counted em while they brush the first class hair twentyseven ways behind the bottles among the glasses bounded on the norwest by the beer stood pretty far to the right of a metallic object thats at times the teaurn and at times the souptureen according to the nature of the last twang imparted to its contents which are the same groundwork fended off from the traveller by a barrier of stale spongecakes erected atop of the counter and lastly exposed sideways to the glare of our mississ eyeyou ask a boy so sitiwated next time you stop in a hurry at mugby for anything to drink you take particular notice that hell try to seem not to hear you that hell appear in a absent manner to survey the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body and that he wont serve you as long as you can possibly bear it thats me what a lark it is we are the model establishment we are at mugby other refreshment rooms send their imperfect young ladies up to be finished off by our missis for some of the young ladies when theyre new to the business come into it mild ah our missis she soon takes that out of em why i originally come into the business meek myself but our missis she soon took that out of me what a delightful lark it is i look upon us refreshmenters as ockipying the only proudly independent footing on the line theres papers for instancemy honourable friend if he will allow me to call him sohim as belongs to smiths bookstall why he no more dares to be up to our refreshmenting games than he dares to jump atop of a locomotive with her steam at full pressure and cut away upon her alone driving himself at limitedmail speed papers hed get his head punched at every compartment first second and third the whole length of a train if he was to ventur to imitate my demeanour its the same with the porters the same with the guards the same with the ticket clerks the same the whole way up to the secretary traffic manager or very chairman there aint a one among em on the nobly independent footing we are did you ever catch one of them when you wanted anything of him making a system of surveying the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body i should hope not you should see our bandolining room at mugby junction its led to by the door behind the counter which youll notice usually stands ajar and its the room where our missis and our young ladies bandolines their hair you should see em at it betwixt trains bandolining away as if they was anointing themselves for the combat when youre telegraphed you should see their noses all a going up with scorn as if it was a part of the working of the same cooke and wheatstone electrical machinery you should hear our missis give the word here comes the beast to be fed and then you should see em indignantly skipping across the line from the up to the down or wicer warsaw and begin to pitch the stale pastry into the plates and chuck the sawdust sangwiches under the glass covers and get out theha ha hathe sherryo my eye my eyefor your refreshment its only in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say britannia that refreshmenting is so effective so olesome so constitutional a check upon the public there was a foreigner which having politely with his hat off beseeched our young ladies and our missis for a leetel gloss hoff prarndee and having had the line surveyed through him by all and no other acknowledgment was a proceeding at last to help himself as seems to be the custom in his own country when our missis with her hair almost a coming unbandolined with rage and her eyes omitting sparks flew at him cotched the decanter out of his hand and said put it down i wont allow that the foreigner turned pale stepped back with his arms stretched out in front of him his hands clasped and his shoulders riz and exclaimed ah is it possible this that these disdaineous females and this ferocious old woman are placed here by the administration not only to empoison the voyagers but to affront them great heaven how arrives it the english people or is he then a slave or idiot another time a merry wideawake american gent had tried the sawdust and spit it out and had tried the sherry and spit that out and had tried in vain to sustain exhausted natur upon butterscotch and had been rather extra bandolined and linesurveyed through when as the bell was ringing and he paid our missis he says very loud and goodtempered i tell yew what tis maarm i laaf theer i laaf i dew i oughter ha seen most things for i hail from the onlimited side of the atlantic ocean and i haive travelled right slick over the limited head on through jeerusalemm and the east and likeways france and italy europe old world and am now upon the track to the chief europian village but such an institution as yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixins solid and liquid afore the glorious tarnal i never did see yet and if i haint found the eighth wonder of monarchical creation in finding yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixins solid and liquid all as aforesaid established in a country where the people air not absolute loonaticks i am extra double darned with a nip and frizzle to the innermostest grit wheerfurtheeri laaf i dew maarm i laaf and so he went stamping and shaking his sides along the platform all the way to his own compartment i think it was her standing up agin the foreigner as giv our missis the idea of going over to france and droring a comparison betwixt refreshmenting as followed among the frogeaters and refreshmenting as triumphant in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say agin britannia our young ladies miss whiff miss piff and mrs sniff was unanimous opposed to her going for as they says to our missis one and all it is well beknown to the hends of the herth as no other nation except britain has a idea of anythink but above all of business why then should you tire yourself to prove what is aready proved our missis however being a teazer at all pints stood out grim obstinate and got a return pass by southeastern tidal to go right through if such should be her dispositions to marseilles sniff is husband to mrs sniff and is a regular insignificant cove he looks arter the sawdust department in a back room and is sometimes when we are very hard put to it let in behind the counter with a corkscrew but never when it can be helped his demeanour towards the public being disgusting servile how mrs sniff ever come so far to lower herself as to marry him i dont know but i suppose he does and i should think he wished he didnt for he leads a awful life mrs sniff couldnt be much harder with him if he was public similarly miss whiff and miss piff taking the tone of mrs sniff they shoulder sniff about when he is let in with a corkscrew and they whisk things out of his hands when in his servility he is a going to let the public have em and they snap him up when in the crawling baseness of his spirit he is a going to answer a public question and they drore more tears into his eyes than ever the mustard does which he all day long lays on to the sawdust but it aint strong once when sniff had the repulsiveness to reach across to get the milkpot to hand over for a baby i see our missis in her rage catch him by both his shoulders and spin him out into the bandolining room but mrs sniff how different shes the one shes the one as youll notice to be always looking another way from you when you look at her shes the one with the small waist buckled in tight in front and with the lace cuffs at her wrists which she puts on the edge of the counter before her and stands a smoothing while the public foams this smoothing the cuffs and looking another way while the public foams is the last accomplishment taught to the young ladies as come to mugby to be finished by our missis and its always taught by mrs sniff when our missis went away upon her journey mrs sniff was left in charge she did hold the public in check most beautiful in all my time i never see half so many cups of tea given without milk to people as wanted it with nor half so many cups of tea with milk given to people as wanted it without when foaming ensued mrs sniff would say then youd better settle it among yourselves and change with one another it was a most highly delicious lark i enjoyed the refreshmenting business more than ever and was so glad i had took to it when young our missis returned it got circulated among the young ladies and it as it might be penetrated to me through the crevices of the bandolining room that she had orrors to reveal if revelations so contemptible could be dignified with the name agitation become awakened excitement was up in the stirrups expectation stood a tiptoe at length it was put forth that on our slackest evening in the week and at our slackest time of that evening betwixt trains our missis would give her views of foreign refreshmenting in the bandolining room it was arranged tasteful for the purpose the bandolining table and glass was hid in a corner a armchair was elevated on a packingcase for our mississ ockypation a table and a tumbler of water no sherry in it thankee was placed beside it two of the pupils the season being autumn and hollyhocks and daliahs being in ornamented the wall with three devices in those flowers on one might be read may albion never learn on another keep the public down on another our refreshmenting charter the whole had a beautiful appearance with which the beauty of the sentiments corresponded on our mississ brow was wrote severity as she ascended the fatal platform not that that was anythink new miss whiff and miss piff sat at her feet three chairs from the waiting room might have been perceived by a average eye in front of her on which the pupils was accommodated behind them a very close observer might have discerned a boy myself where said our missis glancing gloomily around is sniff i thought it better answered mrs sniff that he should not be let to come in he is such an ass no doubt assented our missis but for that reason is it not desirable to improve his mind o nothing will ever improve him said mrs sniff however pursued our missis call him in ezekiel i called him in the appearance of the lowminded cove was hailed with disapprobation from all sides on account of his having brought his corkscrew with him he pleaded the force of habit the force said mrs sniff dont let us have you talking about force for gracious sake there do stand still where you are with your back against the wall he is a smiling piece of vacancy and he smiled in the mean way in which he will even smile at the public if he gets a chance language can say no meaner of him and he stood upright near the door with the back of his head agin the wall as if he was a waiting for somebody to come and measure his heighth for the army i should not enter ladies says our missis on the revolting disclosures i am about to make if it was not in the hope that they will cause you to be yet more implacable in the exercise of the power you wield in a constitutional country and yet more devoted to the constitutional motto which i see before me it was behind her but the words sounded better so may albion never learn here the pupils as had made the motto admired it and cried hear hear hear sniff showing an inclination to join in chorus got himself frowned down by every brow the baseness of the french pursued our missis as displayed in the fawning nature of their refreshmenting equals if not surpasses anythink as was ever heard of the baseness of the celebrated buonaparte miss whiff miss piff and me we drored a heavy breath equal to saying we thought as much miss whiff and miss piff seeming to object to my droring mine along with theirs i drored another to aggravate em shall i be believed says our missis with flashing eyes when i tell you that no sooner had i set my foot upon that treacherous shore here sniff either busting out mad or thinking aloud says in a low voice feet plural you know the cowering that come upon him when he was spurned by all eyes added to his being beneath contempt was sufficient punishment for a cove so grovelling in the midst of a silence rendered more impressive by the turnedup female noses with which it was pervaded our missis went on shall i be believed when i tell you that no sooner had i landed this word with a killing look at sniff on that treacherous shore than i was ushered into a refreshment room where there were i do not exaggerate actually eatable things to eat a groan burst from the ladies i not only did myself the honour of jining but also of lengthening it out where there were our missis added not only eatable things to eat but also drinkable things to drink a murmur swelling almost into a scream ariz miss piff trembling with indignation called out name i will name said our missis there was roast fowls hot and cold there was smoking roast veal surrounded with browned potatoes there was hot soup with again i ask shall i be credited nothing bitter in it and no flour to choke off the consumer there was a variety of cold dishes set off with jelly there was salad there wasmark mefresh pastry and that of a light construction there was a luscious show of fruit there was bottles and decanters of sound small wine of every size and adapted to every pocket the same odious statement will apply to brandy and these were set out upon the counter so that all could help themselves our mississ lips so quivered that mrs sniff though scarcely less convulsed than she were got up and held the tumbler to them this proceeds our missis was my first unconstitutional experience well would it have been if it had been my last and worst but no as i proceeded further into that enslaved and ignorant land its aspect became more hideous i need not explain to this assembly the ingredients and formation of the british refreshment sangwich universal laughterexcept from sniff who as sangwichcutter shook his head in a state of the utmost dejection as he stood with it agin the wall well said our missis with dilated nostrils take a fresh crisp long crusty penny loaf made of the whitest and best flower cut it longwise through the middle insert a fair and nicely fitting slice of ham tie a smart piece of ribbon round the middle of the whole to bind it together add at one end a neat wrapper of clean white paper by which to hold it and the universal french refreshment sangwich busts on your disgusted vision a cry of shame from allexcept sniff which rubbed his stomach with a soothing hand i need not said our missis explain to this assembly the usual formation and fitting of the british refreshment room no no and laughter sniff agin shaking his head in low spirits agin the wall well said our missis what would you say to a general decoration of everythink to hangings sometimes elegant to easy velvet furniture to abundance of little tables to abundance of little seats to brisk bright waiters to great convenience to a pervading cleanliness and tastefulness positively addressing the public and making the beast thinking itself worth the pains contemptuous fury on the part of all the ladies mrs sniff looking as if she wanted somebody to hold her and everybody else looking as if theyd rayther not three times said our missis working herself into a truly terrimenjious state three times did i see these shamful things only between the coast and paris and not counting either at hazebroucke at arras at amiens but worse remains tell me what would you call a person who should propose in england that there should be kept say at our own model mugby junction pretty baskets each holding an assorted cold lunch and dessert for one each at a certain fixed price and each within a passengers power to take away to empty in the carriage at perfect leisure and to return at another station fifty or a hundred miles further on there was disagreement what such a person should be called whether revolutionist atheist bright i said him or unenglish miss piff screeched her shrill opinion last in the words a malignant maniac i adopt says our missis the brand set upon such a person by the righteous indignation of my friend miss piff a malignant maniac know then that that malignant maniac has sprung from the congenial soil of france and that his malignant madness was in unchecked action on this same part of my journey i noticed that sniff was a rubbing his hands and that mrs sniff had got her eye upon him but i did not take more particular notice owing to the excited state in which the young ladies was and to feeling myself called upon to keep it up with a howl on my experience south of paris said our missis in a deep tone i will not expatiate too loathsome were the task but fancy this fancy a guard coming round with the train at full speed to inquire how many for dinner fancy his telegraphing forward the number of diners fancy every one expected and the table elegantly laid for the complete party fancy a charming dinner in a charming room and the headcook concerned for the honour of every dish superintending in his clean white jacket and cap fancy the beast travelling six hundred miles on end very fast and with great punctuality yet being taught to expect all this to be done for it a spirited chorus of the beast i noticed that sniff was agin a rubbing his stomach with a soothing hand and that he had drored up one leg but agin i didnt take particular notice looking on myself as called upon to stimilate public feeling it being a lark besides putting everything together said our missis french refreshmenting comes to this and o it comes to a nice total first eatable things to eat and drinkable things to drink a groan from the young ladies kep up by me second convenience and even elegance another groan from the young ladies kep up by me third moderate charges this time a groan from me kep up by the young ladies fourthand here says our missis i claim your angriest sympathyattention common civility nay even politeness me and the young ladies regularly raging mad all together and i cannot in conclusion says our missis with her spitefullest sneer give you a completer pictur of that despicable nation after what i have related than assuring you that they wouldnt bear our constitutional ways and noble independence at mugby junction for a single month and that they would turn us to the rightabout and put another system in our places as soon as look at us perhaps sooner for i do not believe they have the good taste to care to look at us twice the swelling tumult was arrested in its rise sniff bore away by his servile disposition had drored up his leg with a higher and a higher relish and was now discovered to be waving his corkscrew over his head it was at this moment that mrs sniff who had kep her eye upon him like the fabled obelisk descended on her victim our missis followed them both out and cries was heard in the sawdust department you come into the down refreshment room at the junction making believe you dont know me and ill pint you out with my right thumb over my shoulder which is our missis and which is miss whiff and which is miss piff and which is mrs sniff but you wont get a chance to see sniff because he disappeared that night whether he perished tore to pieces i cannot say but his corkscrew alone remains to bear witness to the servility of his disposition no branch line the signalman halloa below there when he heard a voice thus calling to him he was standing at the door of his box with a flag in his hand furled round its short pole one would have thought considering the nature of the ground that he could not have doubted from what quarter the voice came but instead of looking up to where i stood on the top of the steep cutting nearly over his head he turned himself about and looked down the line there was something remarkable in his manner of doing so though i could not have said for my life what but i know it was remarkable enough to attract my notice even though his figure was foreshortened and shadowed down in the deep trench and mine was high above him so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset that i had shaded my eyes with my hand before i saw him at all halloa below from looking down the line he turned himself about again and raising his eyes saw my figure high above him is there any path by which i can come down and speak to you he looked up at me without replying and i looked down at him without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle question just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air quickly changing into a violent pulsation and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back as though it had force to draw me down when such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me and was skimming away over the landscape i looked down again and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by i repeated my inquiry after a pause during which he seemed to regard me with fixed attention he motioned with his rolledup flag towards a point on my level some two or three hundred yards distant i called down to him all right and made for that point there by dint of looking closely about me i found a rough zigzag descending path notched out which i followed the cutting was extremely deep and unusually precipitate it was made through a clammy stone that became oozier and wetter as i went down for these reasons i found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the path when i came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him again i saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by which the train had lately passed in an attitude as if he were waiting for me to appear he had his left hand at his chin and that left elbow rested on his right hand crossed over his breast his attitude was one of such expectation and watchfulness that i stopped a moment wondering at it i resumed my downward way and stepping out upon the level of the railroad and drawing nearer to him saw that he was a dark sallow man with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows his post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever i saw on either side a drippingwet wall of jagged stone excluding all view but a strip of sky the perspective one way only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon the shorter perspective in the other direction terminating in a gloomy red light and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel in whose massive architecture there was a barbarous depressing and forbidding air so little sunlight ever found its way to this spot that it had an earthy deadly smell and so much cold wind rushed through it that it struck chill to me as if i had left the natural world before he stirred i was near enough to him to have touched him not even then removing his eyes from mine he stepped back one step and lifted his hand this was a lonesome post to occupy i said and it had riveted my attention when i looked down from up yonder a visitor was a rarity i should suppose not an unwelcome rarity i hoped in me he merely saw a man who had been shut up within narrow limits all his life and who being at last set free had a newlyawakened interest in these great works to such purpose i spoke to him but i am far from sure of the terms i used for besides that i am not happy in opening any conversation there was something in the man that daunted me he directed a most curious look towards the red light near the tunnels mouth and looked all about it as if something were missing from it and then looked at me that light was part of his charge was it not he answered in a low voice dont you know it is the monstrous thought came into my mind as i perused the fixed eyes and the saturnine face that this was a spirit not a man i have speculated since whether there may have been infection in his mind in my turn i stepped back but in making the action i detected in his eyes some latent fear of me this put the monstrous thought to flight you look at me i said forcing a smile as if you had a dread of me i was doubtful he returned whether i had seen you before where he pointed to the red light he had looked at there i said intently watchful of me he replied but without sound yes my good fellow what should i do there however be that as it may i never was there you may swear i think i may he rejoined yes i am sure i may his manner cleared like my own he replied to my remarks with readiness and in wellchosen words had he much to do there yes that was to say he had enough responsibility to bear but exactness and watchfulness were what was required of him and of actual workmanual labourhe had next to none to change that signal to trim those lights and to turn this iron handle now and then was all he had to do under that head regarding those many long and lonely hours of which i seemed to make so much he could only say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that form and he had grown used to it he had taught himself a language down hereif only to know it by sight and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation could be called learning it he had also worked at fractions and decimals and tried a little algebra but he was and had been as a boy a poor hand at figures was it necessary for him when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air and could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high stone walls why that depended upon times and circumstances under some conditions there would be less upon the line than under others and the same held good as to certain hours of the day and night in bright weather he did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower shadows but being at all times liable to be called by his electric bell and at such times listening for it with redoubled anxiety the relief was less than i would suppose he took me into his box where there was a fire a desk for an official book in which he had to make certain entries a telegraphic instrument with its dial face and needles and the little bell of which he had spoken on my trusting that he would excuse the remark that he had been well educated and i hoped i might say without offence perhaps educated above that station he observed that instances of slight incongruity in suchwise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men that he had heard it was so in workhouses in the police force even in that last desperate resource the army and that he knew it was so more or less in any great railway staff he had been when young if i could believe it sitting in that hut he scarcely could a student of natural philosophy and had attended lectures but he had run wild misused his opportunities gone down and never risen again he had no complaint to offer about that he had made his bed and he lay upon it it was far too late to make another all that i have here condensed he said in a quiet manner with his grave dark regards divided between me and the fire he threw in the word sir from time to time and especially when he referred to his youth as though to request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what i found him he was several times interrupted by the little bell and had to read off messages and send replies once he had to stand without the door and display a flag as a train passed and make some verbal communication to the driver in the discharge of his duties i observed him to be remarkably exact and vigilant breaking off his discourse at a syllable and remaining silent until what he had to do was done in a word i should have set this man down as one of the safest of men to be employed in that capacity but for the circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off with a fallen colour turned his face towards the little bell when it did not ring opened the door of the hut which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy damp and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the tunnel on both of those occasions he came back to the fire with the inexplicable air upon him which i had remarked without being able to define when we were so far asunder said i when i rose to leave him you almost make me think that i have met with a contented man i am afraid i must acknowledge that i said it to lead him on i believe i used to be so he rejoined in the low voice in which he had first spoken but i am troubled sir i am troubled he would have recalled the words if he could he had said them however and i took them up quickly with what what is your trouble it is very difficult to impart sir it is very very difficult to speak of if ever you make me another visit i will try to tell you but i expressly intend to make you another visit say when shall it be i go off early in the morning and i shall be on again at ten tomorrow night sir i will come at eleven he thanked me and went out at the door with me ill show my white light sir he said in his peculiar low voice till you have found the way up when you have found it dont call out and when you are at the top dont call out his manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me but i said no more than very well and when you come down tomorrow night dont call out let me ask you a parting question what made you cry halloa below there tonight heaven knows said i i cried something to that effect not to that effect sir those were the very words i know them well admit those were the very words i said them no doubt because i saw you below for no other reason what other reason could i possibly have you had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in any supernatural way no he wished me good night and held up his light i walked by the side of the down line of rails with a very disagreeable sensation of a train coming behind me until i found the path it was easier to mount than to descend and i got back to my inn without any adventure punctual to my appointment i placed my foot on the first notch of the zigzag next night as the distant clocks were striking eleven he was waiting for me at the bottom with his white light on i have not called out i said when we came close together may i speak now by all means sir good night then and heres my hand good night sir and heres mine with that we walked side by side to his box entered it closed the door and sat down by the fire i have made up my mind sir he began bending forward as soon as we were seated and speaking in a tone but a little above a whisper that you shall not have to ask me twice what troubles me i took you for some one else yesterday evening that troubles me that mistake no that some one else who is it i dont know like me i dont know i never saw the face the left arm is across the face and the right arm is waved violently waved this way i followed his action with my eyes and it was the action of an arm gesticulating with the utmost passion and vehemence for gods sake clear the way one moonlight night said the man i was sitting here when i heard a voice cry halloa below there i started up looked from that door and saw this some one else standing by the red light near the tunnel waving as i just now showed you the voice seemed hoarse with shouting and it cried look out look out and then again halloa below there look out i caught up my lamp turned it on red and ran towards the figure calling whats wrong what has happened where it stood just outside the blackness of the tunnel i advanced so close upon it that i wondered at its keeping the sleeve across its eyes i ran right up at it and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away when it was gone into the tunnel said i no i ran on into the tunnel five hundred yards i stopped and held my lamp above my head and saw the figures of the measured distance and saw the wet stains stealing down the walls and trickling through the arch i ran out again faster than i had run in for i had a mortal abhorrence of the place upon me and i looked all round the red light with my own red light and i went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop of it and i came down again and ran back here i telegraphed both ways an alarm has been given is anything wrong the answer came back both ways all well resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my spine i showed him how that this figure must be a deception of his sense of sight and how that figures originating in disease of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye were known to have often troubled patients some of whom had become conscious of the nature of their affliction and had even proved it by experiments upon themselves as to an imaginary cry said i do but listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires that was all very well he returned after we had sat listening for a while and he ought to know something of the wind and the wires he who so often passed long winter nights there alone and watching but he would beg to remark that he had not finished i asked his pardon and he slowly added these words touching my arm within six hours after the appearance the memorable accident on this line happened and within ten hours the dead and wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where the figure had stood a disagreeable shudder crept over me but i did my best against it it was not to be denied i rejoined that this was a remarkable coincidence calculated deeply to impress his mind but it was unquestionable that remarkable coincidences did continually occur and they must be taken into account in dealing with such a subject though to be sure i must admit i added for i thought i saw that he was going to bring the objection to bear upon me men of common sense did not allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations of life he again begged to remark that he had not finished i again begged his pardon for being betrayed into interruptions this he said again laying his hand upon my arm and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes was just a year ago six or seven months passed and i had recovered from the surprise and shock when one morning as the day was breaking i standing at that door looked towards the red light and saw the spectre again he stopped with a fixed look at me did it cry out no it was silent did it wave its arm no it leaned against the shaft of the light with both hands before the face like this once more i followed his action with my eyes it was an action of mourning i have seen such an attitude in stone figures on tombs did you go up to it i came in and sat down partly to collect my thoughts partly because it had turned me faint when i went to the door again daylight was above me and the ghost was gone but nothing followed nothing came of this he touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice giving a ghastly nod each time that very day as a train came out of the tunnel i noticed at a carriage window on my side what looked like a confusion of hands and heads and something waved i saw it just in time to signal the driver stop he shut off and put his brake on but the train drifted past here a hundred and fifty yards or more i ran after it and as i went along heard terrible screams and cries a beautiful young lady had died instantaneously in one of the compartments and was brought in here and laid down on this floor between us involuntarily i pushed my chair back as i looked from the boards at which he pointed to himself true sir true precisely as it happened so i tell it you i could think of nothing to say to any purpose and my mouth was very dry the wind and the wires took up the story with a long lamenting wail he resumed now sir mark this and judge how my mind is troubled the spectre came back a week ago ever since it has been there now and again by fits and starts at the light at the dangerlight what does it seem to do he repeated if possible with increased passion and vehemence that former gesticulation of for gods sake clear the way then he went on i have no peace or rest for it it calls to me for many minutes together in an agonised manner below there look out look out it stands waving to me it rings my little bell i caught at that did it ring your bell yesterday evening when i was here and you went to the door twice why see said i how your imagination misleads you my eyes were on the bell and my ears were open to the bell and if i am a living man it did not ring at those times no nor at any other time except when it was rung in the natural course of physical things by the station communicating with you he shook his head i have never made a mistake as to that yet sir i have never confused the spectres ring with the mans the ghosts ring is a strange vibration in the bell that it derives from nothing else and i have not asserted that the bell stirs to the eye i dont wonder that you failed to hear it but i heard it and did the spectre seem to be there when you looked out it was there both times he repeated firmly both times will you come to the door with me and look for it now he bit his underlip as though he were somewhat unwilling but arose i opened the door and stood on the step while he stood in the doorway there was the dangerlight there was the dismal mouth of the tunnel there were the high wet stone walls of the cutting there were the stars above them do you see it i asked him taking particular note of his face his eyes were prominent and strained but not very much more so perhaps than my own had been when i had directed them earnestly towards the same spot no he answered it is not there agreed said i we went in again shut the door and resumed our seats i was thinking how best to improve this advantage if it might be called one when he took up the conversation in such a matter of course way so assuming that there could be no serious question of fact between us that i felt myself placed in the weakest of positions by this time you will fully understand sir he said that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question what does the spectre mean i was not sure i told him that i did fully understand what is its warning against he said ruminating with his eyes on the fire and only by times turning them on me what is the danger where is the danger there is danger overhanging somewhere on the line some dreadful calamity will happen it is not to be doubted this third time after what has gone before but surely this is a cruel haunting of me what can i do he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped the drops from his heated forehead if i telegraph danger on either side of me or on both i can give no reason for it he went on wiping the palms of his hands i should get into trouble and do no good they would think i was mad this is the way it would workmessage danger take care answer what danger where message dont know but for gods sake take care they would displace me what else could they do his pain of mind was most pitiable to see it was the mental torture of a conscientious man oppressed beyond endurance by an unintelligible responsibility involving life when it first stood under the dangerlight he went on putting his dark hair back from his head and drawing his hands outward across and across his temples in an extremity of feverish distress why not tell me where that accident was to happenif it must happen why not tell me how it could be avertedif it could have been averted when on its second coming it hid its face why not tell me instead she is going to die let them keep her at home if it came on those two occasions only to show me that its warnings were true and so to prepare me for the third why not warn me plainly now and i lord help me a mere poor signalman on this solitary station why not go to somebody with credit to be believed and power to act when i saw him in this state i saw that for the poor mans sake as well as for the public safety what i had to do for the time was to compose his mind therefore setting aside all question of reality or unreality between us i represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty must do well and that at least it was his comfort that he understood his duty though he did not understand these confounding appearances in this effort i succeeded far better than in the attempt to reason him out of his conviction he became calm the occupations incidental to his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on his attention and i left him at two in the morning i had offered to stay through the night but he would not hear of it that i more than once looked back at the red light as i ascended the pathway that i did not like the red light and that i should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it i see no reason to conceal nor did i like the two sequences of the accident and the dead girl i see no reason to conceal that either but what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how ought i to act having become the recipient of this disclosure i had proved the man to be intelligent vigilant painstaking and exact but how long might he remain so in his state of mind though in a subordinate position still he held a most important trust and would i for instance like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to execute it with precision unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his superiors in the company without first being plain with himself and proposing a middle course to him i ultimately resolved to offer to accompany him otherwise keeping his secret for the present to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in those parts and to take his opinion a change in his time of duty would come round next night he had apprised me and he would be off an hour or two after sunrise and on again soon after sunset i had appointed to return accordingly next evening was a lovely evening and i walked out early to enjoy it the sun was not yet quite down when i traversed the fieldpath near the top of the deep cutting i would extend my walk for an hour i said to myself half an hour on and half an hour back and it would then be time to go to my signalmans box before pursuing my stroll i stepped to the brink and mechanically looked down from the point from which i had first seen him i cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me when close at the mouth of the tunnel i saw the appearance of a man with his left sleeve across his eyes passionately waving his right arm the nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment for in a moment i saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed and that there was a little group of other men standing at a short distance to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he made the dangerlight was not yet lighted against its shaft a little low hut entirely new to me had been made of some wooden supports and tarpaulin it looked no bigger than a bed with an irresistible sense that something was wrongwith a flashing selfreproachful fear that fatal mischief had come of my leaving the man there and causing no one to be sent to overlook or correct what he didi descended the notched path with all the speed i could make what is the matter i asked the men signalman killed this morning sir not the man belonging to that box yes sir not the man i know you will recognise him sir if you knew him said the man who spoke for the others solemnly uncovering his own head and raising an end of the tarpaulin for his face is quite composed o how did this happen how did this happen i asked turning from one to another as the hut closed in again he was cut down by an engine sir no man in england knew his work better but somehow he was not clear of the outer rail it was just at broad day he had struck the light and had the lamp in his hand as the engine came out of the tunnel his back was towards her and she cut him down that man drove her and was showing how it happened show the gentleman tom the man who wore a rough dark dress stepped back to his former place at the mouth of the tunnel coming round the curve in the tunnel sir he said i saw him at the end like as if i saw him down a perspectiveglass there was no time to check speed and i knew him to be very careful as he didnt seem to take heed of the whistle i shut it off when we were running down upon him and called to him as loud as i could call what did you say i said below there look out look out for gods sake clear the way i started ah it was a dreadful time sir i never left off calling to him i put this arm before my eyes not to see and i waved this arm to the last but it was no use without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its curious circumstances more than on any other i may in closing it point out the coincidence that the warning of the enginedriver included not only the words which the unfortunate signalman had repeated to me as haunting him but also the words which i myselfnot hehad attached and that only in my own mind to the gesticulation he had imitated no branch line the enginedriver altogether well altogether since ive killed seven men and boys it aint many in all those years these startling words he uttered in a serious tone as he leaned against the stationwall he was a thickset ruddyfaced man with coalblack eyes the whites of which were not white but a brownishyellow and apparently scarred and seamed as if they had been operated upon they were eyes that had worked hard in looking through wind and weather he was dressed in a short black peajacket and grimy white canvas trousers and wore on his head a flat black cap there was no sign of levity in his face his look was serious even to sadness and there was an air of responsibility about his whole bearing which assured me that he spoke in earnest yes sir i have been for fiveandtwenty years a locomotive enginedriver and in all that time ive only killed seven men and boys theres not many of my mates as can say as much for themselves steadiness sirsteadiness and keeping your eyes open is what does it when i say seven men and boys i mean my matesstokers porters and so forth i dont count passengers how did he become an enginedriver my father he said was a wheelwright in a small way and lived in a little cottage by the side of the railway which runs betwixt leeds and selby it was the second railway laid down in the kingdom the second after the liverpool and manchester where mr huskisson was killed as you may have heard on sir when the trains rushed by we young uns used to run out to look at em and hooray i noticed the driver turning handles and making it go and i thought to myself it would be a fine thing to be a enginedriver and have the control of a wonderful machine like that before the railway the driver of the mailcoach was the biggest man i knew i thought i should like to be the driver of a coach we had a picture in our cottage of george the third in a red coat i always mixed up the driver of the mailcoachwho had a red coat toowith the king only he had a lowcrowned broadbrimmed hat which the king hadnt in my idea the king couldnt be a greater man than the driver of the mailcoach i had always a fancy to be a head man of some kind when i went to leeds once and saw a man conducting a orchestra i thought i should like to be the conductor of a orchestra when i went home i made myself a baton and went about the fields conducting a orchestra it wasnt there of course but i pretended it was at another time a man with a whip and a speakingtrumpet on the stage outside a show took my fancy and i thought i should like to be him but when the train came the enginedriver put them all in the shade and i was resolved to be a enginedriver it wasnt long before i had to do something to earn my own living though i was only a young un my father died suddenlyhe was killed by thunder and lightning while standing under a tree out of the rainand mother couldnt keep us all the day after my fathers burial i walked down to the station and said i wanted to be a enginedriver the stationmaster laughed a bit said i was for beginning early but that i was not quite big enough yet he gave me a penny and told me to go home and grow and come again in ten years time i didnt dream of danger then if i couldnt be a enginedriver i was determined to have something to do about a engine so as i could get nothing else i went on board a humber steamer and broke up coals for the stoker that was how i began from that i became a stoker first on board a boat and then on a locomotive then after two years service i became a driver on the very line which passed our cottage my mother and my brothers and sisters came out to look at me the first day i drove i was watching for them and they was watching for me and they waved their hands and hoorad and i waved my hand to them i had the steam well up and was going at a rattling pace and rare proud i was that minute never was so proud in my life when a man has a liking for a thing its as good as being clever in a very short time i became one of the best drivers on the line that was allowed i took a pride in it you see and liked it no i didnt know much about the engine scientifically as you call it but i could put her to rights if anything went out of gearthat is to say if there was nothing brokenbut i couldnt have explained how the steam worked inside starting a engine its just like drawing a drop of gin you turn a handle and off she goes then you turn the handle the other way put on the brakes and you stop her theres not much more in it so far its no good being scientific and knowing the principle of the engine inside no good at all fitters who know all the ins and outs of the engine make the worst drivers thats well known they know too much its just as ive heard of a man with regard to his inside if he knew what a complicated machine it is he would never eat or drink or dance or run or do anything for fear of busting something so it is with fitters but us as are not troubled with such thoughts we go ahead but starting a engines one thing and driving of her is another any one a child amost can turn on the steam and turn it off again but it aint every one that can keep a engine well on the road no more than it aint every one who can ride a horse properly it is much the same thing if you gallop a horse right off for a mile or two you take the wind out of him and for the next mile or two you must let him trot or walk so it is with a engine if you put on too much steam to get over the ground at the start you exhaust the boiler and then youll have to crawl along till your fresh water boils up the great thing in driving is to go steady never to let your water get too low nor your fire too low its the same with a kettle if you fill it up when its about half empty it soon comes to the boil again but if you dont fill it up until the waters nearly out its a long time in coming to the boil again another thing you should never make spurts unless you are detained and lose time you should go up a incline and down a incline at the same pace sometimes a driver will waste his steam and when he comes to a hill he has scarcely enough to drag him up when youre in a train that goes by fits and starts you may be sure that there is a bad driver on the engine that kind of driving frightens passengers dreadful when the train after rattling along suddenly slackens speed when it aint near a station it may be in the middle of a tunnel the passengers think there is danger but generally its because the driver has exhausted his steam i drove the brighton express four or five years before i come here and the annualsthat is the passengers who had annual ticketsalways said they knew when i was on the engine because they wasnt jerked gentlemen used to say as they came on to the platform who drives todayjim martin and when the guard told them yes they said all right and took their seats quite comfortable but the driver never gets so much as a shilling the guard comes in for all that and he does nothing much few ever think of the driver i dare say they think the train goes along of itself yet if we didnt keep a sharp lookout know our duty and do it they might all go smash at any moment i used to make that journey to brighton in fiftytwo minutes the papers said fortynine minutes but that was coming it a little too strong i had to watch signals all the way one every two miles so that me and my stoker were on the stretch all the time doing two things at onceattending to the engine and looking out ive driven on this line eightyone miles and threequarters in eightysix minutes theres no danger in speed if you have a good road a good engine and not too many coaches behind no we dont call them carriages we call them coaches yes oscillation means danger if youre ever in a coach that oscillates much tell of it at the first station and get it coupled up closer coaches when theyre too loose are apt to jump or swing off the rails and its quite as dangerous when theyre coupled up too close there ought to be just space enough for the buffers to work easy passengers are frightened in tunnels but theres less danger now in tunnels than anywhere else we never enter a tunnel unless its signalled clear a train can be stopped wonderful quick even when running express if the guards act with the driver and clap on all the brakes promptly much depends upon the guards one brake behind is as good as two in front the engine you see loses weight as she burns her coals and consumes her water but the coaches behind dont alter we have a good deal of trouble with young guards in their anxiety to perform their duties they put on the brakes too soon so that sometimes we can scarcely drag the train into the station when they grow older at it they are not so anxious and dont put them on soon enough its no use to say when an accident happens that they did not put on the brakes in time they swear they did and you cant prove that they didnt do i think that the tapping of the wheels with a hammer is a mere ceremony well i dont know exactly i should not like to say its not often that the chaps find anything wrong they may sometimes be half asleep when a train comes into a station in the middle of the night you would be yourself they ought to tap the axlebox but they dont many accidents take place that never get into the papers many trains full of passengers escape being dashed to pieces by next door to a miracle nobody knows anything about it but the driver and the stoker i remember once when i was driving on the eastern counties going round a curve i suddenly saw a train coming along on the same line of rails i clapped on the brake but it was too late i thought seeing the engine almost close upon us i cried to my stoker to jump he jumped off the engine almost before the words were out of my mouth i was just taking my hand off the lever to follow when the coming train turned off on the points and the next instant the hind coach passed my engine by a shave it was the nearest touch i ever saw my stoker was killed in another half second i should have jumped off and been killed too what would have become of the train without us is more than i can tell you there are heaps of people run over that no one ever hears about one dark night in the black country me and my mate felt something wet and warm splash in our faces that didnt come from the engine bill i said no he said its something thick jim it was blood thats what it was we heard afterwards that a collier had been run over when we kill any of our own chaps we say as little about it as possible its generallymostly alwaystheir own fault no we never think of danger ourselves were used to it you see but were not reckless i dont believe theres any body of men that takes more pride in their work than enginedrivers do we are as proud and as fond of our engines as if they were living things as proud of them as a huntsman or a jockey is of his horse and a engine has almost as many ways as a horse shes a kicker a plunger a roarer or what not in her way put a stranger on to my engine and he wouldnt know what to do with her yes theres wonderful improvements in engines since the last great exhibition some of them take up their water without stopping thats a wonderful invention and yet as simple as a b c there are watertroughs at certain places lying between the rails by moving a lever you let down the mouth of a scoop into the water and as you rush along the water is forced into the tank at the rate of three thousand gallons a minute a enginedrivers chief anxiety is to keep time thats what he thinks most of when i was driving the brighton express i always felt like as if i was riding a race against time i had no fear of the pace what i feared was losing way and not getting in to the minute we have to give in an account of our time when we arrive the company provides us with watches and we go by them before starting on a journey we pass through a room to be inspected thats to see if we are sober but they dont say nothing to us and a man who was a little gone might pass easy ive known a stoker that had passed the inspection come on to the engine as drunk as a fly flop down among the coals and sleep there like a log for the whole run i had to be my own stoker then if you ask me if enginedrivers are drinking men i must answer you that they are pretty well its trying work one half of you cold as ice tother half hot as fire wet one minute dry the next if ever a man had an excuse for drinking that mans a enginedriver and yet i dont know if ever a driver goes upon his engine drunk if he was to the wind would soon sober him i believe enginedrivers as a body are the healthiest fellows alive but they dont live long the cause of that i believe to be the cold food and the shaking by the cold food i mean that a enginedriver never gets his meals comfortable hes never at home to his dinner when he starts away the first thing in the morning he takes a bit of cold meat and a piece of bread with him for his dinner and generally he has to eat it in the shed for he mustnt leave his engine you can understand how the jolting and shaking knocks a man up after a bit the insurance companies wont take us at ordinary rates were obliged to be foresters or old friends or that sort of thing where they aint so particular the wages of a enginedriver average about eight shillings a day but if hes a good schemer with his coalsyes i mean if he economises his coalshes allowed so much more some will make from five to ten shillings a week that way i dont complain of the wages particular but its hard lines for such as us to have to pay incometax the company gives an account of all our wages and we have to pay its a shame our domestic lifeour life at home you mean well as to that we dont see much of our families i leave home at halfpast seven in the morning and dont get back again until halfpast nine or maybe later the children are not up when i leave and theyve gone to bed again before i come home this is about my dayleave london at drive for four hours and a half cold snack on the engine step see to engine drive back again clean engine report myself and home twelve hours hard and anxious work and no comfortable victuals yes our wives are anxious about us for we never know when we go out if well ever come back again we ought to go home the minute we leave the station and report ourselves to those that are thinking on us and depending on us but im afraid we dont always perhaps we go first to the publichouse and perhaps you would too if you were in charge of a engine all day long but the wives have a way of their own of finding out if were all right they inquire among each other have you seen my jim one says no says another but jack see him coming out of the station half an hour ago then she knows that her jims all right and knows where to find him if she wants him its a sad thing when any of us have to carry bad news to a mates wife none of us likes that job i remember when jack davidge was killed none of us could face his poor missus with the news she had seven children poor thing and two of em the youngest was down with the fever we got old mrs berridgetom berridges motherto break it to her but she knew summat was the matter the minute the old woman went in and afore she spoke a word fell down like as if she was dead she lay all night like that and never heard from mortal lips until next morning that her jack was killed but she knew it in her heart its a pitch and toss kind of a life ours and yet i never was nervous on a engine but once i never think of my own life you go in for staking that when you begin and you get used to the risk i never think of the passengers either the thoughts of a enginedriver never go behind his engine if he keeps his engine all right the coaches behind will be all right as far as the driver is concerned but once i did think of the passengers my little boy bill was among them that morning he was a poor little cripple fellow that we all loved more nor the others because he was a cripple and so quiet and wiselike he was going down to his aunt in the country who was to take care of him for a while we thought the country air would do him good i did think there were lives behind me that morning at least i thought hard of one little life that was in my hands there were twenty coaches on my little bill seemed to me to be in every one of em my hand trembled as i turned on the steam i felt my heart thumping as we drew close to the pointsmans box as we neared the junction i was all in a cold sweat at the end of the first fifty miles i was nearly eleven minutes behind time whats the matter with you this morning my stoker said did you have a drop too much last night dont speak to me fred i said till we get to peterborough and keep a sharp lookout theres a good fellow i never was so thankful in my life as when i shut off steam to enter the station at peterborough little bills aunt was waiting for him and i saw her lift him out of the carriage i called out to her to bring him to me and i took him upon the engine and kissed himah twenty times i should thinkmaking him in such a mess with grease and coaldust as you never saw i was all right for the rest of the journey and i do believe sir the passengers were safer after little bill was gone it would never do you see for enginedrivers to know too much or to feel too much no branch line the compensation house theres not a lookingglass in all the house sir its some peculiar fancy of my masters there isnt one in any single room in the house it was a dark and gloomylooking building and had been purchased by this company for an enlargement of their goods station the value of the house had been referred to what was popularly called a compensation jury and the house was called in consequence the compensation house it had become the companys property but its tenant still remained in possession pending the commencement of active building operations my attention was originally drawn to this house because it stood directly in front of a collection of huge pieces of timber which lay near this part of the line and on which i sometimes sat for half an hour at a time when i was tired by my wanderings about mugby junction it was square cold greylooking built of roughhewn stone and roofed with thin slabs of the same material its windows were few in number and very small for the size of the building in the great blank grey broadside there were only four windows the entrancedoor was in the middle of the house there was a window on either side of it and there were two more in the single story above the blinds were all closely drawn and when the door was shut the dreary building gave no sign of life or occupation but the door was not always shut sometimes it was opened from within with a great jingling of bolts and doorchains and then a man would come forward and stand upon the doorstep snuffing the air as one might do who was ordinarily kept on rather a small allowance of that element he was stout thickset and perhaps fifty or sixty years olda man whose hair was cut exceedingly close who wore a large bushy beard and whose eye had a sociable twinkle in it which was prepossessing he was dressed whenever i saw him in a greenishbrown frockcoat made of some material which was not cloth wore a waistcoat and trousers of light colour and had a frill to his shirtan ornament by the way which did not seem to go at all well with the beard which was continually in contact with it it was the custom of this worthy person after standing for a short time on the threshold inhaling the air to come forward into the road and after glancing at one of the upper windows in a half mechanical way to cross over to the logs and leaning over the fence which guarded the railway to look up and down the line it passed before the house with the air of a man accomplishing a selfimposed task of which nothing was expected to come this done he would cross the road again and turning on the threshold to take a final sniff of air disappeared once more within the house bolting and chaining the door again as if there were no probability of its being reopened for at least a week yet half an hour had not passed before he was out in the road again sniffing the air and looking up and down the line as before it was not very long before i managed to scrape acquaintance with this restless personage i soon found out that my friend with the shirtfrill was the confidential servant butler valet factotum what you will of a sick gentleman a mr oswald strange who had recently come to inhabit the house opposite and concerning whose history my new acquaintance whose name i ascertained was masey seemed disposed to be somewhat communicative his master it appeared had come down to this place partly for the sake of reducing his establishmentnot mr masey was swift to inform me on economical principles but because the poor gentleman for particular reasons wished to have few dependents about himpartly in order that he might be near his old friend dr garden who was established in the neighbourhood and whose society and advice were necessary to mr stranges life that life was it appeared held by this suffering gentleman on a precarious tenure it was ebbing away fast with each passing hour the servant already spoke of his master in the past tense describing him to me as a young gentleman not more than fiveandthirty years of age with a young face as far as the features and build of it went but with an expression which had nothing of youth about it this was the great peculiarity of the man at a distance he looked younger than he was by many years and strangers at the time when he had been used to get about always took him for a man of seven or eightandtwenty but they changed their minds on getting nearer to him old masey had a way of his own of summing up the peculiarities of his master repeating twenty times over sir he was strange by name and strange by nature and strange to look at into the bargain it was during my second or third interview with the old fellow that he uttered the words quoted at the beginning of this plain narrative not such a thing as a lookingglass in all the house the old man said standing beside my piece of timber and looking across reflectively at the house opposite not one in the sittingrooms i suppose you mean no sir i mean sittingrooms and bedrooms both there isnt so much as a shavingglass as big as the palm of your hand anywhere but how is it i asked why are there no lookingglasses in any of the rooms ah sir replied masey thats what none of us can ever tell there is the mystery its just a fancy on the part of my master he had some strange fancies and this was one of them a pleasant gentleman he was to live with as any servant could desire a liberal gentleman and one who gave but little trouble always ready with a kind word and a kind deed too for the matter of that there was not a house in all the parish of st georges in which we lived before we came down here where the servants had more holidays or a better table kept but for all that he had his queer ways and his fancies as i may call them and this was one of them and the point he made of it sir the old man went on the extent to which that regulation was enforced whenever a new servant was engaged and the changes in the establishment it occasioned in hiring a new servant the very first stipulation made was that about the lookingglasses it was one of my duties to explain the thing as far as it could be explained before any servant was taken into the house youll find it an easy place i used to say with a liberal table good wages and a deal of leisure but theres one thing you must make up your mind to you must do without lookingglasses while youre here for there isnt one in the house and whats more there never will be but how did you know there never would be one i asked lor bless you sir if youd seen and heard all that id seen and heard you could have no doubt about it why only to take one instancei remember a particular day when my master had occasion to go into the housekeepers room where the cook lived to see about some alterations that were making and when a pretty scene took place the cookshe was a very ugly woman and awful vainhad left a little bit of lookingglass about six inches square upon the chimneypiece she had got it surreptious and kept it always locked up but shed left it out being called away suddenly while titivating her hair i had seen the glass and was making for the chimneypiece as fast as i could but master came in front of it before i could get there and it was all over in a moment he gave one long piercing look into it turned deadly pale and seizing the glass dashed it into a hundred pieces on the floor and then stamped upon the fragments and ground them into powder with his feet he shut himself up for the rest of that day in his own room first ordering me to discharge the cook then and there at a moments notice what an extraordinary thing i said pondering ah sir continued the old man it was astonishing what trouble i had with those womenservants it was difficult to get any that would take the place at all under the circumstances what not so much as a mossul to do ones air at they would say and theyd go off in spite of extra wages then those who did consent to come what lies they would tell to be sure they would protest that they didnt want to look in the glass that they never had been in the habit of looking in the glass and all the while that very wench would have her lookingglass of some kind or another hid away among her clothes upstairs sooner or later she would bring it out too and leave it about somewhere or other just like the cook where it was as likely as not that master might see it and thenfor girls like that have no consciences sirwhen i had caught one of em at it shed turn round as bold as brass and how am i to know whether my airs parted straight shed say just as if it hadnt been considered in her wages that that was the very thing which she never was to know while she lived in our house a vain lot sir and the ugly ones always the vainest there was no end to their dodges theyd have lookingglasses in the interiors of their workboxlids where it was next to impossible that i could find em or inside the covers of hymnbooks or cookerybooks or in their caddies i recollect one girl a sly one she was and marked with the smallpox terrible who was always reading her prayerbook at odd times sometimes i used to think what a religious mind shed got and at other times depending on the mood i was in i would conclude that it was the marriageservice she was studying but one day when i got behind her to satisfy my doubtslo and behold it was the old story a bit of glass without a frame fastened into the kiver with the outside edges of the sheets of postagestamps dodges why theyd keep their lookingglasses in the scullery or the coalcellar or leave them in charge of the servants next door or with the milkwoman round the corner but have em they would and i dont mind confessing sir said the old man bringing his long speech to an end that it was an inconveniency not to have so much as a scrap to shave before i used to go to the barbers at first but i soon gave that up and took to wearing my beard as my master did likewise to keeping my hairmr masey touched his head as he spokeso short that it didnt require any parting before or behind i sat for some time lost in amazement and staring at my companion my curiosity was powerfully stimulated and the desire to learn more was very strong within me had your master any personal defect i inquired which might have made it distressing to him to see his own image reflected by no means sir said the old man he was as handsome a gentleman as you would wish to see a little delicatelooking and careworn perhaps with a very pale face but as free from any deformity as you or i sir no sir no it was nothing of that then what was it what is it i asked desperately is there no one who is or has been in your masters confidence yes sir said the old fellow with his eyes turning to that window opposite there is one person who knows all my masters secrets and this secret among the rest and who is that the old man turned round and looked at me fixedly the doctor here he said dr garden my masters very old friend i should like to speak with this gentleman i said involuntarily he is with my master now answered masey he will be coming out presently and i think i may say he will answer any question you may like to put to him as the old man spoke the door of the house opened and a middleaged gentleman who was tall and thin but who lost something of his height by a habit of stooping appeared on the step old masey left me in a moment he muttered something about taking the doctors directions and hastened across the road the tall gentleman spoke to him for a minute or two very seriously probably about the patient upstairs and it then seemed to me from their gestures that i myself was the subject of some further conversation between them at all events when old masey retired into the house the doctor came across to where i was standing and addressed me with a very agreeable smile john masey tells me that you are interested in the case of my poor friend sir i am now going back to my house and if you dont mind the trouble of walking with me i shall be happy to enlighten you as far as i am able i hastened to make my apologies and express my acknowledgments and we set off together when we had reached the doctors house and were seated in his study i ventured to inquire after the health of this poor gentleman i am afraid there is no amendment nor any prospect of amendment said the doctor old masey has told you something of his strange condition has he not yes he has told me something i answered and he says you know all about it dr garden looked very grave i dont know all about it i only know what happens when he comes into the presence of a lookingglass but as to the circumstances which have led to his being haunted in the strangest fashion that i ever heard of i know no more of them than you do haunted i repeated and in the strangest fashion that you ever heard of dr garden smiled at my eagerness seemed to be collecting his thoughts and presently went on i made the acquaintance of mr oswald strange in a curious way it was on board of an italian steamer bound from civita vecchia to marseilles we had been travelling all night in the morning i was shaving myself in the cabin when suddenly this man came behind me glanced for a moment into the small mirror before which i was standing and then without a word of warning tore it from the nail and dashed it to pieces at my feet his face was at first livid with passionit seemed to me rather the passion of fear than of angerbut it changed after a moment and he seemed ashamed of what he had done well continued the doctor relapsing for a moment into a smile of course i was in a devil of a rage i was operating on my underjaw and the start the thing gave me caused me to cut myself besides altogether it seemed an outrageous and insolent thing and i gave it to poor strange in a style of language which i am sorry to think of now but which i hope was excusable at the time as to the offender himself his confusion and regret now that his passion was at an end disarmed me he sent for the steward and paid most liberally for the damage done to the steamboat property explaining to him and to some other passengers who were present in the cabin that what had happened had been accidental for me however he had another explanation perhaps he felt that i must know it to have been no accidentperhaps he really wished to confide in some one at all events he owned to me that what he had done was done under the influence of an uncontrollable impulsea seizure which took him he said at timessomething like a fit he begged my pardon and entreated that i would endeavour to disassociate him personally from this action of which he was heartily ashamed then he attempted a sickly joke poor fellow about his wearing a beard and feeling a little spiteful in consequence when he saw other people taking the trouble to shave but he said nothing about any infirmity or delusion and shortly after left me in my professional capacity i could not help taking some interest in mr strange i did not altogether lose sight of him after our seajourney to marseilles was over i found him a pleasant companion up to a certain point but i always felt that there was a reserve about him he was uncommunicative about his past life and especially would never allude to anything connected with his travels or his residence in italy which however i could make out had been a long one he spoke italian well and seemed familiar with the country but disliked to talk about it during the time we spent together there were seasons when he was so little himself that i with a pretty large experience was almost afraid to be with him his attacks were violent and sudden in the last degree and there was one most extraordinary feature connected with them allsome horrible association of ideas took possession of him whenever he found himself before a lookingglass and after we had travelled together for a time i dreaded the sight of a mirror hanging harmlessly against a wall or a toiletglass standing on a dressingtable almost as much as he did poor strange was not always affected in the same manner by a lookingglass sometimes it seemed to madden him with fury at other times it appeared to turn him to stone remaining motionless and speechless as if attacked by catalepsy one nightthe worst things always happen at night and oftener than one would think on stormy nightswe arrived at a small town in the central district of auvergne a place but little known out of the line of railways and to which we had been drawn partly by the antiquarian attractions which the place possessed and partly by the beauty of the scenery the weather had been rather against us the day had been dull and murky the heat stifling and the sky had threatened mischief since the morning at sundown these threats were fulfilled the thunderstorm which had been all day coming upas it seemed to us against the windburst over the place where we were lodged with very great violence there are some practicalminded persons with strong constitutions who deny roundly that their fellowcreatures are or can be affected in mind or body by atmospheric influences i am not a disciple of that school simply because i cannot believe that those changes of weather which have so much effect upon animals and even on inanimate objects can fail to have some influence on a piece of machinery so sensitive and intricate as the human frame i think then that it was in part owing to the disturbed state of the atmosphere that on this particular evening i felt nervous and depressed when my new friend strange and i parted for the night i felt as little disposed to go to rest as i ever did in my life the thunder was still lingering among the mountains in the midst of which our inn was placed sometimes it seemed nearer and at other times further off but it never left off altogether except for a few minutes at a time i was quite unable to shake off a succession of painful ideas which persistently besieged my mind it is hardly necessary to add that i thought from time to time of my travellingcompanion in the next room his image was almost continually before me he had been dull and depressed all the evening and when we parted for the night there was a look in his eyes which i could not get out of my memory there was a door between our rooms and the partition dividing them was not very solid and yet i had heard no sound since i parted from him which could indicate that he was there at all much less that he was awake and stirring i was in a mood sir which made this silence terrible to me and so many foolish fanciesas that he was lying there dead or in a fit or what nottook possession of me that at last i could bear it no longer i went to the door and after listening very attentively but quite in vain for any sound i at last knocked pretty sharply there was no answer feeling that longer suspense would be unendurable i without more ceremony turned the handle and went in it was a great bare room and so imperfectly lighted by a single candle that it was almost impossibleexcept when the lightning flashedto see into its great dark corners a small rickety bedstead stood against one of the walls shrouded by yellow cotton curtains passed through a great iron ring in the ceiling there was for all other furniture an old chest of drawers which served also as a washingstand having a small basin and ewer and a single towel arranged on the top of it there were moreover two ancient chairs and a dressingtable on this last stood a large oldfashioned lookingglass with a carved frame i must have seen all these things because i remember them so well now but i do not know how i could have seen them for it seems to me that from the moment of my entering that room the action of my senses and of the faculties of my mind was held fast by the ghastly figure which stood motionless before the lookingglass in the middle of the empty room how terrible it was the weak light of one candle standing on the table shone upon stranges face lighting it from below and throwing as i now remember his shadow vast and black upon the wall behind him and upon the ceiling overhead he was leaning rather forward with his hands upon the table supporting him and gazing into the glass which stood before him with a horrible fixity the sweat was on his white face his rigid features and his pale lips showed in that feeble light were horrible more than words can tell to look at he was so completely stupefied and lost that the noise i had made in knocking and in entering the room was unobserved by him not even when i called him loudly by name did he move or did his face change what a vision of horror that was in the great dark empty room in a silence that was something more than negative that ghastly figure frozen into stone by some unexplained terror and the silence and the stillness the very thunder had ceased now my heart stood still with fear then moved by some instinctive feeling under whose influence i acted mechanically i crept with slow steps nearer and nearer to the table and at last half expecting to see some spectre even more horrible than this which i saw already i looked over his shoulder into the lookingglass i happened to touch his arm though only in the lightest manner in that one moment the spell which had held himwho knows how longenchained seemed broken and he lived in this world again he turned round upon me as suddenly as a tiger makes its spring and seized me by the arm i have told you that even before i entered my friends room i had felt all that night depressed and nervous the necessity for action at this time was however so obvious and this mans agony made all that i had felt appear so trifling that much of my own discomfort seemed to leave me i felt that i must be strong the face before me almost unmanned me the eyes which looked into mine were so scared with terror the lipsif i may say solooked so speechless the wretched man gazed long into my face and then still holding me by the arm slowly very slowly turned his head i had gently tried to move him away from the lookingglass but he would not stir and now he was looking into it as fixedly as ever i could bear this no longer and using such force as was necessary i drew him gradually away and got him to one of the chairs at the foot of the bed come i saidafter the long silence my voice even to myself sounded strange and hollowcome you are overtired and you feel the weather dont you think you ought to be in bed suppose you lie down let me try my medical skill in mixing you a composing draught he held my hand and looked eagerly into my eyes i am better now he said speaking at last very faintly still he looked at me in that wistful way it seemed as if there were something that he wanted to do or say but had not sufficient resolution at length he got up from the chair to which i had led him and beckoning me to follow him went across the room to the dressingtable and stood again before the glass a violent shudder passed through his frame as he looked into it but apparently forcing himself to go through with what he had now begun he remained where he was and without looking away moved to me with his hand to come and stand beside him i complied look in there he said in an almost inaudible tone he was supported as before by his hands resting on the table and could only bow with his head towards the glass to intimate what he meant look in there he repeated i did as he asked me what do you see he asked next see i repeated trying to speak as cheerfully as i could and describing the reflexion of his own face as nearly as i could i see a very very pale face with sunken cheeks what he cried with an alarm in his voice which i could not understand with sunken cheeks i went on and two hollow eyes with large pupils i saw the reflexion of my friends face change and felt his hand clutch my arm even more tightly than he had done before i stopped abruptly and looked round at him he did not turn his head towards me but gazing still into the lookingglass seemed to labour for utterance what he stammered at last do yousee ittoo see what i asked quickly that face he cried in accents of horror that facewhich is not mineand whichi see instead of minealways i was struck speechless by the words in a moment this mystery was explainedbut what an explanation worse a hundred times worse than anything i had imagined what had this man lost the power of seeing his own image as it was reflected there before him and in its place was there the image of another had he changed reflexions with some other man the frightfulness of the thought struck me speechless for a timethen i saw how false an impression my silence was conveying no no no i cried as soon as i could speaka hundred times no i see you of course and only you it was your face i attempted to describe and no other he seemed not to hear me why look there he said in a low indistinct voice pointing to his own image in the glass whose face do you see there why yours of course and then after a moment i added whose do you see he answered like one in a trance hisonly hisalways his he stood still a moment and then with a loud and terrific scream repeated those words always his always his and fell down in a fit before me i knew what to do now here was a thing which at any rate i could understand i had with me my usual small stock of medicines and surgical instruments and i did what was necessary first to restore my unhappy patient and next to procure for him the rest he needed so much he was very illat deaths door for some daysand i could not leave him though there was urgent need that i should be back in london when he began to mend i sent over to england for my servantjohn maseywhom i knew i could trust acquainting him with the outlines of the case i left him in charge of my patient with orders that he should be brought over to this country as soon as he was fit to travel that awful scene was always before me i saw this devoted man day after day with the eyes of my imagination sometimes destroying in his rage the harmless lookingglass which was the immediate cause of his suffering sometimes transfixed before the horrid image that turned him to stone i recollect coming upon him once when we were stopping at a roadside inn and seeing him stand so by broad daylight his back was turned towards me and i waited and watched him for nearly half an hour as he stood there motionless and speechless and appearing not to breathe i am not sure but that this apparition seen so by daylight was more ghastly than that apparition seen in the middle of the night with the thunder rumbling among the hills back in london in his own house where he could command in some sort the objects which should surround him poor strange was better than he would have been elsewhere he seldom went out except at night but once or twice i have walked with him by daylight and have seen him terribly agitated when we have had to pass a shop in which lookingglasses were exposed for sale it is nearly a year now since my poor friend followed me down to this place to which i have retired for some months he has been daily getting weaker and weaker and a disease of the lungs has become developed in him which has brought him to his deathbed i should add bytheby that john masey has been his constant companion ever since i brought them together and i have had consequently to look after a new servant and now tell me the doctor added bringing his tale to an end did you ever hear a more miserable history or was ever man haunted in a more ghastly manner than this man i was about to reply when i heard a sound of footsteps outside and before i could speak old masey entered the room in haste and disorder i was just telling this gentleman the doctor said not at the moment observing old maseys changed manner how you deserted me to go over to your present master ah sir the man answered in a troubled voice im afraid he wont be my master long the doctor was on his legs in a moment what is he worse i think sir he is dying said the old man come with me sir you may be of use if you can keep quiet the doctor caught up his hat as he addressed me in those words and in a few minutes we had reached the compensation house a few seconds more and we were standing in a darkened room on the first floor and i saw lying on a bed before mepale emaciated and as it seemed dyingthe man whose story i had just heard he was lying with closed eyes when we came into the room and i had leisure to examine his features what a tale of misery they told they were regular and symmetrical in their arrangement and not without beautythe beauty of exceeding refinement and delicacy force there was none and perhaps it was to the want of this that the faultsperhaps the crimewhich had made the mans life so miserable were to be attributed perhaps the crime yes it was not likely that an affliction lifelong and terrible such as this he had endured would come upon him unless some misdeed had provoked the punishment what misdeed we were soon to know it sometimesi think generallyhappens that the presence of any one who stands and watches beside a sleeping man will wake him unless his slumbers are unusually heavy it was so now while we looked at him the sleeper awoke very suddenly and fixed his eyes upon us he put out his hand and took the doctors in its feeble grasp who is that he asked next pointing towards me do you wish him to go the gentleman knows something of your sufferings and is powerfully interested in your case but he will leave us if you wish it the doctor said no let him stay seating myself out of sight but where i could both see and hear what passed i waited for what should follow dr garden and john masey stood beside the bed there was a moments pause i want a lookingglass said strange without a word of preface we all started to hear him say those words i am dying said strange will you not grant me my request doctor garden whispered to old masey and the latter left the room he was not absent long having gone no further than the next house he held an ovalframed mirror in his hand when he returned a shudder passed through the body of the sick man as he saw it put it down he said faintlyanywherefor the present no one of us spoke i do not think in that moment of suspense that we could any of us have spoken if we had tried the sick man tried to raise himself a little prop me up he said i speak with difficultyi have something to say they put pillows behind him so as to raise his head and body i have presently a use for it he said indicating the mirror i want to see he stopped and seemed to change his mind he was sparing of his words i want to tell youall about it again he was silent then he seemed to make a great effort and spoke once more beginning very abruptly i loved my wife fondly i loved herher name was lucy she was english but after we were married we lived long abroadin italy she liked the country and i liked what she liked she liked to draw too and i got her a master he was an italian i will not give his name we always called him the master a treacherous insidious man this was and under cover of his profession took advantage of his opportunities and taught my wife to love himto love him i am short of breath i need not enter into details as to how i found them out but i did find them out we were away on a sketching expedition when i made my discovery my rage maddened me and there was one at hand who fomented my madness my wife had a maid who it seemed had also loved this manthe masterand had been ill treated and deserted by him she told me all she had played the part of gobetweenhad carried letters when she told me these things it was night in a solitary italian town among the mountains he is in his room now she said writing to her a frenzy took possession of me as i listened to those words i am naturally vindictiveremember thatand now my longing for revenge was like a thirst travelling in those lonely regions i was armed and when the woman said he is writing to your wife i laid hold of my pistols as by an instinct it has been some comfort to me since that i took them both perhaps at that moment i may have meant fairly by himmeant that we should fight i dont know what i meant quite the womans words he is in his own room now writing to her rung in my ears the sick man stopped to take breath it seemed an hour though it was probably not more than two minutes before he spoke again i managed to get into his room unobserved indeed he was altogether absorbed in what he was doing he was sitting at the only table in the room writing at a travellingdesk by the light of a single candle it was a rude dressingtable andand before himexactly before himthere wasthere was a lookingglass i stole up behind him as he sat and wrote by the light of the candle i looked over his shoulder at the letter and i read dearest lucy my love my darling as i read the words i pulled the trigger of the pistol i held in my right hand and killed himkilled himbut before he died he looked up oncenot at me but at my image before him in the glass and his facesuch a facehas been thereever since and minemy faceis gone he fell back exhausted and we all pressed forward thinking that he must be dead he lay so still but he had not yet passed away he revived under the influence of stimulants he tried to speak and muttered indistinctly from time to time words of which we could sometimes make no sense we understood however that he had been tried by an italian tribunal and had been found guilty but with such extenuating circumstances that his sentence was commuted to imprisonment during we thought we made out two years but we could not understand what he said about his wife though we gathered that she was still alive from something he whispered to the doctor of there being provision made for her in his will he lay in a doze for something more than an hour after he had told his tale and then he woke up quite suddenly as he had done when we had first entered the room he looked round uneasily in all directions until his eye fell on the lookingglass i want it he said hastily but i noticed that he did not shudder now as it was brought near when old masey approached holding it in his hand and crying like a child dr garden came forward and stood between him and his master taking the hand of poor strange in his is this wise he asked is it good do you think to revive this misery of your life now when it is so near its close the chastisement of your crime he added solemnly has been a terrible one let us hope in gods mercy that your punishment is over the dying man raised himself with a last great effort and looked up at the doctor with such an expression on his face as none of us had seen on any face before i do hope so he said faintly but you must let me have my way in thisfor if now when i look i see arightonce morei shall then hope yet more stronglyfor i shall take it as a sign the doctor stood aside without another word when he heard the dying man speak thus and the old servant drew near and stooping over softly held the lookingglass before his master presently afterwards we who stood around looking breathlessly at him saw such a rapture upon his face as left no doubt upon our minds that the face which had haunted him so long had in his last hour disappeared no branch line the travelling postoffice many years ago and before this line was so much as projected i was engaged as a clerk in a travelling postoffice running along the line of railway from london to a town in the midland counties which we will call fazeley my duties were to accompany the mailtrain which left fazeley at pm and arrived in london about midnight and to return by the day mail leaving london at the following morning after which i had an unbroken night at fazeley while another clerk discharged the same round of work and in this way each alternative evening i was on duty in the railway postoffice van at first i suffered a little from a hurry and tremor of nerve in pursuing my occupation while the train was crashing along under bridges and through tunnels at a speed which was then thought marvellous and perilous but it was not long before my hands and eyes became accustomed to the motion of the carriage and i could go through my business with the same despatch and ease as in the postoffice of the country town where i had learned it and from which i had been promoted by the influence of the surveyor of the district mr huntingdon in fact the work soon fell into a monotonous routine which night after night was pursued in an unbroken course by myself and the junior clerk who was my only assistant the railway postoffice work not having then attained the importance and magnitude it now possesses our route lay through an agricultural district containing many small towns which made up two or three bags only one for london another perhaps for the county town a third for the railway postoffice to be opened by us and the enclosures to be distributed according to their various addresses the clerks in many of these small offices were women as is very generally the case still being the daughters and female relatives of the nominal postmaster who transact most of the business of the office and whose names are most frequently signed upon the bills accompanying the bags i was a young man and somewhat more curious in feminine handwriting than i am now there was one family in particular whom i had never seen but with whose signatures i was perfectly familiarclear delicate and educated very unlike the miserable scrawl upon other letterbills one new yearseve in a moment of sentiment i tied a slip of paper among a bundle of letters for their office upon which i had written a happy new year to you all the next evening brought me a return of my good wishes signed as i guessed by three sisters of the name of clifton from that day every now and then a sentence or two as brief as the one above passed between us and the feeling of acquaintance and friendship grew upon me though i had never yet had an opportunity of seeing my fair unknown friends it was towards the close of the following october that it came under my notice that the then premier of the ministry was paying an autumn visit to a nobleman whose country seat was situated near a small village on our line of rail the premiers despatchbox containing of course all the despatches which it was necessary to send down to him passed between him and the secretary of state and was as usual entrusted to the care of the postoffice the continent was just then in a more than ordinarily critical state we were thought to be upon the verge of an european war and there were murmurs floating about at the dispersion of the ministry up and down the country these circumstances made the charge of the despatchbox the more interesting to me it was very similar in size and shape to the oldfashioned workboxes used by ladies before boxes of polished and ornamental wood came into vogue and like them it was covered with red morocco leather and it fastened with a lock and key the first time it came into my hands i took such special notice of it as might be expected upon one corner of the lid i detected a peculiar device scratched slightly upon it most probably with the sharp point of a steel pen in such a moment of preoccupation of mind as causes most of us to draw odd lines and caricatured faces upon any piece of paper which may lie under our hand it was the old revolutionary device of a heart with a dagger piercing it and i wondered whether it could be the premier or one of his secretaries who had traced it upon the morocco this box had been travelling up and down for about ten days and as the village did not make up a bag for london there being very few letters excepting those from the great house the letterbag from the house and the despatchbox were handed direct into our travelling postoffice but in compliment to the presence of the premier in the neighbourhood the train instead of slackening speed only stopped altogether in order that the premiers trusty and confidential messenger might deliver the important box into my own hands that its perfect safety might be ensured i had an undefined suspicion that some person was also employed to accompany the train up to london for three or four times i had met with a foreignlooking gentleman at eustonsquare standing at the door of the carriage nearest the postoffice van and eyeing the heavy bags as they were transferred from my care to the custody of the officials from the general postoffice but though i felt amused and somewhat nettled at this needless precaution i took no further notice of the man except to observe that he had the swarthy aspect of a foreigner and that he kept his face well away from the light of the lamps except for these things and after the first time or two the premiers despatchbox interested me no more than any other part of my charge my work had been doubly monotonous for some time past and i began to think it time to get up some little entertainment with my unknown friends the cliftons i was just thinking of it as the train stopped at the station about a mile from the town where they lived and their postman a gruff matteroffact fellowyou could see it in every line of his faceput in the letterbags and with them a letter addressed to me it was in an official envelope on her majestys service and the seal was an official seal on the folded paper inside it folded officially also i read the following order mr wilcox is requested to permit the bearer the daughter of the postmaster at eaton to see the working of the railway postoffice during the upjourney the writing i knew well as being that of one of the surveyors clerks and the signature was mr huntingdons the bearer of the order presented herself at the door the snorting of the engine gave notice of the instant departure of the train i held out my hand the young lady sprang lightly and deftly into the van and we were off again on our midnight journey she was a small slight creature one of those slender little girls one never thinks of as being a woman dressed neatly and plainly in a dark dress with a veil hanging a little over her face and tied under her chin the most noticeable thing about her appearance being a great mass of light hair almost yellow which had got loose in some way and fell down her neck in thick wavy tresses she had a free pleasant way about her not in the least bold or forward which in a minute or two made her presence seem the most natural thing in the world as she stood beside me before the row of boxes into which i was sorting my letters she asked questions and i answered as if it were quite an everyday occurrence for us to be travelling up together in the night mail to eustonsquare station i blamed myself for an idiot that i had not sooner made an opportunity for visiting my unknown friends at eaton then i said putting down the letterbill from their own office before her may i ask which of the signatures i know so well is yours is it a clifton or m clifton or s clifton she hesitated a little and blushed and lifted up her frank childlike eyes to mine i am a clifton she answered and your name i said anne then as if anxious to give some explanation to me of her present position she added i was going up to london on a visit and i thought it would be so nice to travel in the postoffice to see how the work was done and mr huntingdon came to survey our office and he said he would send me an order i felt somewhat surprised for a stricter martinet than mr huntingdon did not breathe but i glanced down at the small innocent face at my side and cordially approved of his departure from ordinary rules did you know you would travel with me i asked in a lower voice for tom morville my junior was at my other elbow i knew i should travel with mr wilcox she answered with a smile that made all my nerves tingle you have not written me a word for ages said i reproachfully you had better not talk or youll be making mistakes she replied in an arch tone it was quite true for a sudden confusion coming over me i was sorting the letters at random we were just then approaching the small station where the letterbag from the great house was taken up the engine was slackening speed miss clifton manifested some natural and becoming diffidence it would look so odd she said to any one on the platform to see a girl in the postoffice van and they couldnt know i was a postmasters daughter and had an order from mr huntingdon is there no dark corner to shelter me i must explain to you in a word or two the construction of the van which was much less efficiently fitted up than the travelling postoffices of the present day it was a reversible van with a door at each righthand corner at each door the letterboxes were so arranged as to form a kind of screen about two feet in width which prevented people from seeing all over the carriage at once thus the door at the far end of the van the one not in use at the time was thrown into deep shadow and the screen before it turned it into a small niche where a slight little person like miss clifton was very well concealed from curious eyes before the train came within the light from the lamps on the platform she ensconced herself in this shelter no one but i could see her laughing face as she stood there leaning cautiously forward with her finger pressed upon her rosy lips peeping at the messenger who delivered into my own hands the premiers despatchbox while tom morville received the letterbag of the great house see i said when we were again in motion and she had emerged from her concealment this is the premiers despatchbox going back to the secretary of state there are some state secrets for you and ladies are fond of secrets oh i know nothing about politics she answered indifferently and we have had that box through our office a time or two did you ever notice this mark upon it i askeda heart with a dagger through it and bending down my face to hers i added a certain spooney remark which i do not care to repeat miss clifton tossed her little head and pouted her lips but she took the box out of my hands and carried it to the lamp nearest the further end of the van after which she put it down upon the counter close beside the screen and i thought no more about it the midnight ride was entertaining in the extreme for the girl was full of young life and sauciness and merry humour i can safely aver that i have never been to an evenings socalled entertainment which to me was half so enjoyable it added also to the zest and keen edge of the enjoyment to see her hasten to hide herself whenever i told her we were going to stop to take up the mails we had passed watford the last station at which we stopped before i became alive to the recollection that our work was terribly behindhand miss clifton also became grave and sat at the end of the counter very quiet and subdued as if her frolic were over and it was possible she might find something to repent of in it i had told her we should stop no more until we reached eustonsquare station but to my surprise i felt our speed decreasing and our train coming to a standstill i looked out and called to the guard in the van behind who told me he supposed there was something on the line before us and that we should go on in a minute or two i turned my head and gave this information to my fellowclerk and miss clifton do you know where we are she asked in a frightened tone at camdentown i replied she sprang hastily from her seat and came towards me i am close to my friends house here she said so it is a lucky thing for me it is not five minutes walk from the station i will say goodbye to you now mr wilcox and i thank you a thousand times for your kindness she seemed flurried and she held out both her little hands to me in an appealing kind of way as if she were afraid of my detaining her against her will i took them both into mine pressing them with rather more ardour than was quite necessary i do not like you to go alone at this hour i said but there is no help for it it has been a delightful time to me will you allow me to call upon you tomorrow morning early for i leave london at or on wednesday when i shall be in town again o she answered hanging her head i dont know ill write and tell mamma how kind you have been and andbut i must go mr wilcox i dont like your going alone i repeated o i know the way perfectly she said in the same flurried manner perfectly thank you and it is close at hand goodbye she jumped lightly out of the carriage and the train started on again at the same instant we were busy enough as you may suppose in five minutes more we should be in eustonsquare and there was nearly fifteen minutes work still to be done spite of the enjoyment he had afforded me i mentally anathematised mr huntingdon and his departure from ordinary rules and thrusting miss clifton forcibly out of my thoughts i set to work with a will gathered up the registered letters for london tied them into a bundle with the paper bill and then turned to the corner of the counter for the despatchbox you have guessed already my cursed misfortune the premiers despatchbox was not there for the first minute or so i was in nowise alarmed and merely looked round upon the floor under the bags into the boxes into any place into which it could have fallen or been deposited we reached eustonsquare while i was still searching and losing more and more of my composure every instant tom morville joined me in my quest and felt every bag which had been made up and sealed the box was no small article which could go into little compass it was certainly twelve inches long and more than that in girth but it turned up nowhere i never felt nearer fainting than at that moment could miss clifton have carried it off suggested tom morville no i said indignantly but thoughtfully she couldnt have carried off such a bulky thing as that without our seeing it it would not go into one of our pockets tom and she wore a tightfitting jacket that would not conceal anything no she cant have it assented tom then it must be somewhere about we searched again and again turning over everything in the van but without success the premiers despatchbox was gone and all we could do at first was to stand and stare at one another our trance of blank dismay was of short duration for the van was assailed by the postmen from st martinslegrand who were waiting for our charge in a stupor of bewilderment we completed our work and delivered up the mails then once more we confronted one another with pale faces frightened out of our seven senses all the scrapes we had ever been in and we had had our usual share of errors and blunders faded into utter insignificance compared with this my eye fell upon mr huntingdons order lying among some scraps of waste paper on the floor and i picked it up and put it carefully with its official envelope into my pocket we cant stay here said tom the porters were looking in inquisitively we were seldom so long in quitting oar empty van no i replied a sudden gleam of sense darting across the blank bewilderment of my brain no we must go to headquarters at once and make a clean breast of it this is no private business tom we made one more ineffectual search and then we hailed a cab and drove as hard as we could to the general postoffice the secretary of the postoffice was not there of course but we obtained the address of his residence in one of the suburbs four or five miles from the city and we told no one of our misfortune my idea being that the fewer who were made acquainted with the loss the better my judgment was in the right there we had to knock up the household of the secretarya formidable personage with whom i had never been brought into contact beforeand in a short time we were holding a strictly private and confidential interview with him by the glimmer of a solitary candle just serving to light up his severe face which changed its expression several times as i narrated the calamity it was too stupendous for rebuke and i fancied his eyes softened with something like commiseration as he gazed upon us after a short interval of deliberation he announced his intention of accompanying us to the residence of the secretary of state and in a few minutes we were driving back again to the opposite extremity of london it was not far off the hour for the morning delivery of letters when we reached our destination but the atmosphere was yellow with fog and we could see nothing as we passed along in almost utter silence for neither of us ventured to speak and the secretary only made a brief remark now and then we drove up to some dwelling enveloped in fog and we were left in the cab for nearly half an hour while our secretary went in at the end of that time we were summoned to an apartment where there was seated at a large desk a small spare man with a great head and eyes deeply sunk under the brows there was no form of introduction of course and we could only guess who he might be but we were requested to repeat our statement and a few shrewd questions were put to us by the stranger we were eager to put him in possession of everything we knew but that was little beyond the fact that the despatchbox was lost that young person must have taken it he said she could not sir i answered positively but deferentially she wore the tightestfitting pelisse i ever saw and she gave me both her hands when she said goodbye she could not possibly have it concealed about her it would not go into my pocket how did she come to travel up with you in the van sir he asked severely i gave him for answer the order signed by mr huntingdon he and our secretary scanned it closely it is huntingdons signature without doubt said the latter i could swear to it anywhere this is an extraordinary circumstance it was an extraordinary circumstance the two retired into an adjoining room where they stayed for another halfhour and when they returned to us their faces still bore an aspect of grave perplexity mr wilcox and mr morville said our secretary it is expedient that this affair should be kept inviolably secret you must even be careful not to hint that you hold any secret you did well not to announce your loss at the postoffice and i shall cause it to be understood that you had instructions to take the despatchbox direct to its destination your business now is to find the young woman and return with her not later than six oclock this afternoon to my office at the general postoffice what other steps we think it requisite to take you need know nothing about the less you know the better for yourselves another gleam of commiseration in his official eye made our hearts sink within us we departed promptly and with that instinct of wisdom which at times dictates infallibly what course we should pursue we decided our line of action tom morville was to go down to camdentown and inquire at every house for miss clifton while ithere would be just time for itwas to run down to eaton by train and obtain her exact address from her parents we agreed to meet at the general postoffice at halfpast five if i could possibly reach it by that time but in any case tom was to report himself to the secretary and account for my absence when i arrived at the station at eaton i found that i had only fortyfive minutes before the up train went by the town was nearly a mile away but i made all the haste i could to reach it i was not surprised to find the postoffice in connexion with a booksellers shop and i saw a pleasant elderly lady seated behind the counter while a tall darkhaired girl was sitting at some work a little out of sight i introduced myself at once i am frank wilcox of the railway postoffice and i have just run down to eaton to obtain some information from you certainly we know you well by name was the reply given in a cordial manner which was particularly pleasant to me will you be so good as give me the address of miss anne clifton in camdentown i said miss anne clifton ejaculated the lady yes your daughter i presume who went up to london last night i have no daughter anne she said i am anne clifton and my daughters are named mary and susan this is my daughter mary the tall darkhaired girl had left her seat and now stood beside her mother certainly she was very unlike the small goldenhaired coquette who had travelled up to london with me as anne clifton madam i said scarcely able to speak is your other daughter a slender little creature exactly the reverse of this young lady no she answered laughing susan is both taller and darker than mary call susan my dear in a few seconds miss susan made her appearance and i had the three before mea clifton s clifton and m clifton there was no other girl in the family and when i described the young lady who had travelled under their name they could not think of any one in the townit was a small onewho answered my description or who had gone on a visit to london i had no time to spare and i hurried back to the station just catching the train as it left the platform at the appointed hour i met morville at the general postoffice and threading the long passages of the secretarys offices we at length found ourselves anxiously waiting in an anteroom until we were called into his presence morville had discovered nothing except that the porters and policemen at camdentown station had seen a young lady pass out last night attended by a swarthy man who looked like a foreigner and carried a small black portmanteau i scarcely know how long we waited it might have been years for i was conscious of an everincreasing difficulty in commanding my thoughts or fixing them upon the subject which had engrossed them all day i had not tasted food for twentyfour hours nor closed my eyes for thirtysix while during the whole of the time my nervous system had been on full strain presently the summons came and i was ushered first into the inner apartment there sat five gentlemen round a table which was strewed with a number of documents there were the secretary of state whom we had seen in the morning our secretary and mr huntingdon the fourth was a finelooking man whom i afterwards knew to be the premier the fifth i recognised as our great chief the postmastergeneral it was an august assemblage to me and i bowed low but my head was dizzy and my throat parched mr wilcox said our secretary you will tell these gentlemen again the circumstances of the loss you reported to me this morning i laid my hand upon the back of a chair to steady myself and went through the narration for the third time passing over sundry remarks made by myself to the young lady that done i added the account of my expedition to eaton and the certainty at which i had arrived that my fellowtraveller was not the person she represented herself to be after which i inquired with indescribable anxiety if mr huntingdons order were a forgery i cannot tell mr wilcox said that gentleman taking the order into his hands and regarding it with an air of extreme perplexity i could have sworn it was mine had it been attached to any other document i think forbess handwriting is not so well imitated but it is the very ink i use and mine is a peculiar signature it was a very peculiar and oldfashioned signature with a flourish underneath it not unlike a whiphandle with the lash caught round it in the middle but that did not make it the more difficult to forge as i humbly suggested mr huntingdon wrote his name upon a paper and two or three of the gentlemen tried to imitate the flourish but vainly they gave it up with a smile upon their grave faces you have been careful not to let a hint of this matter drop from you mr wilcox said the postmastergeneral not a syllable my lord i answered it is imperatively necessary that the secret should be kept you would be removed from the temptation of telling it if you had an appointment in some office abroad the packetagency at alexandria is vacant and i will have you appointed to it at once it would be a good advance from my present situation and would doubtless prove a steppingstone to other and better appointments but i had a mother living at fazeley bedridden and paralytic who had no pleasure in existence except having me to dwell under the same roof with her my head was growing more and more dizzy and a strange vagueness was creeping over me gentlemen i muttered i have a bedridden mother whom i cannot leave i was not to blame gentlemen i fancied there was a stir and movement at the table but my eyes were dim and in another second i had lost consciousness when i came to myself in two or three minutes i found that mr huntingdon was kneeling on the floor beside me supporting my head while our secretary held a glass of wine to my lips i rallied as quickly as possible and staggered to my feet but the two gentlemen placed me in the chair against which i had been leaning and insisted upon my finishing the wine before i tried to speak i have not tasted food all day i said faintly then my good fellow you shall go home immediately said the postmastergeneral but be on your guard not a word of this must escape you are you a married man no my lord i answered so much the better he added smiling you can keep a secret from your mother i dare say we rely upon your honour the secretary then rang a bell and i was committed to the charge of the messenger who answered it and in a few minutes i was being conveyed in a cab to my london lodgings a week afterwards tom morville was sent out to a postoffice in canada where he settled down married and is still living perfectly satisfied with his position as he occasionally informs me by letter for myself i remained as i desired in my old post as travellingclerk until the death of my mother which occurred some ten or twelve months afterwards i was then promoted to an appointment as a clerk in charge upon the first vacancy the business of the clerks in charge is to take possession of any postoffice in the kingdom upon the death or resignation of the postmaster or when circumstances of suspicion cause his suspension from office my new duties carried me three or four times into mr huntingdons district though that gentleman and i never exchanged a word with regard to the mysterious loss in which we had both had an innocent share he distinguished me with peculiar favour and more than once invited me to visit him at his own house he lived alone having but one daughter who had married somewhat against his will one of his clerks the mr forbes whose handwriting had been so successfully imitated in the official order presented to me by the selfstyled miss anne clifton by the way i may here mention though it has nothing to do with my story that my acquaintance with the cliftons had ripened into an intimacy which resulted in my engagement and marriage to mary it would be beside my purpose to specify the precise number of years which elapsed before i was once again summoned to the secretarys private apartment where i found him closeted with mr huntingdon mr huntingdon shook hands with unofficial cordiality and then the secretary proceeded to state the business on hand mr wilcox you remember our offer to place you in office in alexandria he said certainly sir i answered it has been a troublesome office he continued almost pettishly we sent out mr forbes only six months ago on account of his health which required a warmer climate and now his medical man reports that his life is not worth three weeks purchase upon mr huntingdons face there rested an expression of profound anxiety and as the secretary paused he addressed himself to me mr wilcox he said i have been soliciting as a personal favour that you should be sent out to take charge of the packetagency in order that my daughter may have some one at hand to befriend her and manage her business affairs for her you are not personally acquainted with her but i know i can trust her with you you may mr huntingdon i said warmly i will do anything i can to aid mrs forbes when do you wish me to start how soon can you be ready was the rejoinder tomorrow morning i was not married then and i anticipated no delay in setting off nor was there any i travelled with the overland mail through france to marseilles embarked in a vessel for alexandria and in a few days from the time i first heard of my destination set foot in the office there all the postal arrangements had fallen into considerable irregularity and confusion for as i was informed immediately on my arrival mr forbes had been in a dying condition for the last week and of course the absence of a master had borne the usual results i took formal possession of the office and then conducted by one of the clerks i proceeded to the dwelling of the unfortunate postmaster and his no less unfortunate wife it would be out of place in this narrative to indulge in any travellers tales about the strange place where i was so unexpectedly located suffice it to say that the darkened sultry room into which i was shown on inquiring for mrs forbes was bare of furniture and destitute of all those little tokens of refinement and taste which make our english parlours so pleasant to the eye there was however a piano in one of the dark corners of the room open and with a sheet of music on it while i waited for mrs forbess appearance i strolled idly up to the piano to see what music it might be the next moment my eye fell upon an antique red morocco workbox standing on the top of the pianoa workbox evidently for the lid was not closely shut and a few threads of silk and cotton were hanging out of it in a kind of dreamfor it was difficult to believe that the occurrence was a facti carried the box to the darkened window and there plain in my sight was the device scratched upon the leather the revolutionary symbol of a heart with a dagger through it i had found the premiers despatchbox in the parlour of the packetagent of alexandria i stood for some minutes with that dreamlike feeling upon me gazing at the box in the dim obscure light it could not be real my fancy must be playing a trick upon me but the sound of a light stepfor light as it was i heard it distinctly as it approached the roombroke my trance and i hastened to replace the box on the piano and to stoop down as if examining the music before the door opened i had not sent in my name to mrs forbes for i did not suppose that she was acquainted with it nor could she see me distinctly as i stood in the gloom but i could see her she had the slight slender figure the childlike face and the fair hair of miss anne clifton she came quickly across the room holding out both her hands in a childish appealing manner o she wailed in a tone that went straight to my heart he is dead he has just died it was no time then to speak about the red morocco workbox this little childish creature who did not look a day older than when i had last seen her in my travelling postoffice was a widow in a strange land far away from any friend save myself i had brought her a letter from her father the first duties that devolved upon me were those of her husbands interment which had to take place immediately three or four weeks elapsed before i could with any humanity enter upon the investigation of her mysterious complicity in the daring theft practised on the government and the postoffice i did not see the despatchbox again in the midst of her new and vehement grief mrs forbes had the precaution to remove it before i was ushered again into the room where i had discovered it i was at some trouble to hit upon any plan by which to gain a second sight of it but i was resolved that mrs forbes should not leave alexandria without giving me a full explanation we were waiting for remittances and instructions from england and in the meantime the violence of her grief abated and she recovered a good share of her old buoyancy and loveliness which had so delighted me on my first acquaintance with her as her demands upon my sympathy weakened my curiosity grew stronger and at last mastered me i carried with me a netted purse which required mending and i asked her to catch up the broken meshes while i waited for it i will tell your maid to bring your workbox i said going to the door and calling the servant your mistress has a red morocco workbox i said to her as she answered my summons yes sir she replied where is it in her bedroom she said mrs forbes wishes it brought here i turned back into the room mrs forbes had gone deadly pale but her eyes looked sullen and her teeth were clenched under her lips with an expression of stubbornness the maid brought the workbox i walked with it in my hands up to the sofa where she was seated you remember this mark i asked i think neither of us can ever forget it she did not answer by word but there was a very intelligent gleam in her blue eyes now i continued softly i promised your father to befriend you and i am not a man to forget a promise but you must tell me the whole simple truth i was compelled to reason with her and to urge her for some time i confess i went so far as to remind her that there was an english consul at alexandria to whom i could resort at last she opened her stubborn lips and the whole story came out mingled with sobs and showers of tears she had been in love with alfred she said and they were too poor to marry and papa would not hear of such a thing she was always in want of money she was kept so short and they promised to give her such a great suma vast sumfive hundred pounds but who bribed you i inquired a foreign gentleman whom she had met in london called monsieur bonnard it was a french name but she was not sure that he was a frenchman he talked to her about her father being a surveyor in the postoffice and asked her a great number of questions a few weeks after she met him in their own town by accident she and mr forbes and alfred had a long private talk with him and they came to her and told her she could help them very much they asked her if she could be brave enough to carry off a little red box out of the travelling postoffice containing nothing but papers after a while she consented when she had confessed so much under compulsion mrs forbes seemed to take a pleasure in the narrative and went on fluently we required papas signature to the order and we did not know how to get it luckily he had a fit of the gout and was very peevish and i had to read over a lot of official papers to him and then he signed them one of the papers i read twice and slipped the order into its place after the second reading i thought i should have died with fright but just then he was in great pain and glad to get his work over i made an excuse that i was going to visit my aunt at beckby but instead of going there direct we contrived to be at the station at eaton a minute or two before the mail train came up i kept outside the station door till we heard the whistle and just then the postman came running down the road and i followed him straight through the bookingoffice and asked him to give you the order which i put into his hand he scarcely saw me i just caught a glimpse of monsieur bonnards face through the window of the compartment next the van when alfred had gone they had promised me that the train should stop at camdentown if i could only keep your attention engaged until then you know how i succeeded but how did you dispose of the box i asked you could not have concealed it about you that i am sure of ah she said nothing was easier monsieur bonnard had described the van to me and you remember i put the box down at the end of the counter close to the corner where i hid myself at every station there was a door with a window in it and i asked if i might have the window open as the van was too warm for me i believe monsieur bonnard could have taken it from me by only leaning through his window but he preferred stepping out and taking it from my hand just as the train was leaving watfordon the far side of the carriages you understand it was the last station and the train came to a stand at camdentown after all the box was not out of your sight more than twenty minutes before you missed it monsieur bonnard and i hurried out of the station and alfred followed us the box was forced openthe lock has never been mended for it was a peculiar oneand monsieur bonnard took possession of the papers he left the box with me after putting inside it a roll of notes alfred and i were married next morning and i went back to my aunts but we did not tell papa of our marriage for three or four months that is the story of my red morocco workbox she smiled with the provoking mirthfulness of a mischievous child there was one point still on which my curiosity was unsatisfied did you know what the despatches were about i asked o no she answered i never understood politics in the least i knew nothing about them monsieur did not say a word he did not even look at the papers while we were by i would never never have taken a registered letter or anything with money in it you know but all those papers could be written again quite easily you must not think me a thief mr wilcox there was nothing worth money among the papers they were worth five hundred pounds to you i said did you ever see bonnard again never again she replied he said he was going to return to his native country i dont think bonnard was his real name most likely not i thought but i said no more to mrs forbes once again i was involved in a great perplexity about this affair it was clearly my duty to report the discovery at headquarters but i shrank from doing so one of the chief culprits was already gone to another judgment than that of man several years had obliterated all traces of monsieur bonnard and the only victim of justice would be this poor little dupe of the two greater criminals at last i came to the conclusion to send the whole of the particulars to mr huntingdon himself and i wrote them to him without remark or comment the answer that came to mrs forbes and me in alexandria was the announcement of mr huntingdons sudden death of some disease of the heart on the day which i calculated would put him in possession of my communication mrs forbes was again overwhelmed with apparently heartrending sorrow and remorse the income left to her was something less than one hundred pounds a year the secretary of the postoffice who had been a personal friend of the deceased gentleman was his sole executor and i received a letter from him containing one for mrs forbes which recommended her in terms not to be misunderstood to fix upon some residence abroad and not to return to england she fancied she would like the seclusion and quiet of a convent and i made arrangements for her to enter one in malta where she would still be under british protection i left alexandria myself on the arrival of another packetagent and on my return to london i had a private interview with the secretary i found that there was no need to inform him of the circumstances i have related to you as he had taken possession of all mr huntingdons papers in consideration of his ancient friendship and of the escape of those who most merited punishment he had come to the conclusion that it was quite as well to let bygones be bygones at the conclusion of the interview i delivered a message which mrs forbes had emphatically entrusted to me mrs forbes wished me to impress upon your mind i said that neither she nor mr forbes would have been guilty of this misdemeanour if they had not been very much in love with one another and very much in want of money ah replied the secretary with a smile if cleopatras nose had been shorter the fate of the world would have been different no branch line the engineer his name sir was matthew price mine is benjamin hardy we were born within a few days of each other bred up in the same village taught at the same school i cannot remember the time when we were not close friends even as boys we never knew what it was to quarrel we had not a thought we had not a possession that was not in common we would have stood by each other fearlessly to the death it was such a friendship as one reads about sometimes in books fast and firm as the great tors upon our native moorlands true as the sun in the heavens the name of our village was chadleigh lifted high above the pasture flats which stretched away at our feet like a measureless green lake and melted into mist on the furthest horizon it nestled a tiny stonebuilt hamlet in a sheltered hollow about midway between the plain and the plateau above us rising ridge beyond ridge slope beyond slope spread the mountainous moorcountry bare and bleak for the most part with here and there a patch of cultivated field or hardy plantation and crowned highest of all with masses of huge grey crag abrupt isolated hoary and older than the deluge these were the torsdruids tor kings tor castle tor and the like sacred places as i have heard in the ancient time where crownings burnings human sacrifices and all kinds of bloody heathen rites were performed bones too had been found there and arrowheads and ornaments of gold and glass i had a vague awe of the tors in those boyish days and would not have gone near them after dark for the heaviest bribe i have said that we were born in the same village he was the son of a small farmer named william price and the eldest of a family of seven i was the only child of ephraim hardy the chadleigh blacksmitha wellknown man in those parts whose memory is not forgotten to this day just so far as a farmer is supposed to be a bigger man than a blacksmith mats father might be said to have a better standing than mine but william price with his small holding and his seven boys was in fact as poor as many a daylabourer whilst the blacksmith welltodo bustling popular and openhanded was a person of some importance in the place all this however had nothing to do with mat and myself it never occurred to either of us that his jacket was out at elbows or that our mutual funds came altogether from my pocket it was enough for us that we sat on the same schoolbench conned our tasks from the same primer fought each others battles screened each others faults fished nutted played truant robbed orchards and birds nests together and spent every halfhour authorised or stolen in each others society it was a happy time but it could not go on for ever my father being prosperous resolved to put me forward in the world i must know more and do better than himself the forge was not good enough the little world of chadleigh not wide enough for me thus it happened that i was still swinging the satchel when mat was whistling at the plough and that at last when my future course was shaped out we were separated as it then seemed to us for life for blacksmiths son as i was furnace and forge in some form or other pleased me best and i chose to be a working engineer so my father byandby apprenticed me to a birmingham ironmaster and having bidden farewell to mat and chadleigh and the grey old tors in the shadow of which i had spent all the days of my life i turned my face northward and went over into the black country i am not going to dwell on this part of my story how i worked out the term of my apprenticeship how when i had served my full time and become a skilled workman i took mat from the plough and brought him over to the black country sharing with him lodging wages experienceall in short that i had to give how he naturally quick to learn and brimful of quiet energy worked his way up a step at a time and came byandby to be a first hand in his own department how during all these years of change and trial and effort the old boyish affection never wavered or weakened but went on growing with our growth and strengthening with our strengthare facts which i need do no more than outline in this place about this timeit will be remembered that i speak of the days when mat and i were on the bright side of thirtyit happened that our firm contracted to supply six firstclass locomotives to run on the new line then in process of construction between turin and genoa it was the first italian order we had taken we had had dealings with france holland belgium germany but never with italy the connexion therefore was new and valuableall the more valuable because our transalpine neighbours had but lately begun to lay down the iron roads and would be safe to need more of our good english work as they went on so the birmingham firm set themselves to the contract with a will lengthened our working hours increased our wages took on fresh hands and determined if energy and promptitude could do it to place themselves at the head of the italian labourmarket and stay there they deserved and achieved success the six locomotives were not only turned out to time but were shipped despatched and delivered with a promptitude that fairly amazed our piedmontese consignee i was not a little proud you may be sure when i found myself appointed to superintend the transport of the engines being allowed a couple of assistants i contrived that mat should be one of them and thus we enjoyed together the first great holiday of our lives it was a wonderful change for two birmingham operatives fresh from the black country the fairy city with its crescent background of alps the port crowded with strange shipping the marvellous blue sky and bluer sea the painted houses on the quays the quaint cathedral faced with black and white marble the street of jewellers like an arabian nights bazaar the street of palaces with its moorish courtyards its fountains and orangetrees the women veiled like brides the galleyslaves chained two and two the processions of priests and friars the everlasting clangour of bells the babble of a strange tongue the singular lightness and brightness of the climatemade altogether such a combination of wonders that we wandered about the first day in a kind of bewildered dream like children at a fair before that week was ended being tempted by the beauty of the place and the liberality of the pay we had agreed to take service with the turin and genoa railway company and to turn our backs upon birmingham for ever then began a new lifea life so active and healthy so steeped in fresh air and sunshine that we sometimes marvelled how we could have endured the gloom of the black country we were constantly up and down the line now at genoa now at turin taking trial trips with the locomotives and placing our old experiences at the service of our new employers in the meanwhile we made genoa our headquarters and hired a couple of rooms over a small shop in a bystreet sloping down to the quays such a busy little streetso steep and winding that no vehicles could pass through it and so narrow that the sky looked like a mere strip of deepblue ribbon overhead every house in it however was a shop where the goods encroached on the footway or were piled about the door or hung like tapestry from the balconies and all day long from dawn to dusk an incessant stream of passersby poured up and down between the port and the upper quarter of the city our landlady was the widow of a silverworker and lived by the sale of filigree ornaments cheap jewellery combs fans and toys in ivory and jet she had an only daughter named gianetta who served in the shop and was simply the most beautiful woman i ever beheld looking back across this weary chasm of years and bringing her image before me as i can and do with all the vividness of life i am unable even now to detect a flaw in her beauty i do not attempt to describe her i do not believe there is a poet living who could find the words to do it but i once saw a picture that was somewhat like her not half so lovely but still like her and for aught i know that picture is still hanging where i last looked at itupon the walls of the louvre it represented a woman with brown eyes and golden hair looking over her shoulder into a circular mirror held by a bearded man in the background in this man as i then understood the artist had painted his own portrait in her the portrait of the woman he loved no picture that i ever saw was half so beautiful and yet it was not worthy to be named in the same breath with gianetta coneglia you may be certain the widows shop did not want for customers all genoa knew how fair a face was to be seen behind that dingy little counter and gianetta flirt as she was had more lovers than she cared to remember even by name gentle and simple rich and poor from the redcapped sailor buying his earrings or his amulet to the nobleman carelessly purchasing half the filigrees in the window she treated them all alikeencouraged them laughed at them led them on and turned them off at her pleasure she had no more heart than a marble statue as mat and i discovered byandby to our bitter cost i cannot tell to this day how it came about or what first led me to suspect how things were going with us both but long before the waning of that autumn a coldness had sprung up between my friend and myself it was nothing that could have been put into words it was nothing that either of us could have explained or justified to save his life we lodged together ate together worked together exactly as before we even took our long evenings walk together when the days labour was ended and except perhaps that we were more silent than of old no mere lookeron could have detected a shadow of change yet there it was silent and subtle widening the gulf between us every day it was not his fault he was too true and gentlehearted to have willingly brought about such a state of things between us neither do i believefiery as my nature isthat it was mine it was all hershers from first to lastthe sin and the shame and the sorrow if she had shown a fair and open preference for either of us no real harm could have come of it i would have put any constraint upon myself and heaven knows have borne any suffering to see mat really happy i know that he would have done the same and more if he could for me but gianetta cared not one sou for either she never meant to choose between us it gratified her vanity to divide us it amused her to play with us it would pass my power to tell how by a thousand imperceptible shades of coquetryby the lingering of a glance the substitution of a word the flitting of a smileshe contrived to turn our heads and torture our hearts and lead us on to love her she deceived us both she buoyed us both up with hope she maddened us with jealousy she crushed us with despair for my part when i seemed to wake to a sudden sense of the ruin that was about our path and i saw how the truest friendship that ever bound two lives together was drifting on to wreck and ruin i asked myself whether any woman in the world was worth what mat had been to me and i to him but this was not often i was readier to shut my eyes upon the truth than to face it and so lived on wilfully in a dream thus the autumn passed away and winter camethe strange treacherous genoese winter green with olive and ilex brilliant with sunshine and bitter with storm still rivals at heart and friends on the surface mat and i lingered on in our lodging in the vicolo balba still gianetta held us with her fatal wiles and her still more fatal beauty at length there came a day when i felt i could bear the horrible misery and suspense of it no longer the sun i vowed should not go down before i knew my sentence she must choose between us she must either take me or let me go i was reckless i was desperate i was determined to know the worst or the best if the worst i would at once turn my back upon genoa upon her upon all the pursuits and purposes of my past life and begin the world anew this i told her passionately and sternly standing before her in the little parlour at the back of the shop one bleak december morning if its mat whom you care for most i said tell me so in one word and i will never trouble you again he is better worth your love i am jealous and exacting he is as trusting and unselfish as a woman speak gianetta am i to bid you goodbye for ever and ever or am i to write home to my mother in england bidding her pray to god to bless the woman who has promised to be my wife you plead your friends cause well she replied haughtily matteo ought to be grateful this is more than he ever did for you give me my answer for pitys sake i exclaimed and let me go you are free to go or stay signor inglese she replied i am not your jailor do you bid me leave you beata madre not i will you marry me if i stay she laughed aloudsuch a merry mocking musical laugh like a chime of silver bells you ask too much she said only what you have led me to hope these five or six months past that is just what matteo says how tiresome you both are o gianetta i said passionately be serious for one moment i am a rough fellow it is truenot half good enough or clever enough for you but i love you with my whole heart and an emperor could do no more i am glad of it she replied i do not want you to love me less then you cannot wish to make me wretched will you promise me i promise nothing said she with another burst of laughter except that i will not marry matteo except that she would not marry matteo only that not a word of hope for myself nothing but my friends condemnation i might get comfort and selfish triumph and some sort of base assurance out of that if i could and so to my shame i did i grasped at the vain encouragement and fool that i was let her put me off again unanswered from that day i gave up all effort at selfcontrol and let myself drift blindly onto destruction at length things became so bad between mat and myself that it seemed as if an open rupture must be at hand we avoided each other scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences in a day and fell away from all our old familiar habits at this timei shudder to remember itthere were moments when i felt that i hated him thus with the trouble deepening and widening between us day by day another month or five weeks went by and february came and with february the carnival they said in genoa that it was a particularly dull carnival and so it must have been for save a flag or two hung out in some of the principal streets and a sort of festa look about the women there were no special indications of the season it was i think the second day when having been on the line all the morning i returned to genoa at dusk and to my surprise found mat price on the platform he came up to me and laid his hand on my arm you are in late he said i have been waiting for you threequarters of an hour shall we dine together today impulsive as i am this evidence of returning good will at once called up my better feelings with all my heart mat i replied shall we go to gozzolis no no he said hurriedly some quieter placesome place where we can talk i have something to say to you i noticed now that he looked pale and agitated and an uneasy sense of apprehension stole upon me we decided on the pescatore a little outoftheway trattoria down near the molo vecchio there in a dingy salon frequented chiefly by seamen and redolent of tobacco we ordered our simple dinner mat scarcely swallowed a morsel but calling presently for a bottle of sicilian wine drank eagerly well mat i said as the last dish was placed on the table what news have you bad i guessed that from your face bad for youbad for me gianetta what of gianetta he passed his hand nervously across his lips gianetta is falseworse than false he said in a hoarse voice she values an honest mans heart just as she values a flower for her hairwears it for a day then throws it aside for ever she has cruelly wronged us both in what way good heavens speak out in the worst way that a woman can wrong those who love her she has sold herself to the marchese loredano the blood rushed to my head and face in a burning torrent i could scarcely see and dared not trust myself to speak i saw her going towards the cathedral he went on hurriedly it was about three hours ago i thought she might be going to confession so i hung back and followed her at a distance when she got inside however she went straight to the back of the pulpit where this man was waiting for her you remember himan old man who used to haunt the shop a month or two back well seeing how deep in conversation they were and how they stood close under the pulpit with their backs towards the church i fell into a passion of anger and went straight up the aisle intending to say or do something i scarcely knew what but at all events to draw her arm through mine and take her home when i came within a few feet however and found only a big pillar between myself and them i paused they could not see me nor i them but i could hear their voices distinctly andand i listened well and you heard the terms of a shameful bargainbeauty on the one side gold on the other so many thousand francs a year a villa near naplespah it makes me sick to repeat it and with a shudder he poured out another glass of wine and drank it at a draught after that he said presently i made no effort to bring her away the whole thing was so coldblooded so deliberate so shameful that i felt i had only to wipe her out of my memory and leave her to her fate i stole out of the cathedral and walked about here by the sea for ever so long trying to get my thoughts straight then i remembered you ben and the recollection of how this wanton had come between us and broken up our lives drove me wild so i went up to the station and waited for you i felt you ought to know it all andand i thought perhaps that we might go back to england together the marchese loredano it was all that i could say all that i could think as mat had just said of himself i felt like one stunned there is one other thing i may as well tell you he added reluctantly if only to show you how false a woman can be wewe were to have been married next month we who what do you mean i mean that we were to have been marriedgianetta and i a sudden storm of rage of scorn of incredulity swept over me at this and seemed to carry my senses away you i cried gianetta marry you i dont believe it i wish i had not believed it he replied looking up as if puzzled by my vehemence but she promised me and i thought when she promised it she meant it she told me weeks ago that she would never be your wife his colour rose his brow darkened when his answer came it was as calm as the last indeed he said then it is only one baseness more she told me that she had refused you and that was why we kept our engagement secret tell the truth mat price i said wellnigh beside myself with suspicion confess that every word of this is false confess that gianetta will not listen to you and that you are afraid i may succeed where you have failed as perhaps i shallas perhaps i shall after all are you mad he exclaimed what do you mean that i believe its just a trick to get me away to englandthat i dont credit a syllable of your story youre a liar and i hate you he rose and laying one hand on the back of his chair looked me sternly in the face if you were not benjamin hardy he said deliberately i would thrash you within an inch of your life the words had no sooner passed his lips than i sprang at him i have never been able distinctly to remember what followed a cursea blowa strugglea moment of blind furya crya confusion of tonguesa circle of strange faces then i see mat lying back in the arms of a bystander myself trembling and bewilderedthe knife dropping from my grasp blood upon the floor blood upon my hands blood upon his shirt and then i hear those dreadful words o ben you have murdered me he did not dieat least not there and then he was carried to the nearest hospital and lay for some weeks between life and death his case they said was difficult and dangerous the knife had gone in just below the collarbone and pierced down into the lungs he was not allowed to speak or turnscarcely to breathe with freedom he might not even lift his head to drink i sat by him day and night all through that sorrowful time i gave up my situation on the railway i quitted my lodging in the vicolo balba i tried to forget that such a woman as gianetta coneglia had ever drawn breath i lived only for mat and he tried to live more i believe for my sake than his own thus in the bitter silent hours of pain and penitence when no hand but mine approached his lips or smoothed his pillow the old friendship came back with even more than its old trust and faithfulness he forgave me fully and freely and i would thankfully have given my life for him at length there came one bright spring morning when dismissed as convalescent he tottered out through the hospital gates leaning on my arm and feeble as an infant he was not cured neither as i then learned to my horror and anguish was it possible that he ever could be cured he might live with care for some years but the lungs were injured beyond hope of remedy and a strong or healthy man he could never be again these spoken aside to me were the parting words of the chief physician who advised me to take him further south without delay i took him to a little coasttown called rocca some thirty miles beyond genoaa sheltered lonely place along the riviera where the sea was even bluer than the sky and the cliffs were green with strange tropical plants cacti and aloes and egyptian palms here we lodged in the house of a small tradesman and mat to use his own words set to work at getting well in good earnest but alas it was a work which no earnestness could forward day after day he went down to the beach and sat for hours drinking the sea air and watching the sails that came and went in the offing byandby he could go no further than the garden of the house in which we lived a little later and he spent his days on a couch beside the open window waiting patiently for the end ay for the end it had come to that he was fading fast waning with the waning summer and conscious that the reaper was at hand his whole aim now was to soften the agony of my remorse and prepare me for what must shortly come i would not live longer if i could he said lying on his couch one summer evening and looking up to the stars if i had my choice at this moment i would ask to go i should like gianetta to know that i forgave her she shall know it i said trembling suddenly from head to foot he pressed my hand and youll write to father i will i had drawn a little back that he might not see the tears raining down my cheeks but he raised himself on his elbow and looked round dont fret ben he whispered laid his head back wearily upon the pillowand so died and this was the end of it this was the end of all that made life life to me i buried him there in hearing of the wash of a strange sea on a strange shore i stayed by the grave till the priest and the bystanders were gone i saw the earth filled in to the last sod and the gravedigger stamp it down with his feet then and not till then i felt that i had lost him for everthe friend i had loved and hated and slain then and not till then i knew that all rest and joy and hope were over for me from that moment my heart hardened within me and my life was filled with loathing day and night land and sea labour and rest food and sleep were alike hateful to me it was the curse of cain and that my brother had pardoned me made it lie none the lighter peace on earth was for me no more and goodwill towards men was dead in my heart for ever remorse softens some natures but it poisoned mine i hated all mankind but above all mankind i hated the woman who had come between us two and ruined both our lives he had bidden me seek her out and be the messenger of his forgiveness i had sooner have gone down to the port of genoa and taken upon me the serge cap and shotted chain of any galleyslave at his toil in the public works but for all that i did my best to obey him i went back alone and on foot i went back intending to say to her gianetta coneglia he forgave you but god never will but she was gone the little shop was let to a fresh occupant and the neighbours only knew that mother and daughter had left the place quite suddenly and that gianetta was supposed to be under the protection of the marchese loredano how i made inquiries here and therehow i heard that they had gone to naplesand how being restless and reckless of my time i worked my passage in a french steamer and followed herhow having found the sumptuous villa that was now hers i learned that she had left there some ten days and gone to paris where the marchese was ambassador for the two sicilieshow working my passage back again to marseilles and thence in part by the river and in part by the rail i made my way to parishow day after day i paced the streets and the parks watched at the ambassadors gates followed his carriage and at last after weeks of waiting discovered her addresshow having written to request an interview her servants spurned me from her door and flung my letter in my facehow looking up at her windows i then instead of forgiving solemnly cursed her with the bitterest curses my tongue could deviseand how this done i shook the dust of paris from my feet and became a wanderer upon the face of the earth are facts which i have now no space to tell the next six or eight years of my life were shifting and unsettled enough a morose and restless man i took employment here and there as opportunity offered turning my hand to many things and caring little what i earned so long as the work was hard and the change incessant first of all i engaged myself as chief engineer in one of the french steamers plying between marseilles and constantinople at constantinople i changed to one of the austrian lloyds boats and worked for some time to and from alexandria jaffa and those parts after that i fell in with a party of mr layards men at cairo and so went up the nile and took a turn at the excavations of the mound of nimroud then i became a working engineer on the new desert line between alexandria and suez and byandby i worked my passage out to bombay and took service as an engine fitter on one of the great indian railways i stayed a long time in india that is to say i stayed nearly two years which was a long time for me and i might not even have left so soon but for the war that was declared just then with russia that tempted me for i loved danger and hardship as other men love safety and ease and as for my life i had sooner have parted from it than kept it any day so i came straight back to england betook myself to portsmouth where my testimonials at once procured me the sort of berth i wanted i went out to the crimea in the engineroom of one of her majestys war steamers i served with the fleet of course while the war lasted and when it was over went wandering off again rejoicing in my liberty this time i went to canada and after working on a railway then in progress near the american frontier i presently passed over into the states journeyed from north to south crossed the rocky mountains tried a month or two of life in the gold country and then being seized with a sudden aching unaccountable longing to revisit that solitary grave so far away on the italian coast i turned my face once more towards europe poor little grave i found it rank with weeds the cross half shattered the inscription half effaced it was as if no one had loved him or remembered him i went back to the house in which we had lodged together the same people were still living there and made me kindly welcome i stayed with them for some weeks i weeded and planted and trimmed the grave with my own hands and set up a fresh cross in pure white marble it was the first season of rest that i had known since i laid him there and when at last i shouldered my knapsack and set forth again to battle with the world i promised myself that god willing i would creep back to rocca when my days drew near to ending and be buried by his side from hence being perhaps a little less inclined than formerly for very distant parts and willing to keep within reach of that grave i went no further than mantua where i engaged myself as an enginedriver on the line then not long completed between that city and venice somehow although i had been trained to the working engineering i preferred in these days to earn my bread by driving i liked the excitement of it the sense of power the rush of the air the roar of the fire the flitting of the landscape above all i enjoyed to drive a night express the worse the weather the better it suited with my sullen temper for i was as hard and harder than ever the years had done nothing to soften me they had only confirmed all that was blackest and bitterest in my heart i continued pretty faithful to the mantua line and had been working on it steadily for more than seven months when that which i am now about to relate took place it was in the month of march the weather had been unsettled for some days past and the nights stormy and at one point along the line near ponte di brenta the waters had risen and swept away some seventy yards of embankment since this accident the trains had all been obliged to stop at a certain spot between padua and ponte di brenta and the passengers with their luggage had thence to be transported in all kinds of vehicles by a circuitous country road to the nearest station on the other side of the gap where another train and engine awaited them this of course caused great confusion and annoyance put all our timetables wrong and subjected the public to a large amount of inconvenience in the meanwhile an army of navvies was drafted to the spot and worked day and night to repair the damage at this time i was driving two through trains each day namely one from mantua to venice in the early morning and a return train from venice to mantua in the afternoona tolerably full days work covering about one hundred and ninety miles of ground and occupying between ten and eleven hours i was therefore not best pleased when on the third or fourth day after the accident i was informed that in addition to my regular allowance of work i should that evening be required to drive a special train to venice this special train consisting of an engine a single carriage and a breakvan was to leave the mantua platform at eleven at padua the passengers were to alight and find postchaises waiting to convey them to ponte di brenta at ponte di brenta another engine carriage and breakvan were to be in readiness i was charged to accompany them throughout corpo di bacco said the clerk who gave me my orders you need not look so black man you are certain of a handsome gratuity do you know who goes with you not i not you indeed why its the duca loredano the neapolitan ambassador loredano i stammered what loredano there was a marchese certo he was the marchese loredano some years ago but he has come into his dukedom since then he must be a very old man by this time yes he is old but what of that he is as hale and bright and stately as ever you have seen him before yes i said turning away i have seen himyears ago you have heard of his marriage i shook my head the clerk chuckled rubbed his hands and shrugged his shoulders an extraordinary affair he said made a tremendous esclandre at the time he married his mistressquite a common vulgar girla genoesevery handsome but not received of course nobody visits her married her i exclaimed impossible true i assure you i put my hand to my head i felt as if i had had a fall or a blow does shedoes she go tonight i faltered o dear yesgoes everywhere with himnever lets him out of her sight youll see herla bella duchessa with this my informant laughed and rubbed his hands again and went back to his office the day went by i scarcely know how except that my whole soul was in a tumult of rage and bitterness i returned from my afternoons work about and at i was once again at the station i had examined the engine given instructions to the fochista or stoker about the fire seen to the supply of oil and got all in readiness when just as i was about to compare my watch with the clock in the ticketoffice a hand was laid upon my arm and a voice in my ear said are you the enginedriver who is going on with this special train i had never seen the speaker before he was a small dark man muffled up about the throat with blue glasses a large black beard and his hat drawn low upon his eyes you are a poor man i suppose he said in a quick eager whisper and like other poor men would not object to be better off would you like to earn a couple of thousand florins in what way hush you are to stop at padua are you not and to go on again at ponte di brenta i nodded suppose you did nothing of the kind suppose instead of turning off the steam you jump off the engine and let the train run on impossible there are seventy yards of embankment gone and basta i know that save yourself and let the train run on it would be nothing but an accident i turned hot and cold i trembled my heart beat fast and my breath failed why do you tempt me i faltered for italys sake he whispered for libertys sake i know you are no italian but for all that you may be a friend this loredano is one of his countrys bitterest enemies stay here are the two thousand florins i thrust his hand back fiercely nono i said no bloodmoney if i do it i do it neither for italy nor for money but for vengeance for vengeance he repeated at this moment the signal was given for backing up to the platform i sprang to my place upon the engine without another word when i again looked towards the spot where he had been standing the stranger was gone i saw them take their placesduke and duchess secretary and priest valet and maid i saw the stationmaster bow them into the carriage and stand bareheaded beside the door i could not distinguish their faces the platform was too dusk and the glare from the engine fire too strong but i recognised her stately figure and the poise of her head had i not been told who she was i should have known her by those traits alone then the guards whistle shrilled out and the stationmaster made his last bow i turned the steam on and we started my blood was on fire i no longer trembled or hesitated i felt as if every nerve was iron and every pulse instinct with deadly purpose she was in my power and i would be revenged she should dieshe for whom i had stained my soul with my friends blood she should die in the plenitude of her wealth and her beauty and no power upon earth should save her the stations flew past i put on more steam i bade the fireman heap in the coke and stir the blazing mass i would have outstripped the wind had it been possible faster and fasterhedges and trees bridges and stations flashing pastvillages no sooner seen than gonetelegraph wires twisting and dipping and twining themselves in one with the awful swiftness of our pace faster and faster till the fireman at my side looks white and scared and refuses to add more fuel to the furnace faster and faster till the wind rushes in our faces and drives the breath back upon our lips i would have scorned to save myself i meant to die with the rest mad as i wasand i believe from my very soul that i was utterly mad for the timei felt a passing pang of pity for the old man and his suite i would have spared the poor fellow at my side too if i could but the pace at which we were going made escape impossible vicenza was passeda mere confused vision of lights pojana flew by at padua but nine miles distant our passengers were to alight i saw the firemans face turned upon me in remonstrance i saw his lips move though i could not hear a word i saw his expression change suddenly from remonstrance to a deadly terror and thenmerciful heaven then for the first time i saw that he and i were no longer alone upon the engine there was a third mana third man standing on my right hand as the fireman was standing on my lefta tall stalwart man with short curling hair and a flat scotch cap upon his head as i fell back in the first shock of surprise he stepped nearer took my place at the engine and turned the steam off i opened my lips to speak to him he turned his head slowly and looked me in the face matthew price i uttered one long wild cry flung my arms wildly up above my head and fell as if i had been smitten with an axe i am prepared for the objections that may be made to my story i expect as a matter of course to be told that this was an optical illusion or that i was suffering from pressure on the brain or even that i laboured under an attack of temporary insanity i have heard all these arguments before and if i may be forgiven for saying so i have no desire to hear them again my own mind has been made up upon this subject for many a year all that i can sayall that i know isthat matthew price came back from the dead to save my soul and the lives of those whom i in my guilty rage would have hurried to destruction i believe this as i believe in the mercy of heaven and the forgiveness of repentant sinners the end
