 prologue last night i had a dream heitor bonita said and this is what i dreamed madre de mentiras i beg you dont tell me your dreams antonio bonita said i already know your dreams this ones different heitor replied you dont know this one there ensued a small but ungainly pause while mopeitty mope by the bosstones doowopped out of the speakers music of these old american groups from the s was heitors idea antonio would have preferred machitos hyperhot afrocubano jazz but it seemed the kids who hung out in miamis south beach werent very hip to latino roots and didnt much care to be their loss but even antonio had to admit it was the boneyards gain ever since theyd opened this club it had been packed antonio had been skeptical when hed first heard the idea but it had seemed so offthewall that heitor had glommed on to it right away not that they were directly involved like always they were far removed from official ownership deep in the shadows where nobody could see they raked in the money from the first moment they had set foot on american soil they had made certain that all of their business dealingsfrom their main chemical and ore mining company to a fistful of importexport holding companies to their fledgling entertainment venture which indirectly owned the boneyard as well as other clubs throughout florida and the southeastwere strictly legitimate unlike in latin america where graft and wholesale corruption were among the main moneymakers of oldline family businesses and governments alike these men were comfortable with politicians and bureaucrats they knew their way around governments because they were able to sniff out the tiniest whiff of corruption and turn it to their own ends i dont want to hear the dream looking around antonio could see that p t barnum had vastly underestimated his market potential theres ten thousand suckers born every minute i have an evil feeling about it when they looked at each other it was like staring in the mirror they both thought simultaneously there is my brother but there is also me that was because heitor and antonio were identical twins even down to the extraordinary amber color of their eyes heitor said an evil feeling is it his face took on the aspect of a hungry fox nosing its way into a henhouse tall and lean as serpents they were handsome men in their own way their hair thick and curling was tawny as copper and the planes of their faces were sculpted hard over ridged bone this attribute and many others they inherited from their mother but another mystic side to them they gained from someone outside their family circle this was manifested in their auras which were powerful and magnetic in the manner of a black widow there was a remarkable stillness about them the curled and damped energy one observes in liquid mercury they were predators who did not have to move much in order to get what they wanted when hong kong jelly wong by the royaltones came on heitor said this dream is important and evil or not it must be spoken of he and his brother were dressed in shades of gray that most approximated the inside of an oyster shell shortsleeved shirts tight trousers from the s thinsoled keds without socks both of them despised socks antonio said nothing knowing in his heart this moment would come heitor said i dreamed i was a very devout jew and as this jew i woke from a dream as if i was just born understand me this dream was more like a holy vision his arms thrown wide described a circle the holy vision told me that the messiah was coming on sunday good news is it the evil news was it was super bowl sunday for a moment the twins stared at each other then as one they exploded into laughter the extraordinary thing was that even in such an unguarded moment they seemed like mirror images and in truth on the surface there was virtually nothing to differentiate them save perhaps one liked doowop and the other liked cubop i spoke to the weimaraner today heitor meant senator weiman i told you not to do that antonio said its too soon he wants to take me hunting in virginia antonio sighed wouldnt that be nice the big firms in his state are beginning to make him understand the worth of our copper and lithium importing reelection antonio commented the american way is it not the twins stared at each other and grinned i want to hunt in virginia there was an almost childlike wistfulness in heitors voice not now not yet seeing the look on heitors facehis face antonio took his twins hand and squeezed it i know how you live for the hunt both of us my dear heitors eyes were halfclosed but its for a very different kind of hunt quite abruptly theyd left the pedestrian subject of the weimaraner far behind antonios amber eyes appeared to glow yes i know youre burning to plunge the scalpel in yourself i hate him heitor admitted hes arrogant and spiteful he has what we covet antonio said cutting to the heart of the matter paciencia have patience soon now it will all be ours you know the plan and its a good one if we were in asuncion my hands would be red with his blood but youre not antonio admonished we have come up in the world this is the big leagues for the time being our behavior is under a microscope civilization heitor grimaced it makes me chafe antonio did not reply instead he watched a blonde woman in her late sixties in wide red suspenders whiz by on inline skates all she wore under the suspenders was a pair of workout shorts and a tank top bathing suit just as she was passing the front window they saw a small darkskinned man leap across her path in one motion he snatched her purse and pushed her violently off balance arms flailing mouth opened wide in shock she pinwheeled awkwardly onto the sidewalk as the darkskinned man began to run the twins were up and out the door in an instant communication between them was instantaneous heitor sprinted very fast after the darkskinned man like a cheetah he could run a quarter mile in recordsetting time without breaking a sweat he raced around a corner lunged forward and slammed his open hand into the small of the thiefs back in one more stride heitor had him firmly in tow without a word he spun him around the thief saw two fingers outstretched toward him for one agonizing second he stared full bore into heitors amber eyes what he saw there was impossible to say but he gasped and took an involuntary step backward heitor seeming to change his mind reached out and almost nonchalantly slammed the back of his hand into the side of the thiefs head he did this with such force that the thief was hurled off his feet in the air the man gave a little surprised yip like a dog whose paw has been stepped on then his head cracked sickeningly into a concreteblock wall and he collapsed in a tangle heitor bent retrieved the skaters purse and lost total interest in the man when he returned to the scene of the mugging he found antonio kneeling beside the woman hed gotten her sitting up her back against the plate glass of the club front her right leg apparently uninjured was stretched straight out in front of her but her left leg was bent at the knee all right is it heitor asked the dark stones know antonio replied and this alerted heitor the palms of antonios hands were carefully pressed against the skaters left calf the fingers gripping the muscle the woman had the back of her head resting against the glass her eyes closed i need you antonio mouthed heitor reached out and with his left hand cupped the womans raised knee thus engaged the two brothers stared into each others eyes something passed between them some spark or energy transient as a flame quickly and covertly snuffed out in a moment the woman gave a little sigh and opened gray eyes filled with the memories of her years i have your purse heitor said when her gaze alit on him i dont think anything is missing his smile seemed to compel her to do likewise feeling better perhaps antonio asked her yes much better she wanted to get up and they helped her she looked from one of their faces to the other clearly stunned the pain is gone not even an ache its as if nothing had happened we have a saying where we come from heitor handed her the purse at sinrise the night is only a shadow of itself thatssunrise antonio corrected maybe it is heitor smiled as the skater looked from one twin to the other antonio lifted a beckoning arm escuchame seora come inside and have a drink sientase feel comfortable thats extraordinarily kind of you the woman allowed them to guide her into the boneyard and onto a sofa you both have been so wonderful genuine good samaritans as heitor went to order her a latte he heard her say to antonio people like you restore ones faith in humanity bueno seora being in the right place at the right time there is no substitute for that yes a moment later antonio joined him at the bar they were surrounded by bright polished copper and fragrant steam our sainted mother knows we could be like that all the time heitor said if we chose to antonio rested his elbows on the bar he seemed relaxed almost somnolent like a crocodile in the afternoon sun heitor watched the waitress deliver the latte and some chocolate and almond biscotti to the skater why would we choose to he asked our sainted mother could not imagine antonio said and neither can i in a cloud of milky steam heitor said this puts me in mind of the time i was run over dont exaggerate antonio admonished it was only your arm that went under the wheel that didnt stop you from hauling the driver out of his car honor bound me he was careless with my brother antonio said besides i felt your pain and i was moved to great anger great anger yes heitor said this with an almost wistful tone in a peculiar way he seemed more animated now than when he was bouncing the petty thiefs head against the alley wall it was as if he was vibrating to some inner rhythm you held his face quite quite still while you stared into his eyes that was the good part heitor acknowledged summoning the dark stones antonio dragged in a deep lungful of percolating espresso and cinnamon chocolate until the blood fountained out of his nose and mouth sped from his ears like horses under the whip heitor recalled rapturously you remember the best part antonio prodded but of course the burst of memory was like a delicious taste in heitors mouth we came home covered in blood and leaped in the pool holding hands joined and energized we could not stop shouting heitor said and dona came out at the sounds of our raucous commotion it was her birthday perfecto antonio licked his lips with the tip of his tongue she saw the pool and thought we had filled it with pink champagne wed done that once a truly shocking treat antonio affirmed not as truly shocking as this one heitor said antonio nodded not nearly dona squealed stripped off her thong and jumped in the bloody pool her hard brown body in amidst the blood didnt we have a laugh we certainly did antonio said ah brother with everything thats falling into place la vida es muy buena life is good for us at that moment as he canvassed lincoln road through the front window heitor mouthed i see him without turning his head to look antonio said under his breath leaving is he heitor looking beyond the grayeyed woman enjoying her latte and biscotti kept the man in the periphery of his vision as predicted your information was prescient now hes a dangerous man others as well heitor said antonios amber eyes seemed to brighten as if he were shaking off a dream all work and no play is making us acutely dull heitor said madre de mentiras when you speak in oxymorons something is not right with the order of the world antonio laughed my thought exactly the twins turned and removed themselves from the boneyard like wraiths having purloined and stored the boneyards computer data on a floppy disk he carried on his person robin garner walked with an unhurried gait down lincoln road garner a federal agent had insinuated himself into the bonita twins sphere of influence with the extreme care of a probe navigating the outer rim of a dark star that had been eighteen months ago with sufficient difficulty and hazard he had gotten his entree and as per instructions had crouched like a drone at the edge of their intricate web do nothing his handler had cautioned him and the bonitas can suspect nothing wait and above all else watch garner had the eyes of an expert watcher it was what the actf had trained him to do the anticartel task force was the semiofficial entity within the justice department for whom he toiled in darkness and filth the actf had been created to interdict the alarming rise of the exportation of criminal activities from country to country governmental studies had established this as a worldwide trend as such it was as much a symbol of the new order in world ecopolitics as it was a threat to the united states instantaneous access to information made every governmentsas well as every criminal organizationsactions interrelated but on a personal level the actf gave him work he could sink his teeth into work that mattered so garner had waited and watched becoming a spider just like the bonitas it wasnt all that difficult why would it be he was a natural at penetration and camouflage from an early age garner had become proficient at hiding his true nature when at twelve hed realized that he was profoundly different from the boys around him he knew he was better off waiting two years later when hed had it confirmed to him by a sexual incident that he was gay he knew hed have to learn even more patience his parents were not the kind of people to be supportive of alternative lifestyles and he was no rebel to declare himself and let the chips fall where they might family was important to him at that time more important than his sexual orientation if that made him a coward in certain peoples eyes so be it being gay in sobe provided distinct advantages for one thing garner blended in just fine here youd better be either gay or bi or you didnt really belong for another it made him seem less of a threat to the macho bonitas also his years as a mole inside his own family that sensitized him to the subtle vibes to which others were blind this talent especially served him well in the warren of offices behind the boneyard where he had worked ten hours a day since the day it had opened being tuned in to those vibes had allowed him to crack the case hed been working on the worst part of being gay for garner was the feeling it gave him of being helpless and ineffectual in a straight society all he wanted to do was make a difference and bringing the bonita twins to justice would make a helluva difference even if others took the official glory which they inevitably would garner deep in the washington shadows would have his satisfaction slowly inexorably through chinks so minute only he could have sensed them hed caught quickening glimpses of the bonitas clandestine operations suspected but never provable only now having leaped through a sudden crack in their defenses did he have enough to put them away for multiple lifetimesif only he could get the data to the safe house where his handler awaited patient in his own way garner slipped into a side alley that reeked of urine and dried fish using a key he had been given he opened a side door to the white house this hardcore gay club which had taken over a longabandoned movie theater from the s was named not for the american presidential residence but the similarly named russian senate building in truth garner did not know what to make of his handler of course he trusted him with his life but the disadvantage of garners sexual orientation arose when they met they dont fully trust you his handler always opened their debriefings in this unsettling manner yes mea culpa im harder on you than i am on my straight agents thats because when it comes to you theyre harder on me but they trusted garner enough to embed him within the bonitas sphere of influence that was the paradox of federal bureaucracy that remained like time a constant since garner had joined the actf it had been rocked by turmoil most of what he knew came from rumors he had gleaned in the dimness of company bars of hidden agendas woven deep within the bureaucratic quagmire that was part and parcel of any federal agency he might have discounted these rumors as simply part of the paranoia that went with the boggy territory but even he in those restive periods when he waited to be dangled at the end of a penetration line had noticed the altered vibrations as if down in the center of things quickened drumbeats could ever so faintly be heard nothing definitive mind you just echoes of verbal charges an altered directive here a change in personnel there cuts in field teams in southeast asia a beefing up of others in latin america that was before spaulding gunn was installed as new director of the actf three years ago quite quickly after that the subrosa drumbeats faded into obscurity and the gossip mongers of foggy bottom turned to fresher juicier items to slice and dice in their meanspirited way what it all meant garner could not say except that eighteen months ago his handler had given him the bonitas as high priority subjects for an undercover operation why were the bonitas suddenly at the top of the actf enemies list up until last week garner had had no idea certainly his handler wasnt going to tell him quite frankly garner had no business speculating hand to his heart wrapped in the flag he was required only to soldier on to follow orders and hopefully to win the day garner made his careful way through dark and deserted corridors smelling of old age and new sex the partying that went on here all through the night and early morning was often inconceivable to him like religious sects there were all kinds of gays long ago garner had decided that though gay he wanted to make his way in the socalled straight world this required an entire set of attitudes that the gays who inhabited this place found repugnant the naming of the club was no happenstance but a form of quasipolitical statement here was new territory as far from the auspices of mainstream usa as was russia this was the united nation of queers long may it wave he found the old rickety staircase hidden behind one end of the long sweeping bar on the ground floor and went silently and steadily up it but try as he might he could not be the good soldier running full tilt into unquestioning battle he was too good at using his brain the trouble was garner sometimes thought of himself as cannon fodderclever but eminently dispensable if this turned out to be a suicide mission they would not blink an eye let alone feel the remotest twinge of remorse he wondered whether his handler would think of him after hed turned away from garners newly turned grave dark thoughts for a straightforward undercover operation but it was one thing to gather enough evidence to bring charges against subjects for a welloiled drug operation cleverly hidden within the cracks of an ohsolegit business quite another when these men were antonio and heitor bonita they had no idea how dangerous the bonitas could be the twins were fanatically secretive a sure and unquiet death lay in wait for anyone who they discovered penetrating those secrets coming to the head of the stairs he shook off such morbid thoughts he was used to them they cropped up near the end of missions when the nerves were rubbed raw the danger level at its highest and holding on to patience was his most valuable resource he was close to the rendezvous point close to bringing to a successful conclusion the most important mission of his career he could not rid himself of the fantasy that at long last even his handlers handler would recognize his contribution that after this triumph his handler would never again open a debriefing with the words they dont fully trust you garners handler thought it ironic to set up a safe house in a place that personally made him want to puke garner could not afford to be offended he could see the logic in it when in rome the old saw still made the most sense as prearranged garner entered the back office without knocking it was an anteroom actually part of the stars dressing room when this place had hosted vaudeville acts between film showings on the old wooden desk near the door to the back room was an imitation tiffany lamp that no longer worked a driedup blotter and a pile of outofdate people magazines frosted windows painted shut long ago allowed a feeble seepage of light garner went through the gloom and counted the number of people magazines in the stack there were seven all aligned that meant garners handler was in the next room and everything was secure this was part of the handlers job to keep the safe houses sterile the rendezvous points secure the agentsinplace from being terminated garner opened the door to the inner room and was swallowed by darkness three paces inside he slipped on something slick he almost fell but a strong hand grasped his elbow and steadied him cuidado you could hurt yourself thanks he said automatically but he stiffened what was that smell its a shame the familiar voice said but we no longer trust you what garner turned his head so violently he heard a vertebra crack such a shame another similar voice said because we liked you more than a smell it was a stench a closely held beam snapped on and gainer blinked madre de mentiras look what you stepped into garner stared down and his heart almost slammed into his rib cage blood and intestines lay on the floor in an almost perfect circle muy hermosa said the second voice very beautiful garners gaze followed the beam of light as if it were a magnet its uncompromising glare marched across the small room garner gave a little groan as he recognized the face of his handler that was about all he could recognize of him he tried to look away but as he did so a hand of iron seized the back of his neck and he was forced nearer and nearer to the object of their desire in the uncertain light the human head floating as if on a sea of silken darkness had an almost surreal look like an evil omen in a dream lights blazed garner caught like a deer in headlights looked up blinking into the glare four metalshell photographers floods clipped to shelves drenched the bloody scene in light so bright it was obscene ўay fantastica it was heitor bonitas voice crowing ўque duke how sweet now that the initial shock had dissipated garner was certain seor por favor this way garner felt a powerful tug on his elbow from antonio bonita they knew everything garner thought how had they found out who had given him away but there was no time to pursue these deeply disturbing thoughts he saw that the homey exdressing room had been tricked out in frightening fashion the walls on either side of him contained markings drawn in bloodthe handlers blood garner had no doubt these symbols seemed vaguely familiar to garner a triangle within a circle a single spot red and ominous within a square a cross within three concentric circles though he could not place them they sent a certain thrill of dread through the core of him some primitive part of his brain instinctively recognized a mortal enemy and there on either side of him were the bonita twins long and lean their amber eyes reflecting the awful glare they stood in a concentration of energy garner felt in a frisson along his exposed flesh you tricked us heitor said in a hearty gust of disillusionment traduced us antonio echoed his grip like an iron band i havent traduced you garner said feeling a foolish and clearly hopeless desire to defend himself garners gaze was drawn by light coruscating off the blade of a scalpel heitor held in one hand ive made no false statements against you this was not a court of law garner had entered but an execution chamber no heitor grinned wolfishly what were you going to tell your handler in your debriefing antonio spun him roughly around struck him again and again in strategic parts of his body until the damning floppy disk was exhumed from his person garner crumpled on the slick floor tasted his own blood his head lolled uncontrollably with his pain he sucked in a ragged breath and gasped the heat of the lamps caused the reek of human offal to rise from the floor like spirits from the grave antonio raised the stolen floppy disk on high this contains all the answers names dates et cetera et cetera he said in the ring ing vengeful tones of a hanging judge hellbent for blood are your eyes blind that you cannot see we know what you were going to do with this highly inflammatory information heitor said the scalpel moved and having moved pointed to the disembodied head of garners handler we were provided with confirmation briefly absurdly garner wondered where the rest of him was without crosschecking antonio admonished with considerable irony without independent corroboration we were to be condemned out of hand heitor crouched down in garners face antonio hunkered down beside him like common criminals antonio pitched forward on the toes of his keds whispered in garners ear heitor must have heard this because he said listen to me there is nothing common about us garner had begun to sweat and sweating he prayed oye heitor antonio said hes beginning to stink heitor pushed his head forward and sniffed madre de mentiras it is not a good stink not like blood antonio affirmed not like the dying now heitor said something in a singsong kind of voice it was not a language immediately known to garner whose fascination with arcane dialects had led him to become a linguistics expert but as heitor continued impressions came of povertystricken hovels and packeddirt streets of roosters crowing and mangy dogs prowling the edges of an emerald jungle beyond which rose a modern industrial skyline this was a paraguayan indian dialect garner thought guarani and suddenly the dripping designs on the walls came into sharp focus and garner felt a sick panicky feeling in the pit of his stomach he knew something of this obscure dialect linking it up to the bloody symbols he understood what the twins had been trying to tell him death was the least of what was to come i want you to understand this heitor said with the touch of his amber gaze heavy and knowing on garner the stones you have heard of the dark stones havent you we can see the answer in your eyes antonio said the dark stones know his hand snaked out gripping garners bicep like a pincer without seeming effort he shot to his feet dragging garner with him now he moved very fast hauling garner across the room like a sack of wheat the toe of garners shoe caught in a glistening fold of intestine dragging it with him like an unwilling pup antonio spun garner slamming him so hard against the back wall that all the breath went out of him and antonio was obliged to hold him upright garner was surrounded by the largest of the three concentric circles of blood he imagined the bloody cross converged between his shoulder blades he shook his head to try to clear it looking past the bonita twins he saw the bloody symbol on the fourth wall it had not been visible before because it had been behind him he saw two curving lines that met to form what appeared to be the outline of an eye but it was unlike any garner had seen before because it had two pupils it was eerie like the orb of god imagined but forbidden to look upon heitor moving slowly as a crocodile in the full heat of the day fingered the shining scalpel this is pure instinct now youve left reason outside in the night heres the meat of it antonios glistening teeth clacked beside garners ear we will reveal to you the sole law of the universe the further a creature gets from pure instinct the more flaws it possesses take man for instance heitor said ўmadre de mentiras flatulent with flaws antonio whispered his capacity to reasonhis obsession with ithas wiped out the instinct that made him what he was once heitor said advancing no more antonio said comprende seor heitor stood squarely in front of garner for us this is the game antonio up on his toes the backs of his legs taut wedged garner in the only game in existence heitor smiled the one thing that means something to us he said in the peculiar dialect of the guarani the rest antonio said does not exist now heitors lambent gaze pinioned him and garner screamed he didnt want to but he couldnt help himself the stifling air in the tiny room seemed to have gained a charge of electricity as the symbols on the walls came to life they appeared to pulse and shine eclipsing even the fierce glare of the photo floods was it hypnosis or magic garner raised and trained in the world of mans technological marvels was inclined toward skepticism he had discovered in the course of previous investigations that haitians died of voodoo curses simply because they believed in them there was no more mystery to it than that as if heitor could read garners thoughts he put two fingers on the side of garners neck where his carotid artery pulsed and garner felt an involuntary shudder go through him it was as if an enormous boa constrictor had settled on his shoulders and a certain fear he could neither understand nor control began to pulse like a drumbeat in his lower belly heitor was summoning the dark stones garner began to fight but it was far too late antonios grip held him fast even though he twisted and struck out with fisted hands and scrabbling feet strangely frighteningly it dawned on him that the harder he fought the longer he held on the better they loved it his heart seemed to freeze in his chest what was happening to him it was as if something he felt but could not define was boring through the backs of his eyes into his brain he felt as if he were on fire and involuntarily his body began to dance a manic jig he tried to pull his gaze away but he couldnt horrified he stared into those amber eyes and found himself being subsumed by another presence he felt himself plummeting down like a parachutist through layers of ever thickening cloud and it was as if the airplane he left behind was his own body dwindling in size grown dim and indistinct until it was thoroughly obscured by those clouds still garner fought with every ounce of strength left him they could have kissed him for his heroic efforts it was hours and hours later that heitor used the scalpel before thatfor a long and ecstatic timethere was simply no need day one rachel duke undressed slowly and languorously as she let her clothes fall to the floor she thought of gideons body gideon who was just a cubicle away and very soon would be closer than that her mind filled with images of gideons long lean musculature sinuous biceps sleek flanks hot butt she was so in love with gideon she couldnt see straight it might have been a yucky cliche but the truth was she never knew what intimacy meant until she met gideon rachels parents werent exactly big on intimacy god alone knew how they had had her but she was not in her parents world now she was in gideons gideon was eighteenthree years older than rachel not that the age thing mattered to either of them gideons world was terrifying and intoxicating and exhilarating all at once and rachel couldnt get enough of it she glanced at her watch just past am and their day was just beginning the last bit of clothing slithered to her ankles she reached out and as she pressed her palm to the bare wall that separated her from the next cubicle a tremor of intent went through her gideon as she readied her body so she readied her mind soon rachel at the boneyard was plugged in and turned on she sat in the tiny cubicle dim illumination played like sunlight cascading through densely forested foliage the drowsy sounds of birds and bees the soft burble of a nearby stream wafted on air perfumed with a combination of cypress juniper and a hint of lime rachel liked the dirtysexyfree feeling that came from being in heat outdoors with the animals watching and knowing what you were doing so she had dialed up all this synthetic light and sound and smell through the computer interface to which she was hooked up the tangle of humid odors came to her through a hoppedup network that spewed aromatherapy essential oils into the cubicle she was naked save for oddlooking garments of black rubber strapped across her breasts over her groin and around her thighs electrical leads ran from points on these garments to the computer terminal and a flexible penislike projection rose up inside her the boneyard was a virtual sex parlor one of the first of its kind gideon had turned her on to it it was a way to explore fantasies to make realor virtually realwhat was in your head without fear of aids or other sexually transmitted diseases it was in short the ultimate analgesic for the new severely anxious generation rachel sat back legs spread and watched through eyes slitted with a surfeit of drugs and lust the electronic image of gideon with the computer interface you could of course pick out anything to look at from the data bank images but she and gideon preferred their own images as least when making virtual love to each other when on occasion they interfaced sexually with likeminded individuals a halfcontinent away they appeared on the monitor as all sorts of strange and wonderful people rachels right forefinger moved the trackball mouse pointer higher up gideons virtual inner thigh at almost the same moment jolts of pleasure were transmitted through the leads in her garments to one erogenous zone after another with a little scream rachel came gideon knowing her so well kept her at the peak for so long her feet lifted off the floor and her thighs began to shake uncontrollably until her head lolled to one side afterward in the sweaty interim between bouts she snorted more coke gideon in the next cubicle was doing the same she knew somewhere in the dim recesses of her mind rachel knew it was too much but she didnt care she wanted more needed that much in order not to think about her father the flaming pyre of his death that particular thought caught like a thorn in her throat she wanted to dissolve in tears but instead did more coke was it true you never stopped loving your daddy no matter what even after he was dead what part of him lived on in your heart like a dark seed growing part of her desperately wanted her mother to burst in and rip her from the sexual net but her mother would never do it for one thing her mother would never believe the kind of secret life she was living for another she wouldnt know how to tackle it though she demanded to know where rachel was going at night every night coming home at five six in the morning rachel wouldnt tell her and still she let her go that was her way see something nasty something incomprehensible and do the ostrich dancestick your head in the sand why the hell didnt she stop us rachel thought because the time when she could is long past and now its far too late then the feelingthat peculiar burning that began in her thighs and crept upward took hold of her and felt too good she thought maybe once i wanted her to come and save me but what if i didnt because she was feeling that thorn in her throat again she did more coke because if she didnt surely shed set herself on fire shed tried once and gideon had saved her had gideon done a good or a bad thing the conundrum made her thirsty and she gulped down some of the black lemonade she had purchased in the parlor outside this socalled parlor the large common room of the boneyard was strewn with a hodgepodge of comfy art deco furniture there you could just chill rap a little while drinking a variety of coffees cappuccinos lattes or as was becoming increasingly popular with the kids who found their way here by word of mouth a collection of sodas dark and thick with herbal tinctures featuring names like doa skullcrusher and baddass brew it was all looselimbed informal lowtech out front but back here in the cybercubes the surroundings were hightech city she felt gideon suffusing her with pleasure again and she forgot about her fathers ghost groaning she dropped her black lemonade to the countertop she used her mouse to give as good as she got and soon enough panting her breasts heaving she came again sweat sheened her and she grabbed for the rest of her black lemonade she was in the midst of her third orgasm when the last coke hit brought back layers of the acid trip that had been hovering in the corners of her mind she felt as if death had come into the room and scythed apart reality she saw herself from above slumped and damp glassyeyed in the aftermath of cybersex she was also that person dimly aware of a presence like an angel hovering above her shoulder and the angel that was rachel left the room as it always did on its personal search to find her uncle he had been a cop when he and her mom had been so pissed at each other they stopped talking but rachel had seen pictures of him she even had one hidden in her room when she stared at that photo she imagined what he might be like strong tough big as a bear and smiling at her always that she was conjuring up the perfect father who would love and protect her unconditionally never occurred to her she only knew that she hated her mother for refusing to tell her where her uncle was her mother actually seemed frightened that rachel had become more and more curious about him as rachel had grown into a teenager all rachel knew was if she had a brother shed never treat him like her mother treated hers reality kept slipping out of focus like a lighthouse in the fog now the cyberstimulation came again but this time it felt like a hive full of wasps had gotten under her skin when rachel screamed it sounded like a jet airplane revving its engines she jumped up popping cables those that did not break slewed her off balance and she fell into a bog of quicksand she screamed again but her mouth was full of sand her arms were a mile long her legs like the wobbly piers of a suspension bridge in an earthquake nothing seemed right or good or a frightful bout of nausea caught her like a steamshovel in the gut and she doubled over she retched so hard that she vomited blood she blinked back tears and found she couldnt see then she was doubled over again in an agony so profound it all but paralyzed her when it felt as if it couldnt get any worse pain exploded in the small of her back and she spasmed into a fetal position the door to the cubicle burst inward and sixteen images of gideon followed themselves inside rachels mouth worked spastically and she tried to reach out but shed lost all control of her limbs then the world shattered into a hundredthousand razorsharp fragments taking her with it into an oblivion where even her insupportable pain could not be felt when the wahoo took the line bennie milagros cursed under his breath shit he said as the line spun out across the blue and gold sea i wanted a sailfish lew croaker his steady gaze already on the dancing fish cut engine speed and got ready to maneuver watch it he said this is no pussycat the wahoo was a powerful fish that could move at such astonishing speeds its first run often burned out the fishermans reel you an me we chow down on this wahoo at dusk bennie milagros was braced tensely near the stern of the boat a tall man in his thirties slim as a flamenco dancer he had a high domed forehead and long hair down to his shoulders he wore a white shortsleeve linen shirt a pair of redandblack shorts that reached almost to his very hairy knees and reed huaraches tufts of wiry black hair waved from the knuckles of his toes the shorts were held up over his skinny hips by a belt with an enormous oval silver buckle gaudily engraved with gold steer horns a smith wesson was tucked into his waistband bennie was one of those rich paraguayans who had come to south florida to spend money and be seen if he also did a little business here and there so much the better fighting fish like this reminds me there was this guapa she was special god hears me i would a married her if i could but that woulda spoiled her you know you mean it wouldve spoiled you you know lewis you are a very hardhearted man bennie was grinning but no listen to me this guapa she was like a magnificent wild animal you break its spirit its a sin you know i mean you gotta treat a woman with respect i look darkly upon men who disrespect women what exactly bennie milagross business might be wasnt known to any official entity of the united states croaker suspected that was just as well so this guapa what could i do i respected her kept her spirit alive here he thumped his chest with his free hand but god hears me i am the poorer for being without her he flicked the rod now magnanimous man that i am i am willing to share with you this piece of philosophy i swear on the soul of my dead mother your cockll grow feathers the minute you meet a guapa like this one pearl in a fuckin oyster believe me bennie grunted as the wahoo struck outward and the reel began to spin madly the eightfoot rod flexed severely as the fish took off and croaker turned the wheel over hard heading captain sumo away from alligator reef the reef dropped off sharply and they were soon in about three hundred feet of water three miles out from islamorada one of the middle florida keys the ocean stretched blue and green the whitegold sparkle of the sun lacing the wave crests it was cool and clean out here and croaker loved it the rime of salt borne on breeze and spray coated human skin and boat lacquer alike bennie worked the fiberglass rodglass in fishermans parlance but shit i wanted that fuckin sailfish you already landed one today croaker pointed out relax youre only allowed one billfish a day i feel a need for it in my soul understand maybe you dont bennie risked turning his flat face toward croaker you anglos you have some weird fuckin ideas bout spirituality see its all like televangelists caught with their pants down an afterdeath experiences an like alien abductions an you see all that shit in the national enquirer so much thats what defines spirituality for you you gents just dont get it an thats why youre all crawling over each other to find it he reeled out some line his coffeecolored eyes flashed with salacious good humor he was a handsome man his pockmarked cheeks making him seem all the more powerful croaker slowed some more and turned to starboard this fish was going to get away unless they were both very careful dont lump me into your great anglo stew oh yeah bennie flicked his wrist began to reel in line i forgot myself for a minute youre an excop nypd detective lieutenant he shook his head dirty business more than you could imagine croaker said fifteen years prowling the filthy underbelly of the citys streets had made croaker immune to life even little pleasures had dissolved like wet snow in the citys acid gutters hed spent early mornings washing the blood of murder victims and violent perps off his hands until hed scrubbed his fingertips raw and when he had come in out of the slime hed been met with a cynical web of police plaza corruption between politicos and penthouse residents played like a game of squash where no one worked up a sweat soon hed been driven back onto the streets again trying to wash away what would never come off hes doubled back bennie tensed reeling in line like a madman croaker whipped the wheel around bennie was a fine fisherman croaker never had to babysit him as he did with many of his wellheeled clients who jaded by afternoons cellphoning from the golf course had decided sport fishing made for a power experience here he comes croaker could see the wahoos narrow wake knew bennie was rightthe fish was making a run at the boat make sure you take up every inch of slack he shouted as he goosed the engines to life moving captain sumo out of the way of the wahoos charge bennie was reeling like crazy his eyes following the wahoos silver wake sharp as a knife at the last instant croaker could see that the wahoo was going to try to go under the boat and turned again the wahoo jumped instead and then ran bennies reel spun madly oh good one bennie cried yeah well you an i we got something in common besides loving south florida and fishing he took one hand off the rod for an instant struck himself in the midsection yeah whats that the wahoo chose that moment for a spectacular leap then began another run bennie was almost jerked off his feet he took one lurching step fetched his hip bone against the rail with a powerful sweeping motion he lifted the tip of the rod as the line spun out lotta life yet in this one he grunted croaker once again altered the boats speed coming to port with the wahoo more or less under control for the moment bennie said we both know what its like to have enemies youve got to be joking croaker laughed im like the manatee ive got no natural enemies really you an excop work now and again when the mood prevails with the elite feds whatre they called the anticartel task force anyone official inquires they dont know you you dont know them your name aint on their books so whos to say whos lyin you know that for a fact its a guess what dyou think bennie grinned as he worked his rod also word is you did some mighty fancy footwork with the mob you got friendsand enemiesin high places lewis dont lead me to believe otherwise bennie shrugged i know what i need to bout you he said whered you hear all this nasty stuff croaker asked guys i play mahjongg with bennie had a laugh like a macaws startled screech he flashed a quick glance at croaker the wahoo was tiring no doubt about it its runs were shorter and less powerful bennie definitely had him under control it wouldnt be long before they could gaff him aboard i know something about that mechanical left hand of yours i know it aint no handicap far fuckin from it also i know how you came to south florida babysitting a guapa witness to multiple murder and when the case was over you threw in your shield prematurely and settled down with the guapa what was her name you tell me bennie shrugged she was a model right now shes off in paris milan fuck knows where an who cares anyways she sure as shit aint here her idea of life was different than yours just like your mafia princess back on long island she was beyond the law and she was married ooo i like the size of your cojones seor he shook his head god hears me the guapas can be cruel when they want to be they werent cruel croaker said despite himself like you said they were not for me bennie ignored croakers comment he flicked the glass rod hurting the fish more weakening it further so you came back to this fortyfoot hatteras and the sport fishing charter company youd started years ago after you realized the obvious that the thing with the mafia princess was like unworkable very impressive didnt do it to impress you bennie said reeling in the wahoo did it to make a point bout the kind of man you are an the kind of man i am the wahoos wake was wide now exhausted from the fight it was almost on its side croaker threw the boat into neutral then climbed out of the cockpit and went to fetch the short stout gaff as croaker came up beside him bennies coffeecolored eyes slid his way you an me were the same deep down inside is what i think croaker held the gaff vertically as if it were a medieval halberd next to bennies slender frame his bearlike bulk seemed overpowering he had the handsome weatherbeaten face of a cowboy robert mitchum tall in the saddle sunlight flared in his gray eyes his artificial left hand made of black polycarbonate stainlesssteel iridescent blue titanium and mattegray boron components looked like a knights mailed fist and what kind of man is that very fuckin careful bennie grinned fiercely as he handed off the rod to croaker while he took possession of the gaff it was his fish to land all the way into the boat that was one of croakers rules of the sea like heres a for instance you come down here your rep precedes you you begin to do work for the feds helping the coast guard out now an then wrapping up drug smugglers they cant get a handle on did a lotta tracking in the glades he meant the everglades nasty kinds of stuff in there gators crocs snakes i mean to tell you but you very careful you learned your way around like a fuckin native likewhats the name of those indians not the seminoles who came down later on from somewhere north right georgia they came in the eighteenth century yeah bennie said so anyway not them i mean the original florida gents got whacked like the indians in mexico and peru by the fuckin anglos hornin in taking whatever the hell they wanted the calusas right you hit the glades like you know a fuckin calusa careful bennie stretched over the side swinging the gaff down he was trying to find the gill slit to hook into lots of evil happenin in south florida i dont have to enumerate to you pays tbespecially careful down here and youd know about being careful bennie sure i would what i do in life bennie paused as he made another pass at the wahoos elusive gill slit when it comes right down to it i dont really do anything at all im a fixer people have problems an i fix em business problems personal problemsi fix em all an not like you thinki see that look on your cop face you seen im carrying i know whats on your mind but youre wrong the piece is for protection only he spread his hands i negotiate i find a way to make a settlement he hunched forward his voice lower more throaty see my experience has been that peopleno matter how stupid stubborn or pridefulare motivated by the same thing they dont want to lose i show em how they wont lose bennie wiped salt spray out of his eyes with the back of his arm he was concentrating on the movements of the wounded wahoo hurling itself against the boat hull it still had a bit of life left in it finding the gill slit at last he bent over farther grunting ah shit the wahoo had flicked one last time and the gaffs hook ripped through skin and flesh ill never get this part clean ribbons of blood darkened the water you want help croaker said holding tight rein on the line just say the word bennie was balanced precariously on the top rail the day i need help landing a fuckin wahoo the rest of his sentence was lost in a guttural scream the water around the wahoo already dark with uncoiling blood turned black then a sickening white with a great roar the water purled upward and foaming madly revealed the head of a tiger shark what th fuck bennie shouted it was hugeover a thousand pounds for sure croaker estimated the jaws gaped open inches from bennies hands the cavity looked as big as the lincoln tunnel as the massive jaws clashed shut the gaff snapped in two and part of the wahoo disappeared in a bright maelstrom of flying blood and churning water bennie tried to scramble back but his belt buckle got hung up on the rail for a moment he hung there his upper torso suspended out over the water croaker extruded stainlesssteel nails from the tips of the polycarbonate and titanium fingers of his left hand slashed them horizontally snapping the monofilament line he dropped the glass rod to the pitching deck as with a sickening lurch the tiger shark surfaced again coming right at bennie ўmadre de dios bennies white face was flecked with fish gore scales refracted miniature rainbows off his cheekbones nose and eyebrows his wide staring eyes reflected the ugly graybrown snout of the shark bennies head was directly above the gaping jaws and still the shark rose gripped by a frenzy of blood lust croaker used his right hand to grab bennie by the back of his shirt collar hauling backward but that damn silver buckle was caught beneath the top rail in desperation croaker shouldered in beside bennie bending over the rail he swung his left hand down in a flat arc sunlight glittered off the back ofhis artificial hand the extruded stainlesssteel nail of his thumb pierced the sharks right eye while the other four buried themselves in its snout it was the only part of the sharks anatomy that seemed sensitive croaker remembered stories of divers who claimed theyd fended off attacks by slamming its nose he prayed they were true the tiger shark thrashed its powerful tail churning the water the flailing of its thick body rocking the boat its sandpaper hide scraped against the hull stripping off layers of paint and wood halfblinded and bloodmaddened it rose vertically a third time then crashed downward croakers nails were embedded deep within monstrous flesh and cartilage in reflex hed curled them and now couldnt extract them the sharks abrupt downward rush threatened to take him with it bennie who had been struggling with his buckle lurched free and taking hold of croakers sweatsoaked shirt with one hand drew the smith wesson from his waistband and pumped six rounds into the sharks head he was aiming for the brain but it was so small and so well armored he couldnt be sure hed hit it either by malevolent design or by simple reflex the shark leaped out of the water again could bennie have been such a poor shot even at pointblank range or was the prehistoric beasts body unaware as yet that it was dead no matter the ruined snout burst upward in an eruption of pink spume the leading edge of its doublerowed teeth grazed the inside of bennies right forearm and he gasped he was so startled he dropped the as if it were a hot iron it disappeared down the sharks throat then croaker bunching his fingers tore his steel nails clear through cartilage and flesh ripping open the sharks snout in a long bloody rent that went from end to end it was dead for sure it was dead with six bullets in it and blood pumping out of it like a fountain but croaker had seen too many landed sharks presumed dead come to life with tragic results the beast continued its psychotic thrashing lashing out with tail and mouth more dangerous than ever croaker turned and grabbing a boat hook proceeded to jam the brass end of it through the sharks good eye the boiling water slowly subsided blood spread like an oil slick from a damaged tanker turning slowly on its side spinning like a dying sun in space the shark gradually sank beneath the ocean leaving nothing in its wake to the very end its jaws were working spastically goddamnit bennie said leaning against the railing the color was already returning to his pockmarked cheeks the sonuvabitch took my wahoo and my gun as soon as they docked croaker drove bennie to the fishermans hospital to get the shark wound tended to it wasnt much more than a shallow gash but you never knew it was on the inside of bennies right arm and had come very close to the large median vein on their way to dinner croaker and bennie drove through a late afternoon chewy with brine and the iodine of dried seaweed they were in croakers flamingo and white tbird which bennie loved to say wallowed like a pig but rode at top speed like a magic carpet bennie his right arm resplendent with yellow disinfectant and squooshy gauze used his cellular phone to call a woman named maria croaker heard him making plans for her to meet him at ten that night bennie gave her a mile marker number which was as much of an address as you were going to get in the keys its right off us one maria on the left you cant miss it an about sonia shes cool with it good he turned to croaker as he hung up now when the guapas show up dont like get your head turned around croaker laughed hey bennie since when do i care who you go out with bennie grinned marias my date sonias for you bright boy croaker shook his head no go you know im not into that scene what scene what bennie spread his hands expressively jesus christo lewis this girls no whore he gestured with his chin you recall that story i told you bout the guapa stole my heart i remember everything you tell me bennie he grinned pearl in the oyster hey dont laugh man bennie settled himself in his seat you think i introduce you to just any woman no fuckin way he sniffed the yellow disinfectant on his injured arm and wrinkled his nose in distaste sonias someones pearl let me tell you could be shes yours a formation of pelicans long beaks tucked close to their gray chests swooped low across the water toward their nests among the mangroves croaker followed their flight looking out over the pale turquoise shallows of florida bay that led to everglades national park locals called it the backcountry in this area alone a sixhundredsquaremile warren of waterways basins and inlets between mangrove islets and rookeries for tropical birds that were too small and numerous to be counted or fully mapped hed fished many times for trout and snook and bonefish in the purling waterways where at the dawning of the century the calusa and tequesta silently paddled their buttonwood canoes it was there that hed met stone tree a seminole who had become his guide in the everglades stone tree tall as a calusa thin as a length of whittled wood slowly brought into focus for croaker the moments of sublime backcountry beauty that few people ever saw or understood things here can keep you alive and healthy for decades stone tree told him as they stalked strange flora and fauna through hardwood hammocks and coastal prairies things here can kill you in a matter of minutes its all a matter of knowledge in that selfcontained environment a man could lose himself to the rest of the world until the day he died not ten minutes later croaker and bennie were tucked away in papa joes tiki bar a secondfloor crows nest overlooking the western expanse of the mangrovewoven bay papa joes was an islamorada institution part bar part restaurant part fishing marina and all hangout it was like looking into infinity bennies hand clasped a tall beer glass beaded with moisture like understanding for the first time that there are forces beyond your control forces so primitive and urgent theyre like incomprehensible he was talking about the tiger shark the bar crowded with garrulous regulars was like a colordrenched reef behind them in front the oblate sun was setting over the water it was that gorgeous keys color neither orange nor red but part of both a few clouds ungainly as a clowns whiskers floated by overhead and a couple of motorboats slashed their way across the luminescent skin of the bay a handful of laughing gulls set up shop behind the restaurant on the dock below where the small fishing skimmers rocked gently at their moorings the sky near the horizon was turning that peculiar shade of green found nowhere else but in the tropics everyone was standing staring at the sunset down here it was more than a ritual it was a basic part of life like drinking and fishing as the last curve of the sun dropped below the horizon there was a burst of spontaneous applause then everyone got back to drinking and socializing the keys were the great equalizer status was nonexistent here it didnt matter worth a damn whether you had money or not whether in some other part of the world you counseled presidents or commanded a sevenfigure salary here you were no better or worse than the next person bennie dressed in dark raw silk shorts and a blindingly bright aloha shirt was in a serious mood that fuckin shark was like symbolic right symbolic of what the world is and what we never can be see what i mean he made horns of his forefingers pointed them at his temples we got all these smarts we got opposable thumbs he wiggled his thumbs as an exhibit we invented weapons that can level cities weapons that can kill people but not buildings we got e equals m c fuckin squared this was not the streetsmart cocky businessman most people got to see but the other bennie milagros a deep thinker a kind of philosopher who questioned everything in life croaker knew instinctively that he was privileged to be seeing this side of the man just as he knew some unspoken bond was being woven between the two of them what i mean is all these things they dont mean shit to the shark bennie finished his beer in one long gulp i swear lewis we almost got our asses chewed to meat out there today croaker got more beers as the waitress came with plates of whole grilled pompano from the restaurant below he said it was a force of nature like a storm or a tidal wave nothing more nothing less bennie stared at the fish made fragrant with fresh rosemary and thyme and croaker could see the look on his face he was reminded as croaker was that if not for this particular force of nature theyd be eating wahoo now see youre wrong lewis that fuckin thingthat was our fu ture thats whats gonna take us all down one daya force of fuckin nature unknown unannounced unstoppable croaker pulled bennies glass over peered into the bottom whoa i think id better drop some mighty prozac in here bennie laughed sourly but he was watching the spectral outlines of the brown pelicans on their perches atop the pier pilings the frightening encounter with the shark had set off something inside him i tell you lewis theres something out there waiting for us just after ten oclock maria appeared with sonia right behind her maria was a willowy south american with a massive swirl of black hair black eyes and the manner of a woman born to money sonia also latina was tall very slender with thick layers of dark brown hair and startling hazel eyes she moved with a certain energy and an unselfconsciousness that was immediately endearing it was croakers experience that women who used their beauty like a bank account soon proved dull or selfinvolved or both at croakers suggestion they went to the shark bar a place both he and bennie knew it was a fairly new club on islamorada a funky but hip place it featured salsa bands a tropical setting and best of all it catered to the latin american crowd down from south beach for sport fishing which was good for croakers business but he had another reason for hanging out there and he saw that reason standing head and shoulders above the crowd hey rafe he called rafe roubinnet owner of the shark bar waved and grinned like a man spotting an old college roommate how you been roubinnet thundered must be grand cause i hear youve been out on captain sumo almost nonstop for a month his laughter was infectious been reeling in the charismatic megavertebrates croaker with sonias hand in his maneuvered through the crowd toward the restaurateur you bet the big fish are running and my client list keeps getting longer i cant complain roubinnet was very tall lean and lined from tropical sun and wind his skin dark as mahogany he wore white jeans and a midnight blue tshirt on which was printed in large white gothic letters no recreational whining with his dark thick hair bright blue eyes and rugged good looks croaker supposed he could have been a model but roubinnet seemed too addicted to the slow and easy pace of the keys ai de mi whos the beautiful lady roubinnet cried bring her on over here compadre croaker and roubinnet had a special relationship croaker had gotten a lot of business from the shark bar ever since he had relocated from marco island on the gulf coast it was his home away from home he was known there and well liked not to mention much admired not long ago hed ended a spate of death threats against roubinnet by tracking down a local wise guy whod been hired by a couple of miami mobsters wanting a piece of roubinnets lucrative action roubinnet grinning hugely kissed sonias hand then clasped croakers right hand in his and gave it a squeeze that was as professional as it was powerful you could tell many things about a man from the way he shook your hand before his incarnation as a restaurateur roubinnet had been mayor of miami for a term being halfhispanic hadnt done him any harm and having bennie backing him with money and influence hadnt either its good to see you roubinnet said in that special way of his that made you believe that you were the center of his attention spending too much time on that boat of yours youve got to kick back a little relax like now someone called to him and he waved minute he clapped croaker on the shoulder dont be such a stranger compadre take advantage of the hospitality of the house your dineros no good here then he was striding through the crowd shaking hands laughing as he listened to bits of gossip delivered up by his best customers hes some character sonia said comes on strong but hes a good guy big heart and a straight shooter croaker smiled drink right now id rather dance it will be my pleasure he said as he led her out onto the dance floor so sonia is that your first and last name like madonna madonnas over sonia said so is having one name they swung to a sensuous merengue beat my last names villalobos like the music composer she smiled i like the way you dance very you know liquid reminds me of my brother carlito i used to dance with him like this when we were little i learned from the best croaker said i hung around spanish harlem up in new york so much the latinos finally got used to me he watched her move to the musics insistent beat why did you come tonight she looked at him curiously her arms hooked around his shoulders as their bodies carved out patterns on the floor because bennie asked now he was curious just like that sonia looked at him as if he ought to know then she laughed bennie maria and i all come from asuncion we know each other a long time the band took a break and the dance floor emptied toward the bar the front of which was fiberglass molded and realistically painted to look like a giant shark a set of jaws from a real great white shark its wicked teeth intact jutted from the woodpaneled wall behind the bar it was replicated in the mirrors which reflected the exuberant casually dressed crowd everything was muy casual in the keys would you like a drink croaker asked sonia nodded but afterward i want to dance some more her eyes sparkled its not every night i get to be with an anglo who knows how to merengue you like to merengue its a very sexy dance she said he took her hand threading through the raucous throng recorded music came on jimmy buffett and then a succession of wellknown salsa artists elbowing his way to the bar he shouted his order to frank one of the three bartenders working that night he got a frozen margarita for sonia another mescal for himself what the hell he thought they headed away from the bar across the packed room and out of the glass doors onto a wide wooden patio in true south florida tradition the frigid air inside became an instant memory as the humidity hit them with a moist slap they could smell the mangrove hanging rank and heavy in the spangled night a bed of stars arched overhead the soft lap of the waves was everywhere the frenetic scene behind them seemed a million miles away you didnt even have to close your eyes to believe you were walking on the far edge of the universe they looked up the stars seemed to burn more brightly in the velvet sky in the distance the lights of the keys glowed like pearls around a beautiful neck are you going to ask me to have sex with you sonia asked croaker laughed taken aback i hadnt quite gotten around to thinking about it thats a relief she said because i dont do that kind of thing even for bennie i think he knows that croaker said recalling bennies description of sonia as a pearl in an oyster her eyes danced in amusement dont get me wrong i mean i like sex but i prefer to choose my partners and anyway these days well theres a dark side to it and i worry about things she took a breath let it out very slowly like aids he said she stared out at the ocean tears glittered in her eyes a friend of mine is very ill thats all she needed to say suddenly it seemed very important to be at her side i was eighteen when my father died he said he was a cop i became one because of him it seemed right to follow his example because he was so moral all the evil in the world it seemed tried to get to him and he resisted it all he knew what it meant to be a defender of the law croaker holding her hand imagined his father sitting beside him laughing with his eyes crinkling and his hat pushed back to the crown of his head he looked into sonias beautiful eyes and said he died violently shot in the back in an alley not three blocks from where we lived he was killed by someone he knew and trusted in the end that was the only way his enemies could get to him by corrupting someone close to him he took the point of sonias chin gently in the crook of his finger he was a good man he didnt deserve to die before his time he didnt deserve to die like that he searched her eyes i think maybe its the same with your friend isnt it she nodded tears spilling from her eyes when he wiped them away she laughed and the soft musical sound sluiced away the dark rustle of anxiety that had built up around them she stood very close to him her eyes and lips glittering in explosions of refracted light from the interior of the club i dont know what i expected tonight but maybe i wasnt really expecting to find someone she put her drink on the wooden railing cupped his left hand in hers turning the blue metal over in the light tell me about this its actually a biomechanical contraption he said hed long since gotten over being selfconscious about it my hand got sliced off in a fight when i was in japan and a team of microengineers put together this prototype it runs on a pair of lithium batteries but believe it or not theres a lot of me inside it there are boron bones titanium joints and stainlesssteel nails but my own artificially regenerated nerves tendons and sinews are in there as well but theyre so well protected i could literally put the hand in fire without feeling any more than a pleasant warmth her fingers glided over the mattegray polycarbonate palm the titanium fingers with uncommon delicacy does it need repairs like a car periodically im supposed to go back to tokyo to let the surgical team make adjustments but i havent the inclination i just change the batteries once every six months he looked at her rapt face and hoped she wasnt one of those women who got hung up on the thing itd happened before its been seven years and i suspect they want to replace it with a newer model he shrugged one of these days ill get around to it or maybe youll just keep what you have sonia said maybe youre content just the way you are with a start croaker realized there was more than a grain of truth to that and he nodded grateful at this moment to be with her he was aware of the intensity in her eyes as she touched the tip of each finger of his fleshandblood right hand i like hands she said hands tell you a lot they cant lie she traced the lines on his palm felt the thick calluses you have workers hands strong and capable that comes from being brought up in hells kitchen he said thats a real rough part of manhattans west side you had to be hard as nails or the hoods would take you apart i know what thats like her thumb pressed against his i was raised in the roughest part of asuncion her eyes got dark i learned two things there to be thickskinned and to be patient being patient is hardest of all dont you think it doesnt seem to be an innate human trait thats why its so hard to learn suddenly he seemed as tonguetied as a kid on his first date he remembered being with stone tree they were standing in still backcountry water the sun perched on the edge of the horizon like a demure girl without seeming to have moved at all stone tree reached into the water and pulled up a perch he gutted it spit it on a green branch the morning was filled with pearly light and the perfect smell of roasting fish a roseate spoonbill flew by its unearthly pink haloed by the sun stone tree said life at us best is pure and sweet moments like this caught in your hand stored in your heart is all a man needs and before croaker knew what he was doing he was kissing sonia an instant after he felt her lips opening under his he pulled guiltily away i didnt mean to do that her eyes were huge the irises very pale but i mean to do this putting one hand at the nape of his neck she drew him gently but forcefully until their lips touched then she melted against him her lips opening and her tongue wrapped around his as if she were a nightblooming flower he was filled with her scent it was a heady sensation and he breathed deeply a quick surge of music made his heart pump all the harder lew a light female voice not now he thought can i be unlucky enough to run into an old girlfriend just at this moment with extreme reluctance he broke away from sonia keeping a firm hold on her hand he turned to face the woman who had come through the glass doors from the interior of the shark bar hello lew croaker stared at the woman his mind refusing to work matty it was as if it were encased in a block of ice he felt his stomach give a quick flipflop matty beautiful regal as a princess was looking from him to sonia and back again she wore a very expensive dress in matte black jersey and a string of diamonds at her throat she was so impeccably madeup she looked as if shed just emerged from a beauty salon in her formal designer splendor she looked totally out of place i know this must come as something of a shock christ you can say that again mattys gaze flicked quickly to sonia and as if she were embarrassed whipped back to his stunned face im sorry to intrude but ive got to talk to you i didnt want to leave a message at the marina and they said youd probably be here some time tonight clearly nervous her words came out in a tangled rush you said you never wanted to speak to me again croaker was aware he was gripping sonias hand as if it were a life preserver in high seas he could hardly hear the conversation over the pounding of his heart that was what twelve years ago fourteen matty said fourteen years one month seventeen days she tried to smile but failed miserably she took a deep breath it was at rachels christening how could i forget he said bleakly shes fifteen now and not a word from either of you in all this time im not aware that you ever tried to contact us after what you told me i had no reason to think youd want to see me okay i deserved that he stared at her stonily lew what is it you made your bed you married donald duke that lifes everything you wanted or so you took the trouble to tell me over and over mattys eyes were full of tears that was a long time ago lew sonia broke in whats going on everythings changed matty went on as if she hadnt heard sonia donald walked out on me watching her expression he said what do you want from me matty am i supposed to be surprised or even sympathetic he was painfully aware that he was roiled with emotion as the past came rushing back he had to turn it aside oh yes how thoughtless the introductions sonia villalobos this is matty duke my sister in the stunned silence he let go of sonias hand eighteen years ago she met a man named donald duke lew dont matty pleaded he was a corporate raider a shark who fed off other peoples misfortunes he plundered one company after another selling off the divisions firing people christ matty said you talk about him like he was some kind of criminal croaker concentrated on sonias face as his anger once again bound up his heart he maneuvered people he didnt like out of boardrooms hounded them out of new york maybe even taking pleasure in doing so what proof matty said there wasnt any his eyes blazed nevertheless my sister married him she was dazzled by the lifestyle isnt that right matty matty bit her lip and looked away of course it is she wouldnt listen to my warnings in fact they incensed her i told her what kind of man she was marrying but she turned everything around she accused me of being jealous of donalds wealth and position she made fun of me because i was a cop and i saw the world through a cops peabrained eyes he cocked his head wasnt that the word you used matty and then you said what was it youre pathetic lew youll end up like pop lying dead facedown in an alley he shook his head the lifestyle the money and power were all more important than her own family she met duke and she was suddenly embarrassed by her family by where she had been brought up that isnt true matty protested which part isnt true matty tell me he watched her face at the wedding you gushed over donalds wealthy friends while we sat alone and isolated you never brought him home mama only wanted to cook for him but you never gave her the chance stop it matty cried in anguish you dont understand anything croaker was not to be deterred worse you kept rachel from us as punishment and ma died without ever having a chance to get to know her granddaughter you cut us out and it broke mamas heart not to mention mine he turned to sonia at rachels christening id finally had it and i told her what i thought of her husband and her new life damnit lew you threatened donald in church matty was trembling in front of everyone and i meant every word of it a kind of crazy pulse was beating in his head as remembrance flooded back thats when she told me she never wanted to speak to me again he said to sonia then he rounded on matty now arent you glad you came back without another word to either woman he opened the glass door strode through the crowded club past bennie and maria clamped in fiery embrace on the dance floor and out into the sea of cars in the asphalt parking lot it wasnt long before bennie milagros came dancing down the shark bars front steps above the entrance the front half of a gargantuan fiercelooking molded plastic shark thrust skyward in a plume of fake foam it was tacky but rafe roubinnet said it made him laugh every time he looked at it bennie moved aside to allow a couple of south american businessmen and their women to get by then went purposefully across the lot to where croaker sat behind the wheel of the tbird he climbed into the car beside croaker and handed him a drink here i thought you could use this croaker accepted it without comment bennie extracted a long cuban cigar from his breast pocket took some time with the ritual of lighting it he smelled of mescal and male sweat a hint of marias perfume clung to him like pink clouds cling to cherubim pretty soon the cigar smoke masked it all regarding you i think that you know a bat outta hell woulda left the club in better shape he puffed on his cigar not looking at croaker not looking at anything sonia is steelyeyed so you mustve somehow gotten to her shes upset for you marias kibitzing with her and me im out my ecstatic dancing partner maybe for the rest of the evening another languorous puff oh yeah i almost forgot theres this juicy guapa askin everyone in there where you went god hears me shes got some kinda figure on her shes my sister bennie well shit bennie frowned darkly clamped the cigar between his lips above their heads the palm fronds clattered like an unruly chorus in concert with the high chirps of the tree frogs someone bursting out of the club caught their attention here she comes bennie said softly he waited until he had croakers gaze this sucks man this bad feelin its like poison you know im sorry i screwed up your evening bennie dont be dim bennie waved his cigar in the air this heres bigger than an evening with maria he blew out a cloud of aromatic smoke you know what i thought about in that moment when the shark came up lewis it wasnt my whole life flashing like a line of tarot cards what i thought bout was my sister not my father not my brothers mi hermana bennie turned to face croaker rosa died five years ago and what i was thinking was this my father he always sort of dismissed her accomplishments even when she went to graduate school in bogota earned her masters in economics and got a job at the world bank not that he didnt love her not that he wasnt proud of her in his way he just never showed it bennies eyes were clouded with memory and regret so in that moment i thought of rosa i saw her being wounded by my fathers indifference by my brothers inattention by my own benign neglect he looked at croaker see somethings changed now the fuckin shark did that to me an ill never forget it i miss her an ill never get a chance to tell her that then he leaned over took croakers right hand pointed to the tracery of blue veins along the back of it whats this he hissed its fuckin blood lewis he nodded his head as if hed just solved the riddle of the sphinx just remember whatever your sister is or isnt whatever shes done whatever hurt lies between you you twore joined shes blood matty had spotted them and was walking over she gave bennie a hesitant look bennie slid out of the car he chivalrously left the door open for her went around to the drivers side stood at croakers shoulder as matty came up to the tbird he gave her his best silken smile then leaned over whispered in croakers ear god hear me women can find more ways to be cruel but you know what sometimes their brothers can be worse croaker watched him saunter slowly back to the club entrance smoking contentedly what an enigma bennie milagros was every time you thought you had a handle on him he showed you another facet of his personality he was mercurial crass muy simpatico improbably spiritualand endlessly puzzling a moment later matty stood beside the tbird saying nothing shed darkened her curly wild hair to the color of toffee it suited her coloring better than when shed had her hair dyed blonde she was tall and willowy with the long legs and curvy figure a man like donald duke would have coveteduntil someone taller and leggier came along about to say something she started as car doors slammed and an old buick fired up headlights swung across her face as the buick rolled out of the parking lot then she took a step toward him her tension was palpable you know you have a habit of embarrassing the hell out of me in public maybe now you know a little of how mama and i felt her expression was bleak her lips thinned by anxiety christ this isnt easy why should it be you sure as hell made it hard on us she took a deep breath then compulsively opened her purse slipped something out of her wallet passed it over to him it was a recent color snapshot of rachel she had mattys thick curly hair and her intense expression but donalds ice blue eyes and fair coloring whoever had taken the photo had caught her in an unguarded moment of concentration she seemed as carefree as a person could get shes beautiful he said with a painful pang hed just realized how much hed been cheated in the last fifteen years hed never had a chance to watch her grow up thanks but she forgot to smile she shook her head when he tried to hand back the snapshot thats for you croakers gaze lingered over it i can see both of you in her face the thing is she hesitated donald had been gone for two years six months ago he died he was killed when his private jet got caught in a thunderstorm and crashed into a mountainside outside san francisco croaker wanted to say he was sorry but the word stuck in his throat instead he could not help saying that must have made you rich not really she seemed resigned to his barbs a year ago donald remarried a young oil heiress from texas with impeccable family credentials which i suppose hed longed for all the time she gave birth to their son a week before he died donald stipulated that the estate will eventually go to him tough luck he held the photo up but you still have rachel mattys face seemed abruptly pale she looked like she was about to say something then at the last minute changed her mind lew i her gaze twisted away i have a confession to make i know you didnt say anything when i said youd hadnt tried to contact us his jaw clenched involuntarily you see i know you tried to keep in touch with rachel she took a long shuddering breath i know because i made sure she didnt get the letters sonuvabitch his hands slammed the wheel and she winced it was terribly wrong of me i know she shook her head but i thought i was doing the right thing shielding rachie from someone i didnt want her to see he looked at her and said why didnt you want her to see me goddamnit mattys eyes were wet and she tried to look everywhere but at his face the truth is her lip was trembling and she licked a tear that had slid down her cheek her gaze finally found his you see shes so damn much like you voices came laughing and highspirited as a group came out of the club another engine started up and headlights lit the parking area for a moment before swinging out onto the road well hell what dyou know croaker said in some wonderment he looked at the photo of rachel again before sliding it away matty settled herself silently beside him he smelled a waft of giorgio perfume they lapsed into an uneasy silence old wounds surfacing were proving difficult to deal with mattys anxiety had increased he could feel it like an itching in his bones the salsa band had returned its rhythms insistent and alluring he longed to be inside dancing hip to hip with sonia he wanted very much to apologize to her as if she could read his mind matty said in her best brittle tone you look like you cant spare much time go ahead then your girlfriends waiting for you but i must say i dont know why you waste your time oh for christs sake hed been expecting something like this you can do so much better than that like i could do better than being a cop he said i always had such high hopes for you but they were your hopes matty not mine he turned to her tell me something how come you never asked what it was i wanted out of life how come you assumed you knew she seemed on the verge of tears she was trembling slightly and croaker had the distinct impression she was keeping the tears back by sheer force of will but i did know she said in a small voice we both wanted more for ourselves than mama and pop had i know that we used to talk about it when we were young sure i wanted better than what had been he said but i didnt want to turn my back on it thats what you set out to do matty she squeezed her eyes shut slowly tears formed at the corners welled and dropped into her lap i wish i could make you understand try she shook her head from side to side that would mean her eyes flew open and she glared hotly at him for a moment all right but she couldnt sustain it and she tilted her head back and stared up into the clattering fronds of the coconut palms see for you it was different you were a boy and the streets of hells kitchen were made for boys thats no reason please be still she said its hard enough her eyes squeezed shut again and when she spoke her voice was as quiet as the breeze drifting through the palms just let me tell it okay she licked her lips as if they were dry and he could see that she was terribly frightened of a memory there was this boy richie paglia croaker remembered him dark hair hot eyesa hunk hed gone out with matty for a while then she dropped him cold and disappeared into the world beyond hells kitchen shed turned her back on her neighborhood and her family not long after shed married donald it had pissed croaker off the way shed tossed aside a local kid whod cared for her treating him like dirt he had seen in that gesture an intimation of a larger betrayal to come all for donald and his glittering world croaker bit back an acid comment richie matty was saying he was so sweet on me she put her fingertips to her lips as if she had to flog herself to continue see the thing of it was ritchie got me pregnant what into the shinned silence she forced more words he offered to marry me but i said no i didnt love him and he didnt know what he wanted there wasnt anything between us but sex wed had fun thats all it happens lew not to my sister i knew youd say that she sighed but it did happen her voice trailed away she put a hand up pressed it against her forehead for a moment i couldnt go to you i was what nineteen id finished college in three years made deans list i wanted a career but what did any of that matter to you i knew youd make us get married and wed be miserable either that or youd beat the crap out of richie which he didnt deserve besides catholic that i am i was ashamed you remember how strict mama was about religion she stared down at her hands i was in a panic i felt i was inside a box that was closing in on me richie and i decided the best thing was for him to disappear from the neighborhood that was the easy part hed gotten a job across the river in hoboken and he said hed move there as for me her restless gaze roved the treetops as for me i had to find a place outside of hells kitchen a clinic a doctor croaker could scarcely catch his breath how could his reading of their shared past have been so flawed the truth had a cruel habit of surprising just about everyone so you had the abortion matty nodded it was a decision that almost tore my heart out for a long time i felt unclean wrapped in a sinners ashes i couldnt bring myself to set foot in church i felt i had turned my face away from god but i had no other choice she buried her head in her hands and he waited his heart beating very fast afterward i found that i couldnt go home i couldnt face the inevitable interrogation youd put me through i knew you lew youd take one look at my face and know something was wrong i tried to look for you she nodded but you couldnt find me i had just enough graduation money to stay in a hotel for a couple of weeks when the money ran out i got a job as a copywriter at an ad agency and for the first time i was happy i felt free free of us croaker said your family matty shook her head free of that apartment it was so dark and depressing my god lew how could you stand living there for so long mom and pop were there he said it was home matty turned her head away the agency is where i met donald her tone turned wistful i worked long hours and didnt mind i was trying to stare down my conscience in the mirror but after a while i found i was so happy i was no longer racked by guilt she ran her hand along the tbirds chrome work six months after i started work donald bought the agency id moved up by then i had a group of midlevel accounts i was handling anyway the day the papers were signed donald fired all the high priced executives along with their triplemartini lunches then put together a transition team from those remaining to evaluate the company and the staff for him i was part of the team i worked alongside him for three months every day i never thought he noticed but i was wrong he told me later hed been watching me from day one she turned to him her face full of tears without even knowing it id slipped into a whole new life so you see after everything that had happened everything i wanted to forget i couldnt face the familyespecially you lew mr detective even after months and months had gone by i was terrified youd see the truth in my eyes every time i tried to lie croaker stunned and ashamed heard bennies words coming back to haunt him god hears me women can find more ways to be cruel but you know what sometimes their brothers can be worse something hard and ugly broke apart inside him matty just the soft conciliatory tone of his voice caused her to break down she was sobbing as he reached for her her shoulders shaking her head pressed against the crook of his shoulder he held her close to him and wonder of wonders his eyes were wet as well bennie was right no matter who she was no matter what had gone on between them they were blood it was odd to realize that what he had mistaken for anger was simply mischance and misunderstanding i couldnt face you she whispered i couldnt bear the recriminations the look on your face when you found out your contempt for me for being so stupid for doing all the wrong things so i took the cowards way out after id married donald it was easier to cut the family out but i swear it was your unwavering sense of morality that stared at me in the mirror every morning he held her closer said whats done is done matty its all in the past we can start over again really oh my god lew that would be so wonderful a dream come true but she was rigid with tension and he drew her gently away from him so he could see her face but what her eyes were wide and staring in mortal fear and instinctively he knew that the stark terror he saw in her eyes was what had driven her to seek him out after all this time matty what is it oh dear god she whispered through her sobs rachels dying lew my little girl is slipping away and i dont know what to do day two royal poinciana hospital was a twelvestory pale gold brick edifice that rose at the east end of eucalyptus street though it was a stones throw from the flagler memorial bridge and within walking distance of royal poinciana way and the breakers hotel on palm beach its immediate surroundings were dark bleak and not a little dangerous across the moat of the intracoastal women with big hair emerged from gleaming rollsroyces without a care in the world here you were obliged to lock your car doors the moment you slid behind the wheel it was more than symbolic that the hospital facing the lightspangled intracoastal had turned its back on north dixie highway and beyond broadway that area filled with brokendown cementblock houses and floodlit fiftycent coin laundries was the mean province of the black community that lapped precipitously at palm beachs outer edge it was no wonder that the palm beach concierges urged their charges to avoid the immediate northwest territory be that as it may matty seemed entirely unperturbed as she got out of her black lexus they hurried across the blacktop parking lot and up the stairs into the hospital a faint smell of bandages and antiseptic floated in the closetofreezing air a security guard showed them where to check in and pick up day tagsmatty turned back to croaker this morning she looked exhausted as if she had paced the floor all night waiting for dawn to arrive shed tried to do something with the dark circles under her eyes but when she took off her donna karan sunglasses croaker could see shed failed at the end of the hall on the sixth floor they went through the double doors marked dialysis unit they entered an area that looked for all the world like the waiting room of hell old people bent and haggard as last years saw grass were lined up in the hallway they were supported by walkers wheelchairs and crutches the occasional nurse marched down the line inspecting them like the guard outside a disco who decides which people will be allowed to enter the place reeked of medication and resignation as croaker passed this rank of the infirm he could hear thick and ragged breathing tiny moans and disturbed grunts as if he had come upon a watering hole in the african veld diabetics waiting for their dialysis matty murmured beyond another set of doors was ccd the critical care dialysis it was a warren of claustrophobic cubicles built around a central nurses station surrounding patients in beds were crash carts iv stands monitors arcane medical paraphernalia and in some cases dialysis machines of the eight people in the unit only rachel was young the rest seemed to have been plucked from those unfortunates who had been on the dialysis line too long croaker approached rachel tentatively as though he might wake her with an incautious step but she was beyond such concerns according to what matty had told him rachels condition was critical she had been in a coma at the time she had been admitted to the hospital and had not come out of it she was so pale it looked as if every drop of blood had been drained from her blue veins throbbed beneath the thin skin of her temples a tangled mass of hair spread lankly on the pillowcase a gold nose ring had been pushed aside by a plastic tube croaker tried to imagine her as the child she had been at her christening when hed held her in his arms but the memory eluded him all he saw was the fifteenyearold who lay before him his heart was caught in a viselike grip he was struck all over again by how beautiful she was but her face looked like a death mask she was catheterized and tubed hooked up to monitors that showed her pulse heart rate and blood pressure iv drips punctured her veins a computerized dialysis machine perhaps fourandahalf feet high clad in beige plastic pumped dutifully at her side cleansing her blood doing the work her damaged kidneys apparently could not at last his heart broke and he turned back to matty whats going on what the hell happened to her there was more than a little anger inside him matty stood mutely staring dully at the dialysis machine which had taken on an odd and vaguely unsettling presence as if it were a large and loyal dog that would not leave its masters side simply put shes suffering from nephrotoxic poisoning brought on by an overdose of cocaine and amphetamines croaker turned to see a female doctor in her midthirties fit as an amateur athlete pretty in a tough nononsense way her reddish hair was pulled back from her catlike face she stuck out her hand and croaker took it im dr marsh jenny marsh she cocked an eyebrow and you are lew croaker im mattys ah the prodigal brother returneth dr marsh smiled from all mrs duke has told me im glad she was able to locate you excuse me a moment she turned to matty wed like to take some more blood and urine mrs duke if thats all right matty nodded mutely and dr marsh signed for a lab tech to come in doctor id appreciate some details on my nieces condition croaker said as the tech began to draw blood from rachels arm the cubicle had gotten uncomfortably cramped and dr marsh said why dont we continue this conversation outside she and croaker stepped out into the center area but matty stayed behind my sister personally im relieved youre here dr marsh said mrs duke is having difficulty assimilating everything thats happened to rachel thats perfectly understandable given the nature of the situation however she tells me youre an excop is that right croaker nodded then i assume youve had experience with teenagers on drugs too much jenny marsh nodded as she led him out of the dialysis unit and through a frosted glass door with a cardboard sign taped onto it that read palm beach county drug abuse research studygrant authorized personnel only croaker found himself in one of two windowless rooms crammed with zinctopped lab tables covered with bunsen burners banks of autoclaves and centrifuges and microscopes behind these were neat rows of test tubes retorts pipettes glass slides eyedroppers and precisely tagged glass bottles of chemical reagents a single electron microscope hulked in one corner this paraphernalia made him vaguely uneasy it could not help but remind him of morgues he had been in escorting relatives or close friends of murder victims making painful and traumatic identification while he stood by stoic and for the moment helpless against one wall was a row of stainlesssteel cabinets along with an outmoded refrigerator and a small table laden with a hot plate coffeemaker paper cups jars of cremora and the like theres a drug abuse research study going on jenny marsh said its county funded but because the hospitals involved i volunteered to oversee it dont you already have enough on your plate doctor jenny marsh smiled it was a nice smile that caused her physicians cool mask to slip just a fraction yes i do but this studys important frankly id rather be a part of it than sleep croaker watched the lab assistant hed seen in rachels cubicle come in presumably with her blood and go into the other room while there was activity here it was far calmer than in the ccd as soon as rachel was diagnosed as a drug od blood and urine samples were taken for the study dr marsh said its being done twice a day her contribution to the study is very helpful and i promise you the amounts of blood withdrawn will not affect her in any way matty said okay once the value of the program was explained to her dr marsh said croaker nodded its fine by me then okay first things first jenny marsh went to the table with the coffeepot rachel was brought in through emergency she was exhibiting all the classic signs of drug overdose croaker said what she was confused highly agitated hallucinating dr marsh nodded as she poured coffee for them both all of the above plus she was having seizures with severe vomiting in between in the attending physicians opinion she was clearly in shock she looked at him black cream blacks fine he said she methodically put four packs of sugar into the dark and unreadable waters of her coffee then she handed him a paper cup dr niguel the attending tried to revive rachel without success at this point he dispatched one of the nurses to talk to your sisterwho had brought rachel into see if she could tell him what sort of drugs rachel was into dr marshs gaze turned sympathetic im afraid thats when mrs duke freaked out croaker put his cup down what do you mean she freaked out dr marsh perched on the edge of a backless lab stool she went into hysterics said she wanted her daughter back that shed sue us up and down for malpractice that her daughter had never taken drugs in her life and we were a bunch of incompetents to insinuate otherwise but she was wrong she was wrong dr marsh crossed her arms over her breasts at the tender age of fifteen your niece is a habitual drug user how bad was she shooting thats the good news the only good news im afraid dr marsh sipped her coffee we found no evidence of needle tracks coke uppers pot were her thing blood work confirmed this she sighed then according to dr niguel her kidneys started to shut down in emergency they were looking for signs of bacterial endocarditis which is an infection you find in needle drug users right infection of the heart valves causes blood clots that can break off and go to the brainor the kidneys he put aside the coffee the acid was doing unpleasant things to the lining of his stomach or maybe it was the subject of their conversation this was his niece they were talking about not someone off the inner city streets but rachel didnt have bacterial endocarditis no dr marsh got up rummaged through the old refrigerator she sniffed at an open container of yogurt then used a forefinger to taste it you want anything a million dollars the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound when she gave him a wry look he said but nothing from in there smart man you have to be a doctor who hasnt eaten in thirtyodd hours to be desperate enough to ingest this stuff jenny marsh closed the refrigerator door a renal ultrasound revealed no trace of polycystic kidneys the most typical problem for young people its hereditary she took some more yogurt with a plastic spoon but the ultrasound did reveal something interesting at this time dr niguel called me in i determined her blood pressure was dangerously low and there was a serious lack of oxygen in her kidney nephrotoxic poisoning bingo but you said kidney as in singular dr marsh ate her yogurt slowly and methodically savoring it as if it were manna from heaven thats the anomaly the renal ultrasound showed us your niece was born with only one functioning kidney the other is shriveled nonfunctional did you get her medical history dr marsh nodded after i got her started on dialysis i asked mrs duke for rachels family doctor his names ronald stanskyhes in west palm while youre here youll surely run into him he seems genuinely concerned she swiped her fingers around the inside of the container gathering the last of the yogurt anyway dr stansky knew nothing about the one kidney but thats hardly surprising unless rachel had had renal trouble in the past theres no way he would have known or had cause to check and she hadnt no croaker thought this sequence of events over in his mind until he could picture everything that had happened step by step the process served to settle him down his emotions were so roiled they threatened to impair his reasoning that wouldnt do anyone any good especially rachel in the other room a phone began to ring i want to know what i can do he said youve made it clear her conditions very bad and i he paused to take a breath as a painful image of rachel lying unconscious and helpless not twenty yards away blazed in his mind jesus i just found her again and take your time dr marsh said softly for the first time he noticed her eyes seemed to change color with the light from green to hazel this is a large dose of emotion to deal with at once i know a lab tech stuck her head in told her there was a phone call and dr marsh mouthed not now to croaker she said i want to be sure youre with me completely for this croaker nodded im okay its just that her lifes just beginning the thought of her spending the rest of it on dialysiswell its going to take some getting used to if only it were that simple croaker felt as if he were in free fall what do you mean jenny marsh leaned forward the kidney needs to be replaced pronto a cold pool was forming in the pit of croakers stomach why normally dialysis would work but in rachels case there are complications her face grew grim and determined and croaker had the terrible suspicion that theyd entered the final phase of this nightmarish conversation like what shes developed sepsis an infection from the catheter not in this hospital and definitely not in my section she said when she passed out she fell i suspect the sepsis developed from the wound the attending in emergency was quite rightly concentrating on the renal failure the wound was treated later she put the empty yogurt container aside this is why i wanted to get you away from your niece and your sister mrs duke is going to need your cool head in the days and weeks to come you see ive tried several times to fully explain rachels situation to her but she just wont listen tell me then croaker said with a certain sense of dread she took a quick breath the dialysis machine is washing her blood doing the work of her kidney thats true enough if we can stabilize her but the hard truth is shes far from stabilized now in the meantime were having difficulty controlling the sepsis its sapping her last reserves of strength croaker stared at her bottom line jenny marsh was not one to flinch from hard truths without an immediate kidney transplant shell die immediate the cold pool spread up into his abdomen and chest how long dr marsh shrugged now that becomes a matter of medical interpretation this medical professional says two weeks maybe three no more she said this in a clear steady voice while looking him straight in the eye he appreciated that doctor tell me something how good are you im the best she said it flatly as a statement of fact there seemed no ego involved at all my advice to your sister was to get a secondeven a third opinionif she desired she did and both doctors concurred with my prognosis you can speak to them if you wish but the bottom line is rachel has got to have a new kidney would you be the one to put it in her dr marsh nodded most assuredly okay then we get her one jenny marsh sighed ruefully yes the ideal scenario is for a sisterpreferably a twinto donate his or her kidney there are no other siblings in this family ive tested mrs duke she isnt compatible youll test me of course jenny marsh nodded asap but i have to be honest the chances of a match arent good your sisters already been screened and rejected okay say she cant use one of mine give me another alternative every kidney that becomes available for transplant in this coun try is typed the report is then put online at the national computer center of unos in richmond virginia the united network of organ sharing registers each and every organ there are no exceptions organs are harvested but there are never enough for the growing list of recipients if anyones to blame its our fellow man people just dont want to donate its tragic ill give you one example close to home last year we had thirtyfive thousand deaths in palm beach county alone if all those people had been organ donors rachel and others in dire need like her all across the country wouldnt have a problem but we do have a problem croaker said yes dr marsh nodded and its an insoluble one im afraid theres a waiting list for a kidney of about thirtysix thousand people nationally also theres a case for need rachels young which is in her favor but shes a drug user which is definitely not in terms of time were looking at between sixteen and twentyfour months at the earliest croaker rocked backward as if he had been slapped across the face christ this cant be happening it isnt possible im afraid it is dr marsh said in one way weve become lucky with kidneys theyre the only major organ we are able to keep alive outside the host body with a perfusion machine you chill it to thirtytwo degrees centigrade and pump belzer solution through it believe it or not its a potato starch compound its a real medical breakthrough you can even do it on a braindead body just pump the chilled solution into the abdominal cavity that way youve got seventytwo hours before the kidney becomes compromised but in rachels case this breakthrough does us no good at all croaker tried not to sound bitter unless you can pull strings i dont know about and get her a kidney he leaned forward doc cant you you know pull strings she looked at him for a minute and he thought he saw a flicker of pity in her eyes this isnt city hall you dont pull strings to get a new kidney not unless you have a hundred million dollars to donate to renal research and even then its more a matter of luck than anything else as i told you each kidney is registered if ior any other doctor in this countryis caught putting an unregistered organ into a patient its not only our license thats forfeit its our freedom the acts illegal croakers biomechanical hand curled into a powerful fist but theres got to be a way he said jenny marsh silently regarded that curious and singular weapon with the respect it merited unless you can come up with a donor whos willing and whose blood type and hlahuman lymphocitic antigensare compatible with rachels im afraid there isnt did matty tell you i was a detective in the nypd croaker said yes she did ill find rachie a donor then the look on her face registered whatre my odds i can tell you from experience there arent many people around willing to give up a kidney at least a kidney in decent shape but even if you did find someone their blood type and three of six of their hlas would have to match rachels body chemistry croaker was shaken all over again christ id have as much chance of winning the florida lottery she shook her head sorrowfully mr croaker if it werent for bad odds youd have no odds at all speaking of which soniavillalobos was having a very bad day indeed when she got up that morning she discovered that the power was off it flickered on just long enough for her to take a shower before it died again in the mornings light she carefully made the bed smoothing down corners and edges that were ruffled she was forced to break out her emergency equipment a batterypowered hair drier she did her makeup sitting in her car with the door open the sun streaming through the tinted windows would have otherwise destroyed her color sense mrs leyes emerged from the house next door and sonia leaned out the car door to complain about the power outage estrella leyes a paraguayan from the hill country stopped to hand over a casserole covered with aluminum foil for nestor she kissed sonia warmly on both cheeks with her only daughter long moved away she had come to look on sonia as a surrogate hes better she asked hopefully unfortunately hes not sonia put away her hair drier you should have him come see me mrs leyes said sonia smiled and patted the older womans arm i would but hes gotten to the point where he cant get out of the house ўay pobre then i should come see him that would be nice sonia said but i dont know what good it would do nestors dying from where sonia lived in el portal it was not more than twelve minutes due south to work however three days a week she made a detour off ne second avenue to look in on her friend nestor had been a professional dancer a young man with a beautiful sinuous body his work had been ethereal so it was doubly a crime that he was dying of aids she often brought him food she made or when too busy that she bought at the thai restaurant down the road nestor loved thai food he didnt care much for estrellas goat casseroles but sonia had the good sense never to tell the older woman that today she discovered nestor lying in bed facing the wall the sheets were an unholy mess and she spent forty minutes cleaning him up he was in one of his unresponsive moods so while she worked she recited poems by rudyard kipling shed read them to him so many times they were committed to memory he loved the precise cadences of kiplings nineteenthcentury mind and he responded to the profound sense of mystery kipling must surely have felt for the exotic places to which he traveled her heart broke to leave nestor alone but in truth there was nothing more she could do for him and she was already late for work lord constantine fine imports on ne fortieth street in the design district of miami was a twostory persimmoncolored building with a gated courtyard filled with palms and hibiscus trees she got into the office and hit her desk running as one of three partners she was in charge of buying from the south american and mexican export companies which accounted for threequarters of lord constantines highend furniture and accessories business consequently there were an alarming number of urgent calls she had to make she was so busy she didnt have time to brief her assistant on the afternoons appointments sonia liked to have just the right furnishings displayed for her best decorator clients at twelvethirty just as her stomach was starting to growl like a lion at feeding time carol her assistant stuck her head in the door sorry she said but i just got a call from florida power and light you were having power outages sonia nodded she was still wondering whether to show ellen wright her first appointment the precolumbian head that had just arrived this morning well theyve got to get into your place okay make an appointment for they say now her assistants freckled face held an expression of regret there seems to be some kind of royal screwup that has to do with the gas lines and they say it cant wait sonia cursed under her breath there went her afternoon okay tell them ill be right there oh and carol please cancel mrs wright then take a look at my calendar ill phone you with an update as soon as i get a handle on how long im going to be hopefully you wont have to cancel anyone else it had begun to rain as sonia drove home not just rain but a south florida torrent dropping out of a roiling charcoal sky the rank smell of tropical vegetation turned the air to soup thunder boomed and rolled and the lines of cars on the road threw off thick sprays of water instead of work she found herself thinking about lew croaker she longed to call him promised herself she would as soon as she had a spare moment she liked him a lot which surprised her first of all she hardly knew him wary at heart it usually took her a while to warm up to a man second of all he was anglo oh but not just any anglo she reminded herself he knew latinos appreciated their culture plus he wasnt a muy macho pig like so many men shed met she was surprised that even though the power was still out in her house she heard the tv from estrellas next door mr leyes had been a lineman for bell south hed been paralyzed falling off a pole and now he stayed home all day and watched espn shed forgotten to return the umbrella to the car where she usually kept it so she got soaked running from the side carport to her front door her house was neat and freshly painted a white onestory with tile roof and stucco facade dating back to the s its trim was a shade of very pale blue that seemed indigenous to el portal she ran past the cement seahorses holding up a cracked fountain that no longer worked past a dripping lemon tree and thick nightblooming jasmine now whipped by the wind and bent by the rain she went up the steps to the covered porch then took a look around where the hell was fpl just like the utilities to cry emergency then be late showing up she decided to wait for them inside the warm vivid tropical colors with which shed decorated were muted in the gloom rain pelted the windowpanes sheeting down the glass another roll of thunder boomed and echoed outside she went through the living room and into the small kitchen out of habit she opened the refrigerator but she saw nothing appealing inside she went into her bedroom and turned on the batterypowered bedside radio gloria estefan crooned in spanish which was followed by a very sexy afrocuban number by machito the cubop was in twofour time and she merengued into the bathroom a plastic bubble skylight lent what little illumination there was and she leaned over the sink peering at herself in the mirror she started what was that her gaze flicked to a corner of the mirror what had she seen there a shadow moving must have been a car passing outside she thought her gaze returning to her own reflection in the bedroom the music had stopped an announcer was reading an ad for a latin party jam in south beach this saturday it sounded cool she wondered whether croaker would go with her if she asked him she hoped he would getting hot and sweaty with him would be a treat the more she thought about him the more she wanted to see him he was awfully sexy her thoughts drifted to them dancing the merengue at the shark bar before his poor sister had popped up out of nowhere sonia remembered how he held her how he moved with her and her breath grew hot in her throat she started she saw it again now she was sure there was movement behind hereither in the bedroom or beyond in the living room for a long time she did not move her gaze flicked from one side of the mirror to the other scrutinizing the wedge of the interior she could see in reflection she did not want to turn around yet did not want to give any overt sign that she had seen something amiss she was not frightened but she was wary shed had a gymfreak boyfriend about a year ago who was paranoid about urban violence hed shown her a trick or two about selfdefense and after that she hadnt been afraid of getting into her car at night or even driving to the nearby eleven at three in the morning for milk or sugar the night crawlers who hung out there didnt bother her but this was her home was someone in the living room she turned and as calmly as she was able went back into the bedroom she stood there for a long breathless moment scanning the gloom hello she thought anybody there she felt herself give a little shiver a male voice was spewing out the news in rapidfire spanish none of it was good she stared at the telephone which was on a nightstand on the far side of the bed her knees felt suddenly weak and she sank to the bed as she did so she glanced into the living room at this new angle she saw something that made her heart leap into her throat there was a darkly glistening puddle on the wood floor of the dining alcove rainwater but she hadnt been near the dining alcove from this position a wall protruded out blocking off most of that small space someone could be standing there waiting could it be one of the electrical linemen but then why didnt he say something there was more urgency inside her now and she sprawled across the bed reaching for the phone the bitter taste of fear was in her mouth and now her only thought was to call she felt the shock wave of air coming her way even as she lifted the receiver darkness like a great shadow bloomed on her right side and the bed rocked as someone hit her full force she screamed as she went flying the receiver bounced on the bed spun away from her as she hit the floor on her back a weight like a sixhundredpound gorilla pressed painfully onto her breasts and rib cage immobilizing her at the same time something soft and perfumed and very familiar enveloped her face it pushed down making breathing difficult then impossible it was her pillow someone was trying to smother her she opened her mouth to scream but cottoncovered down filled it her jaws were thrust wide open by the terrible pressure and she began to choke something dark and primitive went off in her brain like a roman candle and she began to thrash wildly with arms and legs it was too little too late breath caught in her throat and she began to gag but she did not give up her clawed hands raked and scraped flesh until a powerful grip pinioned her wrists against the floor she heard a voice hiss cuidado be careful you know this she must not be damaged in any way it was a spanish dialect that seemed awfully familiar to her where had she heard it before then she had it bennies grandfather that strange and sometimes frightening man had used it on occasion it was curious the minutia the mind could latch onto at such moments she recalled bennies grandfathera tall stoopshouldered man with craggy brows and a thick pure white mustachewith a preternatural clarity smoking one of his aromatic handrolled cigars he seemed to hover in the air he was whispering to her in his dialect and she knew he was trying to tell her something vital she cried out in her desperation to hear him but she could not life was escaping her with each beat of her heart she tried to take a ragged breath through the wadding that filled her mouth but to no avail her lungs were on fire and when she gagged again acidic vomit filled her throat and she spiraled downward bennies grandfather had disappeared on the shark bars dance floor she merengued with lew croaker the sensual beat throbbed through her insinuating itself into her very bones she looked into his eyes and melted she was weeping for joy i want you she said in her mind as she died by late afternoon croaker felt drained hed given blood to dr marsh for hla typing hed interviewed dr niguel to see if he had any further insight into rachels condition when she was admitted to emergency and hed spent more time with matty and rachel at last he took a breather outside in the hospitals parking lot and used his cell phone to call his charter office at the marina he had them cancel his appointments for the next several weeks between the money he had been paid by the feds for his work after hed left the nypd and the successful investments hed made over the years he didnt need the income from the fishing charter in order to live he did it because it gave him pleasure hed just hung up when the cell phone chirped hello silence no not quite he could hear a quick catch of breath lew yes this is maria maria it took him a moment to orient himself bennies maria hola maria como ests do you know where sonia lives el portal yes she told me we need you here we maria whats the matter his throat seemed to fill up with alarm whats happened croaker heard a muffled sound she was sobbing maria are you in el portal are you at sonias he realized he was shouting please it was a kind of moan now croaker was already running toward his tbird croaker made the ninetyminute trip from palm beach to the upper reaches of miami in sixtyfive minutes he was lucky in that what obviously had been a torrential downpour here had petered out to a fine drizzle he whipped down i at such speed that he missed the ninetyfifth street exit cursing under his breath he got off at seventyninth street went east to ne second avenue and turned left through the northern end of little haiti just past jacky jacksons relax barber shop he crossed over the little river canal into the peaceful pretty enclave of el portal by that time the rain had stopped altogether and sparks of bright late afternoon sunlight were piercing swiftly scudding clouds he drove down streets lined with small neat onefamily houses of stucco or brick face over cement block painted the soothing tones of the caribbean banyans vied with citrus trees for curbside space and here and there vivid sprays of bougainvillea and tree hibiscus seemed newly scrubbed in dazzling sunlight bennies black humvee was easy to spot and croaker pulled in beside it for almost anyone else outside hollywood the hummer would have been a kind of absurd overkill not for bennie the us army vehicle was armor plated with bulletproof glass and special door locks that could not be jimmied in his line of work it was something of a necessity when croaker got out of his tbird he saw someone sitting in the hummers front passengers seat the windows were rolled down and he walked over maria was sitting stiffbacked in the seat she must have heard the scrape of his shoe soles against the cement of the sidewalk because her head jerked around her eyes were wide and staring croaker stopped beside the open window maria im here for an eerie instant she did not move or even blink i called bennie hes here too she spoke as if she were oblivious to the fact that she was sitting in his vehicle he put his hands on the window frame maria digame whats happened is sonia all right she gave no reply lewis at the sound of bennies voice croaker looked up he saw bennie coming around the side of a white house with pale blue trim he recognized it from sonias description it was her house bennie slapped his palms together getting rid of dirt and leaf debris in a pale linen suit he looked overdressed for rooting around on the ground there was a peculiar look on his face as he came up to where croaker stood somehow that look sent a chill down croakers spine listen to me bennie said quietly turn around and get out of here she shouldnt have called you this is bullshit bennie whats going on go home bennie said i dont want you involved im already involved croaker said you saw to that yourself when you introduced me to sonia pearl in the oyster remember yo recuerdo lewis bennies gaze searched his face digame whats this all about nothing good bennie gestured and they moved away from maria and the humvee at approximately three this afternoon maria gets a call from sonias assistant at lord constantine fine imports this woman is kinda you know freaked someone from fpl calls the office saying they need access to sonias house and she leaves the office just past twelvethirty by like three shes missed an appointment hasnt phoned in as promised the assistant tries numerous times to call here but cant get through bennies gaze flicked past croaker to check on maria sitting still as a statue in the hummer he looked back to croaker thats when she calls fpl get this they have no record of a problem calling the office or dispatching a crew thats when the assistant phones maria with a sinking feeling in his stomach croaker said you check the power bennie nodded i just came from there he jerked his head someone cut the lines into the house one clip very clean professional job you see anything else footprints any other kinds of impressions the ground looks kind of marshy from the downpour i didnt notice croaker lifted his chin toward the hummer you got any electricians tape in there bennie looked at him for a moment then went loping back to the hummer he checked on maria while he rummaged under the drivers seat in a moment he was back with a roll of black tape they took a quick reconnoiter around the house croaker could see no sign of footprints but at one point he got down on one knee to show bennie what appeared to be a run of parallel lines bruising the wet and glistening grass these mean anything to you bennie shook his head they came upon the cut line i dont feature sticking my head into a dark oven without knowing whose hand is on the pilot light croaker said using the polycarbonate part of his biomechanical hand to ground the live ends he spliced the line with electricians tape when he rose he took a deep breath i think wed better try to get inside front door its locked but thats no problem bennie dangled a set of keys on a chain from one finger maria brought the spare set sonia gave her okay then croaker turned toward the front of the house lets go bennies hand on his arm stopped him in his tracks bennies eyes were dark and very sad lewis we may be heading into a crime scene i cant i wont ask this of you you wont have to were friends theres nothing more to say one thing only shadows from the lowering sun shrouded bennie making him seem part of the coming darkness remember when i told you i sensed something out there waiting croaker nodded but if this is it he said i recall you saying it was waiting for us bennie gave a sharp jerk of his head bueno together they went swiftly across the lawn past the fountain held aloft by stone seahorses up the steps and onto the porch in front of the door croaker said you get that thirtyeight replaced yet bennie drew a smith wesson from a shoulder holster and dropped the keys into croakers palm with a constriction in his throat croaker opened the door immediately bennie pushed past him into the gloom of the small house he could hear bennies soft footfalls hurrying across the mexican tiles of the foyer croaker went in after him and switched on the lights the bright tropical colors of the living room seemed to leap at them the room was neat and clean and inviting nothing out of place here croaker paused at the edge of the dining alcove staring down at what the flashlight beam illuminated bennie look at this see the last residue of water shining someone had to stand here for this much rainwater to accumulate either sonia or someone else bennie was breathing softly but energetically like a powerful engine at idle they turned on the lights as they went methodically through the house they checked the only closed door in the hall on the way into the bedroom found linens and towels neatly stacked by color and pattern next came a bathroom the guest bedroom then they went into sonias bedroom bennie stepped into the master bathroom quickly emerged shaking his head nada croaker swung around took a hard second look at the bedspread at first glance it appeared as if it had been neatly made but then as he noticed the repeat on the pattern he could see that it was rucked in one direction it was like an arrow pointing to the phone on its night table looking at the bedspread again it seemed to him as if someone lying on it had reached for the phone wriggling their body in the processor else been dragged across it croaker walked around the foot of the bed to the far side bennie peered over his shoulder whatre you looking for i dont know croaker admitted as he carefully examined the carpet kneeling by the side of the bed he plucked a small clump of hairs that had been embedded in the fibers of the carpet as if by a grinding motion they were the right color and length to be sonias judging by the roots theyd been ripped from her head he rose and reaching out with his biomechanical hand plucked a stainlesssteel nail at a place where the pillow was exposed as if the bed had been hurriedly remade sonia was a neat freak wasnt she bennie nodded wordlessly he seemed fascinated by croakers examination using one stainlesssteel nail croaker gingerly lifted the bedspread away from the pillows the one on his side was slightly askew he saw lipstick smears over its center what the hell bennie said looking closer croaker spotted a couple of eyelashes sticking to the pillowcase he let the pillow fall back as he looked around the bedroom so where is she bennie whispered croaker pointed to the closet bennie had replaced the lost with a with the gun at the ready he flipped the door open nothing but clothes on racks and shoes neatly lined in rows on the floor croaker looked out the window her car still in the carport bennie said i checked it out croaker looking down at the small answering machine hit the messages button with a stainlesssteel fingernail the tape began to play two hang ups then a male voice said sweetheart its nestor so looking forward to seeing you in the morning love you for it but you might as well eat the food yourself this boy isnt feeling any better but hey what the fuck ive got to make the best of it right love you bye for now this would be before the power went off bennie said right sounds like sometime last night croaker looked at bennie whos nestor this was the last call before the power was cut nestors a dancer bennie said or at least he was until he got aids now hes dying slowly an sonias made him like her pet project noting bennies tone croaker looked up you disapprove its like the proximity issue bennie made a face you know man its not a pretty thing no kidding croaker said think how nestor feels he tapped the top of the answering machine you know where this guy lives nah but try sonias speeddialer hes on there you can ask him yourself sure enough bennie was right croaker wrote down nestors number then they retraced their steps through the house the kitchen was the only room they hadnt been in yet croaker stopped in the open doorway flipped the switch cold fluorescent light flickered on and he stared wideeyed it appeared as if the entire contents of the refrigerator were lined up in neat rows along the countertops cartons of milk and orange juice bottles of jam and ketchup and mustard plastic containers holding leftovers a tub of butter the rows were arranged in ascending height every edge was perfectly aligned what the hell is this bennie said croaker was afraid he might already know bennie shook his head all this stuff from inside the refrigerator why was it taken out you think sonia did this for a very long time croaker did nothing he stared at the refrigerator door bennie seeing where he was looking said jesus he passed a hand briefly across his eyes go on amigo weve come this far it didnt pay to think too much not at this juncture croaker closed his titanium and steel fingers around the oldfashioned handle and pulled the door swung open and he saw an interior totally devoid of food the side walls had been smeared with blood on one was painted a triangle inside a circle on the other a dot within a square the shelves themselves had been rearranged to make room for the one item which sat inside an item about the size of a twentypound turkey but one not normally found in anyones refrigerator croaker tried to close his ears to the slow dripdripdrip of blood a good size pool had already formed on the bottom shelf it came from sonias head and neck which had been very neatly severed from the rest of her pale hazel eyes opened wide in a fixed expression of fullblown terror back in the bedroom croaker walked slowly around until he stood in the open doorway to the bathroom someone standing in that spot in the alcove where the rainwater is you couldnt see him from here he walked along the side of the bed as sonia had done hours earlier not from here either bennie looked at him if thats where the killer stood he chose the perfect spot to watch her croaker ignored the sudden chill that went through him smart too he didnt leave any footprints he must have left his shoes outside he pointed to the pillowcase with sonias lipstick smears and eyelashes this is how she was killed bennie came over for a closer look smothered you mean croaker nodded that pillow over her face pushed down hard sonia was no weakling it had to be someone with a great deal of strength or more than one someone bennie added right croaker said he pointed to the spot between them where he had plucked the clump of sonias hairs from the carpet he could picture her as she lay there helpless the back of her head being ground into the carpet dying he felt what he always felt at the scene of a murder as if a vise were squeezing something vital out of his heart she died right here he said bennies right hand curled into a fist blood seemed to have surged into his neck and cheeks he gave an inarticulate cry then lurched out of the bedroom bennie croaker caught up with him in the kitchen bennie was reaching into the refrigerator croakers blood ran cold just what the hell dyou think youre doing i apologize but i have no intention of leaving her head here for strangers to find bennie was taking the head out of the refrigerator as he did so he averted his gaze from sonias head or the bloody symbols croaker wondered bennie began to wrap the head with extreme tenderness in the first of the three towels hed taken from the linen closet in the hall i wont allow sonia to suffer that indignity croaker curled his biomechanical fingers around bennies wrist bennies head came around and he glared at croaker with eyes suddenly the color of flame escuchame seor men have perished for that what about friends amigas know better then you have friends without backbones croaker took a step forward tell me bennie is this really about sonias dignity yes but croaker would not back down and he would not be bluffed perhaps it was just this toughness that appealed so profoundly to bennie at length his mouth twisted in a parody of a smile let me go lewis and we will speak of it he watched as croaker slowly and very deliberately unfurled his fingers one by one with so little effort you could have ground to powder every bone in my wrist his voice had about it a disarming lassitude as if he were speaking of inconsequential matters while basking in the sun you would have caused me great pain and no little inconvenience now he did smile and as he did so he revealed the he had drawn but i would have shot you in the belly then i could have done anything to you lewis anything at all there was a terrible stillness in the air as if all at once the oxygen had been sucked from the room by some monstrous creature that had appeared out of nowhere bennie shrugged but this is no way for friends to talkor even to think maybe youre right croaker said or maybe you have a screwedup idea of friendship bennie jamming the gun back into its holster threw his hands wide what are you pissed lewis now we are no longer friends croaker stared at him bennie nodded okay okay you made your fuckin point god hears me you got the cojones of a latino he stuck out his hand let no bad blood begin here when croaker took it he squeezed it with obvious affection i wasnt lying i got this thing bout deathits got to be treated with a certain degree of respect otherwisehe shruggedthe spirit that lives on is clouded with uncertainty he waved a hand but youre right thats not the whole story he shook his head no way im gonna let the police get clued in bout this lewis their interference i cannot allow unequivocally this is why i told you to leave why i didnt want you to become involved hey bennie wake the hell up this is the scene of a major crime youre messing with croaker said youd better have a damn fine explanation bennie gave him an evil grin the electrical line the pillow the answering machine i seem to remember you doing your share of tampering he calmly resumed folding the towels over sonias head but to be less argumentative my fuckin business is explanations beneath the razzledazzle ripostes he seemed immensely relieved that croaker made no move to stop him this time give me one then i never do anything without just cause remember that he opened several kitchen drawers in turn rummaging through them at length he came up with a roll of twine you use to truss up chickens or turkeys for roasting as sure as were amigos i know who killed her he began to bind the package with the twine thats why sonias murder must be kept between the two of us he looked up at croaker an when you hear the history of it i religiously believe youll agree with me maria freaked out when bennie told her about sonia they took her back to bennies place a nineteenroom extravaganza built in the venetian palazzo style overlooking the intracoastal on fortyninth street in miami beach not two blocks from the eden roc hotel across the water on collins avenue the place was exhausting there were seven bedroomsone presumably for each night of the weekall with openair whirlpools there was a europeanstyle library a billiards room a fully automated film screening theater a stoneencased wine cellar even a louvered cigar patio off the formal dining room it had water frontage with a landing stage guarded by ornate stone winged lions that appeared flown whole from the grand canal in venice tied up to it was a sleek midnight blue cigarette one of those sexy boats built for speed and nothing else croaker and bennie walked out onto the dock the lush deco colors of sunset dappled the intracoastal far out over the southern ocean the last remnants of the afternoons thunderstorm hung against the horizon like a black and impenetrable curtain a soft breeze ruffled their hair washed their faces with sea salt all across south florida it was a time for easy drinking and if you were a fisherman talk of the days exploits though he had an icecold corona in his hand croaker did not feel like drinking the days events gnawed at his heart bennie deposited the large round package under his arm into the cigarette the doctor he had summoned a small balding colombian with a thin mustache that did not quite cover a harelip ministered to maria behind the closed doors of one of the many upstairs bedrooms croaker stared at the carefully wrapped package rolling with the waves of the intracoastal now sonias head was here and with bennies call to her partners at lord constantine that she was attending to a family emergency there was no reason for anyone to suspect foul play there was something even weirder than finding the decapitated head croaker said at length deep aquamarine water could be glimpsed through the carved stanchions of the stone balustrade it seemed a symbol of purity in which the cigarettes cargo had been unceremoniously dropped bennie took out a cigar and went through the ritual of lighting up yeah then i missed it cause it wasnt there no blood bennie how come she was smothered by a pillow in her bedroom a flash of sonias long legs spun through croakers consciousness like a shining lure thats just been struck by a game fish he felt a wave of intense sadness mixed with anger at how her life had been cut short we find her head in the fridge and the only bloods dripping from it theres not a speck inside the house bennie continued to smoke staring out at the light of day slowly being extinguished the killer didnt have a lot of time croaker continued so what did he do after he smothered her we know he didnt decapitate her inside the house but there were those two parallel marks bennie said suppose he dragged her outside an did her there croaker shook his head uhuh we checked the outside except for those two parallel marks there was nothing no blood no viscera no bits of skin or bone besides doing it outsides too risky a neighbor or a passerby could see him so what the hell happened bennie asked i have no idea croaker was abruptly overwhelmed by an image of sonias surprised and happy face as he merengued with her across the dance floor at the shark bar part of him marveled at the calm with which he was dissecting the last few hours events another part of him was ashamed bennie must have had some inkling of what was happening he kept his own counsel as croaker turned away taking a deep breath croaker leaned against the balustrade and watched a white fishing boat plying the dark purling waters of the intracoastal as it passed its wake sent wavelets sloshing against the wooden pylons so that the cigarette rolled at its berth he could see stone tree limned against the kind of lime and orange sunsets you got only in the keys the seminole was aft in the small boat as he navigated it through the mangrove islets do you see it he said croaker thought he was going to point but he didnt i dont see anything croaker replied its getting dark stone tree had said not for me telling croaker as much as he needed to know the doctor emerged from bennies house came down the marble stairs to join them marias resting easily now he said in spanish shes obviously had a difficult time he knew better than to ask the cause of her shock with what i gave her shell sleep deeply and chances are when she wakes up shell be fine if not a card appeared between his fingers and bennie took it this is the name of a friend of mine hes a counselor if your friend is in need he tapped his mustache as if it had tilted out of place you have my assurance that he is the soul of discretion bennie showed the doctor out to the part of the carpark where his emerald bmw stood beside the hummer and croakers tbird croaker saw no money change hands that was not how bennie did business debt was amassed and discharged in intangible ways favors influence accommodations were the invisible but potent coin of his realm bennie disappeared into the house presumably to look in on maria watching the lights coming on along the strand of collins avenue croaker wondered just what his friendship with bennie and sonia had gotten him into suddenly shockingly he felt that the moment he had crossed over the little river canal this afternoon he had become part of bennies shadowy world and he did not yet know what that might entail he only had the unsettling presentiment that everything in his life had changed shaking off this evil feeling he used his cell phone to place three calls to friends in different sectors of the federal government two were unavailable and he left detailed messages on their voice mail the third answered and after hearing about the desperate plight rachel was in transferred the call to a doctor pal of his at walter reed hospital the doctor pretty much reiterated what jenny marsh had told croaker major organs are in hellishly short supply he said and because shes a user im afraid her chances of jumping the line are nil he paused the one good thing is shes in very capable hands i know dr marsh by reputation and shes firstrate if theres a way to save your niece you can be sure shell find it but if the situation is as you have described it he sighed i wish i had better news for you mr croaker right now i dont think theres anything anyone can do except pray for a miracle croaker thanked the doctor and hung up he immediately dialed a local number then entered his anticartel task force access code as a freelance without official ties to the actf he was given a temporary code each time he was hired apparently the last code still worked because he received clearance he punched in wade forrests extension croaker had worked with forrest before in actf he was fairly high up in the organization and rising unlike croaker who was a sporadically used freelancer forrest was a career man to the core though hed come to miami from washington for a specific mission hed opted to stay on croaker didnt necessarily like forresthe was loud overbearing and something of a bully but croaker respected him he was loyal the first rule that croakers father had taught him in law enforcement was that loyalty was the one commodity you couldnt buy borrow or steal forrest wasnt answering his line which was not surprising out in the field most likely what was surprising however was that no human voice came on the line as far as croaker knew the actf field offices were manned twentyfour hours hours a day in fact croaker thought he heard the distant clicks and whirs he associated with an automatic call switching device perhaps it was just his imagination because a moment later wade forrests recorded voice led him through the standard voice mail menu he left a most urgent message maybe just maybe forrest had connections with unos but hed have to speak to him to find out he disconnected just as bennie returned his friend was carrying a small zippered flight bag okay bennie its time for a little showandtell bennie nodded bueno he rolled the cigar meditatively between his lips time an place lewis in my business they are everything bending over he stowed the flight bag in the cigarette then deftly slipped the aft line jumped down into the boat andale muchacho he said we have important business on the atlantic as croaker stepped into the boat bennie scrambled to let go the bow line then back in the shallow cockpit he fired the powerful engines the cigarette gave a throaty roar and a puff of blue diesel smoke as bennie turned her out into the intracoastal the party lights of miami beach swept by on their left croaker could see a long line of white limos disgorging a festive wedding party into the gargantuan lobby of the eden roc hotel flashbulbs popped like sunspots and there was a burst of wild applause as the bride pirouetted around the grinning groom for the kneeling photographers the bride who looked like a model sleek in fitted white satin and organza reminded him of sonia he had a terrible flash of the models head bouncing like a gaily striped beachball down the staircase of the eden roc while flashbulbs fired like cannons taking a deep breath he wrenched his attention away bennie veered off to starboard heading at low speed for the outlet into biscayne bay this far south you needed to take the bay to pick up the channel between the tip of miami beach and fisher island in order to get to the atlantic ocean croaker clambered over to bennies side theres something out there waiting for us he said over the heavy thrum of the diesels isnt that what you said bennie bennie nodded close enough water churned to white froth plumed from the rear of the cigarette you know lewis theres a certain what inevitability bout life like with me being in the line of work im in ive made enemies ive been upfront bout that okay that goes with the territory but there are enemies and then there are enemies croaker could smell something like fish entrails surfacing in the intracoastal it was sharp and immediate like a hit of ammonia it made his pulse pound god hears me bennie was saying ive made enemies like that case in point there are like these two brothers antonio an heitor the bonitas an shit not jus brothers identical twins i mean to tell you lewis these cabrones are some bad motherfucking sonsofbitches bennies hands made complex patterns in the air its like how can i put it its like these bastardos popped outta their mothers womb pissed off at the world know what i mean theyre malicious as shit and whats worse they get off on it croaker eyed him what do these bonita twins have to do with sonias death a subtle change had come over bennie and croaker was struggling to figure out just what it was everything bennie said they whacked her cold i know ithe smacked the left side of his chest with the heel of his handhere thats a mighty big assumption to make but in truth croaker did not immediately disbelieve him on the contrary he had a suspicion that another piece of the enigma that was bennie milagros was about to reveal itself whatre you going onbesides pure instinct i mean spoken like a true detective bennie was chomping so hard on his cigar he was slowly making a mess of it about the bonitas god hears me i got a lot more than hunches bennie maneuvered out into biscayne bay house lights on either side lent the sky a soft magenta glow all around them the water was dark mysterious with manmade reflections this is why i cant have the cops involved it was antonio an heitor all right they whacked sonia as like some kinda warning to me what makes you so sure bennies eyes caught a cusp of the starboard running light and for one brief instant copper spun in their depths its happened before croaker didnt want to say anything at all it was like having a dangerous fish on the linesometimes all that was required of you was to let the line pay out bennie had the kind of look on his face someone would have if he was about to lie down on a bed of nails i mentioned my sister rosa didnt i croaker nodded in the parking lot of the shark bar you said she died five years ago bennies hands worked the controls and the cigarette lurched forward up on plane didnt tell you though how she died croaker grabbed a handrail as he felt the slap of the salt spray on his face bennies eyes were slitted by the wind which was quartering out of the west he broke out a pair of heavy windbreakers threw one to croaker out on the open water at night moving at speed the chill was instantly penetrating and it would only get colder once they hit the atlantic as they bounced over the calm of the bay a double line of cormorants swooped overhead like the soft flutter of a ribbon he tilted his head back watching them for a moment inscrutable black runes against an indigo sky time an place he murmured as if to himself the bonitas an i go way back lewis we grew up in the same neighborhood in asuncion just like sonia an her brother an because of this how you say affiliation they are people with whom i made a grave mistake what was that i took them on as clients bennie shook his head that was eight years ago god hears me that was the blackest day of my life he shrugged but see i was very young an you know when youre young youre like convinced you know all the secrets of the universe wisdom equates with enthusiasm it seems so simple what life can be reduced to the cigarette juddered and hummed happily as it gathered speed across the bay the expanse was dotted with islands ablaze with light in the distance croaker could see the macarthur causeway that ran from twelfth street in miami to fifth street in miami beach so you took the bonitas on as clients he said bennie adjusted their course to starboard at the approach of a boat from the opposite direction antonio an heitor are in the misery business and let me tell you theyre quite fuckin adept at it drugs white slavery arms shipments these are their true businesses in south america although they make mucho dinero in the minerals company left to them by their mother copper tin lithium beryllium theyre market movers in these ores and they do an increasing trade with the us so much so in fact that in the past two years theyve opened subsidiary offices in miami new york and washington dc bennie nodded part of their business comes from selling directly to the us government he readjusted their course to the southeast but the minerals business bores them these twins live for their fun in south america elements within the governments call on them from time to time to disappear peoplerivals political enemies intellectuals amassing too much of a following did you know what they did when you took them on as clients no but i learned very fuckin fast so what you discovered was theyre in effect assassins for hire bennie spat over the side if only thats all they were they were heading directly for the macarthur causeway south of that theyd round the tip of miami beach and head out into the atlantic see heres the thing lewis antonio an heitor they have how should i put it very specialized tastes they dont just like kill someone that wouldnt be fun at all they disappear em they warehouse them then at their leisure they spend a great deal of time having their bit of fun when its over they harvest the organs an sell em to the highest bidderusually thats a minister in the south american government or a member of a ministers family or a close personal friend or a political ally you get the picture bennie looked at croaker in this unholy fashion the bonitas have amassed something far more valuable than mere capitalthey possess the kind of power you an i merely dream about he bared his teeth in a sour grin they own people heart and soul whatever they want in south america is theirs for the taking no questions asked down there they are revered as gods except gods could never be half as evil as these two bennie swept the cigarette around a marker buoy now theyve moved their operation here lewis you see they killed sonia and took her body why do you think they did that croaker staring out at the glittering lights along the bay did not have to answer if bennie was right in all his suppositions the bonitas were harvesting her organs what if it were true for a moment he was overcome by a terrifying emotion he couldnt help but think that they must have a healthy kidney that could save rachels life could it be that somewhere in florida there was a black market in human organs then reality struck him with the force of a hammer blow and he realized what he had been thinking the stench of his own desperation disgusted him what had his father told him desperation could so easily lead to corruption what antonio and heitor had done to sonia was horror enough but his momentary response to it cut so close to the bone it laid bare his marrow it made him feel unclean unworthy to be rachels champion in that instant he felt an enmity to the bonitas so profound it wrenched his heart they had touched him deeply and personally made him for an instant vulnerable and that he could not allow croaker and bennie in the cigarette passed beneath the causeway in uneasy silence the specter of the bonitas who seemed from bennies description to be imbued with an unnatural potency hung in the night like a malevolent spirit bennie croaker said almost gently what happened with your sister what happened with rosa ah it was almost a cry of anguish ripped from bennies heart five years ago there was a particularly difficult negotiation with an american company whose market share in ores and metals would give the bonitas like licketyquick entree into the states they told me to get it for them at all costs that i tried to do but this bastard he knew how much they wanted his business an he wouldnt go for the deals i proposed one night he ran into them at a club an he laughed in their faces god hears me that pissed them off something fierce bennie took the cigarette in a breathtakingly fast arc around the tip of miami beach pale spray fountained up like the tail of a peacock they couldnt whack him cause then theyd lose what they wanted most but like i said they were born pissed at the world an now they were royally pissed they had to blame someone for the affront so they blamed me he was looking out at the inky darkness of the sea his shoulders and neck were lost within the billowing folds of the windbreaker giving him the aspect of a wary softshell turtle i hadnt done my job if i had the affront would never have taken place so they told me i was their employee but i didnt understand the true meaning of working for them so they told me his eyes squeezed shut for a moment and when they opened they were glossy with incipient tears his knuckles were white around the steering wheel they took my rosa lewis mi hermana linda they disappeared her had their ungodly fun with her an then to make sure id learned my lesson they delivered her head to my office croaker standing very close to bennie could tell he was shaking what happened then he asked softly bennie barked out a laugh as he came to a new heading they were in the atlantic now cutting through rolling swells as the wind picked up what dyou think happened i made the fuckin deal for them it was unholy i abased myself for them an got the job done like i shoulda done in the first place so they told me he shook his head ruefully so then three weeks after the deal is signed they drag this guy out of his bed an work on him for what thirtysix hours must have been at least his hearts in the president of argentina an his livers in the brother of the finance minster of brazil he paid for his affront god hears me we all fuckin paid but that was five years ago bennie croaker bracing himself more firmly jammed his freezing hands into the pockets of his windbreaker why would they start again with sonia they have long memories you know i thought they were through with me but i was wrong bennie put the cigarette full out and they thundered across the water with teethjarring bumps as they sliced through rolling wave crests he turned to croaker briefly an you know the worst part lewis the part that eats at my heart like a demon they were right about me antonio anheitor deep in my soul i didnt want to make that deal five years ago i didnt do my best i wanted out from under them i wanted the deal to fail but i didnt consider the like consequences i was sure i could outwit them when no one else could he thumped his chest with his fist i killed rosa as much as them i am to blame for her death his head whipped away you see now how life can be when youre young and know all the answers you find out quick enough lewis that you not only dont know the answers youre clueless bout which fuckin questions to ask his left hand jerked back on the throttle and the cigarette came off plane slowing the engine burbled as they rocked in the swells were here bennie said he gave croaker the wheel then pulled out the flight bag and opened it kill the engine he said all hard sound ceased in its place crept the soft susurrus of the sea they were alone on the ocean land was a thin strand of light far off on the western horizon a glow like the timealtered radiance from a distant star now this is important bennie said so pay attention he leaned forward dipped his hand in a small clay pot daubed something black across croakers forehead cheeks and chin then he did the same to himself bennie what the hell are we doing shh bennie put his forefinger to his lips we are saying goodbye to sonia thiscroaker threw his arms wideis your idea of a funeral not my idea bennie said my grandfathers he took up the towelwrapped package that was sonias head we can proceed now with the soot hiding our features no spirit will be able to recognize us and pull us down as we set sonias spirit on its journey to the other side bennie no be still he hissed this is something sacred i got from my grandfather he was a healer an he like knew things escuchame until we set sonias spirit on its path were vulnerable now to forces we cant control or understand his eyes bored into croakers es verdad lewis its the truth you ready to let the world in croaker nodded im ready covered with lines of black soot bennies face seemed strange as if his features had undergone some metamorphosis croaker put the fingertips of his right hand to his face wondering if the same thing had happened to him from out of the flight bag bennie had produced a small iron brazier listen to me lewis our world consists of three things okay natural law which has nothing to do with manmade law energy and consciousness now consciousness is what defines you an mehuman beings i mean we can reason animals cant theyre bound solely by instinct i mean we have instinct too but weve also got consciousness sometimes thats good you know we invent we striveour progress comes mainly from our consciousness but lots of times consciousness gets in the way of instinct an that amigo is no good at all you know croaker said you have a spiritual side thats both charming and surprising bennie snorted goodnaturedly i suppose thats your idea of a compliment as they spoke bennie was mixing powders poured from plastic phials he added what appeared to be dried leaves and small twigs ground them together in the bottom of the brazier out of the wind he lit the material and silently beckoned for croaker to crouch down beside him the brazier was between them croaker saw bennies nostrils dilate as he drank in the smoke and he did the same immediately he was pierced with the scents of peppermint cedar and orange as well as other odors unfamiliar pungent and earthy as chilies he drank them in like food and almost automatically his eyes closed gradually as he continued to breathe in the aromatic smoke he felt his body growing heavier and heavier as if he were becoming more sensitive to the earths gravity then there came a brief wave of dizziness and he felt as if an umbilical had been cut he was adrift as if his body had taken flight and like the cormorants high above floated on the thermals in the darkness he heard bennies voice boats are vessels for the spirits an for the dead my grandfather told me that boats had three uses for his guarani ancestors he said they all could be traced back to the migrations across the oceans the ancient peoples made the migrations were you know harder than we could ever imagine an sometimes they like took a lifetime the first use is to exorcise sickness an evil spirits the second use is to find the lost soul of a patient near death the third is to ferry the soul of the dead to the shores of the next life silence save for the lapping of the waves against the fiberglass hull of the cigarette but as in a dream the boat seemed to rock far below them part of another realm he and bennie existed as spirits around the heat of a blazing sun the sea bennie saidis the realm of the dead its vast and its wide and its depthless here begins sonias path here begins her journey through closed eyes and drugheightened senses croaker saw bennie rise and leaning out over the ocean gently deposit sonias remains into the water through closed eyes he saw the towel wrapped package bobbing on a wave crest over it spun a shape he could not define then it resolved itself into what looked like an outline of a human eye with a double iris at that instant sonias head was sucked down into a midnight black trough never to reappear croaker opened his eyes blinking bennie was sitting across from him as if he had never moved but looking around the cigarette croaker could find no trace of the towelwrapped package in a last sharp inhalation of commingled scents an image appeared in his mind for the space of a heartbeat and then winked out it was of sonia plummeting like a stone into the fastness of dark waters running with currents and certain mystery croaker slept like a dead man all the way back to bennies he dreamed of dancing with sonia they were in the dark but he knew it was the shark bar he swept her around the dance floor in long exhilarating arcs feeling her body warm and strong as an athletes coming close to him then pushed apart by the dictates of the dance steps she returned again and again to his arms and each time she did it was like a renewal another life being built from scratch her breath was warm and fragrant on his cheek and her laughter reverberated like sweet bells on a mountainside when they passed through a beam of diamondbright light it sizzled the red highlights in her hair picked out the green motes in her eyes and all at once he knew it wasnt sonia he was dancing with but jenny marsh rachels doctor she lifted a hand and made a sign that shimmered the air with gold dust an outline of a human eye with a double iris a sudden movement caught his attention and he turned to find sonias bloody head rolling down the steps of the eden roc hotel in a welter of green sea grape and translucent jellyfish out of the watery depths at the bottom of the stairs rose a mammoth tiger shark opening its jaws it engulfed all that remained of her croaker had one terrifying look into its unfathomable eye before it vanished beneath the black waves he awoke in a sweat to find the midnight blue cigarette already tied up at bennies private dock scrubbing his hands across his face he rose he wondered if hed dreamed sonias entire funeral for a moment he watched his friend hose down the cigarette bennie what exactly do the bonita twins want bennie wiped his hands on his trousers huh theyre mad as hatters who can say whats in the minds of madmen their hearts have been like burned to fuckin ash by their insanity in that event they are beyond understanding sometimes yes croaker said but sometimes madness has a purpose it used to be my job to find it they maybe want me dead bennie waved a hand forget maybedefinitely but theyre like gods you see those whom the gods destroy they first make mad they want to drive me mad are they mad bennie bennie took up his flight bag and climbed out of the cigarette he lit a cigar while croaker followed you know in the old days when the world was less like complicated hat makers were slowly poisoned by the mercury used in making hatbands it like seeped into their fingertips while they were handworking the satin an felt an eventually they went like nutso insane he blew out a cloud of aromatic smoke i religiously believe something of that nature happened to the bonita twins they were poisoned in their mothers womb by evil spirits who the fuck knows what he turned away abruptly and went up the marble stairs toward the house in bennies huge dining room they shared a charbroiled threeinchthick porterhouse bennie ordered from a place in miami with it came cottage fries that croaker knew even as he was eating them would give him indigestion ravenous he ate them anyway afterward bennie brought out the mescal but by that rime croaker had had more than enough altered awareness coffee he could deal with and as bennie went about fixing espresso from scratch croaker said id like to know something bennie was grinding the dark rich beans shoot croaker took a breath exhaled it slowly when the bonitas delivered your sisters head were there symbols like the ones we found in sonias refrigerator bennies hand slipped and he had to fumble with the off button why dyou ask he was facing the kitchen cabinets and croaker could not see his face because when you took sonias head to wrap it you wouldnt look at those symbols croaker stood next to his friend i took that to mean they had some significance for you amateur shrink bennie dumped the ground beans into the top of the espresso maker i know you well enough to see that you dont ever necessarily say whats in the back of your mind bennie turned the espresso maker on then he stood quite still even so croaker could feel emotion emanating from him in waves okay well bennie broke off took up a paring knife and began to deftly peel away the rind of a lemon in thin strips see the thing is those symbols he bit his lip those symbols they are like the cornerstones of my grandfathers world the scars on bennies face shone livid in the light i mean theyre central to his beliefs the magic he the magic he taught the bonitas for a long moment there was only stark silence in the vast house the sudden hiss of the espresso maker made them both start the bonitas were pupils of your grandfathers croaker said bennie nodded unhappily as he got out tiny cups dropped a curl of lemon rind into each he initiated them in the guarani healing arts of the indigenous people of my country it is called by the guarani heta i which in loose translation means many waters bennies eyes were wide and staring as if his sight extended through the fixed past into the unknowable future but what they did lewis was unforgivable they took the healing arts and in their madness perverted heta i into a terrible force for evil croaker thought about this chilling new strand to what was fast becoming a farreaching web as bennie poured the espresso he said what do the symbols mean theyre power gatherers theres one for each cardinal point in the compass when you have them all together there is a summoning of the spirits a nexus of power croaker accepted a cup but there were only two in sonias refrigerator bennie nodded the third is a cross within three concentric circles the fourth is the outline of a human eye with two irises he took up his cup but he didnt drink see each initiate takes a symbol as his or her own the twoirised eye was my grandfathers symbol croaker felt a small chill creep down his spine he told bennie about seeing that symbol in his vision and in his dream bennie slowly put down his cup and walked out of the kitchen curious croaker went after him bennie opened a slider and went out onto the side porch when croaker came up beside him he saw that his friend had gone pale bennie you okay bennie seemed to think about this a long time at last he said to be truthful lewis im not at all sure he gripped the railing and stared out at the reflections of lights swimming like electric eels in the water when my grandfather died it rained for ten days without a break i was fifteen an i can remember sitting in that rain it was a cold rain my grandfather died on the coldest day of winter he was pulled from the paraguay river by fishermen he lived by the river he was very old by then past ninety and everyone said he mustve you know lost his balance in the dark and fallen in hit his head on the rocks i never believed that though my grandfather was so surefooted he could like catch fish with his feet i saw him do it many times it always made me laugh bennies arms were like steel beams as he leaned against the railing and he hadnt yet regained his color anyway my grandfather being a healer had to be burned we built a funeral pyre and placed him on top of it we slaughtered his favorite horse cooked its flesh and ate it to honor him while the pyre burned the wood burned despite the rain everyone said it was a miracle bennie put his head down his chest was heaving as if he were having an asthmatic attack croaker heard the crickets and the tree frogs as if from far away i sat in a tree bennie said an watched the body burn my grandfather he always told me he was part animal once when i asked him which one he smiled an said when i die you watch me closely youll find out bennie shook his head you have to understand something lewis when my grandfather died i was terrified see he wanted to initiate mehe wanted me to keep the traditional guarani ways alive i refused i dont know why maybe i didnt want the responsibility that would like him tie me forever to asuncion he had so many people who depended on his healing i already had money on my mind and an unquenchable itch to see the world bennie took out a cigar stared at it better to admit to that than the alternative that maybe deep down i didnt really believe bennie looked away and shrugged so my grandfather he turned to antonio an heitor god hears me they needed a strong hand their father died when they were young an their mother well the best that was ever said of her was that she was highborn that she was but she was also some kind of witch my grandfather i think he like felt sorry for them he passed the traditions on to them tried to give them some kind of sense of family why were you afraid when he died croaker asked bennie stared at his cigar for some time oh well you know he tried to smile but when he looked up he had a kind of haunted look in his eyes i was pissed at himfor you know making me feel guilty for being who he was i guess i dont know anyway shit i stopped talking to him so when he died jesus i was beside myself so what happened bennie lit his cigar the ritualistic motions seemed to calm him somewhat when hed got it going to his satisfaction he said i sat in the tree you know watching the flames defy the rain i was scared and like entranced at the same time i kept my eyes on that charred body because i was sure id see his spirit emerging as like a bird or something i mean birds were sacred to us but you didnt bennie blew out a cloud of smoke his voice had taken on an odd inflection rising in pitch as if he were again that teenager in asuncion see there needed to be a lot of water thats why it rained for ten days without letup why bennie because when my grandfathers spirit finally did emerge it wasnt as a bird or a horse or an ocelot he turned to look into croakers eyes and the light from inside the house made his face shine like the moon what he had become lewis was a shark bennie no no i saw what i saw bennie waved a hand that beast rose from the flames from the whitehot ashes an it like swam into the torrent of rain like smoke it vanished into the black clouds he took the cigar out of his mouth that tiger shark that took my wahoo yesterday the symbolsmy grandfathers symbolthat came to you during sonias funeral i told you we were vulnerable to spirits he put his hand on croakers shoulder you killed the shark lewis an now god hears me my grandfathers spirit hes here bennie pressed the fingertips of his other hand into the muscle above croakers heart that tiger shark was no coincidence of all the fishermen on the ocean he found us bennie leaned into croaker as he whispered lewis my grandfathers like trying to tell us something such as croaker said bennie squeezed croakers shoulder like maybe who killed him he cant pass fully into the netherworld until his murderers found an like brought to justice croaker stared at bennie the truly curious thing he thought was that in the aftermath of everything that had happened this evening the profound spirituality of bennies grandfathers world seemed perfectly believable he shook his head maybe it was the residue of whatever hed inhaled on the cigarette or maybe he was just going nuts in any case it was getting late he glanced at his watch you gotta split bennie asked croaker nodded yeah ive got to get to the hospital check up on rachel they walked slowly back inside the house bout that bennie paused as they came to the front door ive been thinking bout your niece he took croakers hand in his laid something in it it was a dark green stone perfectly oval worn smooth in the way only centuries of water could accomplish croaker looked up at him whats this bennie took croaker by the arm led him out the front door into the gentle night crickets and tree frogs made a soft susurrus that was almost hypnotic bennie said once as a little boy i saw my grandfather heal a womans arm shriveled by disease how is this possible you ask he pointed above their heads like that tree frog who doesnt have a clue about our conversation you havent got a clue bout this healing process you dont have the healers consciousness so you dont get that bout this youre like that tree frog up there to him this conversation cant like exist cause he doesnt have the ability to get it but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist see croaker nodded this spiritstone it belonged to my grandfather bennies voice was as quiet as if he were in church its very powerful i want you to put it on rachels chest he put his hand over croakers fingers making him grasp the stone its a healers stone but im not a healer lewis and neither are you so the energy in its like limited still who knows it may help in some way croaker thought he felt a kind of warmth emanating from it but perhaps it was just his imagination ill take good care of it bennie looked at it almost wistfully you know what they say about guarani healers lewis they never die their power like remains bennie walked croaker to the car silence enveloped them as croaker opened the tbirds door bennie said esuchame lewis i have a favor to ask of you anything buddy bennie nodded two days from now i want to charter your boat croaker laughed youre giving me more business what kind of favor is that its not for fishing lewis i need it like for the night croaker frowned this isnt for anything illegal is it bennie no nothin like that but he looked around as if the rustling palms might be studded with directional microphones but this is strictly between us you cant tell anyonenot even the people in your office far as they know youre using the boat for yourself okay sure but you have your own boat cigarettes no good for this run bennie clapped him on the shoulder thanks buddy this is like super important i dont know anyone else i can trust he held the tbirds door open wide for croaker remember in two days what time gotta midnight appointment well need to leave islamorada at eight where the hell are we going bennie miami or cuba bennie said nothing put his forefinger across his lips he sure was being damn secretive croaker thought then he shrugged mentally what the hell what were friends for anyway bennie on impulse he embraced his friend whether it helps rachie or not thanks for your grandfathers spiritstone it was after nine it had taken him an hour and a half to get back to royal poinciana hospital in palm beach matty was asleep when he arrived the nurses in the dialysis unit had let his sister sleep on a bed in one of the empty cubicles croaker tiptoed past her on the way to see his niece he asked the duty nurse about rachels condition when she told him it hadnt changed he wondered whether that was good or bad perhaps it was a little of both barring a miracle it was the best they could hope for at the moment rachel lay as he had left her on her back unconscious hooked up to so many hoses she looked like some postmodern mythic creature part human part machine shadows still as death lay across her like shrouds and croaker felt an unspent shout of denial welling up inside him he could not let her drift away into oblivion he had to find some way to get her a healthy kidney when he sat down beside her he found that he was trembling he slipped his right hand into hers trying to warm it it seemed to him that memories of sonia brief but poignant mingled with his awareness of rachel almost as if their two souls shared a space on another plane of existence linked in a cosmic and unknowable manner perhaps this sense was his way of feeling closer to a niece he had longed to know or perhaps tonight of all nights was special and what he felt had some basis in truth in any case he would not laugh at himself for harboring such odd and spiritual thoughts he dug out the spiritstone bennie had given him its dark green color seemed dull muted by the fluorescent lights croaker turned it over a couple of times between his fingers it looked to him no different from any of a thousand such wavewashed stones one might pick up along a seashore nevertheless he set it carefully between rachels breasts it lay there dark and seemingly heavy creasing the sheet with which she was covered he looked at her face willing her back to life but of course nothing happened he waited for what seemed an extraordinarily long time while the many machines ticked over the fluids dripped into her and she continued to drift deep inside her coma at last he reached out to pluck the spiritstone from atop her chest his fingers closed over it and he felt a kind of warmth that almost burned him whos there he started just as if someone had jabbed him with a needle he leaned over her bed rachel now that she was awake he could see her ice blue eyes for himself so vivid they were riveting who are you im your uncle lew mommys brother he moved into the light so she could see him better shes right outside ill go get her no it was just a whisper but it held him as immobile as if it had been a shout he could feel her grip on his right hand as if she were using all the strength she had left to keep him at her side my god uncle lew i was i think i was dreaming about you she tried to smile failed you were on a white horse and your armor shone like the sun he smiled both at the image and to encourage her this is florida honey i think its much too hot for armor but its me im here now she squeezed his hand i know its you uncle lew rachel honey let me get mom shes so worried about you i know shed want to talk to you but i dont want to talk to her those eyes stared up at him the doctor then honey youve been asleep for some time ive got to tell them youre awake please uncle lew i cant bear to be poked and prodded in a minute you can call them but now just stay here with me it was wrong and he knew it dr marsh should be notified at the very least but he seemed helpless before her or more accurately his feelings he was bound to adore her he had known that his only niece he would accept her unconditionally and to be brutally honest her intense desire to be with him mirrored his own fondest wish he could not find it in himself to deny her besides the detective inside him fervently wished for answers rachie what happened to you all these tubes she whispered youre in a hospital you took some bad shit is all her expression was curious youre nothing like matty she doesnt have a clue im into drugs her expression changed abruptly and her mouth began to tremble he could feel a vibration coming through her fingers where he gripped them tightly her eyes fluttered closed rachel he pressed the spiritstone down against her breastbone when he looked at her he met her placid gaze im okay the monitors confirmed her heartbeat and blood pressure were stable the tip of her tongue moved over her cracked lips could you get me something to drink like a diet coke im so thirsty youre getting fluids through some tubes honey i dont think its a good idea to give you anything else right now maybe later after the doctor takes a look at you those ice blue eyes stared up at him with a naked hunger for knowledge what happened between you and matty the cop in him could not resist ill tell you if youll tell me where you got the shit thats rotted out your system she seemed intrigued ive played this game before what game ill show you mine if you show me yours he wondered how sexually active she was she was only fifteen but these days that was no barrier to having sex he stifled the desire to ask her that was a matty question definitely to be avoided he smiled down at her yeah ive played the game once or twice myself you good at it what kind of question was that from a fifteenyearold he asked himself i dont know he said youll have to tell me okay you go first keeping her hand in his he stood by her bed your mother and i he paused unsure how to continue were like i dont know oil and water sometimes she sees black i see white and so we butt heads over just about everything youre bullshitting me rachel said please dont do that uncle lew so he told her as much about her fathers nefarious history as he thought she could digest how donald managed to drive a wedge between the family it wasnt even half of the story but he knew it had to be enough to satisfy her parents are so like cats rachel said you never know whats on their minds when matty deals with me shes so i dont know transparent but when it comes to her and my father god only knows the real story maybe the answer is that parents arent really as transparent as they seem he said they just jump when you press their buttons with an adolescents disarming way of posing questions that cut to the quick rachel said heres the thing that drives me nuts did my father leave matty or did i drive him away croaker leaned toward her honey what makes you even think that the breakup had nothing to do with you in this family people are always leavingyou my father the one constant is me thats just not true pain filled her eyes really after the divorce my father never came to see me why would he do that unless he blamed me oh donald i hope youre rotting in whatever hell youve gone to croaker thought and mattyshe talks to me too much something in her tone alerted him about you and matty whats the problem its more like what isnt the problem meaning because she wants certain answers she asks all the wrong questions she hasnt a clue whats happening rachel what has happenedto you i mean she clamped her jaws shut the look in her ice blue eyes chilled him to the bone croaker could see that she had an ability to rune people out even people who were close to her who loved her that was dangerous maybe even selfdestructive could be this dark streak was what had gotten her into this mess in the first place he wondered okay i told you what you wanted to know he said now its your turn where did you get the bad shit rachel turned her head toward the wall honey her hand squirmed free of his hed seen this attitude before who was she protecting rachel you promised did not but the game you dont know shit about the game her voice was so filled with spiteful venom he was taken aback i didnt cut a loogie what the hell is that it means spit if i dont cut a loogie when i agree to play i dont have to answer my part every dork knows that not this dork he said besides youre in no condition to spit that got a reaction she either laughed darkly or sobbed but in any case she kept her face to the wall he began to feel a kind of desperation as if something ugly and unknown was slipping like jelly through his fingers he had to find a handle some way to get through this thorny facade she had suddenly created rachel listen im not the enemy just a minute ago i was the only one you wanted to be with now youre shutting me out what happened for a very long time there was no sound in the room save the monotonous beeping of the monitors the soft pliant soughing of the machines you wouldnt understand she whispered at last no one does and when she rolled her head back toward him he could see that she was crying im messed up she almost choked on her tears im so fucking messed up she stared up at him as he dabbed her face with the edge of his sleeve uncle lew am i going to die no honey because if i am i want to know he kissed her damp forehead youre not going to die because if i am i have to prepare he kissed her cheeks honey i told you her hand sought his gripping it tightly because if i am i have to see gideon whos gideon rachels ice blue eyes went wide as she spasmed up off the bed the monitors were going blooey and croaker was howling for the duty nurse uncle lew oh god for one brief instant he stared into eyes so filled with terror he felt utterly and irretrievably lost her expression her emotion flooded through him like shards of broken glass he clutched her to him as if by this act alone he could keep her safe hold on rachie hold on he picked up the spiritstone squeezed placed it back on her then took it inside his fist rachels eyes rolled up in their sockets and her hand felt like ice there was no grip left in it he was still howling when three nurses and the doctor on call hurried in with a crash cart one of the nurses had to hold on to matty who was trying to shove her way into the crowded cubicle my girl she screamed whats happening to my little girl the doctor a darkskinned latino looked up at croaker and said in a very civil voice given the circumstances would you mind leaving us to it sir dr marsh croaker said already been paged the latino doctors hands were filled with a vial and a hypodermic he barked orders to one of the nurses then pulled off the syringes plastic cap with his teeth he had no more time for anything but his patient and for that croaker was profoundly grateful croaker realized he was still gripping his nieces hand he stared at the monitors which looked like they were giving readings for an extraterrestrial then he let go pushed passed doctor and nurses and grabbing hold of his sister carried her bodily out of the cubicle croaker dragged matty to the lavatory and spinning open the cold water tap pressed her head down into the spray the water wasnt icytap water never was in floridabut the force of it got her attention she stopped screaming and kicking but he caught a sharp elbow in the ribs he grunted and pushed her face farther down into the sink he heard her try to say something and bent down what another jumble of words and he let up on the pressure enough so her head could turn sideways i cant breathe you bastard she gasped now theres a familiar epithet he reached up for a roll of paper towels that stood atop the empty stainlesssteel dispenser then he released his grip on her and she came up coughing and sputtering he unrolled the towels handed a wad to her she stood staring down at it as if she did not know what it was then a moan welled up from her gut and she began to sob oh god lew oh my dear sweet god he took her in his arms holding her tightly stroking her damp disheveled hair he felt the spasms rack her felt all the strength go out of her and he thought back to the time hed felt this before when wet with melting sleet and his fathers blood hed held his mother limp with grief and despair she had clung to him her lifeline at the moment of lifes severing donald duke was gone but matty still had her daughter matty began to shiver and shake uncontrollably she looked up at him tears streaming down her face clearly terrified lew she whispered hoarsely i cant stop her teeth rattled together whats the matter with me shock croaker said honey its just shock and exhaustion he passed a hand over her forehead smoothing away stray wisps of wet hair im going to take you home now her eyes had the terrified haunted look of a doe suddenly caught in the beams of a cars headlights but my baby what about rachel her expression told him clearly that if there was bad news she was in no shape now to hear it he led her to a toilet sat her down on it wait here he said ill be right back critical care dialysis always quiet seemed preternaturally still terror gripped his heart as he hurried past the central nursess station he saw jenny marsh with a couple of nurses just outside the drawn privacy curtain of rachels cubicle she was deep in conversation and he tried to slow his headlong rush he paused for a moment at the briefly deserted nurses station shes okay for now dr marsh said as he came up she was scribbling something on rachels chart dr cortinez is in with her what the hell happened i was hoping youd tell me you were with her when she woke up i understand her tone held a certain rebuke she handed the chart to one of the nurses nodded to her before turning her full attention on him you shouldve called a nurse mr croaker i wanted to but rachel was adamant she didnt want me to leave her im sorry i know it was wrong but i didnt see that i had much choice jenny marsh appraised him coolly rachel emerges from a comawhich given her condition i must say defies medical logic even so i doubt very much whether she could be lucid let alone adamant thats where youre wrong doctor she was perfectly lucid we had a conversation hed made an initial decision not to mention the spiritstone and he knew he had to stand by it dr marshs training would never allow her to accept such an arcane explanation croaker barely knew whether he did maybe it was just a coincidence the only problem with that was he didnt believe in coincidence jenny marsh looked at him as if hed just grown wings my initial prognosis still applies mr croaker she needs that kidney without it she wont make it he ran a hand through his hair okay i get it howd my tests come out youre not compatible she relented and gave him a rueful smile im sorry croaker sighed how the hell was he going to find rachel a kidney when there wasnt one to be had anywhere he could not help thinking again of the bonitas who according to bennie harvested human organs in south america and now possibly here for the select few who could pay their no doubt exorbitant price there must be a way he couldnt give up hope what can i tell my sister about rachel he asked as i said she appears stable but im afraid shes lapsed back into a coma dr marsh said were doing tests now to try to determine what happened to her itll be a whilethe morning at the earliest why dont you take your sister home mr croaker theres nothing either of you can do and well call the moment theres any news dr marsh was about to turn away when he said lew my names lew his gaze held hers doctor about that kidney there must be a source something i dont know about could she know about the bonitas could they really as bennie had claimed be harvesting organs in this country is there she looked at him ive made calls tried to pull strings ive pleaded and cajoled and frankly once or twice ive made myself look like a fool theres nothing more i can do but she was not quite done and he knew it he felt rather than saw her hesitation and he quickly stepped into the breach doctor if there is another way i need to know about it please like his father hed seen enough rich men predators corruptors and thieves to recognize when conscience was warring with convention not to say that jenny marsh was any of these it was a truism of the street that matters of conscience happened more often to people of good character and kind heart jenny marsh looked into his eyes for what seemed a very long time then she lifted an arm in silent invitation and he followed her across the dialysis unit through a door marked doctors lounge it was a mediumsize room filled with castoff furniture no doubt donated and a window that overlooked the intracoastal it was empty jenny marsh shook her head i must be out of my mind she jammed her hands into the pockets of her lab coat look you have to understand something all of us in the organ transplant area are scrupulousand i underline that wordabout ethics we will not be caught alive or dead with an unregistered organ for us that its illegal to deal in stolen organs is almost beside the point its morally wrong and well have none of it like a strange beast happened upon along a forest path transforming a peaceful stroll into a tense encounter croaker knew their conversation had taken on a new and precarious dimension im still listening jenny marsh drew her shoulders square seeming to steel herself from time to time ive heard that unregistered organs do surface croaker trained to elicit confessions from reluctant witnesses and suspects was adept at reading between the lines are you telling me you know that here in this country theres an underground commerce in selling stolen organs she gave an abrupt nod you didnt hear it from me if you dare tell anyone i mentioned such a thing ill deny it fear had turned her eyes muddy only a glint of green now and again marked the hazel of her irises he discovered that his right hand was tightly clutching the back of a sofa he thought of sonias head sitting in her refrigerator like an offering what had antonio and heitor done with the organs in her body this was the question bennie and he had asked of each other now abruptly a confirmation of their worst suspicions had presented itself as startlingly as a graven image in a jungle glade croaker felt a tremor roll through him and again he felt that peculiar vulnerability as if his very marrow had been exposed whos doing the trafficking weve known for years the arabs the chinese and the pakistanis trade in stolen organs theyre notorious for it the south americans too from what i understand when they disappear peopledissidents rebels political enemies whoeverthey like to get some monetary gain from it jenny marsh nodded ive heard that what about here jenny shrugged he continued to press her could the bonitas have moved their organ harvesting here to the states does that mean you dont know or you wont say i dont know nobody does somebody must croaker thought for a moment tell me something if everyone in your fields so morally incorruptible whos buying these organs everyone i know is ethical come on croaker said jenny looked around them as if she was afraid shed be overheard then she beckoned him to follow her there went out of the lab past the dialysis unit and down a short corridor ending in door which read caution operating theater there she led him into a small operating room she switched on the lights against one wall was a stainlesssteel and porcelain object no larger than a portable writing table with flexible tubes running from its casing it was oblong in shape with legs and rubberclad casters she went over to it this is a perfusion machine she put her hand on its sleek top its what keeps a kidney alive long enough for us to perform the transplant croaker examined the perfusion machine but nothing about it seemed odd or unusual it looked like another bit of surgical apparatus mysterious and therefore vaguely menacing let me give you a hypothetical situation she said theres an accident on ininetyfive multiple deaths these days things are so backed up these bodies arent even carted off to the hospital the me takes them until theyre identified then they go to a mortuary she plucked some stray hairs back behind her ears now say in this hypothetical scenario this mes unscrupulous hes in debt or just wants to make a little more money whatever hes in business for himself he ices the abdominal cavities of the corpses to thirtytwo degrees centigrade until he can get the body onto the perfusion machine then he floods it with belzer solution remember with a kidney hes got seventytwo hours anyway probably hes already got buyers lined up he does his antigen typing that typically takes six to eight hours bingo he matches the kidney to his list and sells it no one knows because accident victims are typically in such bad shape a surgical incision by the me will go unnoticed by the mortician he cocked his head is this scenario hypothetical or typical she looked at him unhappily its been known to happen okay but then what whoever buys the kidney isnt coming to you or someone like you to sew it in no jenny used long slender fingers to smooth the front of her lab coat but no doubt there are others who would with your specific knowledge her expression was bleak youd be surprised at how easy it is to do a kidney transplant any private clinic has the facilitieseven one doing outpatient procedures and bare bones all you really need are three competent professionals a surgeon an anesthesiologist and an or tech croaker searched her face so youre saying what this happens form your own conclusions jenny said softlywhy have you told me about this croaker asked even if i were able to procure a kidney you wouldnt put it in racheleven to save her life jenny marsh put a hand to her temple i dont know i told you i must be out of my mind she turned away to stare blankly at the operating table empty now gleaming in the overhead lights maybe its that youre a cop cops are like priests in a way sometime it feels good to confess to them but you havent done anything wrong she turned back to him the green of her eyes piercing no but in rachels case i seem to be thinking about it and that scares you more than you could know meet me tomorrow night for dinner he said he had to know more about this stateside organ harvesting perhaps it might provide a lead to antonio and heitor and besides wasnt she offering a slender ray of hope glimmering fitfully in the darkness if she knew someone who could get a healthy kidneyregistered or notfor rachel harvesting an organ from an accident victim was nothing like what antonio and heitor were doing but still the thought that he might have to make such a decision scared him as much as it obviously did her right now ive got to get my sister home but well talk more about it then im busy no youre not he said i stole a look at your schedule when i went by the duty station youre off at ten that cool appraisal again how do you know i dont have a date do you jennys gaze flickered and she looked abruptly drained it doesnt matter theres nothing to talk about maybe not but theres no harm in having dinner with me he smiled call it a thankyou on rachies behalf youve gone above and beyond for her and shewere all grateful even if i wanted to she shook her head i make it a policy not to socialize with the family of my patients thats sensible i know he gave her an ironic look but there are times when its best to throw caution to the wind and you think this is one of those times mr croaker lew he corrected her yes i do how many cases like rachels have you had doctor none she hadnt hesitated he thought that was a good sign well then lets go to hell with ourselves and break all the rules jenny marsh studied him for a long moment then nodded reluctantly thats great he said ill pick you up here again she gave him that rueful smile why do i think im going to live to regret this because youre a woman who plays by the rules isnt it nice she said her smile broadening just a bit to have all the answers matty lived in the palm beach apartment that donald duke had bought five years ago and became hers as part of the divorce settlement it was on the twelfth floor of harbour pointe one of those glitzy highrises that dotted south floridas gold coast it was a place that boasted views of both the atlantic ocean and the intra coastal and in best south florida tradition pointlessly added letters to its name it was within walking distance of the breakers hotel and the highprofile restaurants of royal poinciana way and was coveted by anyone who wore diamonds at the beach besides awesome views threethousandfootplus floor plans lavish marble and goldplate baths and a stateoftheart rooftop cardiovascular fitness center harbour pointe also boasted both a doorman and a concierge the lobby was typical of places that used the word residences for apartments that began at one million dollars with its four massive crystal chandeliers its custom missoni carpets and its pink suede and brushed bronze furniture flamboyant was a woefully inadequate adjective to describe it up on the twelfth floor he turned on all the lights in the apartment as if banishing the dark could dispel mattys sudden and crushing depression to his report of rachels stable condition she had said not a word during the short drive over the flagler memorial bridge down royal poinciana way to palm beach proper he put her on one of the two facing oversize sofas in the living room the entire place was furnished grandly in a decorators idea of the european style period furniture upholstered in sweeps of pale moire fabric and french provincial patterns antique oriental carpets in iranian reds and blues muted by time and sunlight this was all set off by eclectic accent pieces statuary paintings of the french countryside mincing side tables swags on lush curtains massive cutglass bowls and ornamental knickknacks in profusion the walls were partially paneled with the ubiquitous floridian mirrors which reflected the two bodies of water in dizzying and unexpected angles all this highly conspicuous artifice provided a brittle surface of culture that hardly surprised him given what he knew of donald duke but something else did in all this wonderland of overpriced junk croaker discovered no photographs no personal possessions or mementos of the last fifteen years no sense of individuality where was matty amid this anonymous chic and glitter matty sat with her bare feet on the carpet looking undone by terror at the center of this perfect hollow splendor she was like a projectile in transit in a limbo defined not by stasis but by velocity when was the last time you ate she made him prompt her out of silence matty i dont remember he headed for the kitchen ill fix you something youll have to be some kind of magician she called after him i havent shopped in a week she wasnt kidding in the comparatively small kitchen he discovered a refrigerator with nothing in it but three white paper containers from chinese takeout half a carton of spoiled skim milk an empty box of shredded wheat a head of garlic half a head of spoiled iceberg lettuce some semiwilted scallions and a jar of reeses peanut butter the freezer held foilwrapped packages of cake a bag of gourmet coffee beans and two unopened pints of haagendazs ice cream jesus he muttered peering into the containers of chinese takeout one held rice hard as ice the second a shrimp dish whose ammoniac smell made him wince the third had once contained an order of ginger beef all that remained however were long slivers of ginger embedded like wooden splinters in a congealed brown sauce he rummaged through the cupboards found pasta and a third of a bottle of scotch all in all with the plastic packet of soy sauce from the takeout it was enough he dug out a large pot filled it halfway with water and set it to boil in a bowl with some warm water he spooned out the peanut butter thinned it to the proper consistency then he chopped up the garlic and scallions added the slivers of ginger and the soy sauce then the garlic and got that mixture going in a saucepan he slopped in a generous dollop of scotch by that time the water was boiling in the pot he measured out the pasta and dumped it in when fifteen minutes later he called matty to the table her eyes got big as saucers what the hell is that she asked pointing to the pasta in a pale brown sauce sit down and eat he ordered sprinkling the scallions over the top matty sighed ran her hands through her hair and sank into a chair by this time she had scrubbed her runny makeup off her face and he could see all over again the beautiful young girl he remembered once she started to eat she couldnt stop after her fifth or sixth forkful she looked up you are some kind of magician this is fantastic thanks he sat down opposite her took a small portion onto his plate it was mainly for show the steak hed eaten at bennies was sitting on his stomach like a leprechaun digging for a potful of gold matty wiped her lips whered you learn to cook like this in japan croaker said actually it was something of a neces sity i hate raw fish so wherever i was i ferreted out the best chinese restaurant and let me tell you there are some great ones there he spiraled some pasta on the tines of his fork somehow i always managed to get friendly with the chef he laughed remembering it wasnt so surprising he extruded the nails from his biomechanical hand once i gave em a demonstration of my own brand of slicing and dicing food they were always asking me back into their kitchens you should have seen em crowd around matty shook her head as she helped herself to more pasta you really are full of surprises so are you he looked at her pointedly and when her gaze met his he said matty dyou think you can tell me why rachie thinks she drove donald away she frowned she said that uhhuh she also said that her father didnt come to see her after the breakup that parts true enough she put her fork down frowned let me tell you we had some screaming fights on the phone about that not in person she shook her head donald was adamant about that hed cut the ties and as far as he was concerned that was that for him the divorce was like an operation he couldnt understand why anyone would want to go back and revisit their gallbladder but rachel was his daughter she raised her eyebrows in his eyes rachel was mine she was part of the life he once had and had gotten bored with you say that so calmly she pushed her plate away shed had enough of her food donald was a driven man he had furies in his head he was always restless always tearing down and building never satisfied with what hed created i understood him that was something you never bothered to do despite himself croaker was incensed youre defending this bastardstill matty sighed raked scarlet nails through her thick hair i can see where this will lead and i have no desire to go down that road again she put a hand over his not when weve found each other again she smiled at him but truly lew there was a side to him you never quite got you were too busy hating his guts he gave me good reason her eyes turned hard for just an instant and croaker clenched his biomechanical hand beneath the table the truth now matty the whole truth and nothing but at rachies christening i was so happy for you despite how youd treated us then donald came up to me and put his arm around me i swear he almost kissed me on the cheek i remember that but you dont know the rest croaker said he told me how great it was to have a cop as part of the family what great buddies we were going to behow wed do things together you know guy to guy like flying out on his private jet to go hunting and fishing the whole country is our preserve he told me and when we go i want you to feel free to bring your cop pals you know the big shots from downtown the highsteppers from city hall he hugged me to him my marrying your sister is the best thing that ever happened to you he said trust me together well make more money than youve ever dreamed of if you get your buddies to play along what do you mean he saw the dismayed look in her eyes and he held on to her hand before i go on this is the last of him matty hes spent too many years standing between us i wont allow that to happen anymore its all in the past agreed she nodded yes lew she said breathlessly as far as im concerned donalds history but i want the true history now all right donald wanted to be hooked into all the right people in new york that meant politicians cops and union leaders he wanted me to make the introductions twist arms here and there if need be all so he could make his dirty deals he leaned forward over the table honey thats when i blew up and threatened him you never told me she whispered because i was so stone cold angry he said but also maybe you werent ready to hear it croakers heart broke at the look of desolation on his sisters face now she knew that there was more to donald than she had known the funny thing was hed dreamed of this moment of setting her free from her selfinduced fantasy about donald but now that it had happened he tasted only ashes in his mouth jesus i fucked up my life no honey you fell in love she laughed harshly is that what its called these days she shook her head but she continued to grasp his hand as if it were a lifeline i was smart beautifuland vulnerable and donald saw it all in a flash spread out in front of him like a fourcourse feast she tried to smile this is the way it was lew all his friendsno strike thatall his associatesyoung millionaires and clever entrepreneurshad married for status they moved in on women of certain pedigree whose families status would ensure them entree to circles beyond even their money okay but donald was different maybe that was too easy a game for him he wanted something more to tear down and build something almost from scratch like he did in business he wanted to play henry higgins to my eliza doolittle he wanted to create a lady of culture and breeding out of this waif from hells kitchen she waved a hand oh he made no bones about it for my part i was thrilled who in my position wouldnt be the attention and grooming he lavished on me was my dream come true tutors in diction manners foreign languagesmy god he even hired a famous coach of the mets opera divas i had private lessons in ballet tennis horsemanship polo exercise sailing when he judged me ready i came out we went on fox hunts in england played polo in argentina crewed in newport it bunded me to everything else she held on to her elbows as a drowning woman will clutch onto a spar this is my walpurgisnacht her gaze struck croakers face with full force donalds dead now my daughters on the point of death and everything i admired in him is turned to dust at last the truth is staring me in the face like a deaths head and if i cant face up to what he was now i never will matty reached out and placed the palm of her hand on the crown of his head as if in benediction then she ruffled his hair as she used to do when they were young its okay her voice with the depth and timbre of a coloratura filled the room at last i understand just how angry weve been with each other she rose and took his chin and turned his face so that she stared into his eyes then she kissed both his cheeks but now everythings been said and well forget about it because weve found each other after all this time then she busied herself with clearing the table and washing the dishes she did it all with clean economical movements and by her straightahead efficiency he knew that she had adjusted to being alone if not to the tragedy that had befallen rachel when she heard him come into the kitchen she turned and he slid his arms around her holding her close he could hear her heart beating fast and he ached for her and for himself at last they broke away and returning to her washing she said lew what else did rachel say to you when she was awake your daughter is angry matty her hands encased in yellow rubber gloves nodded sadly as she rinsed off a plate arent ninetynine percent of the teenagers in the world she said it as if she needed to convince herself rinsing off a plate she gave him an anxious glance over her shoulder whats the matter you too old to remember what its like despite what you see on tv they arent all taking drugs he said also theyre not all hiding a secret like rachel is matty whirled around her face suddenly pinched with new concern what kind of a secret i dont know he admitted i was hoping youd tell me she wouldnt matty went back to washing dishes but he could see she was shaken he took a plate out of the drain board and began to dry it have you noticed a difference in rachel over the past say three or four months she shook her head not really shes been uncommunicative reclusive since donald died when he was killed six months ago something seemed to snap inside rachel i dont know what it was except maybe then her hope that he would one day welcome her back into his life was shattered have you talked with her about it many times but i dont get anything about her world try as i might i cant understand green day or any of these other rock bands that spew out noise it all sounds like a hissy fit to me she put another plate on the drain board and began scrubbing a pot and to be brutally honest rachie would rather i dont get it any attempt at contact with her world she takes as an intrusion matty the amount of drugs shes been doingsomethings seriously wrong can you remember anything at all as you can imagine the breakup didnt help then she shrugged theres nothing else really i mean six months ago she went to dr stansky for her annual school physical and everything was okay she frowned ill tell you one thing stansky didnt say anything to me about her taking drugs no surprise there croaker said chronic drug users know all the tricks to pass physicals he leaned forward are you sure theres nothing no erratic behavior failing grades in school no chronic lying no money missing out of your purse that sort of thing absolutely not she gets straight as in school as to the rest i brought rachel up with better values than that drugs can change people matty he waited for her to respond when she didnt he said id like to take a look at rachels room is that okay instead of answering she said i wish id had a chance to talk to her do you know someone named gideon she turned around a boyfriend is my guess i know she saw someone named gideon i never met him though she wouldnt talk about him you let her see him without knowing anything about him lew rachel is fifteen going on twentytwo when she saw the look on his face she said what would you have me do put a leash on her i cant ground her every night of the year she seems to hate me enough as it is these days she says it often enough and her father how did she feel about him matty sighed there isnt a bigger mystery in my life ive told you that donald never seemed to care much about her of course rachel was aware of it but it never seemed to faze her when he was away she used to hang on every call he made waiting to talk to him and even though hed disappoint her every time her hope seemed undiminished just the opposite in fact oh how that used to infuriate me her voice rose harshly as she continued to amass a pile of clean pots and plates he had been tuning into her wavelength for some time and he was struck by this discordant note matty what is it nothing youve come this far he said gently take the next step she shook her head dont read into anything she shrugged its just that you know he could see her take a deep breath well sometimes it seemed to me that rachel and donald that this thing between them was some kind of sick game she gave off an embarrassed laugh that was almost a sob stupid of me no its not croaker said tell me what you mean matty washed dishes as she did everything else with a meticulous attention to detail no wonder donalds henry higgins routine worked so well with her as she had proved in school and again at the ad agency she had unlimited aptitude its just that this approachavoidance thing with them while rachel was growing up before the divorce you mean matty nodded yes there was something about it an edge sometimes it seemed to me they fed off it that it was their way of dealing with each other rachel would approach him donald would fend her off and it would escalate like that until they were both at some kind of fever pitch and then what would happen i dont know mattys eyes were bleak at the remembrance like a bubble it would suddenly burst one moment it would be there and the next their emotions were back to normal did he finally consent to see her was that how the tension resolved itself sometimes yes at others i dont think so at least i wasnt aware of them being together it was clear matty was struggling with this mystery in either case donald was back to his routine and rachel would be sunny and somehow calm until the cycle started all over again croaker said gently matty i have to ask this was donald in any way abusive to rachel absolutely not her eyes were clear and he could see no reason to doubt her you know me better than that lew i never would have allowed it but the issue never arose donald was not that kind of man he was too confident in himself and in everything he did he knew so many subtle ways to exert his power hed never even consider the physical one for a time she seemed lost in thought she was through washing pulling off her gloves she put a hand gently on his arm her eyes glittered with tears go see her den of iniquity he went down the hall his footsteps muffled by the thick carpet at the far end of the hall he took a step into rachels room it looked like a typical teenagers bedroom it was painted clear white with trim black as funeral bunting there were posters on the wall of kurt cobain the late lead singer of nirvana along with posters of other rock bands stone temple pilots live and rem the bedspread was blackandwhite in a pattern that reminded croaker of those old dinettes from the s he sat on the bed and looked around he wanted to get a sense of the room from rachels point of view when she got up each morning this is what she saw it had been his experience that people liked to wake up looking at their favorite possessions he saw kurt cobain on the wall he saw the window with the lights of palm beach strung like jewels around a dowagers crepey neck he saw a photograph on her dresser inside the black wood frame was a blackandwhite shot of a striking young woman with dark chinlength hair she was dressed in a seethrough vinyl raincoat and was clutching a white longhaired cat to her chest beneath the vinyl raincoat the woman wore a thick black belt covered in metal studs croaker got up and went over to it the photo was not personal but a page cut out of a magazine the young woman was a model he turned the frame around and opened it but the back of the page held nothing more informative than part of an ad for buffalo jeans the name of the magazine or the date did not appear he replaced the photo in its frame took up another smaller photo that had been hidden behind the first one this one was of rachel she had on an aquamarine satin dress with a sweetheart neckline she was made up and there was a string of pearlsperhaps a loan from mattyaround her neck she looked beautiful and very grown up about to go to a prom croaker guessed the only thing was she didnt seem at all happy he slid out the photo of her his sister had given him and compared the two shots in his rachel had been caught in an unguarded moment in this other posed shot her intensity dominated to the point where she appeared brooding almost sullen he put down the prom photo but as he looked at it something bothered him it had moved slightly and there seemed to be something behind it he slid if out of its frame and to his utter surprise found a picture of himself for a moment he could not remember when or where it had been taken then the memory came flooding back it had been at their cousins wedding in forest hills but hadnt this photo originally been of him and matty he held the photo up to the lamplight saw that the left side had been carefully cut away looking this closely he recognized part of his sisters arm and hip after he returned the photos he went methodically through rachels drawers checking in corners through piles of black tshirts and cotton blouses underpants and bras he was looking for two things any sign of drugs and her diary girls her age almost always wrote in diaries diaries were for secrets and he suspected his niece had more than her share of those like who was gideon someone she saw at night matty thought a boyfriend to that croaker would add drug connection he found nothing except a large sachet of lilac potpourri in the bottom drawer her walkin closet was more empty than full there were some clothesmostly all black three pairs of jeans a couple of pairs of thicksoled dr martens boots the ones that laced high up like us army combat boots one pair of blackandwhite retrolooking airwalk sneakers a cluster of black belts larded with metal studs of different shapes and sizes hung from a wire hanger he thought of the photo of the model in her seethrough vinyl raincoat and black studded belt in a corner he found a black leather jacket across the back someone had handwritten the word manman in white permanent paint directly below heaped on the floor was the aquamarine satin prom dress he stooped picking up the dress to hang it when he saw something lying on the floor he couldnt have seen it before because the dress had covered it he used his stainlesssteel nail to bring it out into the light it was a red rubber ball with silk cords attached to either side croaker had seen such items before this was a ball gag part of the ominous ritualistic paraphernalia used by people into sm the ball went into the mouth the cords tied at the back of the head to hold it in place for a long time he crouched there staring a vein pulsed in one temple as he contemplated the growing enigma that was rachel when it came to sex his attitude had always been live and let live but this discovery shook him this was his niece not some hooker on the tamiami trail into his mind came mattys face her confusion painful to witness she had been talking of rachels relationship with her father to croaker there was more than a hint of sm to it even if it was only expressed on an emotional level matty was smart enough to suspect this but what if in rachel it was more what if her sexual relationship with gideon involved a true acting out of these perverse emotions at length he reached out put the ball gag into his pocket he had no intention of letting his sister find it shed had more than enough shocks for the time being before he did anything else he carefully hung up the prom dress smoothing the bodice it seemed important to get rid of all the wrinkles as if by this act alone he could restore his image of rachel to what it had been before hed found the red rubber ball fraught with so many dark implications he went methodically through the pockets of the leather jacket he discovered half a roll of life savers a couple of waddedup tissues thirteen cents in change a small ball of aluminum foil it was tightly packed he extruded a stainlesssteel nail and opened it carefully with the razor sharp tip there was nothing inside except a whitish residue he put this up to his nose then licked it tentatively could be coke he thought but there was too little to be sure he was putting back the life savers in the lefthand pocket when something fell against the back of his knuckles he felt around but couldnt get to it curious he took the jacket off its hanger and turned it inside out he checked the seams they were solidly stitched except for a fourinch length on the left side which had been hastily basted he snagged the loose thread and with a sudden sense of foreboding pulled then he stuck his fingers inside he extracted an ounce plastic bag filled with white powder opening it he gave it a taste on the tip of his tongue he cursed mightily under his breath the taste was unmistakable it was cocaine matty was working steadily in the kitchen shed brewed coffee and she was slicing a slab of what looked like a rich russian coffee cake shed taken from the freezer emergency rations she said when he came in if this isnt an emergency i dont know what is she gave him a tentative smile as she popped the pastry into the microwave turned it on find anything interesting theres something about gideon and rachel he said softly fear harrowed mattys face as he took out the oneounce bag of coke she put her hand to her mouth oh christ is it he nodded cocaine i found it in rachels closet croaker watched her beautiful haunted eyes the microwave beeped and automatically she opened the door the kitchen smelled of cinnamon and walnuts and coffee she stood staring blankly into the interior at last she said what in gods name is she doing to herself lew i dont know he watched as she slid the coffee cake onto plates then licking her fingertips poured coffee into pale green mugs but her frayed nerves betrayed her at last and she spilled some before croaker coming quickly up behind her steadied her hand oh christ oh jesus she leaned back against his solid strength rocking a little my daughter and i havent had much of a relationship the sad truth is i dont know who she is croaker held her tenderly while she gathered herself ill take the food in he said but she shook her head and slowly disengaged herself no i need to do this i can do this she carefully finished pouring the coffee and croaker could see that her hands no longer shook then she put their plates and mugs on the tray and led him into the dining room she sat down swept her hair back from the side of her face sighing my god i feel as if i married a stranger he took a bite of the coffee cake not so long ago i was involved with a womana married woman when matty raised her eyebrows he added an unhappily married woman but that didnt make it right he took another bite of the pastry washed it down with the rich coffee anyway he went on this woman had a daughter she was a beautiful girl and smart but she was sick bulimic she got sick because of her parents they had a terrible almost adversarial relationship and the girl was aware of it all matty who had been stirring cream into her coffee paused you see a parallel this girl felt she was unloved he could see his sister stiffen color flushed to her cheeks and she began to tremble i love my daughter she whispered i know you do i said the girl felt she was unloved thats not the same as her being unloved in fact her mother loved her desperately i love rachel desperately she looked at him imploringly besides you shes the only important thing in my life lew but now i think what if ive come to that realization too late tell me something where was rachel when you and donald were riding to hounds in england playing polo in argentina and crewing in newport he waited a moment she needed you then she must have girls need their mommies matty used a nail to slowly and methodically extract the walnuts from the cake she did this until she had made a hole clear through the pastry at last she said in those days i tried to be there for her but donald was so insistent he needed me too hed given me so much opened up so many doors for me so i went with him and left rachel with the nanny matty gripped her mug with both hands as if trying to warm herself beside a fire her knuckles were white and her eyes seemed bleak and lifeless at last she said whats happened to our liveswhats happened to her when i wasnt looking she was shaking in terror do you think that when rachel says she hates me she really means it what i think doesnt matter im only a newcomer here he said what do you think lew shes taking drugs shes seeing people i know nothing about at night she goes i dont know where she goes and when she woke up it was you she wanted to talk to not me her face was stricken and now all i want is to make it up to her i want to hold her close and tell her how much i love her but what if its too late she trailed off and croaker squeezed her hand in his he wanted to tell her that it wasnt too late but the words felt hollow in his mind in a week maybe two rachel could be dead dont give up hope im using all my resources to try and find her a kidney she bit her lip my god lew do you think you can it would be a miracle hold on matty just hold on tears rolled silently down his sisters cheeks dropping one by one on the tabletop when she could trust herself to speak she said donald gave me everything i ever wanted in return for making me into a fairytale princess i did everything to please him which was maybe the problem somewhere along the way i got lost no honey he said you were already lost when you met him croaker staring at the photo of the model in the clear vinyl raincoat fell asleep on rachels bed afterward matty tiptoed in and covered him with a light cotton blanket before she tucked the left side all the way around him she took a long look at his biomechanical hand she didnt have to wonder what it must be like to be so seriously maimed the first two months after donald walked out on her shed felt as if her legs had been amputated dead though the marriage might be it had become her lifesupport system without it she was certain she was going to die that she hadnt had come as a minor revelation to her as she covered her brother with the blanket she realized that she had never asked him the details of what had happened to his left hand typical she thought it was not her way to confide or ask confidences any form of intimacy other than the strictly physical kind was painful for her it had been this way for so many years that it had become the norm but she saw now what a terrible failing that was it probably had been with donald it certainly had been with rachel matty wished with all her heart that she had been able to fully embrace rachel after the breakup to take her daughter into her confidence so that neither of them would have had to feel so alone but she just couldnt so many terrible emotions in misery she realized now shed suspected for some time that rachel was having a hard time she just couldnt admit it to herself but now the full extent of her daughters emotional pain hit her with the force of a freight train for a moment she doubled over just as if all the wind had been taken out of her her legs gave way and she found herself kneeling on the floor of rachels room the carpet felt rough against her burning cheek and with each shuddering breath she took she drank in the smell of her daughter as if it were lifeblood that could sustain her what else could she do except pray dear god she whispered dont take my baby away before i have a chance to get to know her day three croaker arose before dawn he had a kind of internal alarm clock that never failed him he showered dressed in his same clothes and slipped out the front door all without waking matty it would be hours before she got upgod knew she needed her sleepand by then she could make her own way to the hospital outside glimmers of security lights skittered like fugitive spirits along the sidewalk he listened for the crash of the surf heard hungry gulls calling instead and the peaceful lapping of the intracoastal he decided to walk to the hospital not more than fifteen minutes on foot by the time he got there daylight would have broken and he wouldnt have to bother returning mattys lexus his tbird was still in the hospital parking lothopefully if it hadnt been stolen or vandalized on the way he stopped at a rank of newspaper vending machines got a copy of the sunsentinel it was the broward county daily and would list all the current events scheduled for the area he riffled through local news looking for the right section it hadnt been happenstance that he had fallen asleep in his nieces bedroom hed wanted to breathe her in to give his unconscious time to work on the significance of what he had seen some things in rachels room just hadnt added up to the mental picture he was forming of her outofplace elements usually meant one thing the picture youd formed was in some way false i once went out to fish stone tree had told him i was hungry and the hunger drove me outside into the rain but the moment i put my hands on the boat i knew if i went out in it i would not return so i went back inside and screwed my door and windows shut within the hour the wind was so high it drove sand through the cracks in my house boards so now i remember if a thought doesnt feel right put it aside croaker had fallen asleep with the image of the model in his head but that image didnt feel right he had awakened seeing in his mind the strange word handpainted on the back of the black leather jacketthe coke jacket thoughts images or impressions he had just before going to sleep or as he was waking up were often the purest and therefore truest even if at first they made no sense eventually when enough other pieces fell into place they always did they always led him to the truth manman was what the jacket back had said what in the world was manman he hadnt had a clue last night didnt even know whether it was significant but this morning intuition had quickly bloomed into a suspicion hed got up and stared from one poster of a rock group to another he was more or less in the middle of the flagler bridge when he found the club listings in the sunsentinel on the surface it seemed like a very long shot that hed find it here but he kept scanning the listings and the ads thinking of the leather jacket and when rachel would wear it on rainy days maybe though leather was not waterproof the handful of really cool days in the winter okay when else at night when she went out to clubs and here he was looking for clubs with live music because almost all the way across the bridge he stopped calmly he folded back the page folded it again until the small square ad in the center was made more prominent somewhere not far distant a motorboat engine began to gurgle curdling the placid water of the intracoastal the sweetish tang of marine diesel came to him briefly before being borne aloft by the morning breeze salmoncolored light tinged the lateral cloud bank just above the eastern horizon soon the parade of fishing boats and pleasure yachts would lift anchor coming through here on their way to the atlantic he smelled the ocean heard the gulls and frigate birds calling but only distantly as if they were part of another world at a club called the lightning tube on washington avenue in south beach a band named manman was currently playing he checked the dates and the show times as he walked toward the hospital he imagined rachel at the lightning tube she was wearing her manman jacket and she was talking to one of the members of the band maybe a tall lean guitarist named gideon who covered her hand with his transferring a oneounce packet of coke it seemed logical better it felt right while hed slept in rachels room his unconscious had drunk in the scent of her in his mind he could see her as she had been before the renal failure he walked at her side silent as a ghost but alive as a spirit he felt the nettles of her rancorous rebellion fueled by her fathers rejection and her need to disengage herself from her mother it seemed clear to him that gideon must somehow have a hand in that rebellion tonight hed find out on the other side of the intracoastal croaker walked the three blocks north on olive avenue to eucalyptus street a police patrol car passed him slowing slightly as the driver checked him out before driving on not surprisingly croaker saw no pedestrians at all at the end of the street he went into the hospital parking lot and checked on the tbird miraculously it was untouched he was just about to enter the hospital when he heard a car door slam behind him and footfalls crunching the grit of the parking lot blacktop mr croaker he turned a tall cadaverously thin man was walking toward him he was neither sauntering nor hurrying nevertheless there was a quality about him that gave croaker pause he was dressed in a stylish cafeaulait tropicalweight suit his hair slicked back off his wide gleaming forehead was the color of freshly oiled gunmetal his face was almost all jaw for the rest a slash of a mouth a knifethin knobbed nose and eyes the color of undiluted coffee set beneath bony brows sufficed to define him as a man with both confidence and means the two did not often go together as croaker had some time ago discovered and hed learned to mark men who possessed them the man came up to him his skin was the color of polished teak and his face had a slightly latin cast he was carrying an attach so sleek and thin it seemed impractical he wore black loafers of ostrich skin a slim patek philippe wristwatch and a simple gold wedding band on his left hand very elegant you are lew croaker he smelled faintly of sandalwood and lime and you are the cadaverous man smiled showing teeth yellowed by years of tobacco smoke marcellus rojas diego majeur a business card was proffered between his fingers croaker gave it a quick read mr marcellus rojas diego majeur was an attorneyatlaw it figured croaker looked up mr majeur its what a little after six in the morning majeur crooked his left arm glanced at his patek philippe seven minutes past the hour sir to be exact croaker frowned how long have you been waiting for me since three majeur said it as if sitting in parking lots in the dead of night was routine you look fresh as a daisy thank you majeur gave a little bow mr croaker i wonder if i could have a few moments of your time not right now croaker said ive got to get upstairs yes i understand majeur nodded sorrowfully and tongue against the roof of his mouth made a clucking sound all that was missing was for him to exclaim oh dear like a beloved aged uncle some other time maybe croaker nodded give me a call im in the book another darker look appeared on majeurs face im afraid another time wont do sir not at all its now or never then itll be never croaker was about to turn away when he saw the gleam of a small caliber gun in majeurs hand it was pointing at croakers stomach no majeur said with no emotion at all it will be now croaker looked from the muzzle of the almost toylike gun to majeurs face do you expect me to believe youll shoot me here on the steps of the hospital majeur shrugged its been done before a quick smile cut across his face like lightning in a nighttime storm but not by me his dark and enigmatic gaze held croakers for some time im licensed to be armed by the way im sure you are but i very much doubt youd put yourself in that kind of jeopardy for any client majeurs bland expression never wavered that would presuppose you knew something about me you dont staring into those coffeecolored eyes croaker took a gamble cobbling together a thumbnail sketch from quick observation intuition and past experience i know what i need to know youre the kind of man for whom clients are money the larger the retainer the more youll risk the equations as simple as that if the pay is up to your standard youre detached professional committed to the end tell me how wide off the mark am i a wry smile was creasing majeurs face i can tell you that whoever said money isnt everything is not living my life as swiftly as the had appeared it was gone i apologize for alarming you i am not by nature a violent man unless severely provoked but i needed to gain your full attention mr croaker because the nature of my errand is urgent for my clientand for your niece croaker felt a small shock wave go through him what are you talking about dont play games with me sir it is an unproductive endeavor he jerked his head toward the hospital entrance ive been up to visit her you see you croaker took a menacing step toward him calmate seor he said i mean your niece no harm quite the contrary the nurses have no business i handed them my card majeurs mouth smiled youd be surprised the liberties one can exercise as an attorney i told them i represented a potential donor which is more or less the truth croaker suddenly felt chilled then feverish donor majeur leaned forward even as he lowered his voice to a stage whisper kidney donor seor i mean to say thats what your niece is in need of yes the sky was a pellucid blue high above clouds were lit up with sunlight as if they were neon signs the early morning air felt hot against croakers skin and all of a sudden he was acutely aware of where they were standing an ambulance was pulling up outside the adjacent emergency entrance and peoplemostly doctors and nurses changing shiftswere drifting in and out he looked at majeur who was waiting patient as a buddha is there anywhere we can go and talk majeurs eyes seemed to sparkle in the newly reborn sunlight i think my car will suffice he lifted an arm to indicate the way marcellus rojas diego majeurs car turned out to be a pristine turquoise mustang he smiled as he unlocked it and opened the long door which was one of the beautiful signatures of this automobile you see right off the bat we have something important in common so he knew croaker drove the vintage tbird how much else did he know croaker wondered as he peered into the interior inside as outside it was buffed and polished to perfection this man loved his car so what do you think majeur stroked the chrome it is a beauty no its beauty yes majeur gave a strange laugh a little girls high teehee want to take it for a spin he nodded as croaker looked at him sure as a verdict you do he dropped the keys into croakers hand went around to the passengers side and got in croaker hesitated for just a moment then slid behind the wheel and fired up the ignition the engine thrummed happily make a right when you get to dixie highway majeur directed as they pulled out of the lot had this been his plan all along croaker wondered had he been that sure of himself he went north on dixie made the jog left then right as it became broadway no mans land dangerous for a white man stopped at a light he risked a glance over at majeur he looked and spoke like a litigator croaker could imagine him in the courtroom fiery with indignation as he addressed the jury croaker imagined him winning far more cases than he lost majeur provided more directions and they ended up cruising slowly down a deserted street called rosemary avenue croaker had never been here before up ahead he could see the black wroughtiron fence of a cemetery park at the end of the street would you majeur said it was a no standing zone but that didnt seem to bother the attorney any when they got out croaker saw that majeur had exchanged his attach for what looked like an oldfashioned lunch box with a domed lid majeur saw the direction of croakers look and said almost apologetically breakfast with my schedule it pays to be prepared twentyfour hours a day he shrugged tomorrow never knows he led croaker across the pavement to the locked gates of the cemetery he produced a key and unlocked the gates they slipped through and he carefully relocked it sun shone and birds twittered flitting from tree to tree they strolled seemingly aimlessly down mossstrewn paths past granite headstones scrubbed dull by wind and torrential rain occasionally they passed the tattered remains of an offering the stems of flowers long dried to dust burneddown votive candles in red glass cups hungry majeur placed the lunch box atop a headstone and snapped it open this grave had a bouquet of fresh flowers atop it tightly wrapped in green florists paper as if someone had just placed it there but croaker scanning the vicinity determined they were alone in the cemetery breakfast for two majeur pulled out a pair of big cuban sandwiches of roast pork and fried onions wrapped in waxed paper he also had a thermos of rich dark cuban coffee and cuban sweet rolls i think ill pass for the moment croaker said pity i waited for you majeur was already unwrapping waxed paper from around a sandwich you could tell a lot about someone by the way they ate and the way they made love croaker had found not surprising both stemmed from a primitive place animal instincts that existed in all human beings but it was in the way in which those instincts manifested themselves that spoke of how a personality had been shaped twisted and bent what was important to it and what was not in eating and making love artifice ended and the true person began to emerge majeur was fastidious he manipulated the awkward sandwich the way croaker imagined a surgeon handled a living heart firmly delicately precisely majeur took dainty even bites out of the monstrous thing reducing it by stages to smaller and smaller squares until it was entirely consumed when he had chewed and swallowed the last bite he spun off the top of the thermos and poured coffee into the plastic top the smell of it was instantly overpowering he did not touch the sweet rolls when he was finished he did not even have to wipe his lips he rubbed his hands together and got down to business mr croaker my offer is a simple one my client has access to a healthy human kidney it is compatible with your nieces blood type and body chemistry we would of course provide all the necessary documentation for the doctori believe her name is jennifer marsh the thought that rachel had a shot at life made croaker feel woozy with elation as if hed had too much of bennies mescal but he needed to calm himself to get some assurances to make certain this wasnt some kind of scam if you have any shred of human compassion mr majeur youll tell me the truth does your client really have a compatible kidney i mean if this is bullshit well a young girls life is nothing to fuck with i can tell you i assure you it exists mr croaker and that it is available to my client from an inside breast pocket he slipped croaker a set of folded papers is this a registered kidney majeur smiled as far as unos is concerned its strictly kosher croaker had seen papers like these before jenny marsh had shown them to him just before shed administered the compatibility tests they were certificates of specificationblood type compatibility hla typing so forth because jenny marsh had shown them to him he knew rachels blood type and hla levels a match of six out of six human lymphocitic antigens would be perfect the risk of organ rejection that much less also it would be too good to be true croakers pulse rate accelerated as he saw that five out of six of the donors antigens matched rachels good god this was no joke majeur had the one thing that would save rachels life it was like a gift from god majeur bent forward from the waist and whispered as he had done at the hospital entrance so easily it will be available to your niece croaker ruffled the pages ill want to hold on to these majeur spread his hands wide by all means show them to your dr marsh check everything out my client wants you to feel secure in his promise he waited only a moment but do not take too long as i am certain dr marsh has made clear your niece has very little time remaining before even a compatible kidney will do her no good croaker scarcely heard majeur his heart was beating so fast he could hardly hear himself think the kidney was real it existed it was rachels only chance at life he could not let it slip through his fingers but what did this joker and his client have up their sleeves how does your client know about my nieces situation from dr marsh i believe majeur held out one hand palm up indirectly shes made quite a number of phone calls on your nieces behalf renal pathology is a kind of closed community so the word spread quite rapidly he has many physician friends and your client is majeur smiled for reasons that will shortly become apparent he wishes to remain anonymous sorry croaker said i dont do business with anyone by that name oh come now sir majeur spread his arms back north in new york city you dealt with many an anonymous source criminals majeur stroked his temple with a forefinger not all of them surely croaker stared at him silent majeur was unperturbed in any case i dont believe you have any choice in this matter he waited an appropriate moment and croaker had another flash of him dramatically addressing a jury in closing arguments not that is unless you want rachel to die his first use of rachels name was as shocking as a splash of cold water in croakers face and she will die sir without that kidney dr marshand others i have no doubthave confirmed that croaker said nothing for a very long time dimly like a background wash he could hear the traffic picking up on broadway rap music raw and searing on a boom box waxed and waned drifting away on the sunshine here in the cemetery it was unnaturally still and getting hotter by the minute croaker stirred okay say your client does have access to a kidney thats compatible how much does he want for it im not a millionaire though my sisters got access to money oh its not money majeur said no no nothing like that in fact my client would like you to keep the keys to the mustang i dont think so tangible evidence of his sincerity and good will majeur carefully stuffed the used waxed paper back into the lunch box there are no strings attached i assure you he poured himself more coffee ownership papers are in the glove compartment youll find them in order i assure you the car is yours no matter what may eventuate then he looked up at croaker and smiled his most benign smile the one he reserved for the members of the jury the one theyd undoubtedly take back with them to their deliberations take it sir i know my client it would be an offense if you refused his gift by that one simple statement majeur was telling croaker all he needed to know about the mysterious client he was rich he was powerful he had considerable influence he was generous probably honorable quite possibly without scruples whats the quid pro quo for the kidney majeur nodded as if he approved of the decision croaker had made before i begin my client wants you to know that it was his wish to donate this kidney to your niece free and clear unfortunately circumstances make that largesse impossible his forefinger tapped the front of the headstone you see this croaker looked at the granite marker it said theresa marquesa barbacena may grace and mercy follow her forever as you can see theresa was twentysix when she died majeur closed the lunch box slowly and silently when she was murdered his hands were clasped loosely atop the lunch box like attendants awaiting further instructions what relationship was the girl to your client it was majeurs turn to keep his own silent counsel croaker took a deep breath so in return for the kidney your client wants me to find out who murdered her oh no sir majeur had clearly reached the climax of his summation my client already knows who killed her her husband one juan garcia barbacena he killed her by beating her insensate then tying an electrical cord around her neck and squeezing until her tongue popped out of her mouth and blood leaked from her eyes majeur was a master he waited just long enough for croaker to have digested the grisly details of the murder before he went on and do you know why he killed her sir he shook his head it was for the most banal of reasons he had a mistress and theresa found out about it instead of going to someone who could help hersomeone such as my clientand allowing him to act on it in his own time and manner she confronted juan garcia she threatened himverbally not physically i assure you she was not that kind of person and in response he promptly killed her sounds like an openandshut case croaker said if what you say is true it is true croaker continued on relentlessly if you have sufficient evidence you or your client should go to the police majeur sighed mr croaker in the best of all possible worlds that would already have happened juan garcia barbacena would already be incarcerated that pause again croaker was getting to know this mans persuasive style but this is not the best of all possible worlds it is reality and the reality of this situation is that no matter juan garciasevil no matter his culpability in this crime he will never be charged let alone arraigned majeurs fingers curled around the smooth granite headstone of theresa marquesa barbacena as if by that gesture he could somehow gentle her restless spirit this man is protected even from the direct force of my client there is a wall around him none can penetrate he held up a finger almost none a slow creeping had begun along croakers spine as premonition began inexorably to align itself with reality in a voice that raised the hairs on croakers forearms majeur concluded his summation you sir can get to him my client is convinced of it here in a nutshell is his proposal in return for the kidney that will save rachels life you will penetrate juan garcia barbacenas defenses and you will kill him im not going to kill croaker said for you or anyone else majeurs offer wasnt a gift from god he thought it was a deal with the devil i see majeur put his hand on the front fender of the turquoise mustang with the same force of feeling he might fondle a naked thigh they were standing outside the gates to the cemetery which the attorney had relocked from this vantage point they could just make out the bright spray of color of the fresh flowers laid at the grave of theresa marquesa barbacena that sentiment will come as a shock to the family of ajucar martinez with a tremor of achy recognition croakers mind flew back a decade martinez was a monster hed killed five hookers by the time i caught up to him slashed their foreheads and cheeks cut off their breasts before he slit their throats you shot him dead majeur said coolly yes i did croaker was no longer surprised at the depth of information majeur had unearthed about him even though much of it was classified and so extremely difficult to obtain majeurs first contact with croaker was part of a major operation these people were clearly not fooling around he came after me with his straight razor blew his face right off i shot him in the knee first croaker said it wasnt enough majeur threw the domelidded lunch box into the mustangs backseat then there was dunston mcgriff another psycho croaker recalled raped his stepsister after he had ripped out her heart and ate it then he went on a killing spree four dead six injured thirtyoughteight shotgun was his weapon of choice majeur settled himself against the fender of the mustang sunlight spun dizzyingly off its highly polished surface one bullet through the temple another through his neck a crack marksmans kill you iced him clean had to he was about to take out my partner majeur folded his arms across his chest closed his eyes and put his face up into the sun and now we come to rodrigo impremata croaker looked at majeur the attorney had been ever so successful in resurrecting the old days events that croaker had buried deep in his psyche strode through his conscious mind like a host jackbooted and bristling with the weaponry of war what is this a laundry list an accounting of the dead majeur said if my sources are correct don rodrigo ran the coke cartel in new yorks barrio for many years also it seems he ordered your father killed any discrepancies so far none that i know of croaker waited for the other shoe to drop surely majeur must know about his freelance career with the feds majeur nodded in this age of prevarication and shifting culpability i appreciate your candor sir surely i do he tilted his face more fully into the sunshine the don was the worst kind of egomaniac wasnt he as he amassed power he brought reckless danger to everyone around him even his colleagues wished him dead but the don was too clever for them he kept them weak and warring among themselves majeurs eyes snapped open catching sight of croaker staring at him which is where you came in some bright spark who knewor suspectedthat the don had had your father wiped leaked you some key informationa hole in the dons formidable defenses through which a man of your abilities and determination could slip majeur cocked his head to one side how am i doing croaker shrugged noncommittally but inside he was roiling he thought he was over the bitter feelings the don had awakened in him he thought he had come out the other side of that particular maelstrom thats sort of the semiofficial story majeurs gaze drifted off through the iron bars to theresas grave on the other hand there are thoseand i must confess to belonging to this campwho believe you already knew who had your father whacked i mean to say you certainly did enough investigating on your own time majeurs gaze snapped back to croaker he was looking for confirmation when he got none he went on anyway as this version goes it was you who went to the dons bitterest rival and cut a deal he rolls over on the don and you take the sonuvabitch out neat clean everybodys interests are served now croaker could see that majeur had done so much more than resurrect his past he had evoked not merely remote events pressed into the pages of a scrapbook he had also managed to conjure up the emotions croaker had painstakingly interred in the dark recesses of his mind croaker was reliving the red rage of revenge that had gripped him like a hurricanedriven tide he would have done anything to bring his fathers killer to justiceand had majeur levered himself off the car tell me how old were you when this incident occurred twenty croaker said if it happened like you said oh it happened just as i related it majeur opened the mustangs door you know it and i know it he gave croaker a thin smile so lets save ourselves some time here you have the essential qualities you are both skilled and resourceful hey tell you what when i need a job reference ill call you majeur gave him a wry look he was still in summation no sarcastic bit of business was going to derail him from his appointed task you know what they say about killing a human beingeither you can do it or you cant period i believe you have amply demonstrated that you know how to kill a man in fact one could say that you are an expert at it my abilities are not at issue croaker said if i killed in the past there were damn good reasons for it a those perps deserved it and two i had no other choice with martinez and mcgriff you may have a point majeur said but not with the don there youre wrong croaker told him we never could get anything on the don no matter how hard we tried he kept slipping through our fingers like an eel as if he knew what we were up to before we knew ourselves he nodded and youre right i did a shitload of detective work on the don he had my father killed no doubt of it but the people who spoke to me were too scared to go to the cops and testify and even if i had the proof the don would walk he was wired into the nypd all the way downtown he was an untouchable and in the meantime kids were dying from the shit he was selling there was no other way majeur stood very close to him in the growing heat of the morning the smells of masculine cologne and sweat were suddenly rife there was no other way he was an untouchable majeur whispered the echo in other words he was protected on all sides and in just that way croaker felt the trap snap shut on him he looked into majeurs coffee brown eyes and felt the full brunt of the attorneys intensity just like juan garcia barbacena is an untouchable protected on all sides majeurs hands lifted and fell madre de dios the filthy pig killed his wife in cold blood in the full flower of her life you think he didnt know just what he was doing you dont know juan garcia barbacena worth a shit he is don rodrigo impremata all over again blood had risen into majeurs face darkening his skin to the color of stained mahogany whether or not barbacena committed the crime croaker saw quite clearly that majeur believed he was guilty maybe croaker had gained an insight into the attorney maybe he wasnt just a cold and clever mercenary working the anatomy of the bigger buck he wasnt perfect either he hadnt uttered one word about croakers ties to the actf this had to mean he didnt know i have only your sayso for that croaker said he was aware how with each exchange majeur was leading him deeper and deeper down this particular path but he didnt see that he had much choice rachel had to have that kidney and if majeur was telling him the truth about barbacena treading morally suspect ground was new to him despite majeurs magical mystery tour of his nypd past on one point croaker was clear he had been justified in each homicide he had committed this situation with juan garcia barbacena was another matter altogether he needed some time to check things out and to think but time was the one commodity he couldnt afford rachels condition wouldnt wait for every i to be dotted every t to be crossed some things one must take on good faith majeur said believe me sir we have not lost sight of your nieces welfare i need some time talk to dr marsh let her check out your documentation you have twentyfour hours majeur said at that time we trust you will be prepared to move forward dr marsh will want to be sure this organ exists majeur smiled can and will be done he nodded on the back of my business card you will find a handwritten number you may reach me anytime anywhere within the next twentyfour hours that is a guarantee sir a tangible example of our good faith majeur gave croaker a stern look twentyfour hours this is all the grace period my client is prepared to give you this piqued the detective in croaker in something of a rush isnt he as is your rachel majeur shrugged as it happens my client does have a most pressing deadline he stepped closer to croaker and lowered his voice though who he was afraid could hear him but the dead souls and the seagulls that guarded them was anyones guess at midnight tomorrow juan garcia barbacena arrives in miami under a massive security blackout he stays for twelve hours only while he holds highlevel business meetings when and where are closely held secrets it is during this period you must terminate him croaker felt the sweat break out along his spine youre giving me nexttoimpossible odds i wouldnt have nearly enough time calm yourself mr croaker the moment you give me your assent you will receive a veritable torrent of details on barbacenas itinerary the number of his bodyguards the extent of their weapons as well as a complete workup of his preferences for food clothing shelter and sex you see we have no intention of throwing you to the crocodiles mr croaker sure of yourself arent you certain events in a mans life are inevitable majeur stuck out his hand when croaker took it he said with a surprising amount of genuine feeling i entrust the mustang into your hands without reservations enjoy it fully sir back at the hospital parking lot croaker dropped the lawyer off watched him climb into a new lincoln continental in the metallic grape color so popular in florida he jotted down the license plate number before parking the mustang he unlocked the glove compartment inside he found papers of ownership and registration for the mustang both were already made out in his name including his address and social security number what didnt these people know about him the transfer of ownership form listed marcellus rojas diego majeur as the previous owner no mention anywhere of any other name such as majeurs mysterious client upstairs in the ccd he checked on rachel matty was in the cubicle and she shook her head no change he could see the terror lurking in his sisters eyes and his stomach turned over croaker went to the nurses station in search of jenny marsh but she was in the or and was expected to be there most of the day with four succeeding procedures hed have to wait to see her until their dinner date at ten that night he stuck his head back into the cubicle to take a long look at rachel lying peaceful and halfdead her mother tense and tightlipped beside her there was also a distinguishedlooking man with gray hair and an oldfashioned pencil mustache he turned and gave croaker a brief nod matty introduced him as dr ronald stansky rachels personal physician the two men shook hands i was just telling mrs duke that i have a certain amount of pull at the united network of organ sharing he murmured in a hushed voice as if he might wake the patient perhaps there is something i can do that would be great croaker said but i was under the impression that unos was sacrosanct yes of course dr stansky wore a tropicalweight sharkskin suit a neatly pressed white shirt a dark conservative tie and the oily mien of an undertaker i didnt mean to suggest i could just ring up and have them pluck out a kidney dear me no disturbed he traced the line of his mustache with the tip of a long elegant forefinger then he brightened but friends are friends and i have no doubt they will make their best efforts on our behalf he squeezed mattys hand dont you lose hope he whispered to her croaker tapped stansky on the arm could i see you outside doctor of course dr stansky said croaker gave matty an encouraging smile as he held the curtain back for the doctor outside he said dr stansky my sister tells me you examined rachel six months ago thats true away from matty dr stanskys almost obsequious demeanor dissolved like ice in sunlight revealed beneath was a flintlike intransigence most often brandished like a weapon by wary people in unfamiliar circumstance and dr stansky looked aggrieved at this obvious waste of his valuable time she came because the school she is attending required it she was not ill this was like wrenching water from a rock go on dr stansky spread his elegantly manicured hands the test results were normal in every way croaker shook his head doctor im curious about something how is it that your tests didnt discover that rachel was smoking pot and cocaine and dropping psychedelics i understand that you were once a detective on the new york city police force dr stanskys eyes were like hollow pits into which all genuine human emotion vanished like a stone in a well croaker harbored a strong suspicion this was a trait taught in medical school along with anatomy and cytology why ask a question to which you already know the answer i wanted to hear what you had to say dr stansky was bristling now it is childs play to pass a physical he waggled a finger in warning as if he were a professor before an abruptly unruly class it happens every day of the week in every city in the country its outrageous but thats the reality of it but you understand shes drug dependent now croaker had not meant it as a question and he was met with stony silence getting a physician to admit a mistake was tantamount to cajoling god into conceding somewhere along the line in mans creation hed erred thank you doctor i appreciate your candor dr stansky misinterpreting irony for apology pursed his lips in what may have been stiff acceptance croaker spoke to matty briefly he longed to tell her about his interview with the mysterious lawyer majeur but he didnt have the heart how cruel to get her hopes up if he couldnt go through with the deal or if majeur was running a scam but he did tell her he was continuing to work with his government contacts to try to secure a kidney not exactly the truth yet but not a lie either as he left the hospital croaker considered where he would sleep that night it was too far to drive back to his house in islamorada and the idea of staying with matty in harbour pointe gave him the willies overbred highrises like that were no place for him he dug in his pocket and discovered he still had the keys to sonias house hed neglected to give them back to bennie he went through the parking lot to the tbird turning over the notion of staying in el portal he opened the trunk punched in a number on a small keypad hed installed himself a hidden door opened and he extracted a padded briefcase inside was a small laptop computer he hooked it up to his cell phone used the internal modem to dial up the state motor vehicle database the software asked for an access code and he typed in a number rocky saguas a detective lieutenant buddy on the metrodade police force had given him he got in and punched in the license number hed copied off majeurs lincoln continental the system was jammed up typical he switched to bell south and using the same code gave them the phone number of sonias dying friend nestor a moment later nestors full name and address popped onto the screen it was not far from sonias in el portal he disconnected and got rolling the town center mall was on glades road one of the two major eastwest arteries that ran from one end of boca raton to the other the mall itself was between butts road and st andrews boulevard one of those vast complexes that virtually defined the east coast of florida despite his morning shower croaker had been in the same clothes two days straight and he was about to project a halo of body odor like the rings of saturn he went shopping at the gap for underwear a couple of pairs of lightweight trousers that needed no alterations and a halfdozen assorted polos and shortsleeved shirts he felt neat and clean by the time he strolled back into the mall and ran right into rafe roubinnet the owner of the shark bar hey compadre as usual heads turned at the rolling thunder of his voice it seemed to croaker that rafe was still at heart a politician from what he understood rafe had done a more than creditable job as mayor of miami there were many whod wanted him to run for reelection but hed declined never giving a reason like being a cop politics took its own toll you never knew when youd burn out just the man i wanted to see roubinnet his blue eyes flashing pulled croaker out of the mainstream of the malls pedestrian traffic he wore white jeans a blueandwhite striped shortsleeved shirtr and docksides without socks he had the kind of muscleswell cut not as big as your headthat made most womens eyes cross but he was totally unselfconscious about them i heard a good one the other day roubinnet went on restaurateurs and politicans croaker thought they both love a good joke preferably dirty and rafe was at the top of the list jokes were his major sideline he seemed to have a warehouse of them maybe he got them from his customers there was this eskimo see one day he gets into his snowmobile and heads into town just as he gets to the outskirts the snowmobile develops engine trouble so the eskimo glides into a nearby service station the mechanic comes out takes a long look at the snowmobile then looks at the eskimo and says blew a seal and the eskimo says nah thats frost on my mustache croaker laughed good one rafe he was always aware of how rafes head and shoulders stuck out as he maneuvered through the crowds he must have been murder to guard when he was mayor croaker clapped the tall man on the back its really good to see you away from the bar whatre you doing off the keys provisioning myself roubinnet laughed ah well every once in a while i like to come north and see how the other half of the worlds living to roubinnet up north meant boca raton but with the fishing so good im surprised to find you here im tending to personal business my niece is very ill my condolences compadre roubinnet put a hand on croakers shoulder anything i can do not unless you can find me a kidney for transplant that matches my nieces antigens i was known as something of a magician when i was mayor roubinnet said but this is a bit out of my league sorry forget it its not your worry but where are you staying up here im not sure yet his hand slid around the set of keys bennie had given to him all of a sudden he found hed made up his mind no ill stay at a friends house in el portal roubinnets face split in a smile ah now theres a district with history and stylewith soul he shook his head sadly the nineties has no styleno soul instead theres this big gaping pit into which has fallen all of the musty crap from the fifties sixties seventies and eighties recycled like a bad dream do you take my meaning clothes music the new hip phraseseven recreation video games are back and so is pinballvery lowtech beat poetrys returned to its status as being tragically hip and coffeehouses are cool again which reminds me id better get out all my old kerouac he laughed roubinnet had the kind of laugh that made you want to laugh along with him a natural politicians innate gift his mood quickly sobered theres worse though drugwise heroins in again he gave croaker a rueful shake of his head all in all consider this im telling you its the invasion of the cultural bodysnatchers they walked out of the mall heat humidity and brilliant sunshine hit them like a fist they began to stroll toward their cars croaker spent a bad couple of moments debating with himself he did not want to involve anyone in this deal with majeur but he desperately needed information and when it came to the scoop on people in southern florida rafe roubinnet was the man his stint as mayor of miami had made him privy to the inner workings of the city and indeed the state as a whole that few people got to glimpse let alone master and consensus was that roubinnet had mastered them that meant he knew the dirt on everyone who mattered in floridaand probably all of central and south america as well when they got past the jostle of people croaker said ive got something to ask you shoot you know an attorney named marcellus rojas diego majeur roubinnets clear blue eyes looked startled lew mi compadre is this a casual inquiry or something of a more substantive nature croaker met roubinnets gaze the latter the restaurateur pursed his lips in that case may i ask what kind of deep water you have ventured into his gaze was as intense as it was curious im not sure yet croaker admitted whats the deal with majeur roubinnet looked off into the distance where valets for tgi fridays were busily parking cars this counselor is hardwired into the colombian drug lordsnot the ones whove been taken down recently with all the fanfare and press coverage no no majeurs clientele is so discreet they dont seem to exist i mean even the professional vultures at hard copy dont have a clue these boys are on the face of the planet meaning meaning roubinnet said that his clients are protected at such a high level you get up there and right away you get a helluva nose bleed if youre stupid enough to ask too many questions about them they cart you away on a stretcher and chances are rich youre never heard from again croaker thought about this for a moment what about a man named juan garcia barbacena doesnt ring a bell roubinnet said but something in his eyes didnt quite match his studied nonchalance if youd heard of him youd tell me wouldnt you the blue eyes held steady that was the politician in him certainly compadre croaker shook his head impatiently rafe this is me its okay for you to turn off the bullshit machine i resent that roubinnet said i dont know why croaker replied the machines got your name on it hey compadre back off a pace okay sorry rafe but im in a helluva bind and what kind of bind there was genuine concern on roubinnets face now look lew you went to bat for me i dont forget things like that whatever i can do to get you out of this situation just say the word barbacena those blue eyes showed a snarl of unknown emotion take it from me lew you dont want to know about this man im afraid i dont have a choice is this true im very much afraid it is roubinnet waited while a pack of qtipsretirees with white hair and white shoesmade their agonizingly slow way to their car abruptly impatient he took croaker aside into the shade of a stand of trees that divided the parking lot do you know what youre doing compadre croaker didnt want to think about dire warnings now even from roubinnet the truth was he couldnt afford to not when rachels life was hanging in the balance if taking down juan garcia barba cena was the only way he could save rachels life hed do it maybe jenny marsh would present another alternative at dinner or one of dr stanskys colleagues would come through with a suitable kidney but croaker knew these were long shots without real odds like it or not reality was resolving itself down a single path if at his dinner with jenny marsh she okayed the paperwork on the kidney majeur had given him hed call the lawyer and accept his deal rachel was running out of time rafe he said softly just do me a favor and tell me what you know about this man roubinnet looked around him at the brilliant sunshine flooding the treelined parking lot this is not making me happy lew and i have to say im doing you no favor granted and noted roubinnet pulled him deeper into the shade of the trees beyond in the drenching sunshine cars rolled up and down the aisles like sharks along a reef listen to me lew roubinnet said in a low voice barbacena is a devil hes a man who controls many things drugs are just one of them remember i said that heroin was the new drug of the moment thats his good fortune hes got ties into the far east opium factories that turn out highgrade heroin hes so low profile hes positively invisible one of those few people no one can get to you mean hes protected precisely so okay by whom politicians government they use him to keep control on rebellions revolutions that kind of shit throughout all of latin america anyone down there needs arms they call barbacena hes the man huh lew ive come to know that look its the one you had when you went after those goons who were putting the squeeze on me hell man youve got to take this seriously this guys the real thing roubinnet lowered his voice barbacena is tight with all the rebel leaders all the dissident commanders all the wannaberulers generals tinpot dictators they kowtow to him because hes their supply line and whatever secrets they tell him whatever plans they have he passes on to his contacts in the south american governments in return the government protects him unconditionally he does whatever the hell he pleases and they turn a blind eye get this they even sell him arms and take a kickback percentage of his profits why not they get fabulously rich off each other its the way the world works croaker waited a very long time a line of sweat rolled down the back of his neck rafe someone wants this man dead badly he grunted im not surprised from what i hear barbacenas made so many enemies they could form their own country the whole power trip has gone to his head he believes in the illusion of his own invulnerability no one is invulnerable in this day and age croaker waited while another group of qtips went slowly by rafe do you know who has ordered his death i dont know compadre but i could fill a whole legal pad with suspects whatever i dont think well have to wait long to see if they make good on their order word is barbacenas arriving here in miami tomorrow at midnight about that i may need to get close enough to barbacena to do some sniffing around croaker said if so ill need all the help you can give me surprise was not a word in roubinnets lexicon he nodded just say the word barbacena is no friend of mine he grasped croakers hand in his firm politicians grip for you compadre anything on the way down to el portal croaker used the computer to dial into the motor vehicle database again this time he got through the grapecolored lincoln was a rental from a local company croaker didnt know whether or not to be surprised he got the companys address and closed down since he was just north and east of the location he decided to go there now he exited the highway at atlantic boulevard and took it west to margate was an old basically workingclass area west of ft lauderdale he turned into a strip mall on the east side of in front of him were in succession a cuban restaurant a place that sold graveyard monuments and a shopfront with blackedout windows called the margate gun racquet club he had to laugh the name was a wicked jab in the ribs at those condo complexes in more precious areas like boca that used yacht racquet club in their names though they were in fact neither at the southern end of the strip mall was gold coast exotic auto rentals when he went in there was a young woman behind the counter she was chewing gum while leafing through a recent copy of allure otherwise the place was deserted flyspecked and sunbleached posters of porsches ferraris lamborghinis lincolns and the like were tacked to the walls which were panels of plastic with a woodgrain finish a couple of cheap swaybacked couches and an old fashioned metal ashtray stand were what passed for furniture a plastic ficus tree drooping in accumulated dust stood like an arthritic pensioner by the front window the place had the unmistakable air of quiet desperation the young woman looked up at his approach she was no more than twenty with permed blonde hair bright eyes and pink fingernails as long as knife blades hi im vonda she pointed to a tag that gave her name vonda shepherd croaker introduced himself id like some info on a latemodel grapecolored lincoln continental vondas head bobbed like one of those little dogs on the back shelf of a car let me check inventory no no he told her im not interested in renting i want to know whos rented one from you recently why her voice had turned wary was it in an accident not to my knowledge she popped her gum then i guess youre outta luck he showed her a badge and her eyes widened oh wow vonda this is very important and i can guarantee your bossll never find out gee id like to help you then by all means you dont know my boss see the girl who was here before me she didnt follow the rules and she got shitcanned she shook her head of bright curls i cant show you anything without that court order she laughed nervously as she pulled at her pink shortsleeved blouse im sorry she looked so wistful standing there croaker felt sorry for her pent up in this rat trap of a job he could read her face because hed seen so many like her right now she wanted nothing more than to get in her car and drive off wherever she might end up she wouldnt care all she wanted was to feel the wind in her face and to be away from this drag of a strip mall you come back with a court order itll be out of my hands she said ill show you whatever you want to see court order he mused sounds like thiss happened to you before not to me she said tell me something vonda he rested his elbows on the countertop would you know one if you saw one i sure would she dug out three sheets of coffeestained paper stapled together tapped them with her clawlike fingernail my boss gave me this copy of one if it doesnt look just like this he told me its a fake he nodded showing her he was impressed your boss sure seems to have covered all the bases he also seemed inordinately concerned about court orders whats his name trey merli she spelled it for him automatically as if she was used to doing it with a name like that he wasnt surprised thanks for your help he paused on his way to the door as if just remembering something by the way what time do you close sixthirty sharp back outside he climbed into the tbird and slipped in an everly brothers tape as the music played he went east to i got on heading south he dug out majeurs business card and on a hunch used the computer to hook into bell south he spent some time getting access then gave the software the number where majeur assured croaker he could be reached night or day he glanced at the processing message it was clearly going to take some time to run down the number he put the computer on standby mode by the time he got to el portal hed replaced the everly brothers with jay and the americans jay black started to sing only in america sonias fiveyearold camaro still sat in her carport it had a green and blue save the manatee sticker on its rear window he sat for a moment listening to the tbirds engine tick over every so often the shouts of kids on bicycles floated on the gentle breeze down the block cars on ne second avenue passed with uneventful sighs he stared at the house with its pale blue trim and its cement seahorses out on the front lawn the fountain they were holding up seemed to represent sonias life it was cracked and empty a void waiting to be repaired and filled waiting for the bright flicker of wings the soft cheep of songbirds perched on its beautifully curved rim how little it would have taken to repair that fountain and how little it would have taken to make sonia happy now neither would happen the mossy seahorses and their cracked fountain seemed the very embodiment of the melancholy that hung suspended over the place as if sonias restless spirit were still here waiting to be set free maybe like bennies grandfather she could not make the journey to the nether world until whoever had murdered her had been brought to justice the bonita twins when it got so hot that the sweat began to roll down croakers back he got out of the car and went up onto the porch from there he could see past sonias bedroom awning to the side of the house next door it was pink stucco with a threefoothigh layer of bricks set in a grapefruit tree in dire need of pruning overhung its near corner he put the key in the lock turned it over inside he could still smell her scent stronger now as if the haunting were real and not a romantic figment of his imagination sonia he said it softly gently and knowing that she would not answer did not make his voicing her name any less imperative im here he said feeling not in the least bit foolish ive come back the pent air seemed thick and cloying as if sonia had used the last of its oxygen during her violent death croaker passed the vividly colored furniture on his way to unlock and throw open every window in the house in sonias bedroom he kicked off his shoes and threw himself on the bed the soft afternoon breeze floated in through the open windows and the awning on the front window deflected enough of the early afternoon sun to keep the room deliciously cool the recognition of the bright caribbean colors in sonias bedroom sent a pang of sadness and loss through him he turned through the open side window he heard an announcers voice busily describing in detail a video replay of an accident in a nascar auto race curious he got off the bed and pressed his nose to the screen he found himself looking through the overgrown grapefruit tree into the side of the pink stucco and brick house next door someone was listening to espn croaker glanced at his watch and something clicked in his mind he padded around the bed and went out of the house as he knocked on the front door of the pink stucco and brick house he felt his pulse quicken this was more or less the time of the afternoon when sonia had been killed if someone was home and watching tv today chances were theyd have been doing the same yesterdaythe day of the murder he shook his head as he knocked on the door again it finally opened and croaker found himself looking at a moonfaced man in a wheelchair he looked to be in his midfifties darkskinned and balding with nubby gray tufts of hair over his ears and down the back of his neck his eyes were watery possibly from staring at the tv all day his shoulders were well developed and the hands that lay in his lap were huge and thickfingered he looked up at croaker expectantly what can i do for you from behind him the espn announcer was talking excitedly about ambulances yellow caution flags and totaled cars sorry to take you away from your show croaker stuck out his right hand my names lew croaker im a friend of sonia villalobos you know your nextdoor neighbor oh sure my wife knows her better than i do the man in the wheelchair stuck out his hand my names leyes pablo leyes come on in if you like i could do with the company then his gaze strayed to croakers biomechanical hand and he nodded again ive got a little something cool to drink where sonias house was bright and sunny this place was dominated by shadowed gloom heavy brownandwhite batik drapes stood guard alongside windows overhung by aluminum awnings all the colors were shades of brown the rooms were neat and clean everything arranged just so but the furniture dated back to the late s and early s and seemed nearly as neglected as the grapefruit tree outside without refinishing and professional repair most of it would have shown its age a decade ago now the brown tweed sofas were tattered and worn on seat cushions and arms a couple of chairs had poorly mended armrests and the dining room table had legs so scratched the unstained wood was exposed white as bone leyes had wheeled himself adroitly across floors bared to accommodate his disability carpets and rugs would have slowed him down he emerged from the kitchen with a tray on his lap it contained a large plastic pitcher of what appeared to be lemonade and a pair of cheap glasses with little pastelcolored flowers on them he nodded toward the scarred wooden coffee table would you mind croaker took the portable computer off the table it was on set to an internet web site when espn gets dull i like to surf the internet leyes slid the tray onto the table and taking up the remote killed the sound on the tv all kinds of fascinating stuff to learn apparently he didnt want to miss a minute of the car crashs aftermath cant take the place of going out and doing though i was always a doer yknow he poured the chilled liquid and handed croaker a glass looks like key limeade smells like it too he winked but im here to tell you it packs a mighty wallop croaker took a long thirsty pull and dropped to one of the sofas as if impelled by the eyewatering strength of the drink he thought he ought to get the recipe for bennie thats homemade rum youre drinking son oneten proof the real stuff leyes laughed as he stroked the meat of one arm my estrella makes it believe it or not he waved a hand well my wifes more than capable anytime youre sick in body or in spirit estrellas the one to see shes got quite a reputation justified as hell too i might say you just ask anyone at jiffy tyme cleaners go on everyone on biscayne boulevard knows her leyes had drained his glass and taking up the pitcher he topped off croakers glass then refilled his own he leaned forward in his wheelchair and pointed at croakers biomechanical hand is it true what they say croaker knew what he meant i still feel my real fingers sometimes and in my dreams my hand is whole and beautiful as an opened rose leyes nodded worked as a lineman for bell south fell off a damn pole stupid filthy accident he slammed meaty fists into his thighs i was supervisor for a while but it wasnt the same you know what i mean they meant well i guess but it was a bullshit job all the same pushing papers staring at computer screens christ like to blow your brains out stay at that til you retire he returned to stroking his arm to comfort himself croaker supposed i keep asking estrella if she like go back to paraguay she doesnt though i would never been there but ive heard so many of her stories i feel like i have his expression turned wistful asuncions a lot less dangerous than it is around here he shook his head and slurped his drink think its not a worry pretty dangerous down by biscayne boulevard i wouldnt let estrella out after dark over there i can assure you they say in the fifties n sixties you could hang out at eightysixth and biscayne all night at the club his colorless eyes focused on croaker that place was something famous as hell open all the damn night but come seven in the morning theyd throw everybody out into the parking lot for a half hour so they could sweep the joint thats where the phrase eightysix this guy came from he laughed no damn fiction id like to ask you a question mr leyes its about yesterday were you here all afternoon sure was right here watching espn he smiled always the same my days its okay that way i know what to expect you were alone yep estrella works nine to five croaker leaned forward did you see or hear anything well i thought i heard something like leyess moon face screwed up in concentration so badly he looked like he wanted to swallow his nose dunno really i thought maybe an engine then i figured it was coming from the tv races you know he worried his lower lip later on maybe that night i thought no it was more like a generator a generator could you tell where it was coming from seems to me it was from outside miss villaloboss house the front mr leyes shook his head nan that was the odd thing it was this side between her house and mine that was the area croaker thought where he and bennie had found the parallel drag marks on the soft wet ground what do you think was making this sound mr leyes leyes put the cold glass against the meat of his arm maybe it was coming from the panel truck croakers heart seemed to skip a beat what panel truck leyes shook his head the white one it was pulled up on the concrete path at the side of her house what time was this let me see that scrunchedup face again id make it after one and before twothirty i remember what races was on thats how i keep track of the time croaker said slowly and carefully did you notice anything about the panel truck other than its color its year make or model the license plate it was white like i said leyes said had a florida tag for sure i remember the colors dont know what kinda truck it was though except it was american not one of those japanese brands how about any writing on it croaker asked was it municipal did it have a company name leyes shook his head no no writing at all that i could see anything else anything at all yeah leyes said come to think of it there was this little decal on the back it was the outline of a triangle inside a circle croaker did not go immediately back to sonias instead he took the tbird across el portal to the address bell south had given him for nestor sonias dancer friend as he drove he was all but deaf to the music coming out of his speakers he was thinking of what mr leyes had seen on the back of the white vanthe triangle within a circle one of the two symbols that had been written in blood inside sonias refrigerator one of the four magic signs guarani healers took when they were initiated into heta i the bonita twins had been taken in and trained in ritual and magic by bennies grandfather yet clearly they were no healers they were reavers unlike the vast majority of the houses in el portal which were neat and trim and freshly painted nestors was in gross need of repair a handymans special if it had been listed for sale the original stucco was crumbling revealing here and there the underpinnings of the concrete block skeleton hard to discern just what the color had once been now it had been reduced to the dull pallor of oatmeal a mahoganyskinned woman opened the door to his insistent knock like to wake the dead with a hand like that she said by way of admonition and you are lew croaker im a friend of sonia villalobos still she hesitated until a watery voice from the interior said its all right mrs leyes let him in she was a handsome woman looking a decade younger than her husband with huge coffeecolored eyes high cheekbones and a generous mouth a thick crop of hair was tied at the nape of her neck with a handworked silver pin it was black save for a white streak like nighttime lightning down the center an odd assortment of smells assailed him the sickly sour odor of the infirm mingled with the cleansing scents of cedar peppermint and rosemary these last rose in slender tendrils from the center of a bronze brazier on a side table estrella leyes stood aside a small woman with a fiery countenance but she was as quick to smile as to defend im sorry she said as she closed the door behind him but nestor has trouble with his bills pobrecito a phlegmy laugh erupted from the corner of the room what she means is im broke i havent enough money left even to pay my rent but thats okay i dont have much life left either the voice belonged to a man who like the house was in a shocking stage of disrepair his affliction however was irreversible skeletal white as a corpse he reclined on a dusty rattan chaise lounge that had been overlaid with dingy sheets and rucked cotton blankets a network of blue veins could be seen pulsing slowly just beneath the tissuethin veneer of his skin hush now estrella leyes said where will that kind of talk get you nestor swiveled a head around on a stalklike neck one step ahead of the process servers once not so long ago he must have been an exceptionally handsome man he had a high wide forehead and an aquiline nose but prolonged high fevers had robbed his wideapart eyes of most of their color and when hed danced surely hed not been afflicted with the rubicund sores that pocked his cheeks and lips he was as scabbed over as a chronic drunkard who cant keep his balance i think you should be in a hospital croaker said if you dont have insurance i could speak to some oh i could get hooked up to tubes nestor said i could engage life support with all the fervor of a baptist to water he smiled and raised one enervated hand but why trust to blind science when i have mrs leyes to heal me now i do insist you keep still estrella leyes threw a cautionary look over her shoulder at croaker as she admonished nestor you need to husband all your strength an odd phrase to apply to me but i take your meaning nonetheless nestors head dropped back to striped pillows damp with sweat what mrs leyes means to say mr croaker is that she doesnt trust you to observe the secrets of her healing arts no doubt because of the advanced nature of his infirmity he had developed the disconcerting habit of speaking with his eyes closed in this manner he seemed no more than a bizarre puppet being manipulated by an unseen force nonsense estrella leyes exclaimed though she took a protective step toward a large reed basket that sat atop a round table mrs leyes croaker said gently if it will put your mind at ease i just spoke with your husband he told me rather proudly of your reputation as a healer a shy smile spread across estrella leyess face si thats pablo as she began to unload items from her reed basket nestor said i havent seen sonia today how is she fine croaker said but since she was called away on business she asked me to stop by thats most kind of you nestor said out of the corner of his eye croaker could see that estrella leyes had turned to give him a dark and penetrating look he wanted to smile to reassure her but was disconcerted to find that he could not he seemed drawn in by her mesmerizing gaze until her eyes welled up with tears and she gave a stifled sob nestor turned his head and his pale eyes opened mrs leyes nothing pobre she shook her head not trusting herself to look at him i dropped a powder thats all nestor sighed and his eyes slid closed as if he no longer had the strength to keep the lids open as mrs leyes prepared her herbs and powders he dropped into a deep sleep the diseases exhaust him utterly estrella leyes said in sorrow croaker came over to the table to watch her without turning around she said shes dead isnt she my little sonia croaker nodded wordlessly and estrella leyes bowed her head i could hear her ending in your voice it was a violent and terrible death how do you know that she lifted hands dark with the stains of her herbs and medicines and moved them around him as if in outline a disturbance here and here you carry around the memory like an overcoat he was not even aware he had taken hold of the spiritstone in his pocket until he felt its unnatural warmth against his palm he took it out and displayed it for estrella leyes id like to use this on nestor he said softly maybe it will help dios her eyes opened wide and quick as the wind she curled his fingers around the smooth stone and held them there clasped tightly do you know what this is she whispered her gaze searched his face i pressed this against my nieces chest and she awoke temporarily from a coma even though the doctors swore it was medically impossible estrella looked fearfully at the dark green stone he held it is not wise seor for you to be carrying such a thing i disagree do you know what i found inside sonias house he dipped his forefinger in a dark powder and on the tabletop traced out a triangle inside a circle a dot within a square with a sharply indrawn breath estrella leyes swept away the symbols in their place she drew the outline of a human eye inside which were two irises her eyes narrowed as she looked at him you know what you should not know you are no healer nor am i a reaver he said but the people who made those signs are and i want them why though said softly there was a sharpness to the tone that warned him of the importance of his answer these people murdered sonia as you said her death was violent and terrible he took a breath knowing he was about to embark on uncharted waters also i can feel her restless spirit inside her house you think she cries out for vengeance from beyond the grave this woman was almost better at interrogation than he was croaker thought no it wasnt sonias way to seek revenge she hated the thought of violence es verdad estrella leyess coffeecolored eyes appeared depthless something in her expression softened like the stone cold winter ground at springs first thaw he seemed to have passed some kind of test then what are you proposing rest croaker said eternal rest for her spirit estrella leyes came closer and in a hoarse whisper said who has been teaching you about heta i bennie milagros when we covered our faces in soot and buried sonia do you know him i was acquainted with humait milagros his grandfather estrella leyes turned abruptly away everyone for five hundred miles around asuncion knew humait he was a great and revered guarani healer did you go to his funeral croaker asked bennie told me it rained for ten days he was there for the whole time thats true enough estrella leyes was busying herself with her potions he and bennie had a difficult relationship but there was an unbreakable bond between them special among all the grandchildren humait had a secret name for bennie he always used when they were together sero he called him sero the mountain thats how he thought of him the mountain keeps its own counsel he told me one day the mountain has its own concept of time and place i knew he was speaking about bennie i also heard that humait drowned in the paraguay river there was a muffled sound as the canister she had been holding fell to the tabletop croaker caught her as her knees began to buckle mrs leyes she was so light he could imagine she had the hollow bones of a bird but she had not fainted peering down at her face as he held her croaker could see that her eyes had rolled partially up and her eyelids were spasming like someone in rem sleep she might have been dreaming while awake without conscious thought he pressed the spiritstone into the hollow of her throat almost immediately he heard her voice it was soft as echoey as if it were coming not from her throat but from somewhere very far away i come from a family of guarani fisherfolk she said and on that terrible day twenty years ago i was with my father and brothers on the paraguay i was twentytwo already married once and widowed and i was back to working the family trade as i had when i was a child the sun had not yet risen above the mountains but the misty air had about it the color of the inside of a pearl shell i loved that time of the morning so lovely the riot of tropical colors muted and so perfectly still you could hear the fish swimming beneath the water croaker crouched down estrella leyes clasped firmly in his arms he was afraid he wanted to wake her from her trance but he wanted more to hear the oral history she was reciting we found humaits body she went on at first we thought it had become entangled in the roots of a mass of mangrove that stretched out red and black into the river the shoulders chest and arms were all red at first we thought it was the detritus borne on the current dyed red by the tannin leached from the mangroves but then we noticed that it was not prone floating as it would have been if hed stumbled and fell he was sitting up rootlets beneath his armpits and he was covered in blood it was clear he had been placed in that spot because he was a healer no animal or bird had touched him even the primitive crocodiles kept their respectful distance no one moved except my father he scrambled off the boat and pulled the body out of its nest of roots and i remember this so clearly it might have happened this morning he rolled humait over belly down in the river and scrubbed at his face he scrubbed and scrubbed and all the while he was sobbing like a child in need id never before seen my father weep and it terrified me soon after on my fathers direction we helped him drag humait onto the boat his face was so clean that it was impossible to believe id seen what i had when wed found him each cheek was painted in blood on his left cheek was a triangle in a circle on his right cheek was a dot within a square estrella leyess eyelids ceased to spasm and her body went limp in croakers arms a moment later she stared up at him out of her dark eyes she seemed calm and serene as if waking from a long rejuvenating slumber croaker palmed the spiritstone mrs leyes are you okay she lifted a hand and slowly traced something on his forehead with the tip of a slender forefinger an oval with two dots insidethe doubleirised eye he wasnt destroyed i can feel humaits spirit in you she looked up at croaker in wonder all these years i held my peace about his death because my father swore us to secrecy he made us swear by the story we all gave as testimony that wed found humaits body floating facedown in the river why did your father do that mrs leyes croaker asked why did he lie and make you give false testimony because hed seen the symbols and he was afraid afraid of what he knew the boys who had taken those symbols as their own everyone did theyd become almost like humaits adopted grandsons and theyd killed him theyd left their symbols on his flesh to prove it antonio and heitor croaker said the bonita twins she nodded he was their mentor he loved them like a father didnt they love him in kind what do those two know of love estrella leyes said they have been severed from the family of man and god has turned his face from their countenance despite his first world upbringing and education croaker felt a chill lance through him but why did they kill him after humait had taught them everything they needed to know they had no more use for him estrella leyes seemed to shudder in his arms you see i believe humait knew how evil they were his hubris was in believing he could deliver them from this overriding evil his lasting greatness was that he believed in the goodness in all people but i think this is what destroyed him the bonitas were beyond change and the tragedy is in trying to change them all humait managed to do was to give them more power terrible power she clutched at him you called them reavers and you are right she made a sign and he lifted her back onto her feet this spiritstone you carry it belonged to humait didnt it croaker nodded she put both hands over his right hand keep it safe keep it close to you her gaze raked his face and her voice turned urgent promise me this because you will find the reaversor they will find you i promise estrella leyes looked deep into his eyes whatever she saw there must have satisfied her because she nodded and went back to her herbs and potions as she worked croaker said tell me about the four symbols once croaker had seen a troupe of cambodian dancers perform estrella leyes had extraordinarily long fingers and she used them as these dancers had giving distinct expression and a sense of presence to the most mundane gestures the triangle within a circle is the sign of man fire death her fingertips blackened as she broke dried fungi into spore dust the dot within the square the sign of woman water resurrection she combined the black spores with a yellow powder that smelled vaguely of cacao a cross within three concentric circles denotes a bird flight journeys the heart of the universe and the fourth croaker asked the sign humait took as his own her features were creased in concentration as she poured a brown liquid into the paste she had made the doubleirised eye represents the dreams we see with our inner eyeshe broke off long enough to point to a spot in the center of her foreheadour third eye her fingers were like a pair of fans as she spread them in an arc always the dreams guide us this is what heta i means the many waters are the paths of the innermind the innermind is revealed to healers by dreams she broke open a small withered branch and extracted the white cottony material from its pith added it to the tangy brew it smelled of the rich humus along the banks of the paraguay these are reckonings of the past paintings of the present and portents of the future ive dreamed of the doubleirised eye croaker told her she seemed unsurprised and you will dream of it again she promised whatever youre doing here he said from over her shoulder will it work estrella leyes shrugged there are some things god has determined are fixed she shook her head i am foolish perhaps like humait i attempt the impossible she turned with a vessel filled with a brackish liquid clasped between her hands this is something you should remember when you come facetoface with the bonitas their place in the universe is fixed it cannot be changed by you or anyone else humait tried he thought he recognized the spark of humanity in them and they killed him do not make the same mistake she went to where nestor lay slack and grimly pallid and gently woke him croaker held him upright while she put the vessel to his lips and made him drink but neither her carefully mixed potion nor humaits spiritstone pressed to his bony chest could stem the voracious tide of the opportunistic viruses eating him alive when croaker returned to sonias house there was someone waiting for him on the front porch you the boyfriend he was a handsome man in his thirties with clean smooth features his hair gelled and slicked back into a ponytail was the color of burnt caramel he was slim and agile which said to croaker that he was athletic he wore a mushroomcolored silk suit of expensive manufacture and incongruously a pair of keds beneath the suit was a cream versace polo shirt with two large goldandblack enamel buttons he was imposing in the manner in which he seemed to confront headon whatever life put before him what was most startling about him however was his ambercolored eyes who wants to know croaker responded as he reached the porch the slim man hit him so hard and so fast croaker was stumbling backward before he even felt the blow his ears rang as he gripped the porch rail and there was a growing numbness on the left side of his jaw next time ill put you all the way down croaker could see that the ambereyed man was both surprised and pissed off that the punch hadnt decked him i ask the questions here thiss my sisters house youre sonias brother carlito raw hostility oozed out of him like poison from a snake bite i see it didnt take you long to move in anglo croaker came off the porch railing like it was the top rope in a boxing ring my names lew croaker and this was the most convenient place to stay for the time being how to handle the delicate matter of sonias death as far as croaker knew only he bennie and maria knew the score maybe we should talk inside the slim man had about him the predatory aspect of a fox madre de mentiras what could we have to talk about croaker shrugged as he opened the door with his key come on in he called the ambereyed man walked with a minimum of effort as if he were an expert diver arrowing through water inside he craned his neck my sister here croaker shut the door behind them carlito when was the last time you saw sonia the slim man stared at him with his amber eyes he had about him an uncanny stillness or spoke to her what is this the spanish inquisition you have no business asking me these questions croaker gestured to one of a pair of couches covered in tropical cotton why dont you have a seat amber eyes seemed to glow in the last of the late afternoon light what the hell is this all about seeing no easy way into this croaker said im afraid your sister is dead the other man seemed to unwind in stages until he was sitting bent over on the rolled arm of the sofa when sometime yesterday afternoon croaker took a breath she was murdered the handsome head snapped up murdered ўmadre de mentiras how by whom she was decapitated i dont know yet by whom whatre you a detective as a matter of fact i am croaker showed him one of the official badges tears glittered in the amber eyes as he nodded what happened to her body croaker thought of the white van with the symbol painted on back and the parallel tracks hed found around the side of the house thats where antonio and heitor had sliced off sonias head there was no reason to tell her brother who was already on a short fuse what had happened to her and every reason not to i have no idea croaker said without inflection the slim man grunted some detective carlitos reactions came into focus something about them seemed the slightest bit off croaker thought what was he missing had sonia and her brother been estranged what is it you want here the amber eyes blazed with naked enmity whats in it for you keep quiet a moment croaker said as the ambereyed man came off the sofa arm and took a threatening step toward him croaker put up his hand just listen he admonished this gave the other pause and in that moment croaker said can you feel her the ambereyed man spread his hands frowning its your sisters spirit croaker turned slowly in a circle shes still here shes still waiting for what maybe mysticism wasnt his thing on the other hand he wasnt laughing for a way home croaker said shes held here without peace until i find out who murdered her he looked into carlitos face saw eyes hard as chipped stone to answer your first question yeah i was the boyfriend or i would have been if she hadnt been murdered he took a breath she was a beautiful woman in every way so what is it maricone you were fucking her brains out croaker took the other man totally off guard with titanium and polycarbonate fingers croaker crushed his suit lapels and expensively woven cotton polo as he rammed him across the room until his back fetched up with an explosive bang against the far wall croaker was so close he could faintly smell the steak and grilled onions carlito had eaten for lunch a man who doesnt respect women is a pig croaker said in idiomatic spanish but a man who doesnt respect his own sister is no man at all a weird pale light flared in carlitos eyes and just as quickly fled and dont call me maricone croaker kept to the idiomatic spanish a slow crafty smile spread across the slim mans face you dont talk like an anglo and you surely dont think like one either maybe that was as close as a man like carlitohostile arrogant muy machocould get to an apology croaker let him go and stepped back carlito stared down at the front of his jacket which looked like it had been run over by a mountain bike you know he said slowly and evenly ive killed men for less than this a gravity knife bloomed in his left hand the stiletto blade flicked upward into dead air not a threat in any way theyd been through their macho phase these two men and it had ended more or less in a draw the tilted blade was just an illustration to a story he was telling i slit their throats from one end to the other and watched the blood pump out in a slow sensual rhythm croaker was getting the measure of him he was like a child really in the way in which he studied croakers reactions to his outrageous behavior croaker could imagine a young caligula reciting a list of his egregious sins greedy for reaction from those older and more easily shocked than he but like caligula this lightning rod of a man was a daft and dangerous child never to be taken rightly or underestimated then when their brothers and sons came after me he went on id do the same to them id lie awake at night creating a shining path willing them to come over the wall like evil dreams to invade my house he smiled that sly smile you see i made them sin i never invaded their house i never laid a hand on their property as they did mine the knife point flicked upward sent spinning in a blur a ray of vagrant sunlight i made them sin and then i punished them for it until my blade ran red with their blood croaker went into the kitchen as much to take a break from the overpowering personality as to slake his thirst there was half a sixpack of corona beer in a cupboard but he was reluctant to put it on ice the interior of the refrigerator was still painted with sonias blood he found an open bottle of cuervo gold tequila and he poured double shots into a pair of glasses he came back into the living room handed one to sonias brother when the two of them had drunk some he said id like your permission to stay here it was the formal construction he would have used if hed asked carlito for his sisters hand in marriage the slim man had put away the gravity knife this is not a small thing you ask he stared into the depths of the pale liquor but it is not a small thing you are doing for soniaand for me i understand and i appreciate your kindness croaker switched topics and tones what im trying to follow up on is a possibility heitor and antonio bonita might have murdered sonia you know them you have already begun your investigation i see the slim man sat down on the couch a lozenge of late afternoon sunlight struck him across the face firing his burnt caramel hair what makes you suspect them the manner of your sisters murder decapitation seems to be their specialty amber eyes regarded croaker evenly how much do you know about heitor and antonio croaker sat in a facing chair not enough i was in business with them onceabout five years ago five yearsthen you must know bennie milagros the ambereyed man was so still it was possible to see the pulse in the side of his neck just above the collar of his sleek versace shirt oh yes he said at last benito is well known to me his head swiveled and the amber eyes flashed briefly you are friendly with him perhaps so you are a cautious man that is all to the good he nodded with a man such as he all due caution is warranted what do you mean croaker said the slim man seemed not to hear him as he took a contemplative sip of his tequila he switched to idiomatic spanish you must understand these menheitor and antonio the bonitasmake it their business to be in anything thats dangerous enough to give them big profit margins drugs war materiel blackmarket telecommunication and computer components semiconductor chips girls murderforhire white slaveryyes even that in this day and age but what makes their operation unique is that theyre never connected directly with any of these industries he waved a hand in the air oh i know what youre thinking detectiveall these international criminals hide behind a maze of offshore and foreign shell corporations true but the bonitas go one better they own nothing instead they set other people up to be the manipulators behind the maze of shell corporations they give a good deal of autonomy to these men as they become movers and shakers as long as you perform youre left pretty much alone with your operation your bottom line and your monthly paymentssixtyfive percent of profit another thirty or so percent is plowed back into the business which leaves three percent five if youre very clever left over at the days end i assume croaker said youre speaking about yourself the thing is the slim man continued not quite ignoring the statement their scheme is insidious i mean the more successful you are at running what theyve set up for you the more youre left alone and the stronger the illusion becomes that youre actually in control but its all a lie you see in reality youre nothing more than a patsy youre there to make money for the bonitas if you do that well and good you go home with your pittance if you stumble and the bottom line falls they come and cripple you and spend a damned long time at it in the meantime you take all the riskand if the operation blows up in your face if one black day the federates come pouring through your back door you take the fall theres nothing whatsoever to link the bonitas to the laws youve broken and if youre stupid enough to rat them out theyll hunt you down and make you die in any one of a variety of very unpleasant ways like for instance decapitating you the ambereyed man hefted his empty glass is there any more of this on the kitchen counter in a moment he returned with the bottle and a full glass he set the tequila on the coffee table between them like a signpost the sun had dropped below the horizon and carlitos face was wreathed in shadow he appeared even more handsome a magnet for vulnerable girls but in this twilight the sinister aspect he cultivated like a pet croc had become pronounced croaker could imagine him as a gunrunner or a drug dealer for the bonitas moving like a dancer through glittering circles of money and power gorging on the role becoming one with it it was difficult if not impossible to leave the orbit of a supernova without incurring profound and permanent damage croaker wondered what form of damage carlito had suffered despite the open windows it seemed abruptly stifling in the small house croaker got up stood looking out into the street the sky was orange and purple but below the treetops sharp shadows had crept across the lawns and parked cars making of them inky shapes that held unfathomable secrets what did you do for heitor and antonio bonita i ran guns and munitions the usual stuff he said it too quickly and croaker knew he was lying there was nothing usual about this man croaker said how did it end badly the ambereyed man had come silent as a cat to stand beside him in unspoken consent perhaps they had neglected to turn on any lights inside the house what illumination existed came from the streetlights to a passerbyif there had been onethey might very well have been mistaken for ghosts disembodied faces peering out the plate glass window of a newly deserted house i was in love once carlito said from close beside croaker his voice was thin almost reedy barely above a whisper it seems so long ago five years an eternity he lapsed into a brooding silence from which croaker was reluctant to rouse him croaker knew from hard experience that painful memories needed their own time to work themselves loose the ambereyed man cleared his throat as if he were getting rid of excess emotion anyway i asked her to marry me she was a good girl this woman pure in heart and spirit she saw something in me he waved his glass and tequila sloshed around its sides no matter she didnt know what i did not precisely but she didnt like it she said she could smell a stink on me and when i said to her what stink im no damned river fisherman she held me very close and whispered in my ear the stink i smell is not on your body it comes from your soul the slim man downed the last of his tequila for a moment he seemed inclined to fetch the bottle but then he changed his mind stupid girl i thought what does she know but then lying beside her at night i would fall into bad dreams and i would awake in the morning with the stink of burning flesh in my nose this went on for weeks and finally i realized i was dreaming of my own flesh burning he turned to croaker thats when i knew she was no stupid girl she was very very special she smelled the corruption on me and i thought she must hate this smell why does she stay with me how can she love me because seor sex is easy its like breathing what could be more natural but love is hard love does things to you you have no hope of understanding love changes you even when you have no intention of being changed he glanced down at his empty glass and away again into the anonymity of the shadowed street and then finally i understood she was waiting waiting for me to come to hate the stink as much as she did the ambereyed man had put aside his now useless glass his hands had turned into fists and he pressed them onto the windowsill as he leaned against it i wanted to change i really did tension corded his ramrodstraight arms distorting the expensive fabric of his suit but everything in life has a price some things in life you think you must have but the price if you knew it beforehand youd never ever pay he took a deep breath god or something like himfate perhapstook this woman away from me croaker watched as he turned and walked away from the illumination of the streetlights into the darkness of his sisters house he wanted to ask a question that burned in the back of his throat but the air was still too charged with the agony of memories a great evil was entangled here like a web that crossed time to damage lives beyond any hope of repair youre welcome to this place carlito said in a strangled voice i want no part of it if you feel sonias spirit here all the better it seems good that she can speak to you in this manner croaker knew he was thinking of the way in which this womanwho had died five years agohad spoken to him at last he came away from the window and his eyes adjusted to the gloom found carlito withdrawn to a corner as if needing to fend off all the bad karma hed stirred up do you believe in spirits croaker asked him id like to think so those lambent amber eyes focused on him yes of course he would croaker thought hed give anything to hear this womans voice again even in his dreams theyre both waiting arent they carlito whispered rosa and now sonia theyre joined somehow croaker felt a coil of electricity at the answer to the question that was burning the back of his throat did you say her name was rosa si rosa milagros christ croaker thought thats how he knew bennie he fell in love with his sister and she was decapitated by the bonitas maybe this explained the subtle strangeness of his earlier reactions hed been living rosas murder all over again carlitos eyes were wide and staring it was as if he was talking to himself as if croaker were not there at all im damned now i know that rosa could have saved me i have done things i continue to do things he turned his face away and crossing the room in three huge strides flung open the door and was gone as croaker drove north on i he flicked on a tape of jan deans greatest hits surf music from the glorious s what better songs to think by on either side of him thrill seekers in camaros and firebirds wove in and out of the multiplelane traffic passing on the right whenever they saw an opening they had a habit of cutting back in inches from the trailing cars front grille if you traveled i regularly it didnt pay to think of the highways accident ratio he wanted to turn over in his mind the startling revelation that sonias brother had been in love with bennies sister rosa what role did he play in this widening web it was clear to croaker that he knew more about antonio and heitor than he had revealed one thing was for sure the moment carlito went out the door croaker felt as if a dark and dangerous cloud had vanished he got off the highway at atlantic boulevard and went west jan dean had segued from surf city into new girl in school before his dinner date with jenny marsh in west palm beach he had another stop to make he turned into the strip mall off highway and ejected the cassette of jan dean he dug out his computer and checked on the status of the request for information on the private phone number majeur had given him the database had spewed out a paragraphs worth of information first off it was a cellular number no surprise there but the strange thing was it was not listed in majeurs name the individual the number was billed to was one benito milagros bennie and his mysterious secretive midnight run tomorrow was it a coincidence that juan garcia barbacena was coming into miami at precisely midnight tomorrow croaker sat for a long time in the strip mall while traffic whizzed by in either direction black palms danced against an indigo sky illumination from overhead sodium lights threw the hoods of parked cars into sharp relief at night the blackedout windows of the margate gun racquet club reflected the nextdoor granite monuments with their maudlin sentiments carved for all eternity croaker was unpleasantly reminded of his meeting with majeur in the cemetery and that brought back into focus what he was going to have to do in order to save rachels life he punched in bennies number ўhola bennie its me amigo whats up any news on your niece status quo croaker noticed he was gripping his cell phone too tightly bennie you know a lawyer named majeur no marcellus rojas diego majeur lewis i think with a name like that id remember him if i knew him which i dont rafe had heard of him roubinnet was that a wary note croaker detected in bennies voice whatre you doing hanging out with him i ran into him is all croaker said but he told me this majeurs wired into heavyduty drug people then he must be bennies voice sounded abruptly distant if roubinnet says so you two on the outs didnt you want to back him for a second term as mayor that was a while ago lewis times change people too listen bennie i gotta go sorry the colombian delegation im expectings at the door later amigo and watch who you hang with bennie i dont know whether i can make that run we spoke of yesterday silence on the other end of the line but bennie had not hung up hey whats up with you amigo croaker heard the brittle tone to the voice im counting on you i know bennie but somethings come up and i now listen you gave your word this is too damn important what the fucks changed since yesterday huh i thinkknow what i think amigo you been listenin to evil little bees buzzin in your ear you wouldnt mean rafe facetoface bennie snapped you an me i can like blow these fuckin colombians off for a couple hours all they seem to be interested in anyway is yapping like dogs among themselves okay meet me in the lobby of the royal poinciana hospital thats in palm beach good enough take me what ninety minutes an dont like be talking to anyone in the meantime what like rafe but bennie had already broken the connection croaker put down the phone friction between bennie and rafe what the hell was going on bennie said he didnt know majeur yet phone company records clearly showed majeurs cell phone billed to bennie why was bennie lying and what the hell was so important about his midnight run this was a bennie he hadnt seen before he struggled to remind himself that there were many aspects of bennies life he knew nothing about as close as he might have become to bennie how well did he really know him surprises were popping up daily suddenly the world seemed to have been turned on its head with the possibility that his friendship with bennie held some dark and sinister hidden agenda he got out of the car and stowed the computer in his trunk from the same hidden bay he began stuffing his pockets with small metallic and plastic items he needed to deal with the job at hand and so he cleared his mind of all the questions for which he had as yet no answers it was just after seven gold coast exotic auto rentals was closed for the day vonda had been right on the money he strolled around to the back of the mall where the deliveries and garbage pickups for the complex were made he located gold coasts rear door and checked it out a nearby sodium streetlight would point an unmistakable finger at anyone in the immediate vicinity he had a cure for that he worked on the base of the light for three or four minutes with his stainlesssteel nails using them as pick and wire cutters the light winked out shadows closed in as if starved by the stark glare as expected the rear door was alarmed croaker had a cure for that as well when he had located the bell south junction box for the rental company he pried open the metal door after verifying the alarm system was hardwired into the phone lines he cut the telephone cables quickly using a stainlesssteel nail he picked the lock on the rear door and slipped silently inside the rental office was dark the street and traffic lights from out front the only illumination it smelled dankly of mildew and the musty electronic charge of machinery he kept his head down and crept behind the counter he saw a small miami hurricanes pennant perhaps vondas in a dusty jam jar along with some other miscellaneous souvenirs a womans sweater old and motheaten lay folded on the shelf beneath along with a wellused nail buffer bottles of spectacularly colored nail polish and one of those small collapsible umbrellas farther on he came to the computer terminal he was about to turn it on when he felt something a faint but discernible aura of heat was emanating from the back of the computer he squinted at his watch eighteen minutes after seven vonda had told him she closed at sixthirty sharp even allowing for a few minutes of overtime the computer should have been cold by now he fired up the computer and right away he knew there was a problem the software the company was using booted up well enough but if it was to be believed there were no files no directories no lists of names the software was virgin as clear of data as it had been the day it had been installed someone had purged the hard drive of memory and judging by the temperature of the machine it had been done within the last fifteen minutes he searched the nearby area for a tape backup or floppy disks knowing full well he wouldnt find them anyone clever enough to purge a hard drive would take or destroy the tape and floppies as well it was on his hunt for the backups that he came upon vonda or more accurately all that remained of her her head severed as neatly and expertly as sonias was lying in wait for him covered in shadows it stared at him from a shelf as if it were another of her own souvenirs blood ran along the rim of the shelf looking for an indentation off which to drip croaker felt as if he had been kicked in the stomach he sat back on his heels trying to breathe deeply he needed to get back his equilibrium he closed his eyes for a moment immersed in darkness he could hear the low wash of the traffic going by outside not a voice not a dog bark disturbed the almost absolute silence he stared at vondas head and his breath caught in his throat he had to blink to make sure it wasnt a trick of the shadows that he wasnt hallucinating but there it was a black threeinch floppy disk was wedged between her clamped jaws as croaker moved closer he saw the floppy had a label something was written on it and he moved slightly to read it looking for this detective he raised his hand trying to pry the floppy from between vondas lips he pulled hard and the entire head dropped into his lap he should have laughed at the absurdity of the situation but it was too sad the moment was positively surreal vondas head in his lap the eyes staring up at him looking blankly for help and above them in the center of her forhead a symbol drawn in blood a dot within a square the bonitas with an effort he maintained his grip on reality and peered down at her mouth it looked as if someone had krazy glued her teeth to the floppy curiouser and curiouser this cannot be happening he thought next thing you know ill see the white rabbit racing past me muttering im late im late for a very important date no time to say hello goodbye im late im late im late carefully he extruded his stainlesssteel nails chipped the floppy free of the glue he pocketed the floppy took vondas head by the steellike tendrils of her permed hair and replaced it on the shelf then he froze hed heard somethinga soft footfall perhaps or the furtive movement of a body someone was here not a creature with white furry legs and a pocket watch someone with a dark and dangerous psyche antonio or heitor he listened beyond the throb of blood pulsing in his veins nothing wait he cautioned himself just wait and listen ghostly images of exotic cars appeared and just as quickly vanished off the tacky walls in the headlights of the traffic outside dust motes floated through the air as if dislodged by restless spirits voices drifted in from out front a car door slammed an engine coughed to life and headlights swung across his field of vision at precisely that moment he heard the noise again he turned his head away from the lights but he could see nothing in the deep gloom that a moment later returned to the interior he heard a slow drip and thought that perhaps vondas seeping blood had found its way off the shelf out of the corner of his eyes he saw a flash as of something metallic it was at the far end of the office moving from left to right toward the rear someone was in here with him someone who having murdered vonda had then purged the computers hard drive and left him the ballsy note someone who knew him knew hed be here which one antonio or heitor he wondered whether it mattered it was just about then he heard a sharp crack as of glass shattering and knew hed run out of time he risked a glance above the top of the counter heard and saw nothing in response still crouching he crabwalked as fast as he was able behind the counter until he came to the other end there he could see a windowpane had been smashed out leaving only shards hanging from the edges of the frame from outside he heard something that sounded like a heavyduty car engine and beneath it another noise deep and pulsing a generator he levered himself through the jagged opening out into a section of the rear of the strip mall hidden from the area near gold coasts back door he emerged just in time to see a white panel truck jouncing away from him toward the far entrance to the highway maneuvering between the glass fragments strewn all over the concrete apron he began running very hard all the while trying to read the rear tag he was gaining on the panel truck and now he struck out at an angle anticipating its turn onto the truck slowed for an instant to better take a speed bump just before the exit and croaker left his feet leaping with his left arm extended his biomechanical fingers struck the rear bumper flaying paint and plastic until they grasped and took hold he tried to regain his feet but the truck lurched forward over the speed bump and his hip and knee struck the blacktop with a sickening jolt his right hand fumbled for a hold on the plastic bumper but could find none the panel truck had reached the exit and he had only an instant to gain a less tentative purchase he struggled to pull himself up onto the rear bumper he had one foot and the opposite knee on the bumper but right then the panel truck screeched as the brakes came off and it slewed in a screaming righthand turn out into traffic centrifugal force hit croaker like a mule kick in the small of his back and his arm was almost wrenched clean out of its socket his foot slid along the slick bumper top and gave out onto whistling air it dragged along the blacktop sparks flying from his shoe sole and he just missed having his kneecap smashed if he didnt get himself up onto the back of the truck hed be flayed alive but he was not about to let go not when he was this close to the murderers the truck was weaving dangerously in and out of traffic horns blared angrily and behind him croaker could hear the protesting squeal of jammedon brakes he heaved himself upward swinging his legs with all the force he could muster and hooked his biomechanical hand over the lefthand door handle a moment later he got his feet planted on the bumper he clung there for a moment shivering as if he were on a sheer rock face wind buffeted him and his upper body rattled painfully against the metal of the rear doors as the truck continued to weave back and forth between lanes he did not want to look down at the blurred road that was when he saw the mystic symbola triangle within a circlejust as mr leyes had described it the panel truck must have been doing seventy croaker braced himself against the lefthand door his biomechanical fingers were wrapped securely around the handle he reached up and grasped the handle of the righthand door jerked it down and pulled hard it slammed all the way open taken by the backrush of wind at that moment the panel truck swerved into the next lane and croaker almost lost his balance one foot slipped off the plastic bumper and only the strength of his biomechanical hand kept him from being pitched headlong onto the fast receding road he had to use all his concentration to haul himself back up onto his precarious perch that was when the panel truck screeched to a jarring halt gravity and momentum warred with each other for a split second and he felt as if he were in free fall then gravity won out and he was slammed with tremendous force into the lefthand door almost immediately the truck lurched into gear and accelerated hard again putting more strain on his biomechanical fingers to hold him fast as he slammed into the rear halfdazed he felt himself being jerked sideways as a fist grabbed his shirtfront his head came around and he found himself staring into a pair of amber eyes as familiar as they were baleful the face was as handsome and predatory as a foxs hair the color of burnt caramel sprouted from atop a high forehead with the wildness of a cockscomb it was carlito wide lips pursed as the ambereyed man said so this is the detective a whiteknuckled fist slammed into croakers face stars exploded behind his eyes and if it wasnt for the passing streetlights flickering off the arced blade of a scalpel he might have missed it the scalpel held in the ambereyed mans right fist was coming right at his throat he shook his head trying to clear it the ambereyed man smiled grimly and croaker caught a glimpse of another face just behind him in the trucks interior another pair of amber eyes blinked at him out of a face identical to the first one my god croaker thought with the sudden impact of revelation twins not carlito hes dead the second ambereyed twin said as if reading his mind i myself had a hand in his demise his history had a sadder end than i told you his eyes blazed with a feral intensity so swiftly we meet again detective who would have thought madre de mentiras i had fun at our first encounter how about you the first ambereyed twin brandished his scalpel antonio he cried over the wail of the wind and the screech of the tires hes like a tick on our backside what shall we do with him it wasnt sonias brother hed met at her house croaker thought wildly it was antonio bonita croaker managed to get his right arm into position to deliver a blow but the ambereyed twin who was heitor bonita slammed the heel of his shoe into croakers ribs pain electrified him as he tried to catch his breath heitor kicked viciously again and croakers tentative footing failed him he slid to his knees hanging by the death grip he maintained on the door handle with his biomechanical fingers as antonio watched with the utter detachment of a god heitor leaned out of the open doorway as he did so his gaze was caught by reflected light spinning off croakers biomechanical hand now what is this heitor said the wind plucked his words away but not before croaker marked the particular timbre of the voice the hand antonio said i told you so you did heitor said i want it the scalpel arced in a blur and croaker could see what was about to happen heitor seemed fascinated by the biomechanical hand like a lepidopterist on a field trip who discovers a new species of butterfly he was not going to let it get away he was going to cut it off croakers hand at the wrist croaker tried to clear his head to gather his strength but with each passing instant his perch was becoming more difficult to main tain he looked up into heitors faceantonios face there was no differenceand his blood ran cold for that moment he had the eerie sensation of being pinned to a dissecting table four eyes peered at him avidly two sets of nostrils flared as if at the scent of fresh blood two mouths curled in the same beatific smile as if the men were embarking on a sacred mission croaker with no other option left him let go of the door handle it was that or lose his biomechanical hand with no warning at all antonio had lunged for him the fingers grasping him in an iron grip saved from the scarifying fall to the ribboning highway just below him croaker scrabbled desperately for purchase on the rear bumper fear was thick in his throat it was purely instinctive it came from the dark and lonely place in the mind where no thought existed he was not afraid of many things he had in fact come across many diseased minds but these twins were different they exuded a single terrifying aura that made his stomach clench seeing them was like looking at two boys delightedly playing at the bottom of a grave a joy wreathed them so pure it was almost holy two sets of amber eyes bored into him and he felt a gust of wind billow through him like an evil premonition antonios grip on him tightened and heitor maneuvered in the gaping doorway of the truck as he prepared for his bit of impromptu surgery as he did so croaker got an almost hallucinatory glimpse inside the truck he saw a metal and porcelain machine with tubes running from it it looked familiar where had he seen something like it before but there was no time to think his perch on the rear bumper gave way whipping him out over the highway he glanced down the panel truck was running at such high speed the pavement was one long blur fall the wrong way and he could easily shatter his ribs or worse his neck and he would have fallen but antonio braced against the side of the door opening held him steady in his viselike grip for an instant he peered up into antonios predatory face and something like sheet lightning mysterious and potent passed between them not now not yet antonio stayed the arc of his twins scalpel with his other hand pacienda no heitor cried i want it ill have it now and he wrestled his arm from his twins grasp the scalpel flashed evilly in the passing streetlights it was coming again and there was nothing croaker could do heitor would have his trophy then antonio did a very odd thing he smiled down at croaker in an almost benign manner the dark stones know the howling wind clawed his words to shreds as his fingers opened and he relinquished his grip in that frozen moment when the razor edge of the scalpel passed within a hairs breadth of his left wrist croaker choked back violent nausea and did the only thing he could do he tucked his head into his chest and willed his body to relax as it was flung off the back of the speeding truck and plummeted to the pavement of the highway he bounced and bounced again then rolled as he had been taught keeping his body relaxed and letting the momentum take him freely he tumbled head over heels along oily concrete and cinders amid a welter of screeching brakes and shouted curses the only thing that saved him from being run over was that traffic had stayed well back of the white panel truck that had been driving so erratically as it sped away in a cloud of diesel fumes he managed to gain the side of the highway not long after a young surfer in a beatup pickup stopped and asked if he was hurt croaker fighting nausea and fierce aches in shoulder and ribs said no but a lift would be just fine but on the jouncy ride back up the highway with rap music blaring in his ears he was haunted by the sight of those avid faces twisted in greed and lust his teeth gritted in pain and he closed his eyes against the fierce glare of oncoming headlights a flare of remembrance a stainlesssteel and porcelain machine in the white panel trucks interior tubes going into and out of it he was sure hed seen it before where then the sound of the compressor welled up inside him the compressor that mr leyes had heard when sonia was killed the compressor hed heard later outside gold coast exotic car rentals where vonda had died the compressor that was used to power with a cry that startled the surfer out of his musicinduced reverie croaker sat up straight he had it now the bonitas were using a perfusion machine thats what he had seen in the back of their panel truck the compressor made it portable now he had his proof antonio and heitor had taken a panel truck a perfusion machine powered by a compressor and made their organ harvesting operation both portable and mobile the scalpel heitor had brandished flashed through his mind like the arc of a shooting star in the night sky croaker had the surfer drop him far enough away from the strip mall so he wouldnt be traced back to vondas murder site as he walked could not stop himself from picturing sonias headless bodyand vondasopened up the organs plucked out like ripe fruit by the reavers right now the perfusion machine might be pumping belzer solution through vondas kidneys perhaps sonias as well it was ironic and terribly unfair they had access to kidneys and he had nonesave through majeur but where was that kidney coming from abruptly he put his hand to his throbbing temple there was that pernicious thought again undermining the very fabric on which hed built his life these were organs from people he knewpeople who had been coldbloodedly murdered what kind of monsters were the bonitas he didnt yet know but he had to find out croaker shuddered unbidden he saw antonios and heitors faces again he was struck by their amber eyes lambent as moons cold cruel pitiless estrella leyes was right never had he witnessed two people so estranged from god or the rest of the human race an hour and fifteen minutes later croaker parked in the lot outside the royal poinciana hospital the vintage mustang majeurs client had given him was right where hed left it it sure looked beautiful he found himself thinking about buying a cover for it the ferocious florida sun would otherwise burn away the finish fade the upholstery and dry up all the exposed rubber parts that he already considered it his own car was disturbing one way or another hed have to decide what to do with it with a rag from the glove compartment he wiped down the steering wheel and the leather seat of the tbird that had been spotted with blood from his cuts and abrasions it was almost eightthirty all his heroics it seemed had gone for nothing the license tag hed gotten off the rear of the bonitas panel van was a dead end his uplink to the motor vehicle database informed him the number was off a sevenyearold honda civic registered in dade county tags got stolen so often he knew the cops didnt bother looking for them anymore not surprising that the panel truck had stolen tags the bonitas were thorough professionals he was beginning to get the measure of them their evil like urban spoor was unmistakable despite that croaker found himself ruminating on curious aspects of his two encounters with antonio how to figure antonio saying love does things to you you have no hope of understanding love changes you even when you have no intention of being changed was this true had antonio truly loved rosa milagros impossible hed killed her he and heitor had lopped off her head as if she had been some water buffalo ripe for the slaughter god or something like himfate perhapstook this woman away from me antonio had confessed meaning what he and heitor were men who felt nothing and yet he seemed stigmatized by rosas murder theyre both waiting arent they rosa and now sonia theyre joined somehow why confess anything to croaker what was croaker to antonio he recalled with electrifying intensity the look antonio had given him that had penetrated like a virus deep into the marrow of his bones both bennie and estrella leyes seem convinced that humait milagross spirit lives on inside me croaker thought is this what antonio saw in me is that why hed said im damned now i know that rosa could have saved me i have done things i continue to do things then he remembered estrellas warning to him that humait had thought hed detected a spark of humanity in antonio and heitor and they had killed him for it shed told him not to make the same mistake unconsciously he curled his hand around the spiritstone he felt as he had at sonias funeral as if he was vulnerable to dark spirits action was the only way to snap himself out of these disquieting thoughts he grabbed his gap bag out of the trunk and headed directly into the mens room to wash off the rest of the blood and change his soiled and shredded clothes because he went through the emergency room no one gave him a second look but when he entered the main lobby to get to the elevator bank that would take him to the ccd unit he ran right into bennie jesus christ amigo where the hellve you been bennie was clearly fuming and it was an intimidating sight he grasped croakers elbow with fingers that felt like steel pincers steering him into a corner listen i want to know what the hells going on croaker did not appreciate bennies grip what are you talking about we had a deal clean and simple right the boat thing then you call and like clear out of the blue youre talking with roubinnet and in almost the same breath youre you know bailing i want to know why what did that sonuvabitch say about me first take your hand off me when you answer my question bennies fingers tightened their grip hey amigo wake up this is no fuckin joke i make a deal with someone i expect it to happen period what is that croaker was angry now a threat play it like it lays amigo bennie i thought we were friends bennie spat onto the marble floor friends dont back out on their word they dont lie either croaker said what are you and majeur up to who croaker glared at his friend i told you marcellus rojas diego majeur the attorney an i told you i dont know any majeur croaker wrapped his biomechanical fingers around bennies wrist you dont know the top latin american drug lords bennie you dont know who reps them over here is that what you expect me to believe for a moment they faced each otherfriends once perhaps now nothing more than two stags clashing antlers let go croaker felt his blood rushing in his ears dont make me do this amigo consider any action before you take it slowly and deliberately croaker exerted pressure until bennie was forced to let him go i dont know what the hell is up with you but if you keep on lying im quits he punched the elevator button bennie took a threatening step toward him fuck that ive still got plenty to say a deals a deal no one bails on bennie milagros no one comprende im gonna hold you to that midnight run how are you going to do that the elevator doors opened and croaker stepped in have your colombian buddies talk me to death bennie made a sudden lunge at him the doors were closing but bennie was quick as a sprinter he slammed the rubber bumpers with his shoulders and the doors ricocheted back he stepped into the elevator and croaker smashed the back of his biomechanical hand into his chest bennie staggered back and the doors slid shut in his face upstairs croaker took a moment to allow the excess adrenaline to drain away the meeting with bennie had been profoundly disturbing what had happened between them it was as if they were talking at crosspurposes each of them locked in his own little world worse at the heart of it all was a terrible inarticulateness as if they had nothing to communicate but threats their time on the captain sumo only days ago seemed like months the camaraderie that had sprung up between them an illusion what if it was an illusion he asked himself spun by bennie to rope croaker into this midnight run what the hell was so damn important about it once on a back country fishing trip croaker had been bitten by a pygmy rattlesnake i feel your tension stone tree had said as he had cut open the wound the toxin will be neutralized within minutes why do you worry when croaker had told him it was because there were so many questions in life that had no answers stone tree had replied if you find this is so you are asking the wrong questions before trying to find jenny marsh croaker looked in on rachel dr stansky stood beside her bed his hands clasped behind his back he glanced up sharply as croaker came in then nodded in cool recognition croaker stooped to kiss rachels forehead it felt as if she were burning up and he experienced a quick stab of panic whats happened dr stanskys olympian ego was mollified by the anxiety in croakers tone here was a human emotion with which he could deal theres no good news theyre having trouble controlling the sepsis no doubt rachels severely weakened condition is a contributing factor his voice modulated adding soothing overtones but the staff here is doing everything they can he pointed to two new iv tubes going into her theyve switched to more powerful antibiotics its a waiting game now thats why i urged mrs duke to take a break shed been here just about all day and her nerves were worn thin then he noticed croakers condition you certainly look the worse for wear croaker grimaced i fell off a truck everyones a comedian he peered reprovingly from beneath humorless brows let me take a look at you he unbuttoned croakers shirt and began his examination some nasty truck any luck finding a kidney croaker asked maybe he could still get off the hook with majeur and his despicable deal dr stansky shook his head as he snapped on latex gloves then plucked several items off a countertop im afraid its useless he used a tweezers with curved tines to extract several small pebbles out of the reddish abrasion on croakers right shoulder theres nothing i can do for her you see nothing at all he applied a topical disinfectant and an antibiotic cream to all the cuts and scrapes with a gauze pad ive pulled in every favor twisted every arm he dropped the soiled gauze into a disposal canister marked dangerbiohazard no one can help i thought theyd be able to but they simply cant he stripped off the gloves and threw them after the gauze its a matter of ethics you see these medical people these organ handlers ethics is what defines them his gaze alit on rachels comatose face shes in gods hands now thats all there is to it croaker thanked dr stansky and left the cubicle he was dispirited in pain and hungry it was only now he remembered that he hadnt eaten all day he saw jenny marsh coming toward him from the lounge area where shed first told him in confidence about the american organ harvesting the bonitas activities lent a whole new aspect to it that made her input all the more important he stopped in his tracks dressed in black cotton pants and a sueded silk jacket over a bluegreen blouse she looked startlingly beautiful her catlike face had touches of makeup on it not much but enough to give her an entirely new dimension and what had she done to her hair it hung loose and full and gleaming so that it just touched her shoulders dr stansky told me youre having a helluva time with my niece he said as he drank her in she nodded grimly i dont understand it the sepsis just doesnt want to give up dr stansky says the infections taking advantage of her weakened condition undoubtedly jenny frowned but i still find it odd youd think with the course of treatment were giving her shed be able to fight it off shes weak but she isnt eighty years old she shook her head still its there and its killing her if shes to have any chance at all weve got to have that kidney he held up the documentation majeur had given him then ive got good news i hope as he moved into the light jenny got a full look at the scrapes and bruises still visible my god she said what happened to you he put a hand to his jaw with its days rough stubble and an ache still throbbing from the punch antonio had delivered i seem to be suffering from an overexposure to the vicious undercurrents of life not to worry stansky patched me up while he was talking down to me with his attitude im surprised he didnt charge me he handed over the documents and said jenny i want you to tell me if this is rachels ticket to life their gazes locked for a moment no medical doubletalk okay she hesitated a moment and he could see her considering what he was asking of her doctors worked long and hard to gain the status of demigods asking one to give up that privilege even for a moment required a leap of trust for both parties at length she nodded ill straightshoot it no matter the cost i appreciate that you damn well better her gaze dropped to the papers she held in a moment she said lew you arent seriously considering using this unregistered organ are you that depends he said is it real the documentation appears authentic but then im doing it but jennys gaze flicked up her eyes flashing emerald in the overhead lights no buts if rachels life can be saved thats all that matters jennys words rode harshly over his but the bottom line is you dont know where this kidneys coming from he tapped the top sheet of paper according to this from the same place you or anyone else gets organs the united network organ sharing right some emotion was stuck in her eyes what was it but see it cant be because ive been through the unos national computer network more times than i care to count and i swear to you theres no kidney to be had she held up the papers i checked a couple of hours ago between operations updates dont happen that fast this kidney is unregistered its illegal croaker felt a weakness in the backs of his knees and all the aches hed amassed during this gruelling day seemed to press in on him at once christ jenny dont do this to rachie earlier you told me that in her case you might consider using an unregistered kidney a moment of weaknessor madness there was a confused look on her face for her for you i dont know which she shook her head now it doesnt matter because ive regained the little bit of sanity left me i wont touch an unregistered kidney even to save rachels life yes she said evenly even for that the tension between them flickered and flared jenny was strong and she was principled that was good but could she understand his predicament this was not her niece they were talking about this was not a girl she had lost a long time ago only by some miracle to have rediscovered this was not a second chance for her a rare and fragile opportunity to atone for past lapses but it was for him and the thought that he might lose rachel againthis time foreverwas intolerable lew i know youd move heaven and earth for her she said proving him wrong i can see it in every move you make around her but listen to what im saying if this kidneys unregistered you cannot use it if you do youre not only condoning a sin so heinous it cannot be named youve become a part of it her green eyes sparked with the force of her will and croaker knew that they were at an impasse what happened when an irresistible force met an immovable object the agony was he knew she was right he thought of antonio and heitor the reavers harvesting organs as if they were mushrooms in the forest he couldnt be a party to that but if there was even the slimmest hope that the kidney majeur was offering was as clean as the lawyer claimed croaker had to play the string out to its end even if the end proved too bitter to bear but what if it is legit he said whistling in the dark lew to give in this much cost her nothing in integrity and she led him over to a computer terminal where she logged on surgeons and musicians had the same kinds of fingers croaker thought each one always moving independently in their assigned tasks as if they had ten hands instead of two in sure swift strokes jenny typed in the codes to access the unos system in richmond virginia lit by the pixels of the screen her face looked eerie like that of a fairy queen in a childrens story or perhaps a shakespearean play he knew she was online when she consulted the documentation to get the serial number of majeurs kidney she typed it in and pressed the enter key a soft sigh escaped her lips what is it croaker said from his angle the screen looked like little more than a blur its impossible jenny said as she turned toward him the goddamn kidneys registered it must have come on net while i was in surgery its been reserved for rachel croaker felt the thrill of elation race through him its real he whispered its real and its legit out of utter darkness had come a single beam lighting his way a path had appeared dangerous lonely and all too likely corrosive to his soul but for rachel it was the blessed path back to life thank god then he thought of something jenny if the organs already in the unos data bank lets see if we can get it released jenny pressed some keys she shook her head no go all im getting is an in transit message its not so unusual the moment they get a donors consent do the blood work up and antigens tests the organ details go online theyre meted out as to need compatibility and geographical location so we have to assume this donors in the south florida area but the kidney itself isnt ready yet damn croaker thought hed hoped he could outwit majeur at his own game by getting the organ without having to go through with his end of the deal but the unos system wasnt complying jenny shut down her computer and leaned over the desk on ramrod straight arms she closed her eyes and croaker watched her profile graceful and strong limned against the subdued nightlights of the dialysis unit then she turned around lew how did you work this miracle he spread the fingers of his hands by definition miracles arent explainable right but really how did you do it he stared at her mutely her emerald gaze raked his face okay the clocks ticking the sepsis will kill her in a matter of days if we cant get it under control and the longer it remains unchecked the greater the odds we wont lick it tell your donors people ill need some time to verify the antigen findings on the documentation in one way were lucky usually id have to do a kidney biopsy on rachels before the transplant but in this case we have to forego it her conditions too critical to chance two operations thats turned into a plus now because itll save time the moment the organ is released we go right croaker said he felt his elation quickly replaced by a vivid sense of a steel door slamming shut behind him now hed have to call majeur and take his reprehensible deal for rachels sake he had to have that organ he was committed to terminating juan garcia barbacena who would be within striking distance shortly after midnight tomorrow surely the devil had him by the throat the question was would the devil ever let him go as in a dream or one of bennies druginduced altered states he observed himself using the phone on the desk to call majeurs private number he got the lawyers recorded voice and he left an urgent message giving majeur his cell phone number i have to wait for the call back he told jenny okay nothing more we can do here for the moment she put a hand to her midsection that was my stomach begging for food now im begging you feed me please by the time they pulled into the restaurants parking lot it was teeming not just raining but a tropical downpour that obscured even the far side of the intracoastal in south florida you were never aware of raindrops as discreet entities rather rain was solid as walls spit out of a lowering sky harbor lights was located just east of the flagler memorial bridge geographically it was not far from mattys place but ideologically it was on the other side of town a rare haven for young people in the old money oasis of palm beach the restaurant was named for the platters hit of the music in the place came from that decade which was cool again croaker chose a spot in the far lefthand corner of the lot and killed the engine for some time he sat looking at the rainswept parking lot as headlights swung across the sheened tarmac people hurried in and out of their cars their backs hunched against the storm you seem very far away just now he could smell the light citrus fragrance jenny wore what is it youre seeing croaker stirred it felt strange and nice to have her beside him i was thinking of all the promises ive made and kept none of them seem as important as the one i made to myself to keep rachel safe from harm inside he shivered in the sudden freeze of airconditioning as a hostess who seemed all browned legs and arms led them through the twolevel woodtrimmed restaurant its open kitchen stainlesssteel glinting through gouts of steam was on his right the thronged bar off to the left the happenings were singing see you in september reminding him of the hot summer nights of his youth and even hotter girls in sleeveless blouses and tight capri pants the smell of the steaming city asphalt in august was like a perfume all the girls wore would you mind if we sat outside jenny asked i find that after surgery i cant stand crowds its like my nerves are rubbed raw to his surprise her beauty was undimmed by her exhaustion on the contrary the slightly ragged edge of vulnerability heightened her allure too much proximity to human flesh and blood i suppose croaker whose head ached fiercely could empathize with her suits me fine ive had it with airconditioning outside beneath an enormous blue awning they had the deck to themselves the hostess lit candles for them the flames immediately flickered in the wind gusts sending shadows skittering nervously along the wall jenny asked for a scotch and he ordered a club soda with two limes and a double espresso from a darkeyed young waitress as he sank into the seat beside jenny he noticed the green of her eyes was made translucent in the candlefilled semidarkness the rain thrummed a heavy tattoo against the fabric of the awning threw up a fine spray against the concrete of the dock the waitress came with their drinks and a couple of menus croaker drank his club soda in two long swallows then turned his attention to the espresso now that the possibility has passed us by i need to know one thing he said do you have personal knowledge of this illegal organ harvesting jenny seemed to study him with the rapt attention she no doubt reserved for the openedup sites of her operations has this become some kind of obsession for you because of rachel because of her he admitted and other things her voice was peculiarly expressive cop things detective you havent answered my question no i have no personal knowledge of it ive already told you how i feel about illegal organ harvesting its anathema to me the waitress returned to ask if theyd like to order jenny said shed have a texmex salad grilled pompano and a side of pasta croaker said hed have the same when they were alone again croaker said and yet in that one moment earlier today you were prepared to transplant a kidney no matter its source i thought about it yes jenny sipped her scotch i was reminded of medical school she looked at him over the rim of her glass there were times there when i felt as if i were a novitiate in a nunnery daydreaming of sex my professors would discuss certain protocols and id find myself questioning them is this right isnt there another way a better method her front teeth chinked softly against the glass these heretical thoughts surfaced only at certain times when the protocols being discussed were ones for which no explanation was readily available they just worked no one knew why but all these protocolsfor cancers for instancehad serious side effects for the patient and id think are we doing more harm than good more often than not the patient was saved that much was true but he or she was changedweakened damaged like sand through an hourglass our magic protocols had drained away years along with the disease a gust of wind moaned through the dockside fluttering the candle flames a couple of candles at nearby tables went out all this came back to me in that instant with you the kidney i had another heretical thought but its gone now my life is restored to its proper order croaker tasted his espresso patient now that he saw what was happening he sensed that shed told him the truth also that her analogy about the novitiate was on the mark for her medicine was like religion it made sense out of the unexplainable it carved order out of chaos playing with its rules then was to use her own words anathema heretical because those rules were all that stood between her and the endless night of eternity in that regard they were very much alike both sentinels on guard against evil with these thoughts came a certain knowledge that some gulf that had separated them had vanished leaving them in startling and vulnerable proximity to one another the downpour drummed unceasingly on the awning and thunder rumbled ominously a moment later lightning unstitched the darkness in a bluewhite flash a brown pelican disturbed out of slumber from its perch beneath the bridge flapped its wings made a shallow arc across the intracoastal its long bill thrust forward it glided through the rain on a mission unknown their food and the call on coakers cell phone came all at once as the darkeyed waitress set down their plates croaker went off into a corner untouched by the fluttering candlelight he was near the water at the edge of the blue awning rain spattered his shoulders seeping down the back of his neck in darkness he did the dirty deed and spoke to marcellus rojas diego majeur the tiny numbers on his cell phone glowed green like phosphors on the ocean they seemed to squirm before his eyes like tiny evil eels about to insinuate themselves beneath his skin he heard majeurs voice in his ear and he immediately felt invaded he kept his eye on jenny her face floating in soft light as if the sight of her would keep him safe from majeurs spellcraft this close to the final edge he felt a certain dread creeping through him its a done deal croakers toes curled in hard reflex as the rain beaded his shoe tips im all yours excellent majeur said he seemed to have had no doubts the kidney he was offering would pass muster all that remains is the transfer of information on the subject he meant juan garcia barbacena the victim he was being circumspect because he knew croaker was on a cell phone his schedule has not altered midnight tomorrow where croaker stole another glance at jenny willing a part of him to weld itself to her this he needed above all else so that when as inevitably would happen he was stained by sin he might hold out hope of salvation through this link to her not over the phone majeur said but south seor it will be south the miami area ill need the kidney before then kiss him first on the back of the neck and send him down majeur could not deny himself a chuckle perhaps at his clever turn of phrase then your niece will have what she requires croaker wanted to argue but what with he had no leverage i need the information on our friend were compiling the last of the details majeur told him he does everything last minutethe securitys better that way i cant afford to wait croaker said my nieces condition has worsened patience is required mr croaker my client leaves nothing to chance neither should you majeur clucked his tongue in sympathy believe me the information will simplify a difficult and perilous task for rachels sake you dont want anything to go amissand neither do we no i need to kill juan garcia barbacena the first time going in croaker thought but what will be left of me when im finished will i be able to live with myself what if she dies while im waiting for you to get your act together what if the sky falls and we are all washed into the sea croaker could hear majeurs even breathing on the other end of the line have faith sir we will come out the other side of this whole where did a lawyer like majeur get faith like that croaker wondered meet me at tenthirty this morning thats as long as im prepared to wait he said on the boardwalk in sobe opposite the news cafe thats cutting it close but i can be there be sure you are croaker said the clocks ticking and i need all the time i can get croaker pocketed the phone as he walked back to the table i had them take our plates back jenny said the food would have gotten cold but there were questions silent as fish swimming in her eyes he nodded in thanks as he sat down that small gesture of sending his food back with hers felt like a tender kiss on the cheek he tried to stop his mind from racing whatever lay ahead for him didnt matter he knew it was rachels life that needed saving he could worry about his own later is everything all right she could not keep the anxiety out of her voice we are going to get the kidney as soon as i pay for it they want money their food came the waitress asked if she could get them anything else and he said no thanks very much thats all right jenny took up slivers of her grilled pompano i had no business asking mist had sprung up across the plucked skin of the water drifting in soft tangles that reminded him of a lovers hair spread across a rumpled pillowcase he looked at jenny a fine net of droplets sparkled like diamonds in her windtousled hair and the candlelight shone in her eyes like the sun he found himself regretting that hed set up this rendezvous to elicit her professional advice he liked her more he was attracted to her she very deftly twirled some pasta on the tines of her fork see while you were on the phone i was thinking the thing is id like it to be my business antonio and heitor were summoned into his mind like gen their amber eyes glowing with cold passion he said i dont think thats such a good idea he ate the fish without tasting it uncomfortable with the hurt look on her face the truth is id like it too jenny she tilted her head curious well then im falling down some kind of well blind as a bat in sunlight and i dont want to take you with me even if i choose to go thats not a choice you can make you dont have enough to go by by all means she spread her hands youll find im a very good listener he waved his fork forget it well thats a laugh i finally get up the nerve to take a positive step and you wont let me jenny no no ive come this far its a matter of trust isnt it i want you to hear this there was an expression on her face that seemed to him to be somewhere between sad and rueful as successful as ive been professionally ive managed to royally screw up my personal life i drove away my husband at the time he and i were both convinced it was my overriding dedication to medicine that did us in she stared out at the rainspattered night but i know the truth and its quite a bit more bitter he was a decent guy thunder ruled the sky across the intracoastal a fishing boat bounced and rolled at its mooring its decks white with rain jenny shrugged who knows maybe deep down i dont think i deserve a decent guy i mean look who ive picked since then dino my last boyfriend is typical big macho type drove a ferrari dressed real well a real hunk proud of his sexual stamina jen im gonna screw youtil you scream he actually said that and worse i was actually intrigued she watched his expression for disapproval perhaps so what happened we did it for ninety minutes straight instead of an orgasm he gave me a bladder infection they both laughed quietly almost politely but the mood didnt last too much electricity in the air he was silent for a moment and she went on in a softer tone you see how it is dont you how i surprised myself by being attracted to you because youre a decent guy i knew it the moment we met then i saw you with rachel and it pierced my heart though he couldnt say how he knew there was more she had to say but she didnt go on sometimes as now croaker had come upon a moment with a woman when some unspoken message passed through the air and hung suspended and invisible a kind of primitive recognition that stirred the cauldron of the universe out of its set pattern it was raw and sweaty a jungle thing no doubt about it jennys breath caught in her throat im not good at this she whispered really im not its comforting to know that youre not good at something im not good at skiing either she said he took her hand as he rose were not going skiing tim buckley was singing his sad songs of grace and dreamed encounters in a voice so fragile it made you want to cry jenny had infused her apartment with his music as if it were incense and by this act alone croaker knew she was revealing a hitherto hidden part of herself for croaker one of the most wonderful moments in life was when he first touched a woman with intimate intent the sense of anticipation the perception of what boundaries were about to flower open was so impassioned it made his blood seethe they stood in the middle of her living room barefoot on a thick carpet of swirling shapes and colors hands moving on each other she smelled of lemon and sandalwood and when her hair swung against his cheek he could feel it all the way down to his groin i love the way you feel he said softly she curled her head against his shoulder then she did something quite extraordinary tell me how she whispered in response tell me everything so he did every place he touched her he described and her body quickened in response her thighs trembling her breath rushing out of her in tiny perfumed exhalations with the forefinger of his right hand he touched the side of her neck feeling the triphammer pulse of blood then trailed it into the hollow of her throat where another pulse beckoned him then down over the swell of a breast until he found her nipple swollen with desire he described all of this into the whorl of her ear and she clutched him tightly to her she was turned on he suspected not only because of the heightened sense of the sex it gave herthe down and dirtiness of itbut because it gave her tangible evidence that he was thinking of her that there was more to this for him than mere lust there was nothing a woman hated more than to be left alone by her partner during sex he put his arms lower on her and she climbed him like a tree trunk locking her ankles over the top of his buttocks the pains hed received from beatings from antonio and the highway pavement receded into the background he pulled her to him telling her how it made him feel she shuddered hard against him and began to tell him how he was making her feel she was hot and wet and open and when he entered her there was no resistance at all with every move he made she spoke to him murmuring thrilling incantatory phrases that incited them both she came so fast it took him completely by surprise and by the time he had recovered she was climbing that mountain again shuddering and moaning between her gaspedout narrative this was a jenny marsh so far removed from the cool physiciansurgeon commanding the corridors of royal poinciana hospital she might as well never have been exposed to civilization who had seen jenny marsh like this before him her husband perhaps not dino the stud or any of her other boyfriends the moment held all the rare and breathless magic of glimpsing a unicorn prancing in moonlight in gaspedout delight she let go of everything she held rigid in her professional life he drove into her one last time throbbing uncontrollably as she urged him on with the throaty sound of her voice the scrape of her nails along his sweatribboned flesh the beat of her bare heels on the small of his back later twined in her bed in the darkness of the night she turned her face to his lights from outside filtered through the vertical blinds figuring her face with pale curls and crescents like aboriginal tattoos her eyes were in deep shadow and he could not read her with extraordinary delicacy she traced the asymmetrical scrapes and bruises beneath their gauze wrapping as if she needed to assure herself of dr stanskys competence you have that faraway look in your eyes she whispered tell me what youre thinking its a matter of trust isnt it she had said and she was right trust between two people was all that mattered if you could trust someone with your heart with the secret history of your life then even if the rest of the world went to hell it wouldnt matter so much for what he was committed to do now in order to save rachel felt like a living hell and more than anything now he needed solace if not absolution he told her about antonio and heitor the hideous organ harvesting theyd brought to south florida about sonia and vonda and about bennie and his guarani healer grandfather oh lew tell me this is some kind of terribly sick joke believe me i wish it was he took out the soulcatcher stone it gleamed dully its dark green turned to pitch black by the shadows whats that he held it between the tips of his fingers remember when rachel woke up not only woke from her coma but spoke rationally to me remember you said you couldnt figure it that there was no medical explanation lew in my business theres often no medical explanation thats something i wouldnt admit to just anybody this is what i did just before she woke he pressed the dark stone between her bare breasts staring down at it she shook her head i dont feel anything perhaps you wont but rachel did jenny sighed the fact is cancers go into remission patients recover when weve privately given up on them the human body is a miraculous engine of life this time it had help he could hear her breathing feel her soft breath like puffs of air keeping a balloon aloft over summer fields dear god a sharply indrawn breath her hands closed tightly over his where he held the soulcatcher to her chest her eyes fluttered closed and he could see her eyeballs beneath moving like someone dreaming streetlight entered the room as slowly as syrup with each beat of his heart time seemed to accumulate like gemstones at their feet her eyes flew open and in a voice hoarse with shock she said i saw something she looked down at his hand pressed against her take it away a violent shudder passed through her please croaker twisted put the dark stone on her bedside table what did you see what is it you have to do to get this kidney her voice was like a taloned ghost eviscerating the small pocket of serenity they had built to insulate themselves against the outside world he knew she had struggled against asking this dreadful question sensing that his answer would be even more dreadful holding her tight with her legs around him the naked core of her fast against him he didnt answer her he didnt have to all too soon he could feel the scald of her tears against his flesh lew oh my god oh my god i saw you you were floating in the water shallow water green and gold you were facedown one arm is gone torn away byi dont know what floating into mangrove bump bump bump against roots like the black legs of a great spider her forehead burrowed into his shoulder and there was blood so much blood that none could be left inside you she didnt want to let him go but she was smart enough not to argue he had promises to keep and miles to go before he slept outside her building he got into the tbird the storm had ended as abruptly as it had begun leaving the air humid and still and smelling of jasmine decomposing leaves and loamy earth an almost full moon rode low in the sky dulled to burnished copper the tree frogs insistent song shrilled the darkness he remembered when his father died shot down in an alley not three blocks from home hed relived the moment when hed been called to the scene over and over as if it were an endless loop he couldnt think of his father in any other way than the man suddenly old crumpled lifeless it was as if hed lost his father and all his memories of their life together until his fathers cop buddies took him out drinking after the funeral there halfdrunk hed absorbed their stories about his fatherfunny sad prideful embarrassingbut always intimate and in that way hed regained his inner balance gradually his father came back to him and hed felt restored now he thought about sonia his intimacy with jenny had somehow freed him from the nightmare of constantly reliving the moment when he had pulled open her refrigerator door at last he could remember her as she should be remembered her strong lithe body in his arms as they merengued across the shark bars dance floor he drove to an allnight gas station it was lonely the quiet broken only by the buzzing of the moths and the faint sound of a plaintive country and western song coming from inside the central kiosk everything was automated he didnt have to contact another human soul that was all right by him just now he felt as jenny had after her hours in surgery the oblivion of apartness was all he craved like stone tree in his comfortable shack in the everglades while the tank was being filled he tried not to think of the vision the spiritstone had showed her bump bump bump his own death with a convulsive gesture he inserted the floppy disk hed pulled from vondas jaws into his notebook computer the data had been partially corrupted by saliva blood glue dust who knew what else the computer balked but he persisted then his screen was filled with lines of data apparently the data had been encrypted because every so often a gibberish word would appear in the text what he read sent a chill through his veins here laid out in admittedly incomplete form was documentation of a secret life lived in the shadows carefully constructed by uncle sam according to the spotty data there was a highlevel official running a topsecret operation within croakers own anticartel task force there was a stern warning that all personnel working for something called dictrib were to be denied access to this data dictrib croaker discovered several pages farther on was the acronym for the developing capital countries trade relations bureau secreted away within the us department of state the data showed vast sums of money being moved from the states down to various places in latin america embedded in this data however was a frightening nugget the fund transfers had only destination codes the state department was quite fussy about paperwork all departmental requisition and transfer authorizations were required to have both origin and destination codes in order to be logged in with the dreadful dragons at finance and bookkeeping who were wont to pennypinch you to death these actf transfers lacked origin codes that could mean only one thing this operation was blackbudgeted blackbudget a term croaker had learned in his time with the actf meant the operation was funded without the consent or even knowledge of congress in effect it didnt exist black budgets were deemed necessary by the bureaucrats because sometimes covert operations or even entire divisions were deemed necessaryeven vitalto powerful interests even though their methods would never pass muster on capitol hill for security reasons the major players in blackbudget operations always used pseudonyms on documentation whether electronic or hard copy often these pseudonyms had secret meanings known only to those who chose them this one was using the name sero with a sense of mounting horror croaker recalled estrella leyes telling him about the special relationship between bennie and his grandfather humait had a secret name for bennie he always used when they were together sero he called him sero the mountain here was a secret so foul it sent croakers head spinning could it be could bennie milagros be working for the feds was that why he was so vague and secretive about his business dealings and what was sero doing on his computer screen croaker saw evidence mounting not only of movements of cash but of weapons tactical command cadres and strategic deployments of actf personnel throughout latin america all sanctioned and directed by sero by bennie just what in the hell was he up to each time croaker encountered a destination code he pulled up more evidence of this highly detailed and carefully considered network so much so in fact that at some point he realized that he was looking at the prep work for what must be the final phase of the operation what the hell was going on down there with the buildup of agents and arms it looked like a hot war brewing so far along that it could boil over at any minute and then he came upon one last bit of data it was partially corruptedso much so that it resisted all his attempts to copy it onto his hard drive it showed evidence that sero was running juan garcia barbacena barbacena was seros chief agent and informant in the field the pain of betrayal was so severe croaker almost doubled over now he knew why that secretive midnight run was so vitally important to bennie he was going to meet barbacena he needed to find a means of transportation that was totally secure what better way than with a private charter boat captained by a friend that way only two people knew of the arrangements before he gave them to barbacena bennie and croaker so this is what his friendship with bennie had been reduced to it was nothing more than a ruse to get barbacena into the country under a security blackout croaker pushed on with his work and was able to salvage two partial invoices detailing shipments of what were designated medical supplies but when he saw the sixdigit numeric of place of loadingwhere the supposed medical supplies came fromhis blood ran cold he knew that code from his dealings with the actf it was the federal arsenal in arlington sero wasnt sending barbacena medical supplies he was sending him government war materiel croaker sat in the tbird stunned into immobility this was a bennie that croaker did not know and could barely imagine and yet this was the way it was with the best of the masters they created personas so perfectly realized it was impossible to imagine them any other way croaker ran a hand across burning eyes he felt as if he was having a nightmare of a disaster happening he was powerless to stoponly to wake up to discover that reality was the real nightmare of course the thought immediately occurred to him that it was the bonitas who had left this modernday artifact for him to find he pulled out the floppy stared bleakly at the brief ironic note looking for this detective considering the source the data had to be viewed with a certain degree of skepticism could be the bonitas were trying to put bennie in a frame they certainly hated him enough but it defied logic how the hell could they have gotten access to a restricted government database but there was more evidence that bennies life was a lie according to the bell south records he was paying for majeurs private line was he majeurs mysterious client but if he was running barbacena why would he want his own agent killed that led croaker back to antonio and heitor they knew of croaker knew he was a detective they also knew hed seen sonia antonios first question to him rang in his mind you the boyfriend the bonitas must know he and bennie were friends a sudden chill swept through him how much more did they know about him was rachel now in jeopardy from them was jenny his scalp began to crawl majeur was not who he said he was and now it seemed neither was bennie who was lying and who was telling the truth who presented more danger the bonitas or bennie at this moment croaker had to admit he didnt know but he was sure going to find out until he did he was like a man with a highly infectious disease passing on deadly danger to everyone with whom he came in contact he got slowly out of the car and walking through a battery of moths fluttering in the bright lights returned the gas pump nozzle to its bay closed the gas cap on the tbird and got his credit card receipt all of a sudden he got a flash of the bonita brothers in his face as he clung to the back of their panel truck not now not yet antonio had said staying heitors hand what did that mean and why had antonio allowed him to escape back in the tbird he stared at the computer screen he was at the end of the list of actf destination codes he was about to close down the file when he noticed that the ribbon bar on the left side of the screen showed that he was not in fact at the end of the file he hit the home key twice then the down arrow key there at the very end of the file were embedssymbols within seemingly innocuous text youd have to be looking for them to notice they were screen prompts he called them up and discovered three more destination codes these however had a different prefix than the others he cleared the screen punched in the codes the screen went black he could see his modem being activated then the screen bloomed with color he was interfacing with the dictrib net immediately a security block popped up all he could think of was to type in his actf temporary id the software accepted it he entered the dictrib requisition codes and pressed enter the screen was wiped clear of data replaced by an ominous message code rescinded further access denied pending interview tomorrow flamingo park stadium ross darling who the hell was ross darling croaker thought and what the hell was dictrib he worked the keyboard trying to get an answer but he was effectively blocked worse when he relogged onto the actf net he got nothing but a blank screen his temporary access code had been revoked something hed done had woken the hydra day four i he spine of south beach consisted of three main northsouth thoroughfaresocean drive washington and collins avenueas they ran from first to eighteenth streets but those boundaries were of necessity fluid each week it seemed south beach was expanding northward and westward south beach had been in a state of decline for so long residents still seemed shinned by its recent revival built in the art deco and moderne styles in the s and s it had been through the great depression when you could get a room at a neardeserted hotel for five dollars a week through the s and s it was part of the safe haven for retirees mainly jews from new yorks garment and dry goods unions shops in the late s and early s the rundown historic buildings attracted speculators with more money than expertise and again many people lost money but only a few crucial years later by the end of the decade an influx of european designers models and photographers took quick advantage of the bargainbasement prices they were intrigued by the kitschy architecture and wild deco colors but croaker suspected their interest had more to do with resurrecting oldtime hollywood glamour than it did with a renascence of a bygone period of history it was just past midnight when croaker parked the tbird near the madonna club less than twentyfour hours until juan garcia barbacena landed in south florida and became croakers prey photos of the lap dancers to be hired inside the club were sheened with colored neon lending them an unreal edge the retouched glamour of the photosartificial and flavorlessserved to remind him of vondas empty life like sonia all shed needed was a chance at life she was not now going to get passing a cigar store with salsa music raw and sweaty blaring from its interior his thoughts strayed to bennie and then the sick feeling in his stomach surfaced all over again he found the lightning tube without difficulty this was the place gideons band manman was playing who was gideon rachels boyfriend her drug connection all too likely both the lightning tube had blackedout windows just like the margate gun racquet club he went around the corner saw that the club extended all the way back to a narrow alley filled with green dumpsters and a thin tabby cat that stared at him with eyes like marbles above the back door was a security light that buzzed like a nest of angry hornets in the dirty stucco wall were two filthy windows he looked in one saw a urinal and a sink on the opposite side of the alley was a metal security door bolted and padlocked there were no windows in this building he turned around and went back to the front entrance inside it looked like a garageconcrete floor and walls a trio of old gasoline pumps from the s blowups of pinup calendar pages from that decade were projected on the ceiling steel catwalks crisscrossed the bilevel space a bar constructed out of iron and aquatinted fused glass was the current center of activity cool cats in polyester sleeveless shirts and shiny slacks rubbed shoulders with modelwannabes with big lips and bigger busts a largescreen tv hanging from the ceiling was showing an episode of the patty duke show the great one where she played identical cousins the sound was off highdecibel rock music providing a bizarre soundtrack beyond on the raised dance floor manman was setting up croaker ordered two bottles of blackened voodoo a new orleans beer with a definite kick he watched the graceless moves the cool cats were putting on the hot babes he understood at their age hed done no better maybe the only real difference between him and them was that he was a little less scared stiff by life croaker bottles in hand strolled over to the band setup approaching a guitarist beer he said she turned do i know you croaker couldnt help staring the irises of her eyes were as yellow as a new york city taxi and the pupils were pitch black vertical crescents she looked like something out of cat people he shoved a bottle into her fist you do now she grinned showing a silver blob piercing the center of her tongue here take a real good look she stuck the tongue out at him the blob resolved itself into a tiny sculpted skull she laughed and downed half the blackened voodoo in one ravenous swallow im looking for gideon she had a wide almost pouty mouth a strong assertive nose and glossy blonde hair in another incarnation she might have been a college homecoming queen but she wouldnt have been half as interesting she smacked her lips gideon isnt here she was dressed in a black lace top and silver lurex skirt so short the lower curve of her buttocks was visible beneath black tights she wore four black leather belts with assorted studs one on top of another an armful of jangling third world bracelets and plain black anklehigh boots with chunky cuban heels you a fan a groupie or just looking to get laid thats some badass attitude youve got there he said staring at her something about her seemed familiar could they have met before stay awhile youll get a load of what crawls through the door id just like a word with gideon she finished her beer okay you said that so how come its a personal matter she shoved the empty bottle on top of an amp and snickered yeah right they all say that her guitar was one of those solidbody electric instruments fireball red with black roses on front and back she slung it on her hip like a cowboys sixgun this isnt about gideon she said its about you she leaned in gave him a disdainful sniff you stink man like youre strapped she lifted an eyebrow are you carrying a gun in that manly armpit once as a boy he had peered inside a burntout light switch only to discover the naked end of a loose wire glowing whitely that hot aura had held him transfixed he had wondered what would have happened to him had he stuck his finger inside without looking first this girl reminded him of that light switch a brittle plastic exterior concealing a whitehot current that could shock he lifted his arms im weaponless she rested her arms loosely on the top of her guitar he noticed that they were well muscled except for that terminator hand of yours he dug out the photo of rachel his sister had given him held it in front of the guitarists face you recognize her no but she was lying croaker was sure of it it was a popular mis conception that the eyes were an accurate monitor of truth lies imminent action forget the eyes croakers father had taught him look to the tiny muscles on either side of the mouth these were the places where secrets were given up her names rachel duke she and gideon have a thing going right you say youre not a cop but i say youre a lying geek actually im rachels uncle she fingered the strings of her guitar with studied nonchalance but something in her expression had changed maybe she was gideons old girlfriend jealous of rachel thats how things usually went in these bands whatever he knew he had to press his advantage i saw rachel yesterday he said in the hospital shes dying for the first time she faltered rachels dying slowly deliberately she took off the electric guitar you knew she was in the hospital didnt you i was with her the night she freaked those eerie cats eyes seemed to glow im gideon youre gideon croaker could not help staring at the peaked breasts that protruded saucily from beneath her black lace top one thing for sure he thought in that stunned instant gideon was nobodys boyfriend least of all rachels a look of disgust crossed gideons face fuck you i knew youd have that reaction now he recognized her put a black wig on her head dress her up in a seethrough vinyl raincoat and she was the model in the photo in rachels room a sudden rage burned within him he became aware that with each passing moment the oneounce bag of coke in his pocket seemed heavier and heavier until now it had become an insupportable weight something inside him egged him onsome spiteful piece so furious at rachels helpless situation the hellish moral box he was in his own bad assessment of bennie at the murders of sonia and vonda so close at hand they were like nerves rubbed raw and now thisconfronting his nieces lover who just happened to be a lesbian feeding rachel all kinds of drugs he was unsure whether he wanted to interrogate her or murder her he slapped the plastic bag on the black top of the bank of amps flipped open his federal id and said hey pal youre busted gideons gaze never touched the bag of coke whats this shit something i found stitched into the lining of rachels leather jacket croaker said you know the one with manman printed on it what were you doing in her closet gawking looking for her diary gideon pointed the guitars neck at the bag of coke hey that shits got nothing to do with me its got everything to do with you you sold it to rachel didnt you i never sold her anything gideons eyes glittered fiercely then she put aside her guitar excuse me i have to go pee croaker watched her make her way through the dancing throng to the toilets in the back of the club he moved after her as soon as he saw her disappear into the ladies room he went through the kitchen to the rear door he pushed through it into the dumpsterfilled alley he was just in time to see her slim body sliding legs first out the window of the ladies room he made enough sound to scare the tabby cat gideon landing in a semicrouch whirled toward him he could see her face painted in yellow and black by the security light like jungle camouflage her cats eyes burned in the darkness as she backed up against the filthy wall he could feel the coiled tension sparking off her skin what was she beneath her tribal paraphernalia she was like some throwback creature instincts honed to jungle pitch if she wasnt quite feral she wasnt domesticated either croaker twirled the ounce bag of coke now youll tell me about this she almost spat out her words i do drugs i make no bones about it but i dont sell not here he said and taking her by the elbow led her out of the alley and down washington to the tbird he opened the door for her and they got in okay he nodded you and rachel did drugs together lots of other things too that defiant look was back on her face but you provided the dope she nodded i drummed that one into her head it was either me or some sleazebag out to rip her off too much evil karma floating around gideon she odd on bad shit and because of her drug dependency she may very well die look i christ rachels got an addictive personality but i personally scoped out all the stuff we did this time you fucked up she pointed a forefinger at him youve still got that attitude dont you what attitude the you corrupted my pure little innocent niece attitude they sat glowering at each other from a close proximity that rankled them both were like wild dogs going at it he thought in despair whats wrong with us and then he understood what was happening they were battling over the same bit of territory rachel listen gideon i care for rachel i know you do too im sure you want to help her she shook her head you have no idea what i want i assume what drives you are the same emotions that touch everyone it was the wrong thing to say he knew it even before hed finished the sentence gideon made the harsh sound of a buzzer brrrup wrong uncle cop her voice had taken on the slightly condescending lilt of a game show host and now youve run out of questions to ask the freak youre times up and youve flamed out we must ask you to get the hell out of our face gideon i need your help i know somewhere rachel must have a diary i went through her room and couldnt find it in another act of defiance she reached out and turned on the cassette tape machine whatre we gonna have here she sneered barry manilow but her expression changed when she heard nancy sinatra singing these boots are made for walking she gave him a quick look then opened the glove box out tumbled a wall of cassettes the everly brothers jan dean irma thomas lesley gore the whole works gideon sifted through this veritable history of s pop music as if she were in a treasure trove suddenly she looked at him and when she spoke there was a new note in her voice you into this musicreally a hint of conciliation its a passion yeah with me too her head bobbed up and down afuckingmazing the curious and thorny exterior was now dissolving revealing the true creature beneath in that moment his anger was broken like moonlight on water for what its worth gideon i dont think youre a freak christ i wish i could believe that you can she looked down at the cassettes turning them over one by one at last she said i hope so we both belong to rachel so she had felt it too that ferocious animals imperative over territory then why did you run away from me hey pal youre busted she mimicked his voice with uncanny accuracy i saw the look on your face i was indicted tried and sentenced all within the space of a heartbeat right then you werent ready to listen to anythingespecially what i had to tell you he said nothing because she was right he had been ready willing and able to condemn her out of hand the late nights the coke the adrenaline rushes the kinky sex the whole sleazy picture had formed in his mind and he knew why it was because of what she was he felt the small bulge of the red rubber ball with the silk cords at the bottom of his pocket she was dead on in his mind shed corrupted rachel i made a mistake with you he said i wont do it again is that so but her tone was less defiant shed gone through that phase made her standand her point now a cautious note of curiosity had crept in she bent her head down put her thumb and forefinger into each eye when she lifted her head the bizarre cats eyes were lying on the tips of her fingers they were contact lenses her own eyes were china blue as she put the lenses away in a plastic case her eyes lost focus for a moment he would have given just about anything to know what she was thinking you were right about rachel she does have a diary she looked at him from the side did you happen to see the sachet in her dresser drawer sure it smelled of lilac so does her diary she stuffed it inside the sachet croaker thought an ingenious hiding place for a girl with secrets and an inquisitive mother thanks he said gideon seemed not to have heard him older people have this thing she stacked the cassettes back in the glove box they think its the wisdom of years that makes their flesh hang from their bones like crepe paper she looked at him well heres something for you to chew over rachel odd but it sure as hell wasnt because the drugs were bad i was doing the same shit that she wasall fucking night long that i guarantee a hundred percent got it croaker thought about the implications of what gideon had just told him he knew he needed to speak to jenny marsh as soon as possible why had rachel odd and not gideon that night he said softly did rachel do a lot of drugs yeah what kind cars hissed by the nancy sinatra tape had finished playing but neither of them made a move to replace it early in the evening we dropped some acid we smoked maybe a couple of joints over dinner then later when we were at the club we both did coke his fingers curled into fists on the steering wheel jesus in retrospect the whole cocktail thingyou know the drug mixwas maybe something we shouldnt have done you could say that im sorry gideon put her head back against the leather seat you cant possibly know how sorry tears were glittering in her eyes i dont want anything to happen to her i know this was not a young woman you could easily take in your arms to console so he did the next best thing he changed the subject what club she wiped her eyes with a forefinger what you said you were at a club that night which one the boneyard up here on lincoln road its a coffee bar in front in back its got this internet virtual sex thing rachel liked to hook up there a lot you didnt gideon gave him a dark and unnatural look i indulged her that remark sank into his consciousness like a fishing lure into deep water heres the thing he said i need you to tell me about rachel he took out the red rubber ball its black silk strings fluttered down you know what this is it lay in his hand like an evil eye plucked from a skull its a ball gag sm shit i found it at the bottom of rachels closet did you and she gideon shook her head not my thing not our thing in her face he saw the truth form like an air bubble rising to the surface of a lake croaker took a deep breath let it all go was she seeing someone else gideon suddenly seemed disturbed maybe she was anyway i thought so she sighed we argued about it often enough she always denied it but croaker held still because it seemed to have triggered a response he didnt want her to lose sight of the ball gag but what you know everyones got buttons you push em and wham they go off like fireworks the question of whether she was seeing someone else was one of rachels gideon put her hands together almost as if she were praying i told you that she had an addictive personality that didnt begin and end with drugs what did it begin with he asked softly sex gideon shook her head see for me sex is very straightforward always has been but for rachel she spread her hands i dont know it seemed like she was all tied up in knots about it she interlaced her fingers tightly it was almost like pleasure and guilt were mixed up together as if she couldnt feel one without the other which role is she into he rolled the red ball around his fingertips dominant or submissive i dont know with me shes neither we trade off depending on our moods she pushed her hair off the side of her face do you have any idea who else she was seeing uhuh he said she found someone to do the sm thing with gideon nodded thats my guess man or woman id say a man definitely no suspicions who uhuh croaker continued to roll the ball she must have given you clues people always do whether theyre aware of it or not youd have to be a psychic to pick up on them she said i mean the only male im aware shes seen has been ronald whatshisname her doctor stansky thats the guy i know about that my sister said she took rachel to see him six months ago that was for rachels annual school exam but you couldnt have been with her all the time you have your bandyou mustve been on the road she couldve seen anybody then and youd never know unless she told you something had come into gideons body a tension that was so pronounced croaker could feel its reflection like midday sunlight off pavement what is it maybe nothing gideon toyed with her silverstudded belts but its interesting rachels mom thinks she saw stansky only once why because during that time rachel saw dr stansky maybe half a dozen times what for gideon shrugged insomnia problems with her period a sinus infection anemia that sort of thing she saw the look on his face and responded to it but there couldnt have been anything more to it how do you know that cause i drove rachel every time she went wait a minute croaker said what did rachel need you to drive her for she couldve biked over stanskys office is in palm beach not far from where she lives no its not gideon said this stanskys got a clinic in margate margate croaker thought thats where the gold coast exotic car rentals is something began to click in his mind it was the sound of a sinister engine running in absolute darkness croaker held up the obscene red rubber ball with its silk cords i wonder if dr ronald stansky knows what a ball gag is gideon gazed at it as if it were a dark star she tapped its curve with a fingertip i wonder if the damn things his croaker saw her back to the club then returned to the tbird i want to see rachel gideon had told him just before hed left her but i dont want to be there with matty rachel doesnt want her to know about us and i dont want to be the one to break it to her dont worry shell think youre just a friend no she wont gideon told him im not just a friend and i wont lie croaker knew enough about her to believe that so he told her when matty was least likely to be at the hospital he turned the ignition and gunned the engine it seemed to him curious that he now thought that rachel was in some ways lucky to have met gideon he pulled out in time to touch off the air horn of a semi rolling up washington right behind him he sounded his own horn but the semi wasnt slowing its driver seemed confident in his trucks overwhelming size croaker thought the hell with it and stepped on the gas the turquoise tbird shot out into the avenue in the periphery of his vision he was aware of the huge chrome grille of the semi filling the rearview mirror it seemed to overflow it the driver of the semi startled out of his cockiness slammed on his brakes as croaker roared off by the time he had made a left onto tenth street he had a sense he was being followed a white bmw sedan with heavily smoked windows to make sure croaker made a sudden left onto pennsylvania with the tbirds custom engine roaring the white bmw accelerated into the turn rocking on its shocks croaker could see the miami area laid out in front of him as if on a lighted grid miami beach was one of what was essentially a chain of islands separated from the mainland by the intracoastal waterway and biscayne bay it was connected to miami by a series of causeways because south beach was on the extreme southern end going south from here was a dead end unless you were going to take the macarthur causeway that linked fifth street here with thirteenth street in miami that was going to be his immediate destination guessing right the white bmw made up some time and was close on his tail as he wove in and out of the slowmoving traffic on the causeway it was interestingand ominousthat the bmw was not interested in hiding its intent they flew past star island on the right then palm and hibiscus islands small exclusive enclaves of houses each with their own boat slips amid the palm trees and massive florida rooms giving out onto magnificent milliondollar views of the bay there was enough money afloat on that small part of the bay to satisfy even the most grandiose ego despite his best efforts croaker could not pull away flat out the tbirds horsepower engine could outtorque the bmw but when it came to maneuvering between cars the bmws streamlined shape and superior cornering had a distinct advantage all at once they were into another world entirely downtown miami stark and modern anonymouslooking big businesses vying with tacky tourist shops traffic dried up like drizzle in tropical sunlight when there was a choice croaker had been careful each time to take the obvious one he wanted to make it easy for the driver of the bmw to get so comfortable with them hed begin to unconsciously anticipate them it was the same technique by which you controlled a suspect in an interrogation you revealed little bits of yourself until he was under the misapprehension that he was in control that was okay your first job was to get him to be in synch with you then when you pulled away this security he was yours the tbird crisscrossed shadows for moments at a time it was lost to the bmw until the driver caught on and switched his atten tion from the silhouette of the tbird to the twin beams of its headlights which told him not only where croaker was but where he was headed the sidewalks were as deserted as if a neutron bomb had been detonated even the hustlers and streetwalkers had migrated with the tourists and the kids south to coconut grove bluewhite light bounced off highrises reflective windows but in between the darkness had the stifling impenetrability of the jungle croaker headed south again along the very end of biscayne boulevard soon he would run out of road at first street he cut over to se second avenue still heading south they were alone on the street arrowing through the unquiet urban night into the city smell of hot sooty concrete seeping diesel fumes and stripped rubber tires came another scent water slowmoving as sludge they were approaching the miami river and croakers scalp began to itch as the driver of the bmw read his moves and reacted to them as croaker then responded to the bmws counters a kind of invisible cord had sprung up between them like knifewielding adversaries bound by a short length of rope they had traversed the city without having lost or gained ground their arena was still the space between the tbird and the bmw now that was about to change up ahead he could see it a large hulking presence part massive steel stanchions part poured concrete in the streetlightstudded darkness it looked like the skeleton of a saurian rising from its tar pit deathbed it was the new brickell avenue bridge and he was headed right for it the bridge had been under construction for over a year now its concrete underbed only half complete the rest of the span was bare metal girders the approach road was closed off and barricaded with wooden sawhorses banks of blinking amber lights and a mobile electronic message board that warned road closed danger you bet as he approached he could make out the forms of cranes bulldozers piles of steel piping iron girders wooden scaffoldings bags of cement powder he was heading straight for the unfinished bridge it was there in the close shadows that he would engage the bmw if he didnt plunge at top speed into the river croaker extinguished his headlights then he jerked the wheel over hard to the left pushing the tbird into a lane that would have been filled with oncoming traffic had it been hours earlier with a screech of tires he floored the car pouring all the horsepower under the hood into a single fireball shot that would bring him through the barriers onto the unfinished bridge he had baited his pursuer with those beams hiding in the shadows so the driver would be forced to fix his attention on them in order to follow the tbird just when the driver had become used to its beacon lights hed switched them off on the unfinished span he drove the tbird with the concentration of an acrobat venturing out onto a high wire beneath his tires bare iron rails between them were gaps that could trap a wheel and instantly disable the tbird he took his foot off the accelerator the tbird glided along the iron girders of the bridge like a locomotive then he stepped on the brake bursts of yellow from the caution lights illuminated the interior in the rhythmic bursts of fireworks he got out of the car and found a space between the sawhorses he edged into the darkened construction site it smelled of oiled machinery wet concrete and creosote he paralleled the bmws headlight beams as if he were skating on moonlight he could see the glint of metal pipes and girders were stacked on either side of him they were striped by dark shadows thrown from a makeshift ramp of wooden boards and plywood just to his left from between the gaps the amber caution lights winked on and off like giant jewels beneath his feet more metallic glints water ran in dark rivulets across the rough underbed of the unfinished bridge to the west he could hear the roar of a car engine joining the endless hum of traffic on but he was far away from that sound so much like a beehive on a dark and perilous periphery he was acutely aware that his work here had as little to do with that traffic stream as it did with the big boats berthed at the nearby island havens he was all alone in the night as cut off from everyone and everything as if he were piloting the captain sumo in uncharted waters miles from shore from behind him came a deepthroated roar he turned in time to see the white bmw airborne the driver had used a wooden work ramp as a launch croaker picked up a length of metal pipe the bmw overflew the tbird and was almost upon him when he raised his biomechanical hand he jammed the end of the pipe between the front axle and the underbed of the car when it landed it went into an arcing skid it tipped up onto its rightside wheels the pipe created a shower of sparks trailing behind it like a roman candle croaker ran into the shadows somewhere behind him a car door slammed he listened for another door to slam but none came there had been only one person in the bmw and he was now following croaker onto the bridge he worked the construction site scientifically breaking it down into quarters and methodically searching each one this far onto the bridge the beams of the bmws headlights were fractured into brittle shards by the machinery and materials the only other illumination came from the blinking hazard lights at the foot of the bridge he was almost midway over the river the iron girders arced like a pair of mastodons rusks bare and burnished in the light like patinaed ivory he looked down at the river and when he turned back he saw something behind him melting back into deep shadow he circled back the way he had come it was difficult to make out anything clearly the blinking lights played tricks causing him to see movement where there was none he thought he saw a patch of darkness more distinct than the surrounding shadows he froze where he was watching it for some time it could be the silhouette of a human being or not but there seemed to be a quality about it that was somehow unnerving a moment later he lost the shape he blinked had it moved or had it merely been a trick of the light he couldnt say but in any case he moved cautiously toward where it had been he was now on the edge of the bridges skeleton in front of him between the bare bones of its steel girders the river gleamed dully it was in that split instant looking down at the water that he sensed the movement behind him hed heard nothing however but the now familiar background sounds of the city at night his head came up and he was turning to look behind him when the gun butt crashed into the side of his head croaker collapsed onto the girder the acrid smell of rust and oiled metal swept over him as he gripped the girder he grunted as a steeltipped boot struck his rib cage it plunged into his side again in order to get away he was forced farther out along the span he crawled painfully along the girder with the understructure below him and the river below that his tormentor followed striking him again and again with the heel of a boot he could not see beyond that boot could not even turn his head enough to identify the figure towering above him now the heel smashed into croakers side kicking his body off the girder with a rush of humid air into his lungs he swung from the girder holding on only with his hands every time he tried to gather his legs beneath him to try to swing his whole body back up onto the girder a boot trod hard on hip or knee croaker felt the fear stir deep inside his belly this man was giving him no chance to counter the two choices left him were equally bad he could either continue to grip the girder while he was slowly pummeled into unconsciousness or he could let go now and drop into the black and gunmetal spiderweb of the understructure maybe hed survive all that metal and drop into the river more likely the metalwork would break his neck or back or legs before hitting the water croaker did the only thing he could do he waited for the boot to whistle toward him again then he shifted his weight to counterbalance himself as he let go with his biomechanical hand opening his stainlesssteel and titanium fingers he grabbed the boot just before it struck him and shoved it outward the man fell to one knee in almost the same motion he dropped his left leg downward the heel of his boot struck croaker in the forehead croaker almost lost consciousness and his right hand lost its grip on the steel seeing croaker swinging from the fulcrum of one hand the man grunted in satisfaction he pulled back his leg to deliver another vicious kick and croaker let go with his titanium fingers he dropped into blackness but it was no more than two feet he landed on a diagonal brace and he clung there halfstunned staring upward at his adversary he had a painblurred glimpse of a darkened face then he was staring into the muzzle of a gun from the manner in which the man pointed it at him from the tension coming into his frame croaker knew he was going to use it that he had meant to use it all along when hed been a kid hed loved model trains he loved the perfect miniature world they inhabited stations with tiny painted metal commuters and sidings where they picked up diminutive wooden logs but mostly he loved the sound the metal wheels made over the tracks it had a peculiar metronomic sound that was blissful now hanging by a thread from the unfinished span he heard that sound again his wouldbe killer heard it too because he whirled in time to see a man though he was crouched over croaker could see that he was tall and lean he was hurtling toward them from the far side of the span with impossible speed as if in a dream croaker saw his legs moving with the gliding swing of an expert ice skater only there was no ice he glided across the steel girders like a wraith or a demon summoned up from another time and place then he passed through a patch of light and croaker saw he had on a pair of inline skates for a man approaching at speed he held his upper body astonishingly still it was very odd the skater held his left arm straight out as a marksman might but there was no gun in his hand instead croaker could see the dark glint of a small round object held against the open palm the skater launched himself through the air he was hurtling straight at croakers assailant the man shifted his aim from croakers face to the oncoming skater the man pulled the trigger the sound of a gunshot flat and ugly smacked against the buildings it rebounded over the construction site like a flock of startled birds taking flight then the man and the skater both crashed to the concrete entangled the skater immediately pressed two fingers against the side of the mans head the man seemed to freeze as if every nerve connection in his brain had been temporarily frozen with the heel of his other hand the skater slammed the mans head against rough concrete then he opened his slender fingers the dark stone gleamed against the flesh of his palm without a word he pressed it hard against the mans breastbone the mans mouth gaped open and he arched off the steel girder and the wet concrete croaker clung to the diagonal brace panting with expended effort fear and an excess of adrenaline lights blinking in the distance seemed to spin around on mad axes he felt his muscles begin to spasm and he knew he could not hold on much longer it was then he looked up into the face of the skater it peered down at him dark and large as a harvest moon the skater clucked like a mother hen madre de mentiras seor you are having one shitty day it was antonio bonita he clambered down until one foot was braced against the steel beam to which croaker clung he reached down and gripped croakers hand with surprising ease he helped him back onto the girder he sat back on his haunches as croaker knelt long after hed shaken off the aftermath of the vertigo croaker kept his chin on his chest as if in utter defeat he concentrated on putting the pain into a confined space while he built back his strength without warning he lunged at antonio his stainlesssteel nails extruded to their full length but the slim man danced away circling like a vulture on his inline skates he shook his head lifted a warning finger rocked it back and forth then one finger became two three four and between each finger he produced like a magician a dark green stone smooth as glass not tonight seor not ever croaker stared at the stones wondering at their power and though he knew this was precisely what antonio wanted hed been given enough warning by estrella leyes and by his own experiences with the soulcatcher bennie had given him to know that for the moment at least antonio was beyond his control croaker settled back down willing the tension out of his frame antonio nodded this serenity is difficult for you i know he seemed pleased as if croakers effort at selfcontrol proved a point hed been trying to make croaker kept his expression neutral though he was racked by pain why did you save me antonio circling back shrugged i like you you saved me twice croaker began to stretch his terribly cramped muscles he was careful now not to make any sudden moves your brother wanted to kill me do not presume to know heitors mind seor i dont even know your mind you killed sonia antonio said nothing his amber eyes studied croaker as incuriously as if he were a specimen on a lab table and yet you came to her house pretending to be her brother carlito why i wanted to see you for myself seor antonio had come to a halt he was so still it was unnerving and now croaker knew the shadow hed followed out onto the girder had been antonio no it was more i wanted to meet you so you could lie to me what was the bullshit with carlito and rosa antonios amber eyes darkened in southeast asia croaker had been taken tiger hunting these were large silent beasts very powerful very cunning hunting machines but these attributes were all secondary hed been told to what made the beast so deadly it was the tigers unpredictability you never knew what was in its heart when it would turn on a dime and claw the flesh from your rib cage in the darkness and the striped yellow light antonio looked like such a large jungle catsleek swift deadly unknowable others lie to you seor as carlito i spoke the truth carlito worked for us just as i told you the description of our operation is as i described it we allow the people who work for us much autonomy in return they embarrass us with riches they enjoy an elite lifestylethey become untouchable they are for a time like demigods and carlito he was just as i depicted himstrong willed vibrant a player with a capital p but he was also how shall i say a bit too independent minded so you killed him in a way he was responsible for his own demise seor he knew the rules going in we have no secrets from our employees on that score betrayal on any level simply is not tolerated when as now antonio smiled in just that way croaker could feel a connection that made his bones grow cold now you understand antonio said my lifes work is to lead people into sin if i find that weakness in them i punish them such an enigmatic man and yet with croaker he seemed to ache to be known did you love bennies sister rosa did you ask her to marry you was this the truth you told me it couldnt be because you killed her but it is the truth seor every word croaker shook his head uncomprehendingly what could you possibly know about love everyone you touch you kill not everyone antonio pursed his lips but it is true that people who fall into my orbit are ultimately weak people sin it is the human condition and according to you sins demand to be punished croaker stirred he could find no position in which his body did not ache why youre not god to decide such things in asuncion i was a god people came to mesick unto deathpeople without hope they surrendered everything to me and i healed them this was the special knowledge that bennies grandfather had taught the bonitas this was the mesmerizing quality of his stare that caught you unguarded that man who was about to kill me croaker asked what did you do to him antonio grinned he offered his left hand in it flashed a dark green stone the dark stones know croaker said thats what you said on the back of the truck this is heta i now the grin disappeared who has told you this the stone vanished as well whatever you think you know of heta i forget this is sound advice seor it is given out of friendship were not friends antonio antonio rose silent majestic as a crane unfolding itself in marsh grass escuchame seor listen to me in this life friends are not friends as he disappeared into the darkness croaker called after him antonio how did you find me here how did you know id be at sonias there was no answer and croaker stood on cramped legs and raised his voice im going to track you down antonio for what you did to sonia and vonda the known landscape consisted of the urban susurrus of cars speeding by far away the steady bunking of the yellow caution lights at the foot of the bridge the soft purling of the sluggish river far below from out of this darkness came antonios voice you are already in my orbit seor but as of yet you are another exception you have not sinned a seagull cried the lorn sound no less explosive than the sound of a gunshot croaker shook himself back into awareness of the immediate environment it was not so easy antonio bonita had a way of holding you spellbound croaker went to where the unknown gunman lay in the shadows he was young not more than thirtyand he was large he must have weighed well over two hundred pounds he wore black cotton clothes lightweight functional the kind of clothes you went out in at night when you wanted to blend into dark backgrounds there was blood all over the lower part of his face above his cheeks and forehead were smeared with lampblack even in moderate light his face wouldnt show up in the impossible instant his gray eyes opened croaker felt paralyzed with shock the mans left hand curled into a modified fist the knuckles ugly with calluses and scars canted forward at a precise angle croaker familiar with many forms of handtohand combat recognized the preliminary movements of karate the fist smashed into croakers ribs making him grunt in pain then he kneed croaker and went after him in earnest in combat a skilled assailant has two choices immobilize the victim or kill him it was clear this man wanted to kill croaker he was going for the throat croaker rolled and the strike glanced off a collarbone it was still powerful enough to make him see stars the man gave croaker a vicious kick in the shin then drove his deadly fist inward for the killing stroke croaker gasping in pain had only one option and he took it he wrapped his biomechanical fingers around the mans throat and pressed inward with his thumb the cricoid cartilage broke apart and within seconds the man was dead it was never an easy thing to kill a man even when you had no other choice the act made you sick in your soul no matter what anyone told you to the contrary once you killed a man you were changed forever there was a scar inside you that no amount of time could heal croaker used his biomechanical hand to search through the dead mans pockets he found a wad of ten hundreddollar bills a handful of extra ammunition and a snickers bar sugar for a quick burst of energy he stripped off the corpses belt and steeltipped boots checked inside no id no keys had he left them in the bmw a short walk to the white car revealed keys still in the ignition croaker searched the car found nothing he glanced at the vehicle tag saw it was one of those reserved for a car dealer stolen no way to trace it this man was a professional on the way back he found the gun it was a modified colt special one of the modifications was black sticky tape wound very tightly around the grip the other was that the serial number had been filed off the mob used weapons like that so did field agents of the actf who was this man croaker didnt know but with a premonitory shiver he rolled the bullets around his palm he needed to get them into better light to make sure croaker stared down at the corpse what had antonio done to immobilize him just two fingers to the temple then hed pressed a spiritcatcher to his breastbone why he needed to speak to someone with an expertise in guarani heta i estrella leyes he picked his way back to where the dark tbird hulked and reaching in turned the key in the ignition square in the beam from the headlights he took another look at the bullets dark stars they were custom made they had heads that acted like shrapnel exploding inside a body lots of damageusually fatal even if you missed a vital organ also there was nothing but unidentifiable bits of twisted metal for a ballistics expert to find he felt as if he were in an elevator plunging from a height of a hundred stories up he had seen bullets like these before in fact he had had occasion to use them they were standard issue for certain field personnel in the anticartel task force with due deliberation he sat behind the wheel of the tbird he looked at his face in the rearview mirror his skin was as pale as if hed just seen a ghost he dropped the bullets into his pocket still lost in thought he sped off heading north what kind of hydra had he wakened hed tried to penetrate something sacrosanct the developing capital countries trade relations bureau was that why the actf the bureau he had once freelanced for now had him marked for death maybe ross darling the man who had cut off croakers computer access would provide the answers if darling didnt himself try to finish the job the gunman had been given he rolled into sobe and parked on a quiet leafy street three blocks from ocean drive it was am and he needed some sleep only hours before his meeting with ross darling he hauled himself out of the tbird and went up the steps of a small stucco building its exterior had been recently renovated painted deep blue and purple art deco colors to fit in with the surrounding gentrification he was not surprised to find the front door open it was always left open this was st francis of the palms church but everyone in the neighborhood called it the surfers church sixteen months ago the new priest had begun an outreach program to gather the lost kids already halfdead on coke and heroin who drifted like a red tide of algae through sobe how successful he had been remained yet another religious mystery there was something about the interiors of churches a kind of hush that spoke directly to the soul you didnt have to be a practicing catholic to feel it the particular density of liturgy and extirpated sins the atmosphere felt as if it hadnt changed in centuries which was of course the point you were meant to feel that no matter where you were born when you passed through the sacred portal you had come home croaker was not hypocrite enough to go through attendant rituals he did not believe in nevertheless he felt the last of the adrenaline leach out of him as he sat in a wooden pew and drank in the place the arches in the creamcolored stucco interior were studded with dark wooden beams stark iron nails whose heads were as big around as his thumbnail the carved wood altar was covered by a holy cloth against the rear wall rose an image of the crucified christ on either side were painted plaster statues of the virgin mary and of st francis the interior smelled of candle wax age and the sea croaker put his forearms across the back of the pew in front lowered his head to the impromptu pillow the moment he closed his eyes his mind slipped away mercifully he could no longer recall the instant he had pulled the trigger on his first killajucar martinez later people would call martinez a madman but croaker knew better martinez wasnt nuts he was demonically evil he knew just what he was doing all the way down the line as he had slashed his way through five hookers croaker hadnt told majeur the whole story regarding martinez hed not only tattooed their faces with his razor hed not only cut off their breasts hed made them eat the organs before he slit their throats somewhere in the universe there might be a word to adequately describe this man but if so croaker didnt know it croaker had caught up with him and when martinez had come after him with the razor hed wielded so expertly croaker had shot him in the knee not nearly enough to stop a man like martinez whose extraordinary will to kill and to keep on killing was like a potent intoxicant it wasnt even enough to shut his mouth his impromptu oration was horrifyinga vivid description of his work on the whores hed murdered it was croaker supposed why hed shot martinez in the face twice the split instant between life and death was now as opaque to him as winter ice in the adirondacks but the look on ajucar martinezs face was not below a shattered forehead above an all but obliterated jaw and throat the mans eyes were open in a fixed stare in them croaker could see not only the realization of martinezs death but a piece of his own life this shocked him so much that for a moment hed felt as if his heart had ceased to pump like an animal with a battlescarred face something of croaker had been irrevocably expended in his effort to stay alive it was no longer his and he would never get it back it was this not the sight of all the blood that made him turn away and vomit that night he had been pursued over the terrain of his dreams the relentless presence was behind him no matter which way he ran which turns and twists he took no matter where he hid in the gray light of dawn when he had awakened hed quickly dressed without shaving or showering without breakfast in a stomach clenched tight with apprehension hed entered the cool echoey apse of s maria gloriosa he had not been to his neighborhood church in many years but now it had become a place of ultimate sanctuary beneath the great stainedglass windows where years before he and matty had been confirmed he knelt he spoke to no one not even when father michael had walked by and croaker knew he had been recognized that afternoon hed cancelled his date with his girlfriend he could no more talk to angela than he could talk to father michael he had awakened from his nightmare with the sure knowledge of who was pursuing him over the dreamscapes of his own imagining it was god croaker stirred there was an art to sleeping in hard awkward places if you didnt know what you were doing youd wake up with your neck so stiff you couldnt turn it without pain lancing up into your skull he slid down in the pew and looked out a side window he watched the movement of the leaves beneath the streetlights in the way in which they refracted the light they transformed plain plate glass into the stainedglass windows of s maria gloriosa after a time he closed his eyes he dreamed he was in a calm and peaceful place bluegreen light glowed like clouded sunlight on a faceted jewel he drifted on a diffuse and syrupy bed then with a start that jolted his heart he realized he was lying facedown in water his arms were flung wide and his lungs were burning he longed to take a breath but he knew if he did hed drown at last he couldnt hold out any longer and he opened his mouth to breathe stone tree had once told him of the giant lying out of sight just below the horizon opening eyes full of pearls after a long nights sleep this giant sent reflected light into the sky in advance of the sun croaker woke up to find the sky was no longer dark at six in the morning flamingo park stadium was not quite as deserted as one might expect on the western fringe of sobe it was surrounded by low and midrise buildings from the s and s a felicitous gentrification was infiltrating the neighborhoodrenovations repainting and restoring apartments to a state surpassing their original glory now condos for sale signs hung in front of these complexes even while workmen moved in and out of open doorways at this early hour the tradespeople had not yet arrived but across meridian avenue kids were tossing hardball around the baseball diamond or skateboarding on the pavement just outside the stadium dogs barked joyously as they ran chasing one another across the playing fields from somewhere nearby the scent of freshly brewing coffee entwined with the jacaranda and jasmine croaker his shirtsleeves rolled up was giving an impromptu lesson in bunting to a nineyearold as phil rizutto liked to say bunting had become a lost art croaker was just doing his bit he felt oddly clearheaded for someone with only a couple of hours of sleep and this was why moments ago hed spoken to rafe roubinnet on his cell phone rafe never slept he liked to watch the dying of the night from the deck of his sixtyfivefoot catamaran after the incident on the brickell bridge croaker knew hed need a safe haven his sisters place was out of the question and sonias was already known by the bonitas rafe was the obvious choice he was a friend who owed croaker a great deal the expoliticians contacts and shrewd mind were priceless assets now rafe agreed to meet him at the miami yacht club at one that afternoon heres the key croaker said to a frecklefaced nineyearold named ricky you want to hit it hard enough to get past the catcher but not hard enough so the first or third baseman will get it in time to tag you out swinging away im a champ ricky said i can place the ball anywhere you think im kidding watch he swung the bat in a practice swing right field he said and promptly hit it there center he said and drove a line drive up the middle he put the bat on his shoulder and grinned its a kinda trick really juliohes the pitchersends me the right pitch for wherever i want to hit it he shrugged but with bunting i dont know its not so easy lets give it a try croaker watched the kid put too much pressure on the bat and mistime the bunt dont hold the bat he counseled ricky cradle it like this he didnt look up even when a tall stoopshouldered man detached himself from the last of the shadows of the wide meridian avenue entrance the man had prematurely white hair and such a redcheeked face he looked like hed just come back from a coldweather run he had pale blue eyes the color of shallow water and his hair was cropped detention short he was not a young man but this haircut made him seem older he had the kind of face you rarely saw anymoreone that had once presided over traveling carnivals his was a face made up of equal parts sheriff and judge perhaps he had seen one too many marvels of human oddity because there was something in his demeanor that made it clear he could no longer be surprised the man walked methodically to the backstop he had the heavy even tread of a veteran boxer entering the ring one part wariness two parts resignation he wore one of those travelers raincoats you could fold away in a pocket it was tissuethin and was as wrinkled as an elephants hide beneath it he wore an oldfashioned charcoal suit with narrow lapels and a pair of colehaan tasseled loafers maybe he was an early bird on his way to work when the man was positioned directly behind croaker he said time to talk croaker spoke softly to ricky one more time as he repositioned his hands on the bat when ricky nodded he turned around and began to walk down the first baseline in foul territory the whitehaired man was forced to hurry to catch up ross darling i presume dont be cute darling must be sweating in that raincoat it was one of those awful manmade fabrics that didnt breathe croaker kept walking at a brisk pace you the honcho who eightysixed my actf code what was your code doing in dicktribe territory is that how you pronounce dictrib speak softly and carry a real big dick ross darling pulled his raincoat closer around him as if he felt a sudden chill what did you think you were doing fooling around with mommys cookie jar this was going to be fun croaker thought two grown men throwing questions at each other without much hope of getting a single answer but there was no harm in trying i assume since you closed me down that the distribution numbers i fed into the computer are from the dictrib database if they were real id want to know real fast what a guy like you is doing with them id request a rendezvous with a guy like you and id put a stop to your poaching pronto croaker sighed i suppose this is where you pull a gun and threaten me he stood so that he was straddling the white first baseline its true i dont trust you worth a damn darling said but i dont happen to believe in guns theyre loud and theyre gross and worst of all they make you lazy when youre holding a gun you dont have to think do you his right arm extended and in a flash hed manacled croakers biomechanical hand with a ring of black metal a titanium and molybdenum alloy even you cant break i had it made especially he said this matteroffactly with no particular hubris the band held croakers hand fast he was unable to move his fingers even to flex them so youre a thinker darling croaker kicked in what appeared to be annoyance and frustration at the lime of the first baseline there was a sharp crack of a bat then darling quickly ducked as a baseball went whizzing by him as he was doing so croaker wedged himself against him let me go croaker whispered in his ear what darling froze at the feel of metal pressed to the side of his jaw this croaker said is a modified colt special darling did nothing for a moment he breathed evenly in and out croaker could almost hear him turning over the probabilities in his mind at length he carefully snapped open the titanium and molybdenum cuff croaker moved the to where darling could see it as darling examined it he waved at ricky who gave darling the finger then waved back at croaker kicking the first baseline had been the signal for the kid to hit a ball at darling its got black tape wound around the grip and the serial number has been professionally defaced sound familiar should it darling said blandly hed already recovered from this small reversal of fortune croaker dug in his pocket its loaded with these he held up one of the handmade bullets i remember what we call these darling dark stars because when they hit thats all they leave a big black fucking hole in the target you sound pissed being set up for target practice does that to me croaker waggled the colt special last night someone tried to take my head off with this christ the situations worse than i thought darling said just what the hell does that mean youve been officially sanctioned for termination darling said how does that particular bureaucratic euphemism grab you the sun had crept above the lowlying clouds on the eastern horizon it sent its light flooding over the top of the bleachers a shadow a dark crescent made by the top tier of the bleachers ringed the field all of a sudden the fogs clearing croaker said unhuh i can see how youd want me killed pronto it doesnt track darling said think about it why would i set up a meet with you and in the interim order your termination you tell me i wouldnt darling said i didnt moreover i know who did he was awfully cool for a man with a gun to his head as croaker wondered about this his eye was caught by an almost phantom movement the shadow cast by the bleachers had changed shape a little piece stuck up above the symmetrical curve and this interested croaker it was in a place directly behind darlings left shoulder croaker was more or less facing it if he looked up he might see what was causing it or maybe not hed be looking directly into the sun okay ill bite croaker said if you didnt order the termination who did darling said archly hey i have an idea lets have a pissoff youre hot because youve been sanctioned im hot because i dont know what the fuck an actf freelancer is doing with classified dicktribe code numbers croaker ground the muzzle of the deeper into the other mans temple listen you little shit i know theres a specific actf directive against computer access by any and all dictrib personnel its clear dictrib and the actf are enemies ive done work for the actf last night i almost get my head blown off by a fed stalking me his weapon of choice is actf issue i think you know all about the attack i do but youre dead wrong croaker if you think i had anything to do with it at least im not dead out of the corner of his eye croaker saw the slight movement in the edge of the bleachers shadow and knew what that meant without warning he grabbed a fistful of darlings raincoat with his biomechanical hand and jerked him clean off his feet darling stumbled and croaker halfdragged him into the shadows of the bleachers they crouched under the seats it smelled of rotting wood and decayed plant matter soft light laced through with sawdust filtered down from above it felt cool and protected what the hell is this all about darling whispered only one reason why a man with a gun to his head stays so calm croaker told him hes not alone he jerked again on darling isnt that right someones at the top of the bleachersi saw his shadow on the field get him down here where i can see him croaker growled you dont get it my man is a lookout and a sentinel hes armed with a highpowered rifle but i guarantee he wont shoot you darlings gaze did not leave croakers face on the other hand hell make damn sure no one else does the sudden crack of the hickory bat against the ball was amplified by the close quarters they were in there were shouts of encouragement someone had hit a long ball like who why dont you ask spaulding gunn the director of your own actf hes the one who ordered the sanction he looked at the expression on croakers face poor bastard you dont believe me do you why should i croaker looking out at the playing field could see ricky running as hard as he could toward first base the ball hed just bunted was bouncing between the catcher and the first baseman right now croaker felt like that carefully placed ball ricocheting between a rock and a hard place who was lying and who was telling the truth okay answer me this croaker said ive seen compelling evidence that theres a highly classified and volatile actf operation under way its blackbudgeted and it involves pouring agents and arms into mexico is this the truth it is croaker took a breath now for the question he did not want to ask i caught a glimpse of what appears to be an agent codenamed sero operating under actf aegis who is sero sero is the name of gunns secondincommand that much is confirmed we dont know his real name yet darling was about to say something more when his cell phone rang like the call of doom he looked at croaker who nodded his permission he listened for a moment said into the phone you know the drill and hung up that was my sentinel he told croaker we have to move now his eyes were very pale gunns people have found us gunn wants you dead on this you can rely darling crouched in the darkness his elbows on his thighs people typically have one of two reactions to confined quarters either they are uncomfortable in them or they affect a studied indifference to them darlings reaction was neither in the way he held himself in this dark cramped space was the certain knowledge that he had served time overseas in southeast asia you learned to embrace close quarters smelling of dampness and urine because they were often the only thing standing between you and being caught by the enemy you also learned to use weapons of silence croaker remembered darlings speech against guns it had been short and tothepoint it had also been correct croaker and darling were in an aluminum air conduit that hung from the ceiling of the basement of the white house a gay club on the north side of lincoln road it was not far from the boneyard the internet sex club gideon and rachel frequented the white house was where darling had taken them when hed got the signal that gunns people were on the way half a dozen of themyoung men in lightweight suits and versace tshirts they could have passed for models except for the guns in quickrelease holsters at the small of their backs croaker knew actf field personnel when he saw them two were gone now diverted by darlings rifletoting boy scout on the top tier of the flamingo park stadium the rest had gotten the scent and like bloodhounds were not to be deterred what the hell is going on croaker said i work for the actf darling cocked his head listening to the rhythm of the industrial silence the metered thump of the massive compressor that controlled the central airconditioning unit and the generator that had come on when darling had cut the main power he said gunn wants you dead because youve contracted to assassinate juan garcia barbacena there was no point in asking how gunn had found out croaker had worked inside the actf long enough to know they could ferret out just about any secret if they put their resources behind the effort but there was another more pressing question he needed to ask he needed confirmation of the intelligence hed found embedded in the floppy disc i want to know if spaulding gunn and the actf is running juan garcia barbacena as an agent in place in latin america why do you think he wants you terminated darling said barbacena is gunns point man south of the border gunn and the man named sero croaker felt his heart hammering in his chest what if i were to tell you that sero is the secret nickname bennie milagross grandfather called him darlings eyes widened is this true croaker nodded christ weve caught a break at last darling broke off abruptly croaker strained his ears nothing croaker shook his head this doesnt sound anything like the actf i was mustered into theres a good reason for that darling said its not with his head cocked like that he had the appearance of a hunting dog he seemed satisfied that they were alone within ten months of spaulding gunns appointment as director he had eviscerated the actf of all key personnel and had installed his own people how did he manage that he had been given the unprecedented clout to cut through all the governmental red tape somebody had an agenda that just couldnt wait and that somebody we subsequently discovered was a group composed of canny oldline senators and some of the top people at the department of commerce who were aggrieved that much of their power had been taken away in the most recent governmental budget shakeup how did dictrib come into being croaker asked darling gestured where did all the former actf people end up we could have become desk jockeys at some other bureau within state or we could have taken early retirement we did neither instead we banded together formed a nucleus called in every favor that was due us and were duly set up in a bureau of our own three years ago the developing capital countries trade relations bureau was a sleepy little bureau inhabited mostly by worldview economists with thick glasses and egg on their ties in the back rooms where gunn cant see or hear we made it into a fullfledged operations bureau just like the actf it was a modest setup to be sure but it was ours we were determined to make it an outpost to keep track of spaulding gunn find out his agenda and throw a very heavy wrench into it darling was listening again this sounds like war croaker said only it cant be because its between two factions of the us government its nuts the people who let you take over dictrib cant know what youre up to theyd never sanction a hot war between bureaus our people are cabinet level darling said they can and they have but why latin america bud its the next economic miracle about to take off like the space shuttle only this time it isnt on the other side of the pacific its right on our doorstep because the key to all of latin america is mexico and the profit potential is nothing short of mind altering darling looked at croaker the situations like this gunns gone into orbit on this even his own people know it but theyre either too greedy or too damn scared of him to reign him in thats where dicktribe comes in we edge in take over gunns game keep it under control install your own people you mean croaker said better ours than gunns bud believe it but first barbacena has to be taken out darling nodded with his priceless southoftheborder contacts hes the key without him gunns plan is dead in the water he paused tense he seemed to be sounding all of their environment at once the name of the game is control he said and in this game theres only one rule he who controls the most reaps all the profits and believe me profits are where its at these days especially for politicians its a whole new world for them out there and they dont like what they see theyre running scared people are turning them off just like they turn off the networks for cable channels its the time of the independents and that makes everybody nervous dyou think the speaker of the house or minority whip like knowing theyre being zapped in midoration not damn likely okay i can see that but what exactly is gunn up to with barbacena darling stiffened now croaker could hear them arrhythmic sounds intermittently beneath the drone of the compressors gunns people searching for him croaker could tell their pursuers were close three armed men three blind mice another sound from behind them caused him to turn his head not blind then theyd sprung their trap and were closing in from both front and back now croaker understood why theyd been making so much noise it was the theory of the hunt they had become beaters driving their prey to the killing ground they must be using heat seekers he whispered into darlings ear who nodded heat seekers used infrared beams to pick up the body heat of a human being even absolute darkness wasnt a deterrent keep very still darling had whispered back theres plenty of metal and concrete to deflect the beams before darling had a chance to stop him croaker slithered farther along the conduit to a large removable grill peering through the latticework croaker could see a vertical ladder bolted to the concrete wall that led down into the basement proper there the darkness was leavened by a series of ancient yellowbulbed emergency lights that had come on when darling had cut the power they spread their weak glow in footwide circles over rough concrete walls blue with mildew no matter what darling thought hed be damned if he was going to be caught in a confined space where he had no room to maneuver he took out the and loaded it with dark stars he pushed aside the metal grate and let himself down through it he grasped the top rung of the ladder and began to descend the place smelled unpleasant and musty and the rungs were gritty with rust and oily dirt accumulated over who knew how many years he was less than halfway down when the rung beneath his left foot gave way he swung out wildly came crashing back against the metal ladder the back of his right hand smashed against a rung and the gun went spinning out of his grasp it landed bounced and skittered into darkness on the rock hard concrete floor below cursing under his breath croaker steadied himself and went on descending more cautiously now behind him he could hear darlings soft breathing he was coming so were the mice good theyd have to figure theyd flushed their prey he reached the floor of the basement and immediately knew hed have no chance of finding the gun in this illlighted maze besides there was no time once croaker had gone hunting for alligators in the back country of the everglades stone tree had given him the drill the alligator he had said is a predator he attacks with speed and if you turn tail and run in a straight line hell catch you for sure in the most primitive part of his brain man is also a predator one of the mice was very close now his powerful legs pumping in long strides taking full advantage of the heat seeker he held in one hand in the darkness he believed it gave him an absolute advantage that belief often made people overconfident and this is what croaker was counting on there was ho way to outrun him so croaker didnt try predators count on their prey turning tail and running so croaker did the one thing this predator wouldnt imagine he held his ground and as the man bore down on him swung his left arm up and out he grabbed the man in midflight wound his arm around the assailants waist and pulled him down sharply in the direction of his own momentum but even as the assailant crashed to the concrete floor he slashed upward with a knife croaker felt the blade slice through the material of his shirt he chopped at the mans wrist and the knife went flying but he had left himself open and the man sent a short vicious chop to his kidneys croaker went down on all fours and the man brought the edge of his hand down sharply between his shoulder blades croaker collapsed all breath driven out of him the man scrambled after his knife just as his hand closed around it darling dropped from the conduit and kicked out the man was very fast and darling managed to connect with his shoulder instead of his throat the man spun around and darling came after him that was a mistake the man deflected darlings punch jammed his fist into darlings stomach darling doubled over gagging and the man slammed a knee into the side of darlings face as darling dropped to the floor croaker drove a stainlesssteel nail into the mans side he gasped tried to use the heel of his hand as a club but croaker grabbed it began to twist it away the man tried to knee him in the groin struck bone instead croaker chopped down very hard with the edge of his hand striking the side of the mans neck he collapsed in a heap croaker heard shouts from the other end of the basement scooping up the heat seeker he ran to where darling was gasping on all fours braced against an iron pillar shit darling said as croaker helped him up ive got to get out on the street more he gingerly touched his cheek the bastard almost broke my jaw come on croaker hefted the heat seeker now we have a chance in a series of storerooms he found everything he needed aluminum foil wire cutters electricians tape an extension cord he took off his jacket and wound sheets of aluminum foil around his chest he whispered to darling as he worked when they demonstrated the heat seekers to us they warned us to be careful around kitchensfoil the microwave if it was on would play havoc with the infrared beams he tucked the last piece of foil into his armpit this ought to be enough to fool them then he gestured youre going to be the bait okay darling nodded they went back out into the basement proper croaker kept track of their pursuers with the heat seeker theyre coming he said if were lucky theyre only reading you when he found an outlet in the wall he went to work on the extension cord with the wire cutters when he was finished he plugged in the cord he directed darling farther down the basement so that the extension was between him and their pursuers then he stretched the cord out until it was taut he taped the other end to the wall against which he crouched it was just above ankle height he could hear the pursuers coming at a run and he took one last glance at the heat seeker to make sure of the trajectory of the source he had just enough time to register the conflicting data when someone ran right into the center section of the extension cord the part from which croaker had stripped away the insulation a welter of sparks shot into the air and he could smell the singe of burning cloth and flesh he saw two figures on the bare concrete floor spasming with the aftermath of the electric current he was just getting up from where he was crouching when he felt the muzzle of a gun press against the back of his head okay smart boy stay right where you are and call your buddy over the muzzle jammed painfully against his skull no wonder the heat seeker had given him confused readings at some point as they had been running this man had separated from the others in a flanking maneuver nice and easy now lets not alarm him okay croaker did as he was told and darling came toward them from the spot where hed been standing sparks still flew and juddered in the darkness throwing a fitful illumination over the scene croaker looking down could see that the lower part of his legs were made visible in the arcing light the man standing to one side of him and slightly behind might be visible too if you knew where to look or what was happening stop right there the man said from right beside croakers ear but darling didnt seem to hear him he kept on coming i saidthe man gripped the back of croakers neck his thumb pressed hard in the carotid as he swung his gun around toward darlingstop right there there was a movement from the shadowsno more than a blur reallyand croaker felt a swift current of air then the man pulled the trigger the flash of light the harsh sound of the report seemed contained and magnified by the concrete walls croaker slammed his elbow into the mans side but he was already falling a knife blade was buried in his throat croaker let him fall darling just a flesh wound ross darling came toward him clutching his right shoulder blood was dribbling between his white fingers he gave croaker a small smile as he kicked the dead man whod been holding croaker at gunpoint no so good with my fists but i still know how to throw the knife barbacenas mission has been to destabilize mexico darling looked like an albino the overhead fluorescent lights drained all color from his face he is doing this quite cleverly you see he saw in the ragtag chiapas dissidents a perfect catspawpeople with a cause who he could indoctrinate and arm a force he could make mighty and manifest themselves at just the right time who he could use to attain his own ends with gunns help and money he has done just that even more importantly he has given them a power base he has brought in professional soldiers to train farmers how to kill he has given them what every dissident the world over dreams of legitimacy darling swung his head abruptly around said in a sharp tone doctor enough already get this done and over with i have important work to do they were in the white house basement but now the power had been restored the lights were on and the area was crawling with dictrib agents including a doctor who was tending to darling the wound has to be properly cleaned to prevent infection the doctor was a darkskinned hispanic with oiled hair and the unflappable manner of a mash surgeon it was clear he was used to plying his trade on the fly dont move he coated a cotton swab with a yellowish liquid when he applied it to the wound darling winced and bit his lip just give me a shot of penicillin or whatever it is and slap the damn bandage on darling said with watering eyes he turned back to croaker at this meeting gunn himself will give barbacena his final orders if barbacena is allowed to return to chiapas he will sell the dissidents arms which gunn is providingadvanced weaponry from our own military arsenals this superior firepower along with key intelligence will allow the dissidents to gain complete control of the south of mexico the mexican government will be in complete disarray in a matter of hours they will have lost control of the reins of power the bolsathe mexican stock marketwill plunge it will be like on wall street we are so closely tied to mexico that our own equity and bond markets will plunge in sympathy in desperation the mexican government will plead with washington for help and ironically wall street will be clamoring for exactly the same thing intervention of a semipermanent sort young men in shirtsleeves and holstered mm brownings came and went wordlessly cleaning up the remains of the human carnage the smell of industrialstrength cleaners and disinfectants clogged the recycled air when they were finished croaker was certain there would be no trace of this mortal encounter then and only then gunn and his people in the government will step in darling went on and with barbacenas help dismantle the dissidents piece by piece once and for all in their wake theyll leave in place a new government made up of their handpicked people a puppet government eternally in debt to certain elements in washington then these elements will be able to manipulate both the manufacturing and the financial markets in mexico and you know the saying as mexico goes so goes south america but how are they going to find these people so quickly croaker asked darling smiled as he rubbed the white patch of gauze the doctor had taped over the wound spaulding gunn has already recruited them indoctrinated them and set them in place in positions of business prominence in mexico city theyre like sleepers awaiting their call to action croaker thought for a moment so if during the course of this rendezvous with gunn barbacena was to be terminated you would feel what id kiss your goddamned feet darling nodded thats right if our presence inside justice has proved anything its this spaulding gunn is a dangerous madman the power hes been given has warped him his ambitions override the specific mandate hes been given hes planning to take ultimate control over the economic pipeline hes helped establish with latin america darling waved the doctor away ill be brutally honest croaker terminating barbacena is the only answer its a move wed dearly love to make but for us its too radical even if we succeeded in terminating him even if we were as careful as we could be wed leave a trail behind that someone like gunn is expert enough to ferret out he got up and they walked through the labyrinthine basement i want to be perfectly candid with you darling said heres whats bothering me more than anything i need a way to terminate barbacena he snapped his fingers and just like that you appear his pale gaze bored hard into croakers eyes how is that do you think the same thought has occurred to me croaker said but i was approached by a man named marcellus rojas diego majeur majeur majeur darling rolled the name around hes a hotshot lawyer for some of the elite south american drug lords right heres the deal juan garcia barbacena had a wife darling nodded theresa marquesa she found out he was cheating on her she threatened him and he killed her he beat her unconscious and then strangled her with an electrical cord because he is protected hell never be charged this is why i was hired to terminate barbacena it has nothing to do with you or gunn or your dirty little war its strictly personal darling considered this he nodded it makes sense ive read the file on her death the police found evidence of a breakinforced entry money and jewelry stolen it was ruled an unsolved homicide and now its a closed case in fact from what i could see only a token investigation was ever done for instance where were the bodyguards when theresa was attacked i thought it curious that barbacena himself never objected his brow furrowed theres still the matter of how you came into possession of classified dicktribe codes the bonitas christ if the bonitas are involved darling turned signaled to an agent who hurried over with a notebook computer darling snatched it from him and crouched down he turned it on and his finger spun the trackball mouse this is a classified actf file were looking at darling said nothing was sacrosanct these days croaker thought as he scanned the information on the screen not even the most topsecret files but then he knew firsthand what the government could compile on an average citizen just about everything down to his childrens preferences in toys and videos theres a pattern he said you bet theres a pattern darling leaned forward punched the page down key croaker was looking at what the actf called a serial unsub a file put together over time with enough similar or identical bits and pieces of murder mos to designate the case serial murders suspect unknown you see this one was relatively easy to compile darling said all the victims were decapitated and none of the bodies were ever found croaker ran his gaze down the list this file is four years old darling nodded the first decapitated head was discovered out side tallahassee coroner indicated in his report that the murderer knew his business no cutting and hacking no jagged wounds the neck was severed neatly and completely with a scalpel croaker had an immediate flash of heitor bonita in the gaping black doorway of the panel truck wielding a scalpel with only a scalpel he asked that was the coroners judgment there were no metal tooth marks croaker looked up from the screen so the murderer didnt use a saw he severed the spinal column with just the scalpel that would take a lot of strength it would take a goddamn bull croaker wanted more than anything to take a breath of fresh air to see the blue sky and feel the sun burning his skin but he was in the wrong place for that it would be nice one day to feel clean again but he wondered whether he ever would the bonitas are responsible for all these murders arent they we think so even though theres no proof darling used the trackball and the screen changed take a look at this croaker scanned another confidential actf file it detailed a burgeoning black market for human organs in the southeast theres something this file doesnt show croaker said you have very little time to get an organ from one body to another except for kidneys organs cant be kept outside a human body for long antigen typing typically takes six to eight hours how did these people know which bodies to send to which recipients we have no idea darling said it in a voice that led croaker to believe he had other more pressing questions to answer weve been trying to figure out why gunn has these files hes tracking the bonitas hes keeping a close eye on the organ harvesting ring but hes not taking any action against it evil soul this gunn croaker said clearly theres a connection between him and the bonitas you bet darling shut down the computer i see they hacked into our system which considering our safeguards is alarming enough but just what the hell were they up to slipping you dicktribe codes croaker sighed i think it was accidental the bonitas and bennie milagros have a history together and its not a particularly pleasant one bennie pretended to be my friend he didnt tell me he was working for gunn hes involved in your little war up to his eyebrows thats the material they wanted me to see the dictrib codes just happened to be embedded at the tail end of the file the bonitas probably didnt even know they were there lets hope youre right in the meantime im changing all the computer security codes darling left the computer on the concrete floor while he walked croaker to the rear stairway that lead up to an alley behind lincoln road i wish i could give you more tangible help like backup or tactical support but it just isnt possible so far as ive involved myself with your safety ive already put my bureau at risk dont worry croaker said i appreciate the help you have given me darling extended his hand and croaker took it one more bit of advice stay as far away from the bonitas as you can theyre pure poison and as youve seen theyre being protected by gunn those eyes that seemed witness to all mans foibles and follies now stared deep into croakers soul get to juan garcia barbacena for the good of everyone do what needs to be done and then for gods sake get clear croaker listened to loves album forever changes as he sped north to palm beach on i somehow the bands rococo psychedelia seemed appropriate to the occasion american interests inside latin america it was business as usual he thought we were going south of the border for the same reason we always stick our noses into foreign countries to protect the interests of a very privileged few with the latin economies exploding we sure as hell wouldnt want insurgents or worse socialistleaning governments in power we marched into kuwait for the oil lobby which lobby was backing gunn the autos maybe its the exporters it made sense mexico is our second largest export market behind canada we couldnt afford to let that level of profit be compromised by the rabblerousers but that kind of work is plenty dirty its got to be kept behind locked doors thoughts of secrets led him inevitably to antonio and heitor theyre pure poison ross darling had said and as youve seen theyre being protected by gunn of course they were protected according to the files they were running an organ harvesting operation with actf connivance is that how gunn had amassed his enormous power in so short a time was it leveraged off the dead bodies of people murdered by the bonitas how many elderly senators congressmen cabinet members would be lined up for new parts assured they could get any organ their aging bodies needed croaker didnt care to speculate on numbers when it came to survival human beings were the cleverest of species stone tree had told him that he said it was because they were so damned good at rationalizing even the most evil of men fervently believed they were acting out of right and good except maybe the bonitas croaker had spent enough time around antonio to understand that there was a difference in these twins they were something other there was a terrible pale fire in their souls that was inextinguishable it would be easy to mistake that fire for heta i they were people who knew good from evil they had simply chosen evil he exited the highway and went east on okeechobee boulevard to olive which was us there he went north what was bothering him the most was rachel it was just too coincidental her getting ill at just the time barbacena was coming into miami the moment gideon had told him the drugs she and rachel had taken were clean hed become convinced that rachels collapse and condition had somehow been engineered but how and by whom he had one suspect in mind but he needed some kind of proof he pulled into the parking lot of the royal poinciana hospital the true hell of his situation was now staring him in the face even if his suspicions about rachel being set up proved true there was nothing he could do about it she was still dying without the kidney being offered by majeurs client she wouldnt last the week he was sinking deeper and deeper into a wideranging conspiracy but his path was set kill juan garcia barbacena and rachel would live there were no alternatives the fact that majeur and now darling had given him any number of reasons to detest barbacena did not help much killing someone in defense of your own life was one thing coldly and calculatingly planning a murder from afar was quite another croaker had met a good number of paid assassins and mercenaries in his time one thing they all shared that croaker did not was they had hearts of stone croaker got out of the tbird and wanted to run across the con crete it was not yet eleven and the day was already swelteringly hot the hospital was as cool and hushed as the mechanism of a swiss clock there was something about hospitals that made you tired the moment you walked in maybe they fed gaseous tranquilizers into the recycled air to keep everyone calm in ccd croaker tiptoed into rachels cubical she looked white as milk and so thin she might have floated away if not for the blanket and sheets blue veins pulsed slowly beneath skin turned thin and waxy the digital readouts told him she still had a fever they hadnt yet beaten the sepsis infection as he kissed her warm forehead he whispered i found gideon shell be here soon honey then he took her limp hand in his and squeezed hold on rachie youve come this far just hold on a little longer matty returning from the bathroom saw him and flew into his arms lew where have you been where did you sleep last night she had been weeping he saw the sight of him made her begin all over again hush he stroked the side of her face by tomorrow shell have a new kidney oh lew he gently disengaged himself from her arms matty do you have that extra key to your apartment she nodded rummaging through her handbag as she handed it to him she said you found gideon didnt you whats he like not at all what i expected id like to see him she drew out a kleenex and wiped beneath her eyes in a way i feel i know him hes a kind of link now to her croaker led her to a chair and made her sit down have you seen dr stansky he did not want to continue talking about gideon his sister already had enough on her mind without having to deal with rachels sexual orientation matty shook her head she looked very tired usually he comes in late in the day do you want me to give him a message when i see him no in fact dont even mention i asked he leaned down and kissed her cheek it was as cool as rachels was warm are you okay matty im fine you dont look it when was the last time you ate she gave him a wan smile im not hungry force yourself honey this will be over soon everything will be all right i promise you in the meantime youre no good to rachie in this state she forced a wider smile and nodded he left her there at her vigil there was nothing more he could say but he went down to the commissary and bought some food which he asked a floor nurse to give her he found jenny marsh in her drug abuse study laboratory down the hall from ccd she looked up from her position bent over a microscope beyond two young assistants glanced at him then went back to their work at the bank of centrifuges she put down the pen with which shed been jotting notes on a yellow lined pad she smiled it was a cool smile detached almost impersonal it was not the smile he wanted i hope you can catch up on your sleep this afternoon he said sometime after midnight the kidney will be released excellent she nodded still allbusiness id already planned on staying right here there are a couple of cots in the next room ill call you the moment i get word its on its way you can watch the operation if you wish that may not be possible who knows where hed be maybe floating face down in shallow water he lowered his voice as he came closer theres something else i learned it might be significant the drugs rachel was taking the night of her collapse were pure surprise registered on jenny marshs face that cant be right its highly unlikely shed have gone into coma from the amounts she was taking unless the stuff had been cut with something bad i thought that too but i spoke to the person she was with that night this person took the same drugsthe whole cocktailacid joints coke and she was fine on the other hand she presumably has two kidneys unlike rachel wouldnt matter jenny was frowning theres something odd here but ill be damned if i know what it is jenny i saw rachel a few minutes ago why isnt the infection clearing up ive been wondering about that myself she tapped a finger on the lab counter its probable that in her weakened condition shes having a difficult time fighting off an infection a healthy person would get rid of in hours he was watching her expression carefully you dont seem convinced she looked up into his face and he could clearly see the weariness and worry there to tell you the truth im not she indicated the slide she had been viewing when hed come in ive got nothing tangible to go on in fact from a strictly medical point of view it would be surprising if she had thrown the infection off easily and yet the fact that shes made no progress at all is bugging the hell out of me its as if every time we take one step forward rachel takes two steps back he waited in vain for her to finish her thought when he saw that she wasnt going to he said what about the transplant can you do it if the fever isnt down that wouldnt be advisable jenny said croaker didnt like the sound of that youve got to get the infection under control before i give you the kidney she nodded were doing our best lew believe me i know you are he put a hand briefly over hers and squeezed she pulled her hand gently but firmly away one of the assistants extracted a test tube from the centrifuge held it up to the light she said something to the other assistant who nodded they went into the adjacent room jenny whats the matter he asked youre acting like last night never happened when i was in high schoolbefore i hit all those college courses that turned my desire to be a doctor into an obsessioni was a different person all i thought about then was boys what sweater what skirt to wear to show off what i had it was a carefree time of life he looked down at her sounds good to me she nodded it was lovely but ive got too many responsibilities now to let my eyes go out of focus she got up and went over to the windows he stood a little apart from her from this position he could see a pulse beating in the hollow of her throat the truth is ive missed you already this is a very bad sign he cocked his head bad in what way she turned to face him because when i woke up this morning the first thing that entered my mind was what am i going to wear today i want to look good for lew he smiled that doesnt sound so dire it does to me ive built my whole world to work along certain lines nowwith youits being blown to pieces he drew her into his arms be strong dr marsh let your eyes go out of focus an hour a day he looked into her green eyes surely you can spare me that much out of your hectic life oh lew her lips opened against his and he felt the heat coming off her her body was trembling with repressed desire he stroked her back and her body began to melt against his she tore herself away at the sound of her returning assistants he wondered if her heart was pounding as hard as his was but one look in her eyes told him it must be with an effort she got her breathing back to normal she set limits for her behavior and kept to them he liked that in her listen do me a favor if stansky makes rounds early today make up some excuse but keep him away from rachel why he squeezed her hand im not sure yet im working on a theory i know how you doctors like to band together so i dont want to go around accusing people without backup but if you suspect stanskys some kind of threat to her my god ive got to know that believe me when i have something ill call you i have your beeper number okay for a moment she held on to his hand her eyes searched his face as if she was trying to memorize every line and feature of it i was wrong before its a good feeling to miss you and then have you walk into my lab but for an instant her eyes clouded over and he thought she was going to cry her voice was a hoarse whisper come back lew promise me he smiled at her i promise but a dark and evil presentiment gripped his heart he knew she was thinking of the vision the soulcatcher had shown her of him lying facedown in shallow water the scene of his death the flamingo tbird was waiting patiently for him in the hospital parking lot he unlocked the car turned on the ignition it was as hot as hades in there and he stood outside for a time with the door open and the air conditioner going full blast then he got in and drove it slowly over to mattys place he luxuriated in the feel of the heavy engine the solid bodywork the smell of the lovingly conditioned leather seats for an instant time rolled back to when he was eighteen when all he could think of was girls and cars maybe in that order maybe not depending on his mood could be that was as close as he had come to being carefree but unlike jenny marsh hed grown up in hells kitchen where nothing worth having came without a serious price every day created another battleground another fight over territory bragging rights a girl and always there was some hothead eager to bounce your brains off the sidewalk as he pulled into the harbour pointe visitors parking lot he wondered what it would be like being a part of jennys carefree highschool days he found he couldnt imagine it even though he had the key the concierge stopped him consulting a list owners compiled with the names of people who had keys matty hoping he would stay with her had put his name on the list the night hed slept over upstairs he went directly into rachels room everything was the same as the last time he was here he went to the dresser opened the bottom drawer there was the large sachet carefully he untied the ribbon that held the cloth together and pulled a small diary from the fragrant crumbles of dried flowers and spiced herbs just as gideon had told him he sat on rachels bed and ran his hand over the surface it was dark blue paperboard with tan corners of simulated leather he opened it and with a heavily beating heart began to read the first entry was dated january of this year croaker quickly riffled through the pages rather than making an entry for every day rachel had written only about key events during the year obviously she was not a girl to scribble woke up had a fight with mom went to school met gideon got stoned in fact as he began to read in earnest he saw this was less a diary than the streamofconsciousness inner workings of his nieces mind it was not an easy read there are places in the human soul so intimate to bare them is shocking in them dwell deformed things strange wishes bizarre desires obsessions evenall the demons that drive us but should never see the light of day rachel had felt a need to give these shadows life and now croaker was poring over them like a shaman studying the thrown bones of a sacred animal halfway through he set aside the diary and looked up he saw rachel standing on the far side of the bedroom she was looking at him just as if she were really there she didnt look like the dying girl he had just left in the hospital instead she appeared very much like the girl in the prom dress photosolemn but healthy this illusion opened its mouth and spoke to him in the words he had just read today something snapped when mom told me donald was dead i could hear a sound like a clap of thunder mom was watching my face real hard to see what id do so i did nothing just sat there and stared at my corn flakes and then i thought about how cruel donald and i had been to each other for two years pretending it was over when obviously it wasnt that thought defeated me i cant explain it but i had this weird urge to take a carving knife and slit my wrists to the bone i might have done it too if i didnt think of how sad it would make gideon i spent about ten minutes imagining her face imagining my blood all over the floor her face my blood i just couldnt do that to her but i wanted to i could feel the ache like a magnetic pull i want to rush headfirst into that california mountainside i wanted so much to join him what was i going to do without him i cant imagine the thing is donald loved me i know he did in fact im sure now he loved me more than he ever loved mom i hate him for that for other things too but none of that stops me from loving him just the opposite really its as if many of the things he did bound us closer together its odd mom came to hate him because of his cruelty she never got it i think thats what enslaved me to him thats the right word too enslavement id do anything he asked of me anything and that was the secretthat was the bond between us he could have asked me to plunge a knife into my breast and i would have done it without a second thought not that he would have though he was too busy using his penis like a weapon those sessions hurt me but the pain was so sweet i would come with tears in my eyes with my body shaking sometimes there was blood just a little bit a drop a crimson eye this too would bind us like an oath on our hands and knees wed wipe it up together and afterwards he was so tender when he told me hed started training me when i was so young i immediately thought of the story of o which he gave me to read when i was ten i read it over and over until i had memorized whole passages of it id recite it during some of our sessions and that seemed to turn him on like nothing else at first i thought it was the words because sometimes wed act out the scene i was reciting but then i came to understand he loved the fact id learned his lesson so completely when he asked me if i thought what we were doing was wrong i remember looking into his face and saw something id never before seen there fear it was then i understood that he was as much enslaved as i was we both existed here apart from the world it seemed to me that the sessions were the only time we were alive outside this circle of secrets we were just letting hours pass going through the motions of living but it wasnt living at all the longing for each other the denials then after all that holding back the rush of joyous pain and that single crimson drop of bloodthat was living croaker took a deep breath and the vision of rachel vanished he put a hand to his forehead found that he was sweating he had spent most of his adult life picking through the twisted labyrinth of the criminal psyche you tried to enure yourself to find ways to detach yourself so you wouldnt be swept under by the garbage but it wasnt possible because you were sticking your nose into a place that was essentially the only true sanctuary left over the years croaker had learned not to be shocked by these revelations but this was different rachel was no criminal no psychopath she was just a girl in desperate need of help and she was his niece this terrible peek into her soul chilled him to the bone if it was true that you never really knew what people were thinking it was also true that most times you didnt want to find out this was why homicide cops burned out the better they were the faster the burn because there was only so much close exposure to psychosis you could take then it was time to close your eyes and turn away from a sun that burned too bright and had come too close he wiped his face clean of sweat took up the diary again and read the second half at length his vision of rachel as she had been reappeared in the bedroom this time she was sitting crosslegged in the center of the floor it must have been fate his vision of her said when ronald put his hand on my naked breast during a physical exam my nipple rose against his palm and he twisted it until tears came to my eyes then i knew and i was his i asked him after that first session how he knew he said he could see it in my eyes i asked him what he saw and he told me you were naked and when you looked at me i saw there was no barrier between us i wonder if thats the definition of submission then he asked me the question ill always remember ive seen you naked before many times but there was always the wall the defense of the inner castle what changed today of course i knew it was donalds death thats whats changed me and then i saw how i could go on being with gideon is nice i can even say i love her but for me love isnt enough theres this thing inside me for which i have no name its the thing donald tapped into its the same thing that ronald saw in my eyes i need it i have to have it now i know i can go on the sessions will continue i will survive so the sessionsas rachel called the sm sexual trystscontinued with dr ronald stansky standing in for her father donald duke it was a sick story getting sicker all the time how damaged must rachel be in order to cling to this way of life so severely damaged that she was misunderstood by everyone there was something about that damage that set her apartmade her unknowable even to gideon croaker wanted to gather her up in his arms and protect her his heart broke for rachel who craved only one thing love if only she knew it if she survived this trial hed have to see she began a whole new life and that meant telling matty everything but not now not yet he was so caught up in these thoughts that he almost missed it but something had caught in the net of his memory and he flipped back to the nexttolast page it was dated three days before rachels collapse this last session was strange she said i mean all sessions are strange donald once told me thats where their power lies in opening yourself up to all the dark forces inside yourself surrendering to them but this was stranger than most i guess it was because we werent alone i mean often we werent alone in the beginning during the medical tests of course ronalds nurse would be bustling around to draw blood or set the xray machine in place or take the specimen cup from me i guess he had to do these tests to make it okay for me to be at the clinic so often but after the tests the nurse would leave and ronald and i would be alone to begin our journey it was odd but exciting doing it in the examination roomall that clinical stuff and here we were banging away i think thats why ronald never took me to a motel or anywhere else also in a motel room that doctorpatient thing wouldnt be there this time there was someone with him a man tall and lean and dark he looked like a shadow ronald asked if i would mind the man wanted to watch he wouldnt touch me wouldnt say a word just watch somehow i liked that it reminded me of how i sometimes felt with donald i wanted mom to see us together even though i knew it would hurt her terribly but it was the only way she would ever get to know me and i knew she never would so i said okay i let the man watch he did it like hed done it before like he knew what it meant to watch not just seeing things but observing i knew everything ronald and i did meant something to him and that made our pleasure so much more intense afterward when ronald was cleaning up the man came over to me we looked at each other for such a long time it felt as if my lungs would burst i didnt know he said it was such a mysterious thing to say a little thrill went through me and he had this voice not much more than a hoarse whisper i wanted to ask him what he meant but i thought id look like an idiot for some reason i knew this was someone i didnt want to embarrass myself with i didnt know anything about you he said i was so startled i felt my heart leap just as if it was a football kicked between the goalposts blood rushed in my temples and i couldnt say a thing later when he and ronald sat talking i drifted into the other room they didnt notice when talk gets serious men have no use for girls or women his suit jacket was hanging on this oldfashioned wood coat rack ronald has at the clinic i was drawn to the jacket as if it was magnetized for a long time i didnt do anything i was content to let it brush against my cheek it smelled strongly of him and i liked that then i slipped my hand inside and found his wallet it was one of those europeanstyle wallets like donald used to carryslim and so long you cant stuff it into your back pocket its a rich mans wallet because you have to put it in the inside pocket of a suit jacket it was made out of crocodile skin dyed a blue so dark it looked black i loved that color i opened it up not knowing why and then i saw his name embossed in gold trey merli could anyone really have that name if you drop the ytre merit means three blackbirds in italian i read it over and over again until it took on a kind of magical quality trey merli there the entry seemed to end however in the two blank lines left before the end of the page rachel had scribbled something hastily in pencil it was an address trey merlis croaker looked up from rachels diary the blood singing in his veins according to vonda shepherd trey merli owned gold coast exotic auto rentals in margate gold coast was the place majeur had rented the grapecolored lincoln now it turned out that merli knew dr ronald stansky what could that mean croaker didnt yet know but it was clear that the evil engine in margate that he had glimpsed was about to deliver up its black and ugly secrets the address rachel had scribbled in her diary was on hibiscus island the island was out in the middle of biscayne bay you got there by crossing the bay on the macarthur causeway taking the fountain street turnoff onto palm island then continuing onto hibiscus the island was small no more than ten blocks long and just two blocks wide but it was home to large stucco houses each with their own boat mooring croaker eased the tbird into the curb in front of a white house in the middle of the block it looked similar to its neighbors except for the dark blue awnings and the matching trim he got out the brutal heat felt good on all his aches and pains he went up the driveway paving and rang the doorbell there was no response so he walked around the side of the house past orange bougainvillea and pink hibiscus in the back was the florida room and a screenedin pool area eight white chaise lounges with blue textilene cushions were arranged in two rows so perfectly one would think there was a photo shoot going on the area however was deserted the pool filters burbled like a just fed infant a palm trees fronds brushed against the top of the screen on a cart sat a pile of freshly laundered towels in candycolored stripes below were three different kinds of sunscreens beyond the screenedin pool was the bulkheaded dock there was no boat in the slip but when croaker came around the back he saw that the screen door was not entirely shut he opened it and stepped inside through the windows straight ahead he could see a large living room to the right were the windows of the master suite to the left the windows of the twobedroom guest wing the only movement he saw was of a green plastic alligator float drifting in the pool it eyed him incuriously as he crossed the patio the slider to the living room was unlocked and he stepped into the airconditioned interior he was met by a sea of beige and offwhite furniture it was expensive spotless and uncreased five placesettings were arrayed on the travertine marble dining room table around a high spray of fresh flowers but there was no smell of food neither was there a hint of perfume or cigarette smoke in the kitchen croaker went through the pantry and cabinet drawers all were well stocked with food gadgets and utensils he left the refrigerator until last ever since sonias death that commonplace utility item had taken on an eerie aura he could never again open a refrigerator door without thinking of her head staring at him from inside with his grip tight on the handle he thought what if trey merlis head is in there then his teeth gritted he jerked the door open inside were the normal contents of a normal refrigerator nothing more he waited a moment for his accelerated pulse to slow a bit the door shut with a small sigh more beige and offwhite in the luxurious master suite a kingsize bed an antique french provincial armoire that had been stripped and bleached a wall mirror framed in gilt croaker looked through the armoire without finding anything of interest beside the fact that trey merli had good taste in clothes and a good deal of money his fashion colors ran to dark blue suits and white shirts something croaker could have guessed from the exterior of the house at the foot of the bed was a large sandcolored lacquer box approximately thirty inches deep and almost as long as the width of the bed beside one night table was a remote croaker picked this up and pressed the open button the box at the foot of the bed opened soundlessly and equipment rose out of its depths there was a twentyfour inch tv a vcr a laserdisc player and a welter of software croaker counted more than a dozen videotapes and about ten laser discs in slip cases like those oldfashioned lp records used to come in on the bed was a neat stack of three white dress shirts they were freshly laundered folded around cardboard sheets held in place by paper ribbons taped to the opened sheet of brown paper on which they lay was taped the cleaners pink copy of the receipt the shirts were the same style and brand that were inside the armoire but now croaker could see something odd it wasnt about the shirts but about the cardboard around which they were folded they looked doubled over he held on to the top shirt and using his biomechanical fingers slid the cardboard out only to discover a manila folder as he looked at it he felt his heart give a lurch the name typed on the tab was sonia villalobos he opened the file it was a record of sonias medical history as recorded by dr ronald stansky he saw with a glance to the top of the page that this file came from stanskys clinic in margate not from his private practice office in west palm beach sonia was stanskys patient quickly he withdrew the second file looked at the name typed on the tab to his horror he saw that it was vonda shepherds file he flipped it open she was stanskys patient as well even if he believed in coincidenceswhich he didnthed never buy this as one he saw many of the same tests being performed in the same order maybe that was medical protocol maybe not but they all ended with one specific test that made his blood run cold he drew out the third file his mind refused to register the name on it rachel duke his right hand shook as he leafed through the file with an increasing sense of alarm his mind began to spin in a certain direction that quite frankly scared the hell out of him if he was correct he folded down the brown paper wrapping took a look at the name of the cleaners on the receipt jiffy tyme dry cleaners it read the address was on biscayne boulevard why did that sound familiar croaker froze hed heard somethinga small sound coming from the living room he silently moved to another spot in the bedroom one that had a better view of the open doorway into the hall the hall was empty as far as the first turn beyond that he was bund he went out of the bedroom and down the hall just before the turn he paused i cant see you a voice said but i can see your shadow the voice sounded very familiar croaker went slowly and deliberately into the living room the slim ambereyed man was sitting crosslegged in an overstuffed offwhite chair i see were fated to keep running into one another antonio he said and at the oddest moments his arms rested lightly on the upholstered chair and may i inquire as to your purpose here croaker watched him with fixed intent you mean you dont know i want to hear it from your mouth his amber gaze flicked from the windows to the paintings on the walls to the perfectly set dinner table before fixing croaker ўque hermosa tu boca how beautiful is your mouth you never answered my question croaker said the narrow handsome head never moved which question about rosa you told me you loved her antonio but you couldnt have loved her you killed her you lopped off her head as if she were an animal for a long time the ambereyed man said nothing but there was something building inside him it was like the pressure drop your ears registered in the quiet just before the onset of a terrible thunderstorm no he said quite suddenly i killed rosa he rose unfolding from the chair and came slowly and casually toward croaker this is how you recognize a man stone tree had once told croaker he can change his name he can change his id he can even change his face but his gait will always give him away just as fingerprints can identify a man out of a million similar men so can a mans gait that never changes even if he breaks a bone his body adapts and the peculiarities of the old gait reemerge this wasnt antonio it was heitor croaker knew antonios rolling liquid gait this mans was altogether different it was angular full of small impatient motions i wondered what my brother was up to heitor said telling tales out of school is not his style is it no this close croaker could smell his animal scent this man held no respect for the restraints of civilization and the death of rosa milagros is the tale that should be told least of all he spoke quietly slowly as if he were on valium it disturbs me greatly that he thinks of rosa still he loved her he said to you he told me he was damned croaker said with some effort now i think youre both damned he turned and headed across the living room toward the slider through the glass he could see sunlight spin off the pool he could just see the head of the plastic alligator floating without a care in the world good thing it could not know that with each moment sunlight was degrading its skin all too soon it would begin losing air and then it would be tossed in the garbage croaker felt heitors presence just behind him good he did not want heitor anywhere near the master suite once i dreamt i was damned heitor said this as if he and croaker were in the middle of a conversation croaker stopped in front of the slider in its glass he could see heitors reflection as he spoke in this dream i trod upon the flaming heads of the damned as i neared them they bent their heads presenting their necks so that a flat path appeared for me at the end of the path was the devil heitor crossed his arms over his chest how would you imagine him seor as a man in a red suit with horns a tail and a pitchfork madre de mentiras no the devil was as my mother had described him to me when i was little he had a sharks head and the body of a beautiful naked woman he smiled my mother warned me to beware the devil because he is ugly no seor because he is beautiful it is this beauty that makes him powerful croaker felt the edge to this man what was beneath his almost unnatural calm what happened in this dream when you met the devil i ate him heitors amber eyes twinkled with delight without a moments hesitation seor i took out my scalpel and carved his flesh into bitesize chunks i thought it would stink of death and putrefaction but all i tasted was roses he pursed his lips it was raw just like my mother taught me to eat my meat she said all the power in a dead thing vanishes with heat keep it cool keep it raw muy bueno heitor timed the last word to his action he spun croaker around the heel of his hand was jammed just beneath croakers chin two fingers of heitors other hand pressed against his temple it was just what antonio had done with the gunman to subdue him it was heta i croaker could do nothing more than slip his right hand in his pocket now he felt a chill invading him it was as if he were encased in a block of ice he tried to move but he couldnt the two fingers held him immobile while heitors amber gaze bore into him heitors face hovered in front of croakers who are you to hear antonios confessions you are a messenger nothing more and when your message is delivered he drew back and laughed ill keep you guessing as to what happens then abruptly his face darkened again but my brother perhaps he has illusions perhaps he sees you as more than a messenger i should kill you now then the message will never be delivered there was a riddle here that needed solving croaker knew but in his current state he couldnt think clearly ill do it myself heitor spat this out thats what ive wanted all along i am not one to stand by like a potbellied man in middle age and watch others hunt croaker had spent the last several moments focusing his energies on getting the fingers of his right hand to move one by one they closed around the spiritstone he felt the familiar warmth a tingling radiating out that was like the heat of a sun and as that heat spread the paralysis dissipated a canny look suffused heitors face perhaps my brother wants to tell you your fate this is not allowed in heta i perhaps though he wishes you to know how you will be betrayed by those closest to you we have seen these things we are privy to many many secrets of the human heart and seor let me tell you they are all dark croaker squeezed the spiritstone harder antonio says that we know too much that it is unnatural he says knowing these secrets that should not be known has made us what we are i say so fucking what madre de mentiras life is one big game to us play it or die lose and die win and survive to play another day these are our only laws and now seor you exist under those laws comprende sure heitor i comprende just fine he pressed his right palm with the spiritstone in it against heitors flat muscleridged stomach heitors amber eyes opened wide his lips opened but no sound emerged with a sweep of his left arm croaker broke the other mans hold he chopped down hard on heitors clavicle thrust his sinking body away from him and pulled on the slider handle that was a mistake heitor slammed into his waist and the two of them hit the glass slider with such force that it shattered and they hurtled through out onto the patio paving rolling over and over they went over the concrete coping into the pool croaker went under the water was shallow pale as air he had a quick flash of jennys vision of him floating facedown in shallow water was he approaching the moment of his death he saw the underbelly of the plastic alligator pushed it out of the way as he broke the surface heitor pulled him back under shook him like a disobedient dog until croaker was overcome by vertigo in desperation croaker slammed the heel of his biomechanical hand underneath heitors jaw he broke free and pushed upward gasping for air maricone where did you get that spiritstone heitor was smart i want it with his free hand he produced the scalpel light spun off the wickedlooking stainlesssteel blade no single stone should have stopped me like that croaker recalled his recent conversation with ross darling when they were looking at the unsub file so the murderer didnt use a saw croaker had said he severed the spinal column with just the scalpel that would take a lot of strength it would take a goddamn bull darling had said he was so right the blade swept in a shallow arc it doesnt belong to you give it to me or ill cut your other hand off the blade hovered poised one quick flick of the wrist is all it will take the dark stones know croaker said calculating each word you cant have it it belonged to humait croaker had that single moment of shock in which to act he slammed his forehead into the bridge of heitors nose blood gushed and heitor reared back in convulsive reaction he made tiny gasping sounds like fish flopping out of water croaker rolled away and scrambled up heitor reached out for him blindly and croaker drove a wellplaced kick into his rib cage heitor grunted and his face went under croaker put the plastic alligator between him and heitor as he swam toward the edge of the pool he turned back in time to see heitor swimming toward him underwater in quick powerful strokes heitor ignored his swollen nose which streamed blood behind him in lovely patterns he brandished the scalpel he appeared to be grinning as he slashed out with the blade croaker grabbed the alligator jammed it down with a loud hiss the point of the scalpel punctured the plastic and the alligator deflated heitor rose to the surface water pink with his blood sluiced off him escuchame seor now you have given me what i crave this is the kind of hunt i can savor does it hurt heitor the broken nose heitor spat blood into the pool we worship pain seor we welcome it it is the validation of the hunt he raised the scalpel balancing it in his palm when we feel pain we know we are alive he waded through the water do you think you can stop me from taking your hand croaker held the spiritstone in front of him finish it heitor now do it if you can inches away heitor paused he stared into croakers eyes his right hand came up weaving the scalpel back and forth in a lazy pattern croaker moved the spiritstone and heitor retreated a pace an expression of pure hatred turned his handsome face ugly ill remember he whispered as he backed away through the water not now not yet but soon it was almost the lilting croon of a lullaby he slipped silently to the gunite steps quickly crossed the screenedin patio and was gone croaker let out a long pentup breath he collapsed back into the water he was sick to his stomach from the excess adrenaline and his throat was dry he could see heitors blood drifting through the pool in strands that parted and thinned to a light stain with a groan he pulled himself out of the pool and lay on his back on the patio tiles his head fell against the coping and he closed his eyes each encounter with the bonitas seemed to take more and more out of him what would happen the next time they met he didnt want to think about that now so he thought about jenny at length he took a couple of large beach towels and went back to the tbird after spreading the towels over the seat he got in his shoes squooshed he took out his cell phone and dialed jennys number he prayed that she wasnt in surgery hello he let out an audible sigh when he heard her voice jenny its lew look i dont have a lot of time so dont ask questions but ive got some interesting evidence regarding the stansky situation tell me i saw a copy of his medical file on rachel how did you doesnt matter the point is he knew she had one kidney he xrayed her in september of last year and made a notation of it and jenny hes also the doctor of record for two murder victims who i suspect were used for organ harvesting he could hear jennys sharply indrawn breath but that alone isnt enough i know but get this stansky screened both of them for human lymphocitic antigens these were healthy young women nobody does antigen typing unless unless theres a need to match up their organs with a compatible host jenny finished in a hushed voice you see the logic of it dont you he asked imagine yourself running an organ harvesting business whats your main problem getting healthy bodies suppose thats already been taken care of he could almost hear her shudder then time youd have to get the antigen typing down asap so you know which patient is compatible with which organ right what if you had that information before the victim was killed oh lew tell me this isnt whats happening here im very much afraid it is our friend dr stansky is hipdeep in an organ harvesting operation hes the scout he matches his patients up with the harvesters needs as in everything logical its as neat as a pin there was a pause on the line he could hear her rapid breathing lew did stansky do hla testing on rachel al a bl he recited all eight readings from memory oh god thats rachels hla profile she said why would stansky have done the test he couldnt have known rachel would be in need of a kidney when he saw her thats the whole point croaker thought jenny listen to me i want you to move rachel is she too sick for that no but a good hospitalthe best jackson memorial in miami im affiliated okay do it now but jenny dont tell stansky where shes being taken but hes her doctor i talk to matty get her to change physicians you can do it but lew jenny what happens if sepsis is being regularly reintroduced to rachels system she wouldnt be able to fight it off no matter how much antibiotics we could give her isnt that whats happening call me when rachels been moved he said and put the cell phone away there was something else on his mind hed found stanskys files in trey merlis shirts these shirts had just returned from the jiffy tyme dry cleaners on biscayne boulevard where had he heard that name before he considered the address on biscayne but he couldnt recall where that number was he drove to a gas station inside the kiosk he found a wire rack of local maps he bought one and along with a pair of cheap beach towels took it out to the car he stood there for a moment letting the sun bake him for a moment he could still feel the residue of the unnatural chill heitor had laid on him he opened up the map traced biscayne boulevard north from where he was thats when it clicked in his mind pablo leyes had told him that his wife estrella worked on biscayne boulevard at a dry cleaners named jiffy tyme the news cafe was open twentyfour hours croaker stood in the shadows beneath the green awning looking out at the pinkish oystershell light over the beach across ocean drive it was less than thirteen hours before croaker would have to put barbacena in the gun sight even though it was before lunchtime the restaurant was far from empty models with long legs and sunglasses coming off early morning fashion shoots were busy chainsmoking while they attacked highcholesterol breakfasts in between mouthfuls they dished other models croaker was wearing olive trousers a pale green shortsleeve shirt of nubby linen and thin socks with white diamonds on them new clothes he had bought at a nearby boutique his shoes still squeaked when he walked though theyd need a couple of days to dry out majeur arrived without fanfare as he parked the grapecolored lincoln and got out croaker went across the street majeur was dressed in a stylized darkblue versace tuxedo a white rose was pinned to his satin lapel its bruised petals were stained with what appeared to be lipstick it was as dark as dried blood he swung his pencilthin attach case against his thigh with a kind of insouciance as if he were prodding a favorite horse to show its best moves his hatchet face had lost none of its rich mahogany glow but tendrils of his slick gunmetal hair curled damply against his forehead obviously croaker wasnt the only one sleepdeprived but this was not an outfit befitting a man burning the midnight oil as he collated intelligence on juan garcia barbacena and his amazing technicolor security machine glancing at his gold patek philippe watch majeur said punctuality says much about a mans more private habits good morning sir not much of a morning yet croaker said but it will be majeur said i promise you that his eyes had that slightly watery look people get when theyve had too much to drink they strolled slowly along the beach as the heat spread upward from the baking sand it was like an oven croaker said you look like youve had quite a night some people you just have to dress up for majeur offered croaker a chocolatecovered mint then popped one into his mouth sadly i believe i am approaching an age when too much champagne sours the stomach it always did but when youre young you just dont care majeur seemed to roll that thought around with the mint that is true the destruction occurs early the body moralsthey both suffer beneath the onslaught of life with a small frisson croaker realized the lawyer was talking about himself the body has gravity to contend with he said but as for morals as for morals majeur continued they suffer from each roll of the dice life is a gamble sir a discordant dance against the odds no lasting good ever came from that croaker had an intuition that life for majeur had been reduced to a relationship with one person his client is that where you were last night visiting the gambler i am never far from him he and i have become like siamese twins hi that event when one dies what do you think will happen to the other majeur slipped off the gold marriage band from the third finger of his left hand he turned it around contemplatively on the tips of his slender fingers when one takes the first step on a path seor one often fails to grasp what may lie at the end this i think is a state necessary to impel one onward light shone off the gold band as he slowly turned it sacrifice is the essential building block of life sir small ones large ones andoccasionallyone so profound that one cannot possibly be aware of its consequences he held the gold band up you see this ring seor it represents nine years of my life a life imagined it seems now by someone unknown to me he lofted the ring flying through the glistening morning it joined the whitegreen breakers sinking into the sand now like those waves that dream has gone and another one has taken its place ill tell you something majeur croaker said its damn hard to work up sympathy for the man whos extorting me the lawyer laughed that highpitched curiously feminine sound i agree besides giving me a sour stomach too much champagne makes me maudlin i detest people who are maudlin dont you majeur gave him a crooked smile but my maundering highlights an oddity he took out a cigar in a metal sheath looked at it for a moment then apparently reconsidering put it back inside his tuxedo jacket you see unlike you i understand that a relationship has sprung up between us sort of like the rapport between torturer and the tortured majeur laughed again i will say considering you arent an attorney you certainly have a way with words seor he rubbed at the place on his finger where the wedding band had been but who is to say who is the torturer and who is the tortured croaker paused aware that majeur had just told him something important majeur i think sir that time makes fools of us all majeur shook his head as if trying to clear out the excess of champagne hed consumed to work seor we have promises to keep the pause had been fatal the tenuous thread that had a moment before seemed to connect them had vanished and a subject to send down before we sleep majeur unsnapped his attach extracted a small manila envelope two folded blueprints and a sheaf of onionskin papers held together with a white paper clip he handed them over the papers were filled with singlespaced typewritten paragraphs of text the envelope contained a dozen blackandwhite photos each with a name on the back the photos bore the mark of the surveillance camera they were grainy the subjects imposed on the run it is all there seor everything you need croaker studied the top photo he saw a remarkably young man with thick pitch black hair a disarmingly dimpled smile and eyes as sharp as a falcons not a handsome man but in this case it made no difference the face was virile strong in every sense of the word this was juan garcia barbacena the subject has a fascination for exotic food spices twowheeled vehicles and sex in this country he travels in convoy ever security conscious majeur would not utter barbacenas name in public he is driven in a bulletproof gray rollsroyce two black mercedes sedans in front two behind he has nine men with him at all timesprofessional bodyguards four drive the mercs four ride shotgun one drives the rolls also theres a woman whos a food taster majeurs nicotinestained teeth shone like buttered kernels of corn as he smiled hes like a roman caesar you see he has paid for his absolute power with paranoia in this case croaker said flipping through the sheets of onionskin his paranoia seems all too justified an accurate observation sir majeur snapped his attach shut which is why we have chosen you to kiss him down he shot the cuffs of his white tuxedo shirt subtly adjusting the gold and lapis cufflinks the bodyguards run in four sixhour shifts that way theyre always fresh and alert what about the food taster shes thai majeur observed she sleeps curled like a cat at his side when he has no need of her sex her talents lie elsewhere majeur looked out across the beach to where a beautiful golden lab leapt to catch a frisbee tossed by his master majeur stopped apparently not wanting to get too close they sat on a bench like the old men who later in the day would be hunched chins on their canes watching with rheumy eyes the topless girls dreaming of being nineteen again for him business invariably comes first but sex is an imperative majeur smelled of tequila and a floral scent that did not belong to him he travels with three girls like a harem its a crap shoot as to which one he will choose sometimes its more than one at once lucky man croaker said majeur put his head back to observe a sky rich in color not today croaker consulted the written material i see he stays at unconventional places no hotels thats right he owns a building here in miami beach and another in miami warehouses at least thats what they appear to be on the inside they have been completely remodeled to his specificationsopulent bedroom suites conference rooms and business lounges with all the latest hightech computer gear and satellite uplinks this way he can have the run of the place position his bodyguards for maximum security and no one knows about it i see you have the building plans here croaker unfolded the blueprints theyre accurate absolutely uptodate croaker looked down the beach to where the golden lab was leaping in an expression of absolute joy through the surf theres only one thing remaining majeur nodded whatever you need sir i can get croaker put a hand in his pocket a long gun a steyr just a moment majeur held up his hand he reached into his breast pocket and took out his wallet and an ultraslim gold pen he flipped open the wallet turned over a business card and prepared to jot down croakers specifications but croaker was aware of these small movements only peripherally his gaze was caught by the wallet it was long and slima europeanstyle wallet made of crocodile hide in low light it might have passed for black but in the mornings bright sun croaker could see it was a very dark blue it was the wallet rachel had described in her diary the wallet owned by the man dr ronald stansky had brought to their last sm session who had watched them perform majeur was trey merli go on seor im waiting croaker cleared his throat and focused his mind all sorts of thoughts were running rampant through his head what the hell kind of conspiracy had he stumbled into he made himself go on i want a steyr ssg with a swarsky scope and a harris bipod tapewrapped stock serial number filed off done ammunition one box will be sufficient is there anything else binoculars zeiss ten by fiftysix night owl but in truth croaker had only half his mind on these details majeur nodded delivery of the equipment seor the edge of his versace tux jacket was flapping against his thigh eightthirty tonight at no ill tell you where majeur the lawyer inclined his head as you wish sir the bar of the raleigh hotel a delightful place a thin smile wrinkled his lips i applaud your choice then like ice splintering under a heavy footstep his expression changed seor i sound a single note of warning do not mistake our rapport for a weakness on my part i know what you tried to do on the unos system you are locked out of the kidney until such time as i am satisfied you have fulfilled your end of the bargain you cannot get it you will not get it until the subjects heart has ceased to beat and how will you know its been done majeur tilted back his head oh seor i will know im paid to know croaker watched the lawyer walk back to his car and drive off sand rattled against his shoes he thought about the crocodile hide wallet he thought of majeur watching rachel and stansky go through their sexual catechism he might be marcellus rojas diego majeur attorneyatlaw but he was also trey merli owner of gold coast exotic auto rental in margate when the grapecolored lincoln had disappeared croaker walked slowly back beneath the green awning of the news cafe and ordered a fresh orange juice with a large squeeze of lime two eggs over easy with salsa and a double order of bacon heitor had called him a messenger what had he meant by that what message did croaker have and who was he delivering it to croaker took his juice and sat at a table his aches and pains were now too numerous to keep track of so he turned his mind elsewhere he sipped his juice and let the vibrance of sobe wash over him while he was otherwise engaged life had begun to creep into ocean drive professionalscamera and soundmenswung into the restaurant for cokes and muffins burly boys in string tops offloaded sparkling fresh produce from trucks tourists took pictures of one another with the trademark awning behind them the air smelled of root vegetables cilantro and makeup a jaunty jack russell terrier trotted by followed by a woman in a bikini and inline skates the day was at last in full swing the manta moved through the green water as languidly as a sun worshipper so big it seemed as unreal as a cloud it sucked plankton up into its wide mouth like some alien vacuum cleaner seen from above it was black as pitch its long horned fins extending in front its whiplike tail undulating behind following it croaker and rafe roubinnet in scuba gear swam in wide ellipses they rose and fell as if on columns of air but really they were riding the same current as the fish the spanish manto meant cloak and that was what this beast most resembled gold flecks glittered on its rough skin as the edges of its wings rippled but when croaker sank down diving deeper into the water he could see that its belly was as pale as ice shining in dawn light bennie and majeur were just like this ray pulling a manto around them to hide what lay beneath rafe touched croakers arm pointed to his watch then gestured upward the speargun attached to his wrist by a short nylon cord fluttered through the water in concert like an admonishing finger time to leave croaker nodded waggled his clear fins and began his ascent to the surface long before he got there he could see the dark shadow of rafes catamaran glancing back down through the green water croaker could see the manta dwindling into its dark unfathomable world part of him longed to be taken by it down and down into another realm and with it all the obligations that weighed upon his soul like a lead casing vanished in the darkness of another place croaker breached the surface bright sunlight bounced off the water almost blinding him they handed up their tanks weight belts fins and spearguns to a waiting crewman they climbed up the rope ladder slippery with salt and seaweed the polished sunwashed foredeck felt good beneath croakers bare feet the dive had somehow renewed him as rafe had promised it would they stripped off their masks and shortiesneoprene wet suits with short sleeves and legs all they wore were bathing suits rafe clucked like a mother hen over the deep purple and green bruises that spotted croakers skin christ you need a good long vacation he threw croaker an oversize towel croaker dabbed gingerly at his body hell this is my vacation rafe roubinnets boat was a beautiful sixtyfivefoot handmade cat made of carbon fiber the same strong but lightweight material as dennis conners americas cup boat it was slooprigged which meant it had a single mast there was a cabinor housemounted on aluminum struts above the water and between the two huge pontoons the foredeck was made of a thin sheet of west system epoxy resin painted glistening white with gold piping like the rest of the boat aft of the house was a nylon webbing for the crew of four to cross from pontoon to pontoon the wheels were set into cockpits scooped out of the aft section of the pontoons there were two wheels because the cat had twin screwsa pair of mammoth gas engines five hundred horsepower chevy hemis typically seen beneath the hoods of racing carsfor use when rafe wanted to motorsail or needed to outrun a storm the twin screws gave the cat another advantage they made it highly maneuverable it was the kind of boat you would feel comfortable in even if you went all the way up to newport rhode island a small folding table had been set up on the foredeck it was covered with a homey blueandwhite checkered cloth the cloth had pockets on the corners each filled with a small lead weight to keep it battened down croaker could see that the ends of the table legs fit into specially made depressions in the deck so it wouldnt shift in the swells they sat on canvas captains chairs with gold anchors silkscreened on the backs drying and warming eating fresh stone crabs caesar salad and warm garlic bread there was beer and champagne in a large metal cooler but croaker opted for club soda they ate in companionable silence for some time when he thought enough time had passed croaker said when did you and bennie part company it was obviously a delicate subject so he was not particularly surprised when rafe said id rather not talk about bennie but i would croaker pressed rafe gave croaker a long look while he munched on a forkful of salad always the detective eh compadre he nodded okay youre right he got pissed you wouldnt run for mayor again pissed rafe snorted hell compadre he went ballistic he had big plans which is why hed offered to help finance my campaign in a major way rafe shrugged maybe he wanted miami to become a safe haven for his clients maybe he had something grander in mind with bennie its always something grander but really it didnt matter because i cut the discussion short it was simple i was quits with politics bennie apparently didnt agree but its more than that croaker said you told me you dont like the company he keeps by and large thats true rafe threw down some shell and sighed he leaned back his captains chair tipped on its rear legs the truth is bennies a user compadre he makes friends for a reason and that reason is to benefit benito milagros he has this amoral streak its what makes him irresistible to a great many women and i can understand that theres a certain rush in watching somebody cleverly circumvent the law croaker pushed his plate away rafe i need some straight talk where im going tonight id say its downright vital i dont like the sound of that compadre a certain tension had come into the tall mans frame does this have something to do with juan garcia barbacena croaker hitched his chair forward it has everything to do with barbacena at midnight im going to put my head beneath the guillotine rafes chair came crashing down onto all four legs thats when barbacenas landing in miami the two men looked at each other for a long time sunlight spangled the ocean a pair of cormorants flew by heading for land for his part croaker wanted to go the other way down and down following the manta until the thought of the city and what he had to do tonight vanished but rachel wouldnt let him his tailthe electrical cordwas plugged into her hospital monitors he couldnt let her life signs flatline you said youd help me rafe roubinnet nodded gravely count on it whatever you need compadre nothing in life frightens me not even helping to plot juan garcia barbacenas death rafe shook his head barbacenas a hardened criminal ive got no qualms on that score no the world will be a far better place without him ill help you even though i know his death will make bennie one very happy hombre in the ensuing silence croaker could hear the blood coursing through his veins the pounding of his heart was almost painful the boat rocked a little on gathering swells very softly croaker said did you know that bennie works for the us government hes running barbacena in a sanctioned operation in mexico it doesnt surprise me to hear this hes in the company of thieves compadre quite a bit worse croaker said but if barbacenas working for him why would bennie want him dead rafe stood up lets take a stroll they went forward the boat had lifted anchor after theyd come back on board it was running lightly before the wind more or less paralleling the coast they stood looking out at the greenblue water dotted with fishing and pleasure boats compadre you must have had a mentor a rabbi i think they call it in new york no croaker nodded of course rafe said if hes smart every man when he is young finds a rabbi to learn from i am no exception and neither is bennie he clamped his hands together after a time the ties that bind you to your rabbi run very deep you understand its an intimate relationship unlike any other you and your rabbi come to share strengthsand fears now think of your rabbi imagine he has a daughter she is a beautiful creature very strong in many ways weak in others like all women she is enigmatic rafe was staring out at the creamy wake all right then this young woman meets a man and falls in love with him he is strong clever charismatic but he is the wrong man for her your rabbi knows this you know this but nothing can convince her love conquers all she insists i know him i will change him rafe stirred as if in a dream tragic words but then love can be terribly tragic compadre verdad yes croaker said its the truth rafe folded his arms over his browned chest well then events transpire with the chilling inevitability of fate they marry the man loves her for a time he abuses her as well but hope persists inside her more time passes he ignores her cheats on her one could say she takes the abuse and the indifference with a degree of stoicism it is also possible that she mistakes fear for hope then everything changes when she finds out about the mistress something snaps inside her her strength comes to the fore and rashly she confronts him and for her efforts she is murdered he beats her then strangles her with an electrical cord croaker said long before rafe had come to the end of this morality tale croaker had known that he was speaking about juan garcia and theresa marquesa barbacena so you already knew theresas fate rafe said now you know the rest bennies mentorhis rabbi in your parlancewas javier marquesa theresas father he meant juan garcia barbacenas dead wife who according to majeur barbacena had savagely murdered when they returned to the table they found the dishes had been cleared they had been replaced by bowls of watermelon chunks mango slices and papaya halves a silver thermos of coffee stood in the center next to a plate of lime wedges rafe leaned over the table squeezed the juice from several wedges onto the fresh fruit the gaily colored table was between them rafe i found out that bennies paying the bill for majeurs cell phone im sure thats not all hes paying for rafe dished out the fruit but i know majeur is working for the bonitas croaker said it doesnt make sense that bennie hired him to coerce me into settling his score with barbacena its the bonitas who have access to the kidney rachel needs rafe steepled his fingers unless majeur is working for bennie and the bonitas without any of them knowing he grunted that would be just like bennie devious to a fault and dont forget they all come from the same region in asuncion they know one another well croaker thought about this for some time so its possible bennie put my nieces life at risk a sad day compadre rafe handed a plate to croaker disillusionment is a barbed little pill that sticks in your throat he poured steaming black coffee into sea mugs weighted at their wide bottoms but life must go on isnt it so croaker nodded his eyes hooded one thing bothers me though bennie has a large and complex operation going barbacena is the spearhead why would bennie contract to have him eliminated now why not wait until the operation has been completed i can think of several reasons rafe tapped his fingertips together with barbacena coming here to miami hes at his most vulnerable now afterward who knows he might vanish back into some south american jungle then again word is barbacenas taken some dubious risks recently in the process hes made enemies in high places that would be a grave liability to someone in bennies position croaker considered these things as he ate some fruit it was cool and sweet and tart all at the same time he thought about bennie what was the real motivation for his actions who knew what a man with such a restless spirit really wanted who dyou think bennie would pick as barbacenas replacement he asked rafe shrugged im unfamiliar with the new players the benefits of retirement compadre but you can bet theres someone its only good business you never fire an employee without having already hired his replacement the same crewman who served lunch emerged from the cabin with croakers cell phone call for you mr croaker the young man said handing over the phone lew he heard jenny marshs voice in his ear and he walked to the far rail hi he said how are you making out the wind whistling around him made it impossible to hear he told her to hold on while he went into the house are you okay jenny said as he closed the door behind him the way you cut off the last call it couldnt be helped his heart constricted at the anxiety in her voice i was calling from a place i shouldnt have been in im fine now he was alone in the main salon and he sat on a builtin sofa what about rachel rachel and i are at jackson memorial she said that was quick i used a medevac helicopter it was the only way the ambulance ride would have done her no good at all what do you mean youre fine now nothing could get past this woman he thought i tripped and fell into a pool is all it was nothing believe me damn you i dont believe you he knew she was thinking of the spiritstone vision he cut her short stansky in the dark and hell stay that way jenny said i gave explicit instructions at the royal poinciana dialysis unit he wont be told anything anyway he doesnt come in until about six in the evening he stared out at a tanker moving slowly along the horizon he didnt want to tell her that with stanskys connections the doctor could easily find out where jenny had taken rachel that wasnt the immediate problem he was facing however everything seemed to be coming down to a matter of timing and matty your sisters okay i told her we lacked equipment that rachel now needed that got her anxious of course but i managed to settle her down i told her jacksons better able to handle the transplant as long as shes calm the last thing we need is for her to be calling stansky now she wont she trusts me rachels now my patient great now do you mind telling me what the hell is going on no problem just as soon as i get there until then i want you to keep a close eye on the infection already being done hour by hour i could read you that far youre a whiz he looked at his watch it was just after three ill be there by five until then no one gets in to see rachel except you and matty okay of course there was a brief hesitation lew youre scaring the hell out of me im going to get hospital security up here right now a sensible precaution he said sit tight and try not to worry oh right that will be a breeze he did his best to ignore her sarcasm one more thing jenny sometime in the next couple of hours im going to give you a call im going to say go thats it go when i do i want you to have matty call stansky have her tell him where rachels been moved are you nuts youll understand when i get there just do it jenny okay no its not okay youre going to have to do a lot better than that through a window he watched rafe speaking to one of the crew croaker could imagine other crewmen scrambling in the aft netting rerigging the sail as the boat came about i need him to verify this theory your monitoring the infection level will hopefully do part of it but only stansky can provide the other half i need my hands on him but at the time and place of my choosing right okay i can understand that i have the same suspicions about him you have when you get here well compare notes she sounded at least partially mollified sounds good jenny im glad youre with rachel me too she hesitated a moment lew will you swear to me youre all right except for a couple of more scrapes and bruises im fine really see you soon the house was divided into a number of cabins some separated by bulkheads to one side of the main salon was a halfbulkheada serving counter behind which was the compact but highly efficient galley gleaming with stainless steel and copper at the far end of the salon was a head one of two doors led to the master stateroom with its own head the other to a short corridor ending in two other cabins that could be used as offices during the day and as guest bedrooms at night the crew was quartered in berths within the pontoons a crewman entered bringing a tray back to the galley because the bulkheads were thin croaker went all the way back into the head off rafes stateroom inside the cramped space he dialed ronald stanskys west palm beach office the receptionist told him in her crisp indifferent voice that the doctor was at clinic today and did he need the number croaker said he did he broke the connection and dialed it he identified himself to stansky as juan hidalgo he spoke in a combination of spanish and badly fractured english a man like stansky would disdain having to learn spanish even though he worked parttime at a clinic something to do with a pain in his lower abdomen he told the doctor stansky finally got it continuing in juan hidalgos laborious manner croaker told stansky that he was at work and it might take him an hour to get there the doctor assured him hed wait with the knowledge that stansky was firmly in place for the next couple of hours he called jenny and gave her stanskys clinic number he put the cell phone away just as he reached for the door to the head the cat lurched in a swell and he slid sideways he was stopped from falling against a bulkhead because the circular rag rug on the floor did not give curious he knelt down peeling back an edge he saw that it was quite cleverly tacked down with velcro strips he was about to replace the section of rug when he noticed something beneath it on the floor peeling back more he discovered a circular cover cut into the floor surrounded by a thick rubber gasket seal in its center was a small metal wheel had it been open the circle was just large enough for a hefty man to fit through after a moments thought croaker flattened the rug back onto its velcro mounts and emerged from the head he fetched the plans of barbacenas converted warehouses majeur had given him and went back out onto the foredeck he spread the plans on the table placing bowls and sea mugs on the corners to keep the wind from ripping them this top one is the miami residence he said rafe took a good look at it youre kidding right this is locked up like fort knox i dont see any way in but i do croaker said his forefinger stabbed out you see here where the electrical conduit comes through the basement from the street normally theres no egress but when barbacena renovated he needed an army of lines for his computers satellite feeds what have you thats way over what had been intended when the building was built they had to put in several relay boosters and that means access i dont see any boosters here i see a freezer and a prefab wine cellar take another look rafe peered more closely at the plan see the erasure marks rafe traced his finger over the spot i see em what was erased were three letters fpl rafe looked up at him florida power and light croaker nodded i know everybody there rafe said all it will take is one call to verify the access but he made no move toward the house instead he rolled up the top sheet revealing the plan for the miami beach warehouse he scanned it briefly same layout here basically both these places are death traps even if you get in undetected even if you get to barbacena without being caught or killed youll never get out alive see my first week in office i got a crash course in assassinations and security one of those subjects thats fascinating and terrifying at the same time croaker nodded so what were looking at here is a suicide mission if you try to do it this way theres no doubt of it rafe glanced from the plans to croaker maybe thats what bennie wants thats occurred to me rafe sat back down in a captains chair then weve got to come up with an alternative he steepled his fingers when i was mayor i drove my security handlers crazy why because i was outside so much snipers they kept moaning a sniper is how they got to jfk they complained its how they got to king and bobby kennedy the outdoors is their worst nightmare he looked at croaker i may have made these guys nuts but i took everything they said very damn seriously they knew their business he leaned forward tapped the plans emphatically forget this stuff unless youre one of the mario brothers youll never get through to him its outdoors where youve got to make your move great minds think alike croaker said as it happens barbacenas a vegetarian very strict about it also traveling makes him hungry according to my information the first thing he does when he disembarks is eat hmm there are damn few vegetarian restaurants in the area even fewer that are still serving at midnight croaker said thinking of the short list provided in the material majeur had given him rafes expression broke into a smile ay de mi if we can pin down where barbacena will have his midnight snack you can take him rafes words were like a beacon in the night it was reassuring to know that he agreed with croakers own assessment of the situation croaker recited the list of vegetarian restaurants hed memorized theres only one that serves after midnight rafe said with a wolfish grin an chay asian food in a rain forest setting very trendy its on ninth and washington in sobe thats where barbacena will be croaker said he turned abruptly away almost stumbling to the far rail there he stood his back to rafe and the crew staring down at his biomechanical hand im racing toward midnight he thought i have no more time to evade the inevitable he wrapped his fleshandblood fingers around the cool metal at the base of his artificial hand a moment later he felt a presence behind him compadre its always like this rafes voice was soft on the sea breeze at the eleventh hour is when all the old doubts and fears start piling up theyll cripple you if you give into them rafe stopped he was close enough to croaker now to see what croaker was doing slowly and deliberately croaker pressed a series of five small buttons on the inside of his left wrist he waited three seconds then pressed them again in another order then he gave the biomechanical hand a sharp twist to the left it came off he cradled it in his right hand you know when i was in southeast asia i saw an old man display a krait just this way croaker looked at rafe do you know about kraits rafe no theyre snakes of the genus bungarus the most highly venomous in the world this old man handled them every day of his life i often wondered whether it occurred to him that all it would take was one misstep one bite and hed be dead croaker turned his biomechanical hand over so that it was palm up the fingers curled seemingly at rest in the old mans grip the krait seemed as harmless as this hand he held up the hand so the sunlight fired the metallic blue and beautiful theyre banded in fantastic colors but it would be a mistake to think that kraits were anything other than deadly a kind of sadness touched rafes handsome face compadre those jap technosurgeons sure knew what they were doing when they gave you that hand the things it can do neither of them cared to look at the stub of his wrist with its stainlesssteel collar its grooves and whorls micromotors calibrated rods and fibers this was too intimate a sight like another mans genitals i wonder rafe said do you feel nakedyou know nakedwithout it a bit its as much a part of me as my fleshandblood hand croaker looked away each moment it becomes more concrete im shown barbacenas photo now hes a real person instead of a name in a file you and i work on penetration and now i know exactly where hell be in the first few minutes past midnight he jerked his head in disgust its hit me rafe up until this moment ive been finding more and more elaborate ways of fooling myself id split myself into two distinct people out of selfpreservation it wouldnt be me who looked through the sniper scope i kept telling myself it wouldnt be me who centered juan garcia barbacena in the crosshairs it would be someone else who pulled the trigger and blew his head off but now the selfdeception has cracked like so many mirrors behind it all theres only me he stared bleakly into the sundazzle on the water come midnight it will be my eye in the sight my finger on the steyrs hair trigger my decision to exert that last bit of pressure until i hear the familiar percussion in my ears feel the recoil absorbed by my right pectoral muscle he was gripping his biomechanical hand so tightly his fingers seemed white and bloodless yes barbacena will die rachel will have her kidney and i will have to wake up tomorrow morning and realize the terrible price ive paid to be the master of life and death this pain you feel now i admit it cant be minimized but the deed is worth doing compadre deep down you know that this is an evil man for what he has done for what he will do he deserves to die rafe gripped his shoulder and when you see your niece recovered when you see the smile on her lovely face whatever doubts still linger will disappear like so much rain would they croaker wondered he wished he was as sure of that as rafe was nevertheless rafe was right about one thing he reattached the hand swinging it onto the stainlesssteel grooves on the outer circumference of his wrist stub working the buttons he realigned his nerves and tendons with the conduits running through the biomechanical interior he flexed the titanium and polycarbonate fingers extruded the stainlesssteel nails retracted them the truth he was stuck with was this curse or gift he didnt feel complete without this appendage he stared at the skyline of miami looming ever larger as they headed into shore sunlight emblazoned the highrises turning them the color of brass like brass they had been beaten into shape by the society of man just as he had forged on the anvil of venality and betrayal he realized it wasnt only for the murder of his wouldbe killer hed sought sanctuary at the surfers church last night it was for the deliberate act of coldblooded murder he was bound to commit tonight croaker was in the tbird on his way to jackson memorial when he noticed the flashing lights of a metrodade patrol car behind him he glanced at the speedometer even though he knew he hadnt been exceeding the limit the last thing he needed was to be pulled over by an overzealous cop but that was just what was happening he rolled to a stop at the curb and waited while the patrol car nosed in behind him there was a space of maybe fifteen feet between the tail of the tbird and the nose of chevy patrol car lights revolved flashing traffic passed nothing happened that was okay the cop was on the phone checking the registration of the tbird standard operating procedure croaker was looking at the windshield of the cop car in his rearview mirror when his cell phone rang probably jenny telling him that hospital security was in place but it wasnt jenny lew am i glad i got hold of you rocky saguass voice buzzed in his ear he was one of croakers contacts a detective lieutenant in charge of a squad at the metrodade police not as glad as i am to hear from you i got one of your flyswatters sitting on my tail now croaker kept his eyes on the rearview mirror even as we speak this is not good saguas fretted not any fucking good at all croaker sat up straighter in his seat whats up rock i dont know what the fuck is going on but i sure dont like it i just got back to the office and i find this priority bulletin come across the wire from the fbi its a request to pick you up and hold you in isolation for transfer to fed authority an icy ball was forming in the pit of croakers stomach feds the actf must be desperate opening up their search for him to local law enforcement would inevitably cause questions to be asked questions theyd rather not answer which was why the order included the iso designation they wanted him in strict isolation until they got their hands on him they give you cause croaker asked says here youre wanted for questioning concerning the death of vonda shepherd bullshit i say saguas went on i pulled the file this shepherd girl she was blonde cauc twentysix worked at gold coast exotic auto rentals in margate i made some calls reached out to the uniform who caught the b and e squeal said he found her head like off the fucking body man it was a goddamn horror movie he barfed his lunch all over his nice shiny shoes as croaker watched the door of the patrol car opened and a pair of shiny boots emerged it wasnt me rock i didnt whack her of course you didnt but you musta done something theres a shit storm of activity around here and its all armed at you a heavyset young cop was attached to those shiny boots he had a grim lantern jaw and short blond hair sparkling with sweat in the heat his right hand was on the butt of his service revolver it was impossible to look behind his reflective aviator sunglasses to guess his intent which was the point in any case he was heading toward croaker with the determination of a tank lew croaker said nothing he was watching the attitude of the cop and thinking how his options were rapidly shrinking he was like a spelunker exploring a cave the deeper he went the narrower the next cavern became until now he found himself wedged in on all sides by solid rock lew it was rockys voice you still there yeah well dont be i mean to say get the hell out of my jurisdiction and do it pronto this bulletin has highest priority no choice here buddy i gotta put every man i can spare on it get me sure croaker said but what about this flycatcher stuck to me maybe he hasnt gotten this info yet gimme the tag number of his vehicle croaker strained in his seat to read the plate in the mirror from his days in the nypd he was used to reading reversed images threejohnsoncarolinerunefortyfour he read off hold on sunlight spun crazily off the young cops wirerimmed sunglasses making him look like a robot intimidating inhuman cops cultivated an edge like that you needed whatever advantage you could get when at any moment a semiautomatic might be shoved in your face anything that might make the perp say not this one hes too tough lets move on the young cop was taking his time sizing up the situation just like they taught you in the academy in the mirror croaker watched the cop put his hand on the trunk of the tbird maybe he thought vondas dead body was in there croaker kept himself very still but his heart rate was already elevated rock i think hes made me ive run out of time the cops twoway radio squawked croaker could hear the word urgent the cop paused turned his head he hesitated a moment bending down to peer through the tbirds window at croaker you he ordered stay put then he trotted back to his car and leaned in i got him on the twoway saguas said burn rubber thanks rock i owe you yeah you do saguas said but thatll be another story he hesitated just an instant lew take care okay croaker took one last look at the cop he was standing beside the patrol car speaking into the mike while he stared at the back of the tbird croaker slammed the tbird in gear jammed his foot on the accelerator and took off down the street he had to will himself not to look in the rearview mirror it was all he could do to maneuver through the traffic at high speed down here nearer the hospital complex there was a very high percentage of elderly drivers no one was going fast except him a siren screamed behind him the patrol car was coming fast its revolving lights panicking the qtips behind the wheels of the intervening cars croaker turned right then right again the patrol car came on croaker pushed the tbird through a narrow gap between a red toyota and a refrigerated truck using the truck as camouflage he made a sharp left turning left again he was back on nw seventh avenue the patrol car was coming but he had a moments respite enough to formulate an emergency plan he cruised to a stop at a red light and took a long look at the oncoming traffic along the cross street once he got a sense of the traffic flow he saw it was going to be uncomfortably close behind him the patrol car appeared siren screaming lights flashing croaker glanced in the rearview mirror for this to work he needed the patrol car so close there was room only for reflex response he returned his attention ahead the light was still red he prayed for it to hold if it turned to green now here came the patrol car to his left a large truck lumbered along the cross street the young officer in the patrol car was using his loudspeaker ordering croaker to pull over croaker floored the accelerator swinging left crossing the path of the oncoming truck the startled trucker blew his air horn and croaker just missed crushing his rear bumper on the trucks grille the patrol car speeding after him was not so fortunate it rammed the truck almost headon the entire front end accordioned in on the young cop his head came flying forward but before it could slam into the steering wheel the air bag deployed that was as much as croaker glimpsed as he sped away his right hand shook a little when he pulled up in front of the west wing pavilion he noticed a crack in the steering wheel where hed been gripping it with his biomechanical hand like a fine florida restaurant or nightclub jackson memorial hospital had valet parking considering the area of miami it was in it was a smart move croaker looked at his watch it was now fortyfive minutes since hed called jenny and told her go stansky would be arriving any minute if he wasnt here already he glanced up at the pavilions brick facade then trotted up the steps into the cool hushed lobby he took the elevator up to the fifteenth floor went quickly along a wide hallway he passed a nurses station then turned a corner the dialysis unit was across the street at jackson memorial towers but jenny had decided to bring rachel directly to west wing where the transplant operating theaters were housed he saw jenny at the far end of the corridor she had just come out of rachels room as if sensing his approach she turned seeing him she smiled then quickly shook her head stansky hadnt shown up yet how is she he asked they were still some ways apart but the corridor was clear and the nurses station more than a hundred feet behind him around the corner between them were only two patient rooms and a bathroom jenny had wisely picked a quiet little backwater section of the floor to keep rachel safe better jenny said it was stansky wasnt it she nodded only briefly distracted by a tall slim technician in a white coat pushing a man in a wheelchair out of a room between them your instinct was right no wonder we were making no headway with the infection stansky was reintroducing the sepsis into rachels intravenous tube every day he was poisoning her croaker said why the technician turned the wheelchair in croakers direction why dont you ask him yourself the technician said as he kicked off the wheelchairs brakes and hurled it directly at croaker even though the patient was partially slumped over croaker recognized him it was stansky the doctors wrists and ankles were bound cruelly to the wheelchair with wire and his suit looked dark with sweat and blood croaker snared one arm of the wheelchair with his biomechanical hand it swung around on two wheels almost pitching over on its side before he had it under control by that time hed already determined that dr ronald stansky was quite dead croaker looked past stansky to see the man in the white coat he was standing just behind jenny one arm was locked across her throat you see how ridiculously easy this is seor finding the vulnerable spot is my forte that is because it is a distinct pleasure croaker looked into jennys green eyes there was concern there to be sure but no panic he returned his attention to the man in the technicians coat it was antonio not heitor his nose wasnt broken you once told me that others lied to me croaker said stansky was one of the worst offenders wasnt he oh there are worse i assure you croaker held out his hands palms up antonio this is between you and me he said theres no need to involve anyone else no man is an island seor surely you know that those amber eyes scrutinized croaker as he walked slowly down the corridor it is by his private and business connections with the world that a man may be influenced manipulated you mean antonio smiled my english is not so fine as yours seor perdoname cut the crap antonio what do you want madre de mentiras you have the patience of a moth you and heitor have worn my patience thin croaker said but its your time thats limited hospital security is crawling all over this floor unfortunately for you no antonios eyes blazed briefly thats far enough seor for emphasis he tightened his grip on jennys throat making her gag hospital securitylaughable though it ishas been neutralized were here now seor the three of us and of course your niece until i say otherwise tell me croaker said how much did stansky know about your organ harvesting operation thats why you murdered him isnt it so he couldnt talk stansky had become more trouble than he was worth perhaps you know something of his sexual peccadilloes so much for your english being not so fine every few seconds his gaze flicked to jennys face monitoring her like a doctor checks on a patient in critical condition he didnt know how she would handle herself in a crisis antonio smiled peccadillohe rolled the us spanish stylecomes from the spanish pecado it means little sin he sighed as if he were truly saddened stanskys sins werent so little anymore pity he had his uses like pimping for you and heitor in interrogations it was wise to tell your subject several dark and dirty things about himself this put the two of you on a different plane an intimacy evolved and thats what you wanted also it put the subject off guard softened him up for the questions you inevitably wanted answered stansky culled the live bodies for you to plunder from among the patients in his margate clinic what i want to know is whats your connection with trey merli hmm antonios eyes were hooded whats a trey merli heres whats been bothering me antonio croaker went on as if antonio hadnt spoken i break into gold coast exotic auto rentals and what do i find antonio broke into a beatific smile a young womans head ўque undo muchacha such a beautiful girl croakers hands curled into fists he saw in antonios face how the other man delighted in baiting him with effort he refocused on what he needed to do youre already inside yet you didnt trip the alarm when i follow you out its through a broken rear window only the glass shards are all on the outside antonio shrugged so you broke the window getting out which means there was only one way for you to have gotten in you had a key and the alarm code croaker cocked his head now who could have given you those things except the owner a man named trey merli but maybe you know him as marcellus rojas diego majeur curious isnt it there was a smile on antonios face not unlike the one on the mona lisa at that moment the door to the bathroom opened and matty stepped out into the corridor several things happened at once matty gave a little oh at what she saw antonio moved his head sightly to see what was happening jenny smashed the heel of her shoe against antonios instep and croaker went into action he had seen in jennys eyes what she had meant to do a split second before she did it and he was prepared he raced past matty spinning her out of harms way he had just an instant while antonio was reacting to the sharp and unexpected pain in his foot he locked his biomechanical fingers around antonios wrist pulled the muscular arm away from jennys throat she ducked down gasping in air croaker extruded the stainlesssteel nail of his forefinger it slid across antonios throat dont make another move seor it was an odd order for antonio to give he was the man with the weapon at his throat then croaker saw that jennys face was white and pinched he looked down to see the stiletto blade of a gravity knife pressed against her side antonio was gripping it with his free hand what do they call this seor a mexican standoff no antonio seemed inordinately pleased with himself as if hed planned this all along croaker was furious to have one of the bonita twins so near to the three women he cared most about in life was intolerable with his face very close to antonios he said what is it you want this seor antonio hissed to push you to prod you to become your own personal devil why to see when and where you will fail seor to see what kind of man you really are you want to see if i measure up isnt that right antonio if ive got what it takes to go headtohead with you mano a mano there was an almost wistful tone to antonios voice truly that would be something with an animal grunt he slammed his knee into the small of jennys back sending her stumbling into croaker as croaker moved to catch her antonio slithered away croaker turning jenny away to protect her looked at antonio this isnt finished es verdad seor i would die first antonio flicked his wrist and the blade of the gravity knife disappeared into its handle pocketing the knife he vanished around the corner of the corridor jenny croaker began im all right she had already regained her balance and was rubbing the sore spot in her back who in gods name was that antonio bonita together they walked toward where matty was standing near rachels room hes part of my problem croaker turned to his sister and she nodded she too was okay just shaken then she saw stansky slumped over tied to the wheelchair oh my god croaker took her in his arms guided her back down the hall and into rachels room honey stay with rachie now dr marsh says the infections finally under control i know she told me matty said ive been praying she looked at croaker but lew i called dr stansky you told me to right i told him we were here and now she turned as if she could look through the door to where stanskys corpse still sat cooling by the moment dont think about that he soothed stansky was corrupt he was hurting rachie he sat her in a chair by the bedside you just concentrate on rachel pray if you want to by tomorrow i promise shell have her kidney he squeezed her hand and left her there outside in the corridor jenny was coming out of an unoccupied room i put stansky out of public view for the time being its enough he scared the daylights out of your sister she went to a wall phone and lifted the receiver in two strides croaker was at her side what are you doing calling the cops what else she whispered with her hand cupped over the mouthpiece after whats just happened its obvious hospital security wont cut it croaker reached across her depressed the pips severing the connection listen to me jenny thereve been some unexpected complications the people whore involved with the organ harvesting are putting me under the gun theyve got the cops looking for me on a trumpedup charge of murder oh christ now she did look scared but lew i have no choice theres a dead man in that room i have a duty to call the cops of course you do i wont stop you he took the receiver out of her hand and hung it up listen to me im in such deep water i cant see the surface he pointed antonio killed stansky to stop him from talking about the organ harvesting operation but why bring the body here why rattle my cage further by threatening you you heard him it was a macho thing jenny seemed to be conjuring up antonios image in her head christ ive met so many guys like that croaker nodded in a way it was a show of power believe me i was impressed but dont for a minute think youve met anyone like antonio bonita he studied her face trying to judge her level of anxiety see he wasnt lying he wants to test my mettle jenny closed her eyes for a moment when she opened them he could see that they were clouded with worry but free of tears dont you see he pressed on the moment you call the police i have to be out of here within minutes of you telling them whats happened theyll be buzzing around here like bees on flowers they wont let you alone that means i cant get to you until its all over oh lew she put her head against his chest for a moment now i know what its like when i give a patients family bad news i feel like something irrevocable has happened she looked at him isnt there some way out there must be i cant believe it will all end in tears it wont he gripped her shoulders these people have given me a role to play for the moment at least ive got to stick to it i canti wonttake a chance with rachels life but isnt that just what theyre counting on of course she was right what did it matter that he had caught a glimpse of the daring conspiracy among actf director spaulding gunn bennie and barbacena to use the mexican chiapas rebels as pawns to destabilize mexico and install a new government that would make a handful of americans rich beyond anyones wildest dreams they still had him firmly in their vise as long as rachels life hung in the balance hed have to do what was required of him damnit lew im not the kind of person to sit on my hands and wait around for something to happen all right maybe you cant do anything except be a rat in their maze but not me her eyes were alight look they got to her some way somehow they caused her to need this kidney if i could find out how they did it it was stansky i know it croaker shook his head but jenny even if you find out how they got to rachel what good would it do she still needs that kidney and i have to pay their price for it jesus she slammed the flat of her hand against the wall theres got to be something if you find it let me know dont shed heard the defeat in his tone and she glared at him dont you dare give up hope his lips brushed hers youre a remarkable person jenny im sorry as hell i got you into this she put a hand behind his neck and kissed him fiercely she opened his lips with hers and her tongue twined with his he put his arms around her he did not want to let her go the force of her will lent him strength it was so heady that for an instant he was dizzied grudgingly he finally released her she didnt cling and she wasnt going to cry take care of rachel he handed her the phone in the next twelve hours shes going to need the kind of care only you can give her jenny looked at the receiver as if it were a black widow spider take it he curled her fingers around it make the call jenny looked deep into his eyes i wont say goodbye i wont even think it he left as antonio had swiftly and silently disappearing around the corner jenny watched that corner of the corridor as if by will alone she could bring him back she counted silently to sixty then she turned and dialed given a choice croaker would not have used the tbird he didnt have that luxury he couldnt afford to have it found at the hospital so he took the chance and drove it the drive to miami international airport was nerveracking every time he spotted a metrodade patrol car he made a detour that put him in neighborhoods best avoided there was a positive side to that the cops tended to avoid them as well at the airport he put the tbird in the longterm parking lot as he walked to the domestic airline terminals he made a call on his cell phone yeah a male voice said in his ear hey felix lew what the hell felix pinkwater worked for the florida department of revenue theyd worked together on several actf cases i need a favor croaker said among other matters the fdr was in charge of collecting the state corporate taxes how about first thing tomorrow morning im late for my tennis game felix i have no leeway i need this now felix sighed what is it lew a club on lincoln in sobe called the boneyard i need a rundown on the owners jesus lew what else can i get you a starring role beside jodie foster would be nice but right now ill settle for this felix snorted in his ear hold on let me get the old computer fired up this time of the day its one tired puppy croaker stood outside the terminal people rushed to make their flights others just deplaning sauntered out got it felix said in his ear the boneyard is owned by a corporation los mirlos encantados inc the enchanted blackbirds croaker thought his mind racing tre merli los mirlos encantados is a subsidiary felix was saying the parent company is mineral imports sa and mineral imports is owned by some bahamian corporation called juego holdings and dont ask me who owns juego holdings with these offshore shell companies its impossible to know for sure felix sounded aggrieved like all bureaucrats his power resided in his facts and figures croakers pulse had accelerated juego meant game in spanish and the game was allimportant to the bonitas croaker laughed toddle on off to your tennis game felix i owe you big time felix said hasta luego muchacho in the terminal croaker did a slow cruise of the airline ticket counters as he passed the delta desk he overheard the attendant saying im sorry but the sixten to los angeles is completely sold out there are no standby seats available and thats our last flight tonight she was speaking to a college kid in a denim jacket jeans and reeboks he had a duffel bag over one broad shoulder theres gotta be something he said i gotta get home its my sisters wedding you could try another airline the kid shook his head i got a discount standby ticket with delta i cant afford anything else the delta attendant looked sympathetic im sorry but theres nothing i can do the kid shook his head and drifted away croaker stepped up to the counter and the attendant greeted him with a pair of bright eyes and a generic smile yes sir he asked for a roundtrip ticket to la and she gave him the soldout spiel she looked at him brightly i could get you on the fivefifty tomorrow morning no good croaker said ive got to get there tonight he thought for a moment what about another airline the attendant nodded let me check while she did croaker kept his eye on the kid he was staring at the delta departure board as if he could manufacture another flight out of hope youth could do that to you sir american has a flight to los angeles leaving at seventen its the last flight out of the airport she squinted at the monitor i see one seat remaining croaker told her to hold it for him he gave her a name he made up on the spot she nodded this is concourse h american is in concourse d sir youd better hurry croaker thanked her and sauntered over to the kid can you beat that he said conversationally the flight to la is sold out i know the kid said i tried to get on im flying standby tough luck croaker said well my buddy and ill just have to wait until tomorrow you too i guess you need a lift no thanks the kid looked morose the thing is ive got to get there tonight my sisters getting married hey you know theres one seat left on the american flight it leaves in just about an hour and a half the kid shook his head doesnt matter i dont have the bucks cmon croaker said lets see what we can do the kid looked skeptical this a joke or what you want to get home tonight croaker said right at the american counter he paid cash for the ticket he used the fictitious name hed given the delta attendant when he handed over the money he used his biomechanical hand displaying it prominently so the american attendant would remember him then he went back to the kid and handed him the ticket the kid eyed it suspiciously okay whats the catch croaker showed him his federal id official business you get the ticket you travel under the name on the ticket then you forget all about it thats it croaker nodded you need my help and i need yours its as simple as that the kid grinned and pumped croakers hand hey cool thanks a lot give my congratulations to your sister outside as he waited for a shuttle bus croaker felt satisfied hed given the cops a trail to follow the more time they wasted on trying to track him down in la the more leeway he had here in miami he looked around everything seemed different sharp acutely focused saturated with color he was aware of everything it was always like this at the end of a case when at long last the perp was in sight now every decision made every action undertaken was crucial latinos had the best phrase for it bailar en la cuerda floja that was what he was doing now dancing on the slack rope balancing on the razors edge he took the shuttle to the fontainbleu hotel then grabbed a cab up to palm beach it was an expensive ride but worth every penny it was near pm when he walked across the concrete parking lot he took the tag off a buick riviera switched it with the one on the turquoise mustang then he climbed behind the mustangs wheel the facade of the royal poinciana hospital loomed cool as an ice cube in the gathering darkness he got in and turned on the ignition the engine thrummed happily he put it in gear and pulled out of the lot if he kept to the speed limits he had just enough time to make one stop before his eightthirty appointment with majeur the lobby of the raleigh hotel was tall and stately as evocative of the s as the salon of an old ocean liner some years ago it had been lovingly restored the terrazzo floor was beautifully patterned and polished beyond up a short flight of stairs was the open restaurant which looked out on a garden filled with palm trees and a spectacular pool that had made the cover of life when the hotel first opened the bar was justly famous tucked away in the left corner of the lobby its dark terrazzo floor had embedded in it a stylized outline of a martini glass complete with olive garnish the place was small and intimate with a burnished wood bar and a mirrorclad wall of glass shelves filled with liquor bottles of every description it was an authentic haunt meant for adults celebrations and laughter that burst like the bubbles in fine champagne majeur was already at the bar a martini glass was in front of him by his left knee was the kind of hardsided aluminum case photographers use to carry their delicate equipment a martini for my friend majeur told the bartender as croaker took the stool next to him and make it just like this one dry as the kalahari he was dressed in the sort of deliberately casual suit that cost if it was wrinkledand it wasit was meant to be he wore a bandcollar shirt of subtly striped silk and bruno magli loafers his eyes were slightly glassy as if hed been drinking for a very long time maybe hed been celebrating but he didnt look like hed be laughing any time soon you picked a fine spot he said as the bartender set the martini in front of croaker the drinks are first rate thats beside the point croaker said majeur took up his glass not to me its getting late croaker slipped off his stool lets get this over with majeurs hand covered his for a moment dont be rude sir enjoy your drink croaker sat back down with the cops beating the bushes for him he was uneasy in public places but maybe this would turn out for the best something was eating at majeur majeur swallowed half his martini do you know anything about the kalahari seor because he knew it would calm majeur croaker took a sip of his martini just that its a desert in africa it covers a hundred thousand square miles in southern botswana eastern nambia and western south africa to be exact i once flew over it do you know that its pockmarked with lake beds cracked and parched now dry as a bone but once there was water jy la vidal and life croaker had once interrogated a serial bomber who was so antsy the other cops on the squad were sure he was a stone junkie croaker knew better the man simply had to tell them just how smart hed been it was an imperative inside himself over which he had lost control there comes a time in every perps life when he needs to unburden himself it might come in the form of bragging or confession or anywhere in between like the sun coining up each day it always showed itself you just had to be clever enough to recognize it i know youve met my niece croaker said i know you watched her and stansky do their thing majeur flicked a hand for another martini nothing changed in his face i dont want anything to happen to rachel and in that one simple sentence croaker understood everything the question i kept asking myself is why a man like you should be renting a car you have a lot of money you probably own more than one car so why the lincoln now i see you knew id do a run on the tag that id find out youd rented it from gold coast and you wanted me to go there majeurs martini came and he sampled it for all his outward reaction they might have been comparing golf scores at gold coast i meet vonda croaker continued who tells me a man named trey merli owns it also shes prepared for me she even knows what a real warrant looks like because she tells me trey merli has shown one to her the second time im there antonio bonita is inside the office armed with the keys and the alarm code from rachels diary i discover that trey merli knows dr ronald stansky her physician shed scribbled down an address on hibiscus when i go there everything is placed just so including a load of shirts from the jiffy tyme dry cleaners but instead of cardboard between the folded shirts i find certain medical files this place isnt a home its a stage set i assume for my benefit croaker took another sip of his martini then theres the matter of the grave majeurs dark gaze met croakers in the mirror at the back of the bar which grave sir theresa marquesa barbacenas barbacena himself is almost never in the states what on earth would his wifes grave be doing in south florida majeur nodded his head so its true what they say that youre one fine detective of course that was not her grave just a stage set yes i set clues for you the false grave the rental carthis was a trail back to trey merli and at trey merlis house i was able to leave for you the files on sonia vonda and your niece but why you work for the bonitas majeur stared into the clear depths of his martini then he quickly downed it and threw some money on the table its getting close in here they went out into the lobby up the stairs through a glass door out into air sticky with humidity the velvet evening hung in the palm fronds like spiderwebs lights twinkled around the perimeter of the pool a couple of kids waist deep in water splashed each other while a youngish woman in a bandeau bathing suit looked on indulgently otherwise the pool area was deserted the two men walked slowly until they heard the rhythmic sounds of the surf majeur carried the aluminum case as if he were a replacement window salesman near the seawall he put the case down between them now i will tell you something seor as they say yo hablo con el corazon en la mano i speak from the heart you grow up you gain a profession you make career choices for good or ill theyre yours you meet a woman fall in love get married in other words there is a routine a rhythm this is life he took out a cigar but then seor something happens he slipped it out of its case clipped off the end and lighted it this something is as unexplainable as it is unexpected you see someone and a door opens to a place inside you that was there all along only you didnt know it seor this person without even knowing it leads you to a new place your old life fades like a photograph in the fire and another life as it seems magically and mysteriously begins croaker thought of majeur slipping off his wedding ring and throwing it into the south beach surf seor this is what happened when i saw rachel i saw her with that pig stansky and my heart stopped he turned to look at croaker directly escuchame seor this was not a matter of lust lust is a thing of the surface of the moment like smoke it disappears on the first gust of wind no i am speaking of something permanent profound this was a matter of finding myself when i saw her when i saw what she was doing what stansky was doing to her i saw how lost and alone a human being could be and in that moment i recognized myself in her i saw how alone i was in my marriage i woke up in bed the next morning and looked at the person next to me i saw a woman from a prominent family a woman of significant pedigree a women for whom i had no feeling whatsoever i had married her simply to please my father and i thought of rachel she became a mirror in which i saw my own soul i knew then that i had to do something to save her in a sense it was the first step in saving myself comprende of course croaker understood he had felt something remarkably similar as hed been reading rachels diarythe urgent necessity to save her from men like the late donald duke and stansky and all the others who marched in their footsteps so you decided to play both sides of the fence youd betray the bonitas while continuing to carrying out their orders majeur nodded the morning after i saw rachel and stansky together i knew i had to do something to try and thwart the bonitas but what they are very clever men i could not give myself away majeur stared at the children climbing out of the pool they used rachel to get to you they need barbacena dead at the same time they have to maintain reasonable deniability they chose yousomeone with skill and training someone who could not be traced back to them should he be caught majeur how did they get to rachel i do not know seor truly he shrugged you cannot change what has already happened she still needs the kidney croaker believed him majeur looked miserable i did some digging recently croaker said does the name juego holdings sound familiar to you but of course i have done some paperwork for that entity it is one of antonio and heitors shell corporations so it was as croaker had suspected the bonitas owned the boneyard the club on lincoln road where rachel had collapsed in an apparent drug overdose another link between antonio heitor and rachel but what did it really prove why had she collapsed at just that moment what had they done to her now that i know youve betrayed the bonitas croaker said turning his thoughts back to the present i want to know how you became involved in the first place majeurs shoulders slumped his dapper clothes seemed to fall in listless folds as if in the last few minutes hed shriveled physically it certainly wasnt my idea he placed the cigar very precisely on the sea wall letting it smoulder like a dormant volcano a year ago maybe a little more i was contacted by antionio bonita he was already working for your government he showed me reams of records they were officalgovernment documentation the federates knew everythingwho i represented the deals id brokered the drugs that had passed from hand to hand they had me by the throat so they coopted you majeur nodded i kept on with my practice this is what they wanted antonio told me that from time to time i would be contacted my role would be given to me in detail all that was required of me was to follow the script which is what you did in this case until you saw rachel with stansky correct seor majeur watched cigar smoke taken by the wind this morning i told you that life was a gamble by betraying the bonitasby allowing you to see it was they who damaged your niece to coerce you into murdering juan garcia barbacenai am gambling that you will be the one to stop these monsters but it wasnt merely justice majeur wanted croaker had seen that look in many a mans eye and he knew what it meant listen to me majeur i wont kill the bonitas for you or for anyone else i know it but there may come a time soon when you are given no other choice majuer picked up his cigar i have no illusions sir we have entered into a most deadly game my actions have already left me in mortal peril the bonitas knew you would show up at gold coast and they took precautions ouizas ellos se le ponermos la mosca detras de la oreja i think they already suspect me with the twins who can say he was standing straighter now a modicum of the old majeur was reasserting itself if they do it does not matter not now tonight i have declared myself i reject them and it is a feeling muy bueno croaker listened to the surf hi its constancy it reminded him of the rise of life over death more than anything now he needed that reassurance it seemed clear now that bennie could not be involved with the actf the bonitas must have set him up but there was still a nagging doubt and croaker knew he needed factual confirmation of what hed learned he needed to get his hands on majeurs phone bills to see if they jibed with the southern bell computer records that showed bennie was paying for majeurs cell phone line listen to me majeur said the bonitas run this organ harvesting ring but in this they are not independent your government is involved in what manner i do not know but it is clear that they have made some kind of lunatic deal with the bonitas he took the cigar out of his mouth one does not make deals with a pair of rabid dogs but youve never met the fed who made the deal with the bonitasthe man who calls the shots no just antonio majeur picked up his cigar and now i must be going but i will meet you at midnight how do you know where ill be majeur smiled i know where the target will be we both read the same material its a sure bet we came to the same conclusion you are not going to penetrate those two fortresses with his entourage i will gamble you are not going to make the attempt anywhere indoors how dyou know the odds sir at heart i am a gambler you know he waited a moment trying to read croakers expression you have been to the restaurant already havent you croaker nodded dont take this the wrong way majeur but i dont want your help its too dangerous for both of us as you say the bonitas have an uncanny ability of finding out everything majeur gave him a fierce grin he reached down moved the aluminum case next to croaker this is something i must do for myself seor call it the rehabilitation of a soul croaker took possession of the tools of the assassins trade theres a building he gave majeur an address on washington avenue its directly across from an chay three stories high access to the rooftop is gained in the rear from there ill have a clear vantage point to the front of the restaurant the angle is ideal you have made a wise choice with all of the targets vaunted security it is prudent for you to have a lookout and in the moments just before and after impact someone to watch your back besides the quicker the kill is confirmed the quicker rachel gets her kidney thanks majeur de nada there is a way you can show my gratitude to rachel when she recovers her health tell her a little about me youll do that yourself croaker said youll see her at jackson memorial when this is all over majeurs gesture was curiously formal that would give me pleasure sir as he began to turn away croaker said majeur seor theres another reason why youll come armed tonight isnt there majeur smoked his cigar for some time his gaze drifting youre thinking of heitor and antonio croaker prompted after i hit the target they have no more use for me heitor is obsessed with this he raised his biomechanical hand and as for antonioi dont yet quite know what hes obsessed with but hes drawn to me no matter sir they will kill you there seemed no doubt in majeurs mind they have no other choice you know too much you are too dangerous to them i know croaker discovered they were alone in the lighted pool area just one more thing i have told you everything not quite everything whats your involvement with estrella leyes it was not so much a stab in the dark as a foray into the shadows the medical files at trey merlis house had been slipped between shirts just back from jiffy tyme dry cleaners where estrella worked so you have traveled farther than i had anticipated majeur said estrella and i grew up together in those days she was like my older sister but where my interests lie in the business world hers lie in the larger universe that surrounds us all you mean heta i majeur nodded after i stole the files from stansky i needed a place to stash them estrella volunteered ive met her croaker said its clear the bonitas frighten her terrify is more the word croaker could see the concern for estrella on majeurs face she has seen firsthand the kind of terrible rituals they perform on humans it is saidshe has told me thisthat the twins are not born of human womb as the story goes they were left on a dying womans doorstep even then as infants they were capable of terrible things they ate her child so she tried to kill them the woman but they would not die instead they clung to her crying in their hunger and their desperate need by their constant suckling they healed her in a kind of hideous symbiosis they strengthened one another soon she forgot about her own child they made her forget she took them in she became their mother croaker almost laughed jesus you dont believe that crap do you i mean there are stories of bogeymen vampires all sorts of demons the world over but thats all they are stories majeur shrugged on this subject i am neutral seor the law is what i know he gave a little smile that seemed somehow sad the law and how to circumvent it what power the bonitas have they learned from humait milagros then they perverted that knowledge to their own ends that is one history but listen to me carefully in guarani history and legend are expressed by the same word majeur looked down at the aluminum case perhaps thinking of its contents one thing i do know estrella leyes is not an ignorant woman trey merlis house on hibiscus island was just as croaker had left it after his encounter with heitor wherever majeur had needed to go it wasnt back here croaker slipped in through the screened porch he went swiftly and silently through the darkened house the perfectly set table looked eeriea tableau awaiting stage directions to come alive there was a den but after twenty minutes of searching he was convinced it contained no household records he went into the master bedroom the shirts were still on the bed the tv and video equipment still risen from their lacquer coffin at the foot of the bed something was bothering him about the whole situation with the bonitas the actf and bennie but he couldnt put his finger on just what he didnt believe majeur had lied to him on the other hand he was convinced majeur didnt know the whole truth he turned on a lamp and his eye wandered over the details of the room more often than not it isnt whats hidden youre looking for his father had once told him its whats right in front of your nose croaker stared at the stack of laser discs casablanca blade runner last tango in paris beneath something metallic gleamed he reached over pushed the laser discs aside his finger hooked around a latch and lifted out rolled a deep drawer inside were hanging file folders tax returns bills receipts investment records he looked through those but found nothing unusual except that majeur was a good deal wealthier than he had imagined his gaze fell on a tab on which was written phone receipts just what he was looking for croaker took out the folder and leafed through it the house had three phone lines nothing surprising in that given its owners profession then he saw the current bill for the private cell number majeur had given him it was sent to majeur and contained a notation that it had been paid by check the notation gave the check number and the date it had been paid croaker looked at the months previous bill and the one before that they were the samebilled to and paid for by marcellus rojas diego majeur there was a ghost in the machine on one point at least antonio had got it right everyone was lying to croaker even computers but then computers were dispassionate they merely displayed data programmed by humans and data could be altered croaker felt almost lightheaded according to the records hed found bennie wasnt paying majeurs cell phone bill as the bell south records showed that meant bennie hadnt lied to him about knowing majeur everything croaker had learned about bennie from the computer floppy disk was now suspect but if his involvement in the actf was a lieif all the documentation about sero had been planted by antonio and heitorwhat was bennie planning to do at midnight tonight at precisely the same moment that juan garcia barbacena was arriving in miami why did he need the captain sumo it was almost pm when croaker pulled up to estrella leyess house in el portal through the front windows he could see the blue flicker of the tv set pablo leyes watching espn next door sonias house was dark and still for a time croaker stood beside the nightblooming jasmine the sensuous perfume wafted in waves from the white starlike blossoms in the gathered shadows he seemed part of the street as essential to this block as the big old lemon tree that shaded the east side of sonias house he listened to the palm fronds clatter in the night wind and imagined it was the sound of sonias voice he wanted to hear her laughter to see the bright glint of her eyes in candlelight he wanted to punish the men who had denied her a chance at life that they were the same men who had injured rachel seemed cruel beyond any compromise he knew there would come a time when he would meet antonio and heitor for the final time he could feel it like an ache deep in his bones there would be no half measures no question of surrender there could only be vengeance and death goaded into motion by such turbulent emotion he strode through the glow of a streetlight coming home should never involve so much pain and suffering he thought the leyess front door was wide open so that what little breeze blew across the block could cool the house through the screen door the noise from inside drowned out even the most industrious insects drone according to the hyperbolic announcer the vaunted argentine soccer team was on the march a blade of glimmering blue light brilliant as a spark from an arc welders torch spilled across the porch like a beckoning finger a large moth was stuck on the screen door as if with a dab of mortar illuminated by an irregular patch of moonlight its pale speckled wings seemed made of the same powder women applied to their cheeks the moth hung absolutely motionless as if suspended between moonlight and the void croaker moving cast his shadow and the moth a spectral shape like two hearts touching hurtled into the night croaker opened the screen door and stepped inside he saw squadrons of chanting fans as players kicked a soccer ball back and forth across the tv screen someone was sitting in a big upholstered chair glued to the action from where croaker stood he could just see the top of a mans head over the chairback it looked like pablo leyess bald dome there was a strong smell of herbs and spices and croaker was reminded of estrellas healing work with nestor sonias dancer friend a shadow fell on a section of countertop past the open arch into the kitchen it darkened a photo of a young girl amid tropical foliage no doubt estrella leyes in the jungle outside asuncion this beautiful girl stared at the observer with an uncanny prescienceas if she had already anticipated this moment in the future when she would be scrutinized by a stranger at that moment croaker would have called out but something was wrong the open front door the loudness of the tv exaggerated by the quietude of the street outside the ghostly shadow in the kitchen croaker was struck by the eerie sense that the flickering images on the screen were spewing their hightension energy into a static room he stared at the back of the chair he recalled the first rime he had seen psycho there was a scene near the end where marion crane goes up to the attic of the bates house and turns the rocking chair around revealing the mummified corpse of norman batess mother up until then you were sure mrs bates was alive because norman periodically talked to her in that moment everything was revealed her death and normans madness after finding human heads in refrigerators and office shelves it took little imagination to picture another corpse watching soccer with filmedover eyes but if pablo leyes was dead whose shadow ebbed and flowed in the kitchen croaker touched the soulcatcher at the bottom of his pocket he made his decision to move and in that moment a voice said mr croaker an unexpected pleasure the chair swiveled around and pablo leyes smiled dont be startled son he hooked an enormous spatulate thumb back over his shoulder i saw your reflection in the tv screen his bald head distorted the hectic tv images into strange bursts of light like constellations on a planetariums ceiling croaker relaxed dropping his hand to his side i hope you dont mind the intrusion but its important i see you leyes beamed hell son with a request like that youre welcome day or night he stroked the meat of his arm seems its been forever since i was important enough for someone to come see me after hours he gestured you want a drinkanything theres some of estrellas killer paella she can heat up just take a minute thank you but no i have very little time time enough to sit though he waited while croaker perched on the arm of a tatty sofa now whats so pressing son i remembered youd worked for southern bell leyes nodded thats right lineman those were the days let me tell you like a damn cowboy ride them poles yahoo but you worked as a supervisor as well leyess watery eyes clouded over for as long as i could stand it which wasnt all that long im no damn paper pusher make book on it croaker hunched forward i need some info on how someone could break into the southern bell computer system hack it you mean leyes face twisted up hell son i could do it from here with my notebook computer he squinted up at croaker that what you want to do make a little mischief at my old alma mater he seemed intrigued by the idea excited even id like to get in croaker said several days ago i logged on using a police access code couldnt hack it with that let me tell you no i know thats why im here croaker had to raise his voice over the frenzied soundtrack from the tv someone had scored a goal i got some info from the southern bell system that i now suspect is false id like you to check it out if you would leyes grinned hell son nothing would give me greater pleasure he pulled his wheelchair into view and croaker got the wheelchair into position thats right now give me a lift into the saddle he lifted himself out of the upholstered chair with his massive arms croaker took hold of him under his armpits and he flopped into the leather wheelchair seat with the solid thwack of a deepwater fish landing on a boat deck make yourself to home he called as he propelled himself out of the living room and down the hall to the rear of the house estrellas in the kitchen ill be back with the hardware in a couple minutes in the kitchen a large iron skillet was on the stove it was filled with vegetables and herbs slowly sauteing next to it a wooden chopping board was covered with saladromaine lettuce cucumbers coriander croaker didnt see estrella the back door was open she must have taken the garbage out he pushed through the screen door stood on the small concrete stoop waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark thick swaths of blackgreen tree hibiscus blotted out the moon and bougainvillea draped like bunting crickets and tree frogs chirruped in the still soupy air mrs leyes a sound from the rank of three galvanized steel garbage cans drew him down off the stoop his footsteps were silent in the grass and loamy mulch beneath the trees he found her crouched with her back against the middle garbage can her elbows were on her drawnup knees her wrists crossed one over the other it was a kind of meditative pose a serene state but altogether too fixed when he knelt down beside her he saw that her lips had been sewn shut her eyes were open staring at the swaths of bougainvillea by dawn tomorrow they would be reborn in all their magnificent colors estrella leyes would never see it he placed two fingers on her carotid artery no pulse he took out a pocket knife and carefully slipped the blade between her lips this close he could see the neat sutures applied through her flesh with a surgeons artful precision no beads of blood oozed around the punctures which meant her mouth had been stitched shut after she died the moment he cut the sutures her lower jaw dropped open her mouth was filled with small smooth stones dark and wet with her saliva a drool of it dripped onto her chest where a dark stain slowly spread around the black hilt of a chefs knife what section of blade croaker could see was mossy with coriander croaker wiped away the sudden sweat on his face with the back of his hand he launched himself up in three strides he was back on the stoop and through the screen door the cooking smells once so delicious now seemed cloying they followed him down the hall he walked in absolute silence as stone tree had taught him rolling his soles from heel to toe his weight evenly balanced on the outside of his feet he went into each doorway he passed to the right was a tiled bath pristine white smelling of sandalwood across from it on the left was a small study with a daybed a cheap desk and a sisal rug the color of burnt toffee farther along on the left was the master bedroom decorated in rose and offwhite the last door on the right was closed he put his ear to the door heard nothing turning the knob he unlatched the door then taking a step back he kicked it open he found himself in a large room it was obviously a new addition because it was unfinished wallboard taped at the seams was still unpainted the floor was unsanded wood spattered with dollops of chalk white spackle and black pencil notations as to window measurements the single piece of furniture was a green metal desk piled with computers modems software packages and instruction manuals from a hole in the ceiling a single wire dangled attached to a brown plastic fixture and a bare bulb the bulb however was not the source of illumination a small fire flickered in a rough stone vessel that sat on the floor by its light he saw the crocodile it was an evillooking reptile horned and scaled a prehistoric predator that considered man fair game it crouched in the corner of the room its small amber eyes glowed as it tracked croakers movement its thickly armored tail flicked in warning its black lips pulled back from yellow incisors and it hissed low in its throat as its heavily muscled body tensed croaker saw pablo leyes he lay on his left side his wheelchair upended and partially on top of him someoneor somethinghad taken an enormous bite out of him it looked as if his spine had been severed croaker took a step in his direction and the croc shot forward its great gray jaws opened then snapped shut with the report of a rifle shot croaker leapt back someone chuckled cuidado seor have a care he will kill you if you give him half a chance someone stepped out of the shadows cloaking the right side of the room besides leyes is dead take it from me a square white bandage covered the center of his face heitor christ what have you done here last night i dreamt i was all alone heitor said in a starry sky i floated tumbling helpless i looked at those stars but they were so far away their light failed to illuminate me their gravity failed to hold me then i awoke and seor i knew in my heart i had dreamt about you heitor clucked his tongue reprovingly but this isnt your dream i have the ability to choose croaker was in a semicrouch and i say to hell with your laws as if it were following the conversation the crocs huge head swiveled around then youll die seor as surely as estrella and pablo died there was something obscene about heitor referring to his victims by their christian names it suggested an unspeakable intimacy but you wont kill me now heitor not yet youll wait until i put a bullet through juan garcia barbacenas brain barbacenas name seemed to send heitor into a frenzy i should be the one to kill him his eyes blazed as he thumped his chest it isnt right ive known that from the beginning madre de mentiras this way is too damned civilized time and again i told antonio a shit like barbacena doesnt deserve a clean death he should be allowed to see oblivion approaching slowlyhe pointed with two fingers here in my eyes and it should be done in accordance with heta i dont try that with me croaker said heta i is a healing art you and antonio twisted it perverted it into something bestial and evil he swept his arm in an arc just look around you estrella was the healer and you killed her theres no healing here only sickness and death heitors extreme agitation had brought blood to his face a red stain seeped through the bandage over his nose he crouched down next to the croc see what becomes of your plans to civilize us croaker felt his heart skip a beat either heitor was mad or he was talking to the crocodile the croc grinned simply by dint of keeping its jaws shut its amber eyes glowed with singular malevolence as its mailed tail slammed against the wall wallboard shattered and dried spackle rose in the air in a miniature mushroom cloud heitor dont talk to me heitor cried tell it to antonio antonio isnt here heitor patience was required now croaker knew its just us chickens and the ghosts of the people youve murdered heitor put his hand over the flames that rose from the stone vessel sorcerers are capable of many things seor if you were born in asuncion you would know if your veins flowed with guarani blood you would understand he lowered his hand as he did so the crocodiles eyes turned to slits transformation is one of the foundations of heta i the sorcerer is consumed by fire and remains unmarked his hand plunged into the fire the cuff of his shirt blazed the smells of burning cotton and crisped human hair were suddenly strong in the room heitor made a fist as the flames spread up his arm the spark and crackle of the burning fabric seemed as loud as a forest fire his lips curled back from his teeth and now croaker heard an eerie sound it seemed like chanting heitor stood as the flames curled across his chest and back like a living serpent his shirt turning black disappearing in small tufts of smoke broke apart at the shoulders hanging down in sparking tatters then heitor opened his clenched fist hi it were three dark stones the crocodiles eyes opened the flames glimmered and died as if doused by wind and rain heitor smiled he pointed to the crocodile the sorcerer becomes an animal in order to drink the blood of his enemies and remain strong and virile so that even the passing years cannot touch him seor these are truths i tell you he tore off what remained of his ruined shirt and threw it on the floor here you see the truth but your mind wont accept it heitor was not entirely correct croaker was thinking of humait milagros who bennie was sure had been reincarnated as a tiger shark bennie milagros isnt paying for majeurs cell phone majeur himself is croaker said but you wanted me to think otherwise you wanted to pit me against bennie to cut me off from everyone and everything why for the same reason i killed pablo and estrella heitor said man is a social creature daily he draws on the resources around him heitor said in crises he will seek the assistance of those closest to him it was astonishing there wasnt a mark on him it never fails this part of human nature like a vine seeking the rough bole of a tree the fire might have seared off his hair but it had left his flesh unmarked you see seor a man is understood only when he stands alone finally the last layers of civilization are stripped away what is revealed is the essence this is a commodity most rare precious and beautiful it is to be savored like a magnificent cigar heitor laughed as he did so the crocs jaws gaped open for a mad instant it appeared as if the laughter were emanating from the reptile you do not understand seor the leyes they would have helped you they did before now we are in a new phase of the game you are alone even before he had finished speaking croaker was on the move with his biomechanical hand he ripped the wire from the ceiling at the same time he slammed his left foot down on the top of the crocodiles snout the teeth clashed together with a ferocious clang he whipped the wire around the jaws lashing them tightly and securely together with a thiefs knot the beast thrashed beneath croakers shoe but could do no damage with an incoherent roar heitor rushed croaker without seeming to move at all croaker slammed the heel of his biomechanical hand into heitors broken nose heitor screamed and fell to the floor as if poleaxed blood spurted from the ruptured wound croaker kicked him hard in the soft spot just beneath the lowest rib and heitor fetched up against the corner where the crocodile had first crouched he was out cold bending down croaker took hold of heitor by his hair and dragged him back down the hall and into the kitchen the smell of burnt food greeted him and he took the skillet off the burner as he passed the stove dropping heitor in the center of the floor croaker went to the refrigerator and took out a tray full of ice he stripped heitors trousers to his knees then applied the ice to his testicles heitor awoke with a start and a little scream croaker knelt putting all his weight on the knee that pressed against heitors sternum hola heitor he said then he reached up turned up the flame on the burner he extruded a stainless steel nail from the end of one biomechanical finger and let it heat up in the gas flame looking into heitors amber eyes croaker said i knew a guy once called himself charcoal man charcoal man worked the cityconey island the east village fortysecond street wherever tourists hung out and the cops wouldnt bother him he would eat fire hed run a burning torch up and down his bare arm then hed set himself on fire thats the kind of thing youve got to admit really gets a crowd going croakers nail glowed red and he studied it meditatively so i guess by your standards this guy was a sorcerer croaker smiled without warmth only i knew his tricks heitor how he coated his mouth and throat how he rubbed his arms with a vaselinebased ointment how he prepared his whole body so he wouldnt be roasted alive the glowing nail made a curved shadow over heitors face sorcerer trickster i guess its just a matter of semantics croaker moved the redhot fingernail so heitor could feel its heat like the sole plate of an iron now here is what i want to know heitor i want the truth about bennies sister rosa what were the circumstances of her death heitors amber eyes looked beyond the nail to croakers face there was blood all over his puffy cheeks and lips and ugly bruises were forming beneath his eyes what do you imagine maricone that i will shudder in fear and vomit up my soul to you merely because you order it no heitor i expect nothing from you from his pocket croaker extracted humaits spiritstone he saw heitors eyes open wide as he pressed it into the hollow of the slim mans throat ack heitors jaws worked spastically acckkk now croaker said softly tell me what i want to know tell me about rosa milagros for a moment nothing happened then it seemed as if the amber color drained from heitors eyes they appeared as transparent as windows i spit on the woman heitor hissed i curse her in whatever hell she finds herself why croaker asked what did she ever do to you before she came antonio and i were mokoi mokoi croaker repeated whats that the bond between twins it is special it is sacred the bitch rosa ripped us apart like a doctor prematurely drags a fetus from the womb his face twisted in rage and in his maniacal thrashing he almost unseated croakers knee it was a violation an abomination i could not allow it illumination flooded croaker so antonio had told the truth about his love for rosa this revelation was so astonishing that for the moment croaker did not know what to make of it you killed rosa he whispered she loved him she said she could smell the stink of corruption on him she said she could save him she said the spiritstone was leaching the memory out of heitor like blood from a stone in his agony he was only peripherally aware of croaker she seduced him drew him away from mokoi the us that had been the us that was our foundation the basis of life itself she destroyed i thought after i kill her it will be all right mokoi will return it will be as it always had been between antonio and myself droplets of blood flew as he shook his head dead wrong she reached out from beyond the grave and the gulf between antonio and me only grew deeper antonio knew what i had done in that first moment when he discovered her body i believed he was actually going to kill me i could see it in his eyes a twin knows but he couldnt do it we are of the same womb of the same moment birth and death antonio remembered that in time but there was punishment to come like a woman in a jealous rage he withheld mokoi the soul of one twin cannot meet the other unless both are willing from that time our special bond was severed croaker pressed the spiritstone more firmly into heitors flesh now i want to know about bennie whats your connection with him heitors eerily transparent eyes seemed fixed on a point not in space but in time it has to do with the bones of course we want the bones everyone does what bones that will be enough a new voice commanded croaker turned to see antonio coming down the hallway he filled the open archway to the kitchen looked past croaker to his prone and bloody twin there is quite enough of a mess as it is without adding more his amber eyes flicked back to croaker get off him seor i beg of you he said this in a soft almost paternal voice tinged with what could only be called profound sadness croaker did not move antonio dressed in an oyster gray linen suit held the length of wire croaker had used to bind the crocodiles snout as a cowboy holds his coiled lasso there was no sign of the reptile however a curious red welt ran across the bridge of antonios nose down both cheeks and beneath his jaw it was as if he had been bound by the wire croaker dismissed the thought as he palmed the spiritstone so antonio wouldnt see it antonios expression hardened and he said i do not repeat myself seor do as i have said or suffer the consequences with the spiritstone taken away color was flooding back into heitors eyes the flux of full consciousness transfigured the pupils i am not afraid antonio croaker said but you and heitor should be ive come for you he placed his glowing nail against heitors right cheek antonio jumped at the same instant his twin did seor you do not know there was a searing hiss a sickly sweet smell that clung to the back of the throat heitor screamed he thrashed and moaned but he could not dislodge croaker so much for sorcery the dark stones know croaker sheathed his nail what remained on heitors cheek was a deep red wound that seeped blood he looked up at antonio now he carries my mark it will serve to remind you both there was a sudden fierce gust of wind that took croakers breath away he must have blacked out for a moment because he next found himself against the refrigerator door three feet from where heitor lay his back ached as if he had slammed into the fridge antonio was now standing between him and heitor antonio stood over croaker trembling with barely suppressed rage remember i told you that you were an exception because you hadnt sinned now that has changed pobre poor soul the world is like blood always fluid always changing friendships form dissolve the only truism in life is that you can hold on to nothing there was that sadness again tingeing his face as well as his voice you should not have harmed heitor look what hes done here hes like a rabid dog croaker struggled to his feet with great difficulty his legs felt like their bones had turned to liquid outrage threatened to close his throat for gods sake he murdered rosa he grabbed onto the refrigerator handle to hold himself steady why do you continue to defend him why do you think hes damned you antonio you said it yourself croaker was desperately stalling for time while he tried to regain his strength what the hell had happened to him held l something antonio had done to him had robbed him of energy face it mokoi is gone whatever it was that linked you two that made you special no longer exists yo tengo la sarten por el mango im running the show leave now antonios face was flushed with blood if you harbor any hope of saving your niece seor walk out of here and dont look back stalemate for now thats the best he could expect croaker knew with rachels life hanging in the balance he had no other choice and antonio knew it but as soon as barbacena was dead as soon as majeur confirmed the kill the kidney would be released and jenny could do her thing then the rules would change then would come the final reckoning est terminado del todo it is over between us seor the friendship now we are mortal enemies comprende after midnight who can say what will transpire the federates want you and they are abetted by the police for you there will be nowhere to hide in the living room the soccer match was over according to the announcer something called the extreme games was about to begin antonios mocking voice stopped croaker at the front door digame seor sonia or vonda lets have your best guess which onedonated her kidney so your niece might survive accompanied by antonios soft laughter croaker stumbled blindly outside at the curb he hung on to the mustang but it did no good the rich sweet smell of the nightblooming jasmine made him violently sick day five an oppressive wind was blowing in off the ocean it had an evil smell as if it had churned up all the sins that had been buried for centuries in the ocean floor croaker crouched on the rooftop of the threestory building on washington and ninth opposite the vegetarian restaurant an chay could feel the pressure drop thickening clouds were already so low the aquamarine and marlin blue neon lights of the deco building facades were hazed in eerie halos a storm was on its way stone tree would know how fast it would make landfall and how bad it would be meanwhile the sobe nightlife wasnt missing a beat cool music poured like syrup into the humid air hot cars paraded by girls and boys spangled in tropical colors mingled every which way for them it was a night like any other but somewhere not far from here juan garcia barbacena was arriving was it by private plane that had touched down or maybe by boat outside the threemile limit maybe bennie was pulling alongside in his midnight blue cigarette which scenario was the right one croaker didnt know just as he didnt know whether bennie was friend or foe thirtythree minutes after midnight and counting croaker rechecked the steyr and the harris bipod he took another look through the swarsky scope made some minor adjustments and got used to looking at the environment in the flat two dimensions of the scopes viewing circle satisfied he put the rifle aside and relaxed come what may he was ready he picked up the zeiss night owl scanned the street below using binoculars very quickly taught you the value of patience with the field of vision so limited if you panned too quickly you were sure to miss something significant also there was a rhythm thirty seconds scrutinizing the environment looking for the target ten seconds relaxing otherwise eye fatigue would set in and again you risked missing an important element croaker watched the young faces coming and going animated by a couple of beers a few joints and the anticipation of sex he remembered those days when the summers seemed endless and the word future held no meaning summers made him think of fishing fishing made him think of bennie who was bennie milagros anyway a pal or a government operative leading a secret life funny croaker thought either way i miss him instinct drove croaker to take up the binoculars and scan washington avenue in front of an chay like all street scenes it had changed but stayed the same different people same basic configuration except except for the young man lounging against the fender of a black mercedes convertiblethe new one blunt and boxy ugly as sin he wore a lightweight armani suit and italian loafers his hair was long slicked back off his wide forehead when he crossed his arms across his chest croaker could see the muscles stretching the fabric using the young man as a focal point croaker tracked slowly in each direction just to the left he found two more young musclemen there were three to the right they had just emerged from a mercedes sedan also black a second black mercedes sedan was parked around the corner on ninth street croaker began looking for the gray rollsroyce at that moment he heard a sound behind him it was a tiny noise not more than what an old door might make if it was pushed open a crack he heard it distinctly just the same nerves heightened tension created greater acuity of the senses it was instinctive part of the primitive animal defense mechanism that had survived centuries of increasing civilization he swung the steyr around half expecting to confront one of barbacenas security entourage instead he saw majeur coming toward him in a halfcrouch someone was with him his heart almost stopped it was jenny majeur what the hell dyou think youre doing he was furious in a couple of minutes this will be a red zone get her out of here lew please listen jenny said urgently jenny what about rachel how could you leave her now lew please believe me shes in good hands i handpicked a team to watch over her but she doesnt have you the sharpness in his voice surprised croaker afraid for rachels life and jennys safety he turned to look down at washington avenue here came the gray rolls oh my god he thought were all fucked now you promised youd be there when the kidney arrived majeur inched forward sir i would not have brought her unless lew for gods sake shut up both of you the steyr balanced against his chest on the harris bipod already felt like an old and trusted friend ive got a job to do despite whats going on here rachel has to be saved thats the only thing that matters dont you see thats why ive come jenny was just behind him he could feel the heat of her body the smell of her the rolls had blackedout windows and three stubby antennas what did he have in there besides cell phones a portable computer hooked up to the world wide web and the internet the rollssrreetside rear door was opening barbacenas men were clustered around the car like the praetorian guard he was coming croaker leveled the steyr gaining the angle he wanted the steyr was equipped with two triggers one behind the other the front trigger required a standard vpound pull the one behind was a hair trigger needing only vi pound of pressure to fire the rifle then he heard jenny whispering in his ear majeur came to see rachel thats where i met him i told him what id found because id been trying to call you croaker curled his forefinger around the front trigger i turned it off the last thing i need is my cell phone ringing now a woman was emerging from the rolls tall and slim and oriental she was dressed in a sea green shantung silk suit the thai food taster i made majeur bring me i told you that i wasnt going to stand idly by i had some ideas of my own after hearing your evidence against stansky i got to thinking what caused rachels acute renal shutdown stansky knew her history he was poisoning her by reintroducing the sepsis into her ivs and i thought what if they had poisoned rachel in the beginning the street was crawling with security barbacenas goons had begun to fan out methodically and systematically sectoring the immediate area but jenny had caught croakers attention at last poisoned it was as if a great ray of light revealed a hidden shape in the shadows now he understood the significance of the bonitas owning the boneyard rachel didnt od on the drug cocktail the bonitas had poisoned her but so what he was still caught in the awful vise he had to kill barbacena to save rachels life across the street the thai taster was talking to one of the security goons then she bent down apparently delivering a message to someone still inside the rolls barbacena the thai taster said something to the goon and he ordered two men into the restaurant the thai taster stepped away from the rolls a figure was emerging black elephantskin loafers black tropicalweight linen suit white voile silk bandcollared shirt a flash of gold at his wrist as he put a hand on the roof of the rolls croaker recognized him immediately juan garcia barbacena the target croaker pulled the front trigger cocking the action then moved his hand backward he rested his forefinger lightly on the hair trigger now only the slightest squeeze was all that stood between the target and oblivion he felt jennys hand on his back and tried not to react to it this is why i had to come to stop you rachel was poisoned along with the drugs youd expect to find her blood showed traces of ethylene glycol byproducts with barbacenas head squarely in the scopes sights croaker froze ethylene glycol thats antifreeze right jenny said its also an almost perfect poison its odorless tasteless and you only need to ingest three ounces put it in a soda or coffee and shed never know with rachels drug history plus the fact she only had one kidney they were betting it would go undetected and they were right the thai taster was on the sidewalk barbacena was turning away from the building where they all crouched in a moment he would disappear through the doorway to an chay and the opportunity would be lost forever barbacenas face hung as large as a full moon in front of him he steeled his finger against the hair trigger for the last time he took a deep breath let it out slowly and evenly when it was all gone his finger would tighten against the hair trigger and barbacena would hit the pavement with half a head what good does knowing this do me he said except to make me hate the bonitas all the more ive put her on a treatment protocol jenny rushed on urgently ethanol iv which will slow the formation of glycolic acid and were continuing to flush her kidney croaker eased his finger off the hair trigger what dyou mean the breakdown products mustve damaged her kidney but they didnt destroy it there is damage to the renal tubules but the human body is a marvelous machine once we flush the glycolic acid from her system theyll regenerate in a matter of months her kidney will be rehabilitated she gripped his shoulders do you understand lew rachel doesnt need the transplant you dont have to go through with this hellish bargain through the swarsky scope croaker watched the thai taster precede juan garcia barbacena into the restaurant they vanished from his view like game fish briefly seen plunging into the depths of the ocean he put the steyr aside and sat down on the roof so its over he felt as if he weighed a thousand pounds coming so close to killing someone in cold blood was like standing at the edge of an abyssonce you took the next step you had no idea how far you would fall now to be able to back away was a relief almost too intense to absorb croakers head was buzzing with an excess of adrenaline why didnt you discover this poisoning before jenny sitting beside him said softly we were going on basic assumptions rachel had a great deal of controlled substances in her system she was a chronic drug abuser she was in acute renal shutdown a girl of her age what else could we think she never took her gaze off croakers face but then i had the blood samples id taken from her for my drug abuse study medevaced to me and i took a long hard look at them there was no reason for us to have done so earlier because we were looking for a drug od and thats exactly what we found the circumstances and the symptomology were absolutely consistent we would have seen the ethylene glycol in a minute had we done a kidney biopsy but rachels condition was already too critical to even consider such an invasive test however when i analyzed the blood id drawn from her for my research program i saw it was highly acidic ethylene glycol itself is more or less harmless but when the body starts to break it down you get glycolic acid which is terribly destructive we were lucky on two counts because she only has one kidney they needed to use a minimum dose to cause the renal failure also the dialysis was the best thing we could have done for her because it kept the kidney flushed if not for the sepsis stansky introduced she might have begun to recover by now croaker took her hand it was incredibly brave of you to come here and not as foolhardy as you thought she gave him a smile it was a gamble croaker looked past her to where majeur was standing a slim silhouette in the misty neon glow it is ten minutes after one majeur said as he came across the roof i was scheduled to call antonio by one the latest weve got to get out of here croaker left the materials of the assassins trade where they were he had no desire to touch them again and majeur had never wanted possession of them in the first place as they walked to the rear of the roof croaker said to majeur i have some bad news the leyes are dead majeur stopped in his tracks a strong gust of wind ruffled his hair and blew open his jacket ay de mi estrella croaker nodded heitor killed them i got there too late a look like flint came into majeurs eyes it was her greatest fear but she knew one day the bonitas would come for her majeur shook his head fighting back deep emotion bennie will be sick at heart croaker took a deep breath tried to still the hammering of his heart lew jenny said whats the matter majeur looked at him seor you appear ill croaker said tell me majeur do you mean bennie milagros majeur nodded we all know each other for years sir how could it be otherwise bennie estrella antonio heitor myself humaita was the glue that bound us together you see we all grew up in his back pocket it was tragic when he was killed we all flew apart like seeds spat from a mouth croaker put a hand to his head to try to stop the sudden throbbing bennie swore to me that he didnt know you what reason would he have to lie to me majeur shook his head that i cannot say seor was bennie friend or foe croaker wondered first he and croaker were the best of buddies then it seemed as if he had a secret life with the actf it seemed as if he had used croaker but the damning information on the floppy disk that linked him to the topsecret actf operation in mexico could have been planted by the bonitas friend again and now this bennie had lied so what was true and what was false croaker had been returned to majeurs kalahari whose shifting dunes brought constantly changing fortunes where allies became enemies as easily as sand slipped between your fingers unless it was because of the bones croaker stared into majeurs face heitor had mentioned bones at the leyeses just before antonio had intervened what do you mean the bones majeur looked abruptly uneasy this is not something one easily tellsperdoname seoran outsider you see bennies grandfather was a sukia among the guarani such an extraordinary healer appears perhaps once in a mans lifetime often it is far less in any case the sukia is venerated beyond any other healer because his powers are so great when he dies it is said these extraordinary powers live on in his healing stoneshis spiritcatchers and in his bones this is why his corpse is burnt on a pyreso the bones might be cleansed of flesh and preserved majeur looked at his watch sir it is very dangerous to remain here we must leave now croaker glanced at jenny nodded in single file they went down the vertical metal ladder of the fire escape majeur went first then jenny with croaker the last off the roof on the street croaker turned to majeur what happened to humaits bones i think you can guess majeur said as they trotted toward the mustang following the funeral pyre the bones disappeared they were stolen croaker unlocked the door and they piled insidejenny in the front passengers seat majeur in back do you know by whom i have no proof majeur settled himself in the backseat but it seemed clear to me that it must have been heitor and antonio they coveted humaits power they killed him why would they do that unless they could take his power and keep it like lightning in a bottle croaker thought of the extreme secrecynot to mention urgencyof bennies request to made a sea rendezvous at midnight on the captain sumo as he fired up the ignition he said majeur how did barbacena arrive in miami by plane or by boat boat majeur said a plane would have been too insecure but the boat would not have landed again too much risk a launch would have been sent out to get him and his people is that what bennie had tried to inveigle out of croaker a means of transport for barbacena but nothing about bennie and barbacena made sense according to rafe roubinnet bennie wanted barbacena dead because barbacena had murdered theresa marquesa barbacena the daughter of bennies mentor then why had bennie allowed barbacena to gain such an exalted position in latin america why hadnt bennie sought revenge before this once again croaker felt himself enmeshed in a web of lies who could he trust jenny surelyand rafe most likely majeur but beyond that he could be sure of no one not even ross darling government agents invariably had their own agendas private bureaucratic skirmishes they were bent on winning darling was no different ill be damned croaker thought if ill let myself be a pawn in the insane war between him and spaulding gunn he turned the corner onto washington avenue up ahead was an chay where juan garcia barbacena was contentedly earing his vegetarian dinner before his meeting with gunn croaker could imagine the scene the goons stationed at the four corners of the room the thai taster in her sea green shantung suit daintily nibbling at each dish as it came steaming from the kitchen and barbacena famished from his journey digging in with a macho gusto even this far away the mustang rocked crazily on its shocks croaker slammed on the brakes as the restaurants windows blew out and debris from its interior hurtled into the street christ majeur cried a bomb and croaker thought heitor he didnt trust me to get the job done and he was right he had his own plan going jenny was already out the mustangs door croaker shouted after her to stay put then raced after her passing the mercedes convertible the blast had blown it over on its side fortunately its steel frame had acted like a shield to protect the slowmoving traffic on washington and the pedestrians across the street still kids sat on the sidewalk or stood dazed hands to their heads smoke streamed from the rippedopen restaurant as if that was a kind of signal someone started screaming crowds were forming with alarming speed soon croaker knew it would be impossible to get away in the mustang he saw jenny kneeling beside a young girl whod been caught in the welter of flying glass and wood shards and he ran to help her jenny was cradling her head talking to her as she worked to stanch the flow of blood and assess the severity of her wounds croaker did as jenny directed him ripping clothing into makeshift tourniquets moving the less severely wounded away from the smoke fire and debris as he and jenny reached another body he heard the first sirens they were coming at speed croaker felt a chill go through him even with this kind of chaos he couldnt afford to be here when the cops arrived jenny he said christ jenny weve got to get out of here she turned to him she was spattered with blood he opened his mouth to say something but her expression stopped him lew i know you cant stay the sirens were louder now the cops are coming and i know theyre looking for you but im a doctor and there are people here who need me i have a duty he looked down at the bloody young girl they were tending and nodded go on she pushed him sternly away but he could see tears glittering in the corners of her eyes jenn i she brushed past him continuing to tend to the wounded the siren was drawing closer majeur had wormed his way past them he was now standing quite near the gaping entrance to the burntout restaurant croaker called to him majeur what the hell are you doing get away from there not yet seor i must find out what happened in there flames licked and curled and the oily smoke had thickened there was a terrible sweetish stink in the air that could only come from one source incinerated human beings what happened croaker shouted ill tell you what happened barbacena and his entire cast of characters are dead look at it in there majeur its like a blast furnace no one could have survived majeur one hand shielding his face moved closer peering into the smoke and flamefilled interior there is a back entrance perhaps they had some forewarning perhaps some of them escaped youre insane croaker moved to go after majeur more sirens screamed in the night to croaker they sounded like the howling of hunting dogs whod caught the scent of their prey at the edge of the blistered interior majeur paused and looked back at croaker madre de dios seor ўvamos the cops are only seconds away im not going to let you get caught in there croaker said all right majeur nodded but to be safe wait for me in the car give me three minutes seor i beg of you i must do this his gaze shifted as the first of the police patrol cars screeched to a halt at the edge of the growing throng for favor seor la pelota est aun en el tejado the game isnt over yet croaker watched jenny talking to the wounded and dazed victims while she worked on them with tenderness and efficiency she had the true gift of the healer it was as if there was an aura around her that eased peoples pain and stilled their terror he made his way through the thickening crowd toward the mustang he had to fight like a salmon swimming upstream everyone else was pushing relentlessly toward the locus of the bomb blast back inside the mustang he turned the ignition to make sure he wasnt wedged in by traffic he had to drive up onto the sidewalk facing away from the site of the disaster he turned around staring through the rear window at the chaos more patrol cars their lights flashing had drawn up uniformed cops were making their way to the scene others were working crowd control still others were assisting the first of the emergency medical people who had arrived in ambulances croaker could see jenny hard at work an ems paramedic knelt beside her she spoke to him gesturing and he nodded they rose and she took him on a brief tour of her makeshift triage area he called for the folding gurneys to take the most seriously wounded away fire engines screamed their entrance and now more of the cops were needed to clear a path for the firefighters lugging hoses connections were made to hydrants and the water was turned on soon the bomb squad would arrive where the hell was majeur croaker wondered he had less than a minute to get out of the interior before he was caught by the first contingent of firefighters in hreretardant gear and the vanguard of police in response to all this heightened activity the crowd surged forward now at its periphery near the blackened front of an chay croaker saw majeur emerge he looked past the oncoming rescue teams trying to pick out the turquoise mustang croaker opened the door stood on the floor rim and lifted his biomechanical hand it reflected the revolving lights back at majeur majeurs face lit up when he saw croaker and he began to make his way out of the interior it was then that croaker saw heitor emerge like a wraith from the crowd his twicebroken nose was still bandaged but the laceration croaker had made in his cheek was barea clean red steak glistening with unguent croaker shouted and pointed at heitor majeur unaware waved back then heitor was beside him got you maricone croaker could read heitors lips majeur started turned and heitors right arm moved from a distance it seemed as innocent a gesture as one man shaking anothers hand but then croaker caught a quick metallic flash as the scalpel blade buried itself in majeurs side croaker was off and running toward the bombedout restaurant majeurs eyes opened wide and his lips pulled back from his teeth as if he had eaten something very sweet he staggered but heitor ever helpful kept him on his feet croaker hit the outer shell of the crowd and was slowed to a crawl no avid onlooker seemed inclined to let him through he was obliged to claw and muscle people aside to ignore curses wild punches and kicks in order to make any progress at all up ahead heitor acting like a good samaritan hustled majeur away from the rescue crew they raced by him spreading out into the interior as the hoses were brought up heitor brought majeur to the periphery of this activity and gently almost lovingly lay majeur onto the sidewalk helplessly croaker watched him twist the scalpel trying to get through the intercostal cartilage between majeurs ribs and find the heart croaker was close enough to gain a better view of heitor but still too far away to be able to intervene as he continued to squirm his way through the melee he watched heitors head swivel like a dog on point heitor rose and began to move through the triage area as if he were invisible no one noticed him or asked his business there either they were all too busy or hed worked some hetd i spell he moved slowly methodically as if he were in no hurry at last he came to where jenny was working on a young girl with bad burns he stood behind her gazing down at her meditatively then he turned as if with uncanny knowledge he looked right at croaker for a split instant the whole world ceased to exist an enigmatic smile transformed heitors lips and he turned back to the work at hand croaker frantic did everything but hurl people from his path but he was trapped in the terrible surge of the crowd dense sweaty keyed to the excitement of the moment they had merged into a solid body that gave but did not break he saw heitor standing over jenny backlit by the smoke and fire heitors curling coppercolored hair appeared to be made of flames croaker shouted but to no avail he clawed and elbowed his way forward in time to see heitors hands closing around the back of jennys neck didnt anyone notice couldnt they see what was going to happen this was heitors revenge to murder jenny in front of croakers eyes heitors right hand touched the side of jennys neck his left hand seemed to stroke her hair jennys head turned to look up she saw heitors battered face which was what he wanted he stared down at her she stiffened as his grip strengthened croaker struggled in his agonizing trap she was going to die and there wasnt anything he could do about it no he screamed no antonio at heitors side took hold of his brothers wrists antonio like heitor before him had appeared like smoke out of nowhere heitors head whipped around and he screamed antonio shook his head firmly his whole body stiffened and heitor released jenny croaker broke through the inner ring at last racing past a fat man and a pair of bodybuilders but the bonitas were gone swallowed up in the chaos of the surging throng croaker took three steps toward jenny before his way was blocked by two uniformed cops sorry bud one said youre off limits step back sir the other uniform said professional personnel are taking care of everyone croaker took a step forward and the second uniform put his hand out i said step back sir his other hand had gone to the butt of his holstered service revolver croaker paused gazing over the uniforms shoulder he saw jenny tending to an open wound in a victim on a folding gurney he craned his neck saw that it was majeur accompanied by one of the ems paramedics guiding the gurney she passed within the protective semicircle of cops on crowd control still tending to majeur she climbed into the back of an ambulance as the driver slid it inside the paramedic jumped in after her the driver climbed behind the wheel and the ambulance took off croaker relaxed at least she was safe from heitor he began to back off the last thing he needed now was a confrontation with the police hey wait a minute the first uniform said i think i seen this guy ray didnt his photo come over the apb wire couple hours ago you think ray suspicious unsnapped the guard strap on his holster as he drew his service revolver croaker ducked away eeling into the crowd hey he heard the first uniform shout hey you stop it was easier to move away from the locus of interest because every spot he vacated allowed someone to step closer people were happy to let him through he took a circuitous route back to the mustang he fired the ignition slammed it in gear and drove off down the sidewalk until he was clear of the traffic tieup then he floored the accelerator as he headed away from the an chay bombing he plucked out his cell phone punched in a number when he heard the familiar voice in his ear he felt his heart skip a beat stone tree had said to him when it comes to people you must stand aside from anger antipathy and fear these emotions dog the senses when you feel them you cannot experience the tightness of the situation on the contrary every thing seems wrong and you take action from that false reading hey bennie ive missed the hell outa you lewis listen about what happened in the hospitalwe have to talk about that croaker said as he zipped around a ford sedan he reaccelerated somethings changed you wanta talk about it now lots croaker said for one thing theres an apb out for me say what croaker listening carefully heard the sharp note of surprise in bennies voice but was it genuine there was a gamble he was going to have to take also i know why you wanted me and the captain sumo he ran a light on the amber turned west bennie did you get them get what a certain wariness had slipped into bennies tone the bones bennie bones what the hell you talking about dont bullshit me your grandfathers bones thats what its all about isnt it this bad blood between you and the bonitas they murdered humait then stole his bones after he was cremated youve been trying to get them back from heitor and antonio right you must be cracked why would i care about a pile of bones because all your grandfathers hetd i powerall thats left of himhis entire legacyis in them like living marrow silence on the line croaker crossed the macarthur causeway gaining the mainland the highrise skyline of miami loomed in front of him and memories of his nearfatal encounter at the brickell bridge at length bennie said who the hellve you been talking to people you apparently didnt want me speaking to croaker could hear bennie take an audible breath you know amigo youre right we do have to talk right fucking now where are you croaker told him good bennie said im in the glades not so far away get your anglo ass over to flamingo pronto and amigo make damn sure you arent followed dont worry croaker said with the police apb im not likely to make a mistake see that you dont bennie said both our lives depend on it croaker took the dolphin expressway west to floridas turnpike from there he headed south to florida city a small cluster of seedy familystyle restaurants tricked out with neon and flashing lights to attract tourists heading for the keys or everglades national park after filling the mustangs gas tank he hung a right heading into the inky blackness within half a mile it seemed as if hed left all vestiges of civilization behind there were few lights and fewer structures just solitary clusters of tin shacks for migrant workers tending the crops he passed the state corrections facility three bleak miles on he was in the everglades flamingo was in the heart of the southern everglades it was just southeast of cape sable on the southern tip of the florida mainland from there fishermen naturalists and houseboaters alike had access to more than two hundred square miles of backcountry waterways mangrove swamps and buoymarked channels clear out to the keys all the way down croaker watched his rearview mirror through florida city there was plenty of traffic behind him but no cops he changed lanes frequently just the same if only out of habit he was not by nature paranoid once outside florida city the vehicles behind him were as scarce as oases in a desert their headlights shone a long way on the flat wet stretch of road hed been watching the same pair of headlights behind him for some time when he decided to pull off to the side of the road he killed the engine and the mustangs lights the vehicle was a darkcolored dodge ram truck covered with the alkali dust and pale mud of the fields it slowed as it came abreast of the mustang then pulled over just in front croaker tensed he watched the drivers door swing open a rangy man in jeans dusty boots and a weatherstained cowboy hat walked slowly over to him he was carrying a shotgun casually at his side he came up to the mustang and leaned down to the open window howdy evening there was a small uncomfortable silence while the man worked a chaw of tobacco around his mouth he peered into the mustangs interior as if looking for contraband need any help car okay everythings fine croaker said ive been driving all day i got a little tired and decided to pull over for a while the man nodded wise move dont wanna fall asleep behind the wheel specially down here nobody to come fetch ya after the car flips over you got far tgo just to the park visitors center picking up my girlfriend croaker put a sheepish look on his face we had a kind of setto couple of days back you know how it is there was another uncomfortable silence while the mans flinty eyes searched croakers face for answers to questions croaker could only guess at better git on over there the man spat a dark blob onto the ground she were my gal i wouldnt care for her bein out here at night alone just about to do that croaker said thanks the man nodded and sauntered back to his truck croaker kept track of it as he drove away about a half mile on it made a right down a side road croaker continued on to flamingo without further incident sporadic spits of rain greeted him as he drove into the national park visitors center he drove past the lodgea row of attached cabins looking very s then the restaurant now long closed for the night he rolled through the deserted parking lot onto the marinas concrete apron one light was on at the side of the activities shack behind it lights at the docks edge picked out the boats used for backcountry tours and cruises on florida and whitewater bays they lay to tied securely in their slips they were by necessity shallowdraft boats since the water rarely went deeper than five feet and was often no more than a foot or so it was a scene both serene and bucolic it reminded croaker all over again why stone tree preferred to live down here in the backcountry as he got out of the mustang a figure detached itself from the shadows of the activities shack the light illuminated bennies face he was dressed in black just like the actf agent on brickell bridge had been from his left hand dangled a pair of infrared binoculars for seeing in the dark well amigo i could hardly have anticipated this shut up muy bien i count to ten bennie took out a cigar although it was improbable hed be able to get it lighted in this wind and rain i take into account the state of your like agitation an i you know dont take offense what is that croaker asked a warning or a testimonial bennie gave an explosive laugh he rolled the unlit cigar around his mouth like it was a snickers bar youre one pissedoff hombre you know that you sure youre not latino you definitely got the temper muy caliente cut the entertainment its skin deep ive worked out enough of whats going on underneath bastard rain dribbled down croakers collar running like sweat down his spine you knew majeur you knew hed extorted me into killing barbacena and you did nothing to stop it because you wanted barbacena dead why would i want that javier marquesa he was your mentor in asuncion barbacena married his daughter and then murdered her knowledge is power eh amigo bennie seemed unsurprised that croaker knew this true juan garcias death has been a dream of mine but i could never you know find the means he very quickly made himself invulnerable that ended tonight barbacenas dead he was sitting at ground zero eating his rice and tofu when heitors bomb went off bennies eyes were dreamy at last he seemed to have relaxed slightly as if a chronic ache had receded i thank god you came through this okay spare me croaker turned up his collar the rain tasted salty like tears did you set me up bennie do you work for the us government the sadness returned to bennies face id never like do that to you were amigos jesus you must have a very fucking twisted idea of friendship maybe i wouldnt know to be honest ive never had a friend before the two men stood facing each other beside them the mustangs engine ticked slowly over croaker searched bennies face but he could find nothing of significance there no signpost no hint of what was going on in this enigmatic mans mind i saw documentation that a certain agent is ramrodding a topsecret mexican operation arming and training the insurgents in the south for a political coup hes codenamed sero croaker saw bennies eyes open wide and he nodded yeah estrella leyes told me about the nickname your grandfather called you sero the mountain she shouldnt have done that bennie seemed genuinely sad that was something sacred between humait and me croaker ignored the melancholia exactly now you know how i feel we saved each other from the tiger shark we buried sonia together i gave you my trust thats sacred bennie its a secret between two people but you lied to me used our friendship and now what do you expect me to believe you still have my trust lewis what the hell dyou mean by that is that you in the government computer bennie are you the ghost in the machine right now t wouldnt bet against it this operation its like a welloiled machine running day and night bringing us closer to the moment when elements within the us government and their big business partners will be running mexico for their own economic gains that kind of thing takes a load of planning not to mention bigtime bucks but were talking latin america here money and schemes are useless without a great deal of knowhow you understand what i mean by knowhow dont you bennie connections connections connections nothing gets done in latin america without crawling into bed with the corrupt honchos down there thats your stockintrade maybe so amigo but do you think im the only one the rising wind whistled through the marina set the boats to rocking a sudden burst of rain rattled the rigging since croaker had made no reply bennie decided to try another tack about these people lewisestrella and majeur the ones i never told you theyre dead bennie all of them except maybe majeur who if he isnt dead probably wishes he was croakers balled fist struck bennie full on the jaw croaker was an expert and bennie never saw the punch coming the cigar went flying and he went down hard his backside hitting the concrete apron ўdios mio bennie sat there one hand to his jaw he seemed genuinely stunned croaker looked down at him you stupid bastard look what your bloodgame with the bonitas has done first sonia then vonda shepherd now estrella pablo leyes and majeur all dead bennie sucked meditatively on a tooth croaker hoped it was broken but what the hell would you care by your own admission you never had a friend in your life except you amigo stop calling me that croaker dug the soulcatcher out of his pocket held it in his palm ill tell you the truth bennie i was touched when you gave me your grandfathers spiritstone now i honestly dont know why you did it maybe it was some kind of goddamn bribe to get me out on the boat at midnight what did you need me for bennie did you want me to transport you to the backcountry rendezvous point so you could pick up the bones he held the spiritstone for bennies to take where are they humaitas bones bennie stood up dont be waving that around if it should like fall into the wrong hands he refused croakers offer you an i weve got no healing powers but antonio and heitor could like get every secret my grandfather put into it that stone is like a storehouse of his spells chants an healing croaker rolled the smooth soulcatcher around his fingertips he recalled how it had drawn rachel out of her coma how it had drawn the truth from heitor take it bennie i dont want it but bennie just shook his head a gift should never be returned otherwise it becomes an instrument of evil you stubborn sonuvabitch bennie started and croaker whirled around a pair of headlights had entered the compound god hear me lewis i warned you our lives would be forfeit if you were followed here but i wasnt croaker said i can guarantee it the headlights were coming straight for them yeah bennie thrust the binoculars into croakers hand tell me what you see croaker focusing the lenses saw a pale panel truck pop into view in the infrared lenses sonuvabitch the bonitas how did they know he shoved the binoculars back at bennie got down on his hands and knees shining his pocket flashlight beneath the mustang he let out another oath what is it amigo croaker stood up miniature homing device on the underside of the car nice touch bennie said those fucking bonitas the panel truck raced around the last turn on its way to the marina shit croaker said and they both began to run toward the boats rocking at their berths this one bennie pointed to a darkgreen twentyfivefooter as he untied the bow line i was just out on it croaker leapt onto the deck got behind the wheel the keys were in the ignition and he started up the engine the white panel truck careened through the parking lot as bennie flipped off the aft line ready bennie shouted as the truck screeched to a halt beside the mustang antonio swung out while the truck was still rocking on its shocks he hit the concrete running heitor was just behind him croaker had the boat in gear and was steering it clear of the dock he spun the wheel around as the boat cleared the far pilings white wake churned up as he increased speed nowhere to hide now antonio stood on the end of the dock staring balefully after them sero do you hear me croaker risked a glance back so the bonitas knew humait called bennie sero this was nuts one minute he was sure bennie was the actf operation mastermind the next he was equally certain that antonio and heitor had set bennie up was sero a true ghost in the machine a figment of the bonitas warped game heitor was running down the length of the dock paralleling them he ran full tilt keeping them in sight as he neared the far end of the dock crazy bastard bennie said what the fucks he up to croaker saw antonio hold his right arm out toward the boat he looked like moses about to part the red sea christ heitors going to make a run at us croaker said the boat was in a narrow channel there wasnt much room to maneuver he turned the wheel to starboard just as heitor made his running leap off the end of the pier as he did so antonio opened his hand in it a black stain no larger than a quarter a soulcatcher antonio began to chant the words swept away by the foul weather heitor opened his arms wide he looked as if he were flying across the water propelled by the rising wind surely it couldnt be antonios magic against all odds he made the front of the boat his shoes skidded and he rolled heavily onto the deck bennie hurried forward youre one sorrylooking fucker then he kicked heitor in the ribs croaker keeping one eye on the narrow channel overhung with mangrove and vines and the other on the dock saw antonio raise his arm higher and pick up the pace of his chanting croaker took out humaits spiritstone bennie watch out he warned stay away from heitor but bennie was past hearing ўhip de putana he spat on heitor and kicked him again somethinga particularly strong gust of windrocked the boat it caught bennie by surprise he lurched and heitor reaching up punched him in the groin bennie went to his knees gasping croaker saw the glint of heitors scalpel and he shouted bennie catch as bennie turned he threw the soulcatcher bennie reached up for it but heitor was quicker his left hand darted out and intercepted the throw there was an instants flash of heat and light and heitor began to laugh he easily parried bennies thrown punch his hand with the stone in it pressed against the side of bennies neck bennie went down as if poleaxed heitor straddled him and the scalpel glittered as it moved down toward bennies throat croaker threw the boat into neutral turned off the ignition and ran forward in his mind he saw heitor stabbing majeur hed been too late to save the lawyer would he be too late again he hit heitor with such force that the blade missed its mark it penetrated bennies chest slicing through the heavy muscle as if it were butter bennie screamed croakers momentum drove heitor sideways into the side of the boat he grunted spun and buckled as croaker smashed his elbow into the side of his head the spiritstone skittered along the deck and croaker dove for it that was a mistake he knew it the moment he was fully extended and vulnerable he should have taken care of heitor first heitor drove a knee into the small of his back lights exploded behind croakers eyes and he rolled an instant before the point of the scalpel embedded itself in the deck where hed just been he struck out but he had no power behind it and heitor brushed it aside heitor grabbed the spiritstone and in almost the same motion smashed the back of his hand into croakers face dazed croaker felt himself engulfed in a kind of eerie lethargy years ago hed gone elk hunting in the mountains of montana and had almost frozen to death this was much the same feeling a kind of detachment a sense of slipping into a twilight world where nothing mattered and any movement was unimaginable he watched with unblinking eyes as heitor slowly opened the hand with which hed struck croaker there embedded in the center of the palm was humaits spirit stone heitors bandaged face leered down at him see how it works i have your soul in here youre mine maricone fight it all you wish it was meant to be he crouched down in front of croaker i had a dream that foretold this moment in the dream i smelled the mangrove i felt the rain against my face i felt as clearly as one sees a beacon in the night the pain you have inflicted on me i used my scalpeland i discovered the mystery of life and death he was grinning like a jackolantern i held your bloody head in my hands he placed the spiritstone almost reverently against the center of croakers forehead with his other hand he plucked the scalpel from the deck i want you to feel it all he said i want you to see your death coming it was foretold in the dark stone it is in my eyes soon it will be all you know he moved the scalpel to a position level with croakers throat its coming closer seor you see yes the scalpel moved here it is heitor was flung sideways as the loud report echoed through the mangrove swamps croakers gaze swept from the blood leaking from heitors shoulder to bennie prone on the deck aiming a snubnosed wood chips flew as bennie got off another shot but heitor was no longer there hed flung himself over the side into the channel bennie clearly exhausted dropped his arm the clattered against the deck amiga his voice was soft and hoarse croaker blinked several times blood coursed back into him the unnatural lethargy was lifting he levered himself up staggered to where bennie lay inspecting the wound he saw that it was deep bennie lay in a widening pool of blood not so good huh lewis dont worry croaker began to work on him as best he could he stripped off his own shirt cut it up with one stainlesssteel fingernail then he began to bind up bennies wound the main thing now was to stop the heavy bleeding worry bennie tried to laugh then gasped as the pain threatened to overwhelm him why should i worry ive got a mortal wound and were out in the middle of nowhere shut up once again ill ignore your insult under under the circumstances its like the least i can do bennie grimaced as croaker bound the wound ever more tightly no i wont worry we cant like go back to the dock because antonios waiting for us and somewhere in the water heitor is swimming like a shark forget heitor croaker was just about finished it wasnt much but for the time being itd have to do hes bleeding like a stuck pig hell attract every croc within a fivemile radius you still dont get it do you amigo these are the bonitas they eat crocodiles for tea bennies gaze held croakers plus hes got the soulcatcher croaker shone his pocket flashlight around the deck no sign of the spiritstone he got up no time to worry about it now he went aft the boat had drifted into an outcropping of mangrove he started up the engine backed off then headed around a sweeping curve beyond that the channel straightened out and he was able to put on more speed soon they were alone with the mangroves the purling water and the nocturnal predators they were on the wilderness waterway heading due north toward coot bay bennie tried to sit up groaning he flopped back down into his own blood where we goin amigo even if you know a place no use in like hidin out ill be dead by morning keep still youre losing blood cant lewis if i stop talking ill think about whats going to you know happen to me nothings going to happen to you croaker said angrily youre too big a bastard bastards die bennie said just like mere mortals he tried to laugh but it turned into a phlegmy cough croaker didnt like the heavy sound of it he hoped to god the scalpel hadnt pierced a lung he forced himself to concentrate on the channel it was difficult to navigate at night especially at speed but with bennie pumping blood with each beat of his heart he dared not slow down hey amigo you hear bout the bigcity ambulance chaser goes out to a potential clients house bennie was breathing as hard as if hed just run a marathon in ninetyplus heat its in the sticks see real backwoods stuff seems this farmer he got run over by his neighbors tractor an broke his back the neighbors loaded and you know the ambulance chaser smells a jackpot bennie paused to breathe some he sounded like a grandfather clock in need of an overhaul so anyway he pulls up in the farms front yard steps outa his porsche and into this like big pile of shit he looks down and goes jesus god im melting croaker laughed for his efforts bennie began a whole new round of coughing when at last he stopped croaker heard him say in a subdued voice shit its blood just then croaker saw the uprooted buttonwood it was shaped like a manatee overhanging the waterway just past it croaker eased the boat down a narrow channel the air was heavy with the rank aroma of mangrove bennie looked around what is this place croaker cut the engine let the boat drift down to the end of the channel home he said leaping onto shore and hauling on the bow line if you happen to be a seminole who talks to birds and fish sounds like a fucking disney character bennie grumbled as croaker scrambled around and tied off the aft line croaker took a deep breath of the world he knew so well and went back into the boat to gather bennie up in his arms it was said that stone tree walked with the spirits this was repeated by keys fishermen and backcountry guidespeople not normally susceptible to flights of fancy he had settled here because it was the center of the world this is what he had said when croaker had first sought him out at the center of the world i listen he had told croaker what do you hear croaker had asked and stone tree had said everything it was at that moment that croaker knew he wanted stone tree to be his guide only gradually as the days and nights passed in languid concentration melting one into the other did he realize that he was here for more than instruction on fishing people were afraid of stone tree in the same way they are afraid of being alone in the night it was something they could not quite explain as a consequence he was pretty much left alone this was just the way he liked it it had occurred to croaker that he let their fear stand guard over him stone tree lived in a rough wood and tin shack on a spit of land almost wholly surrounded by red mangrove you couldnt walk on the red mangrove because they grew in the water the groves were like a moat protecting a medieval castle only a small neck of solid land connected the spit to the mainland bennies body was growing heavier with each step as croaker picked his way across the narrow neck he was as bent over as an octogenarian with spinal arthritis as always he passed close by the manzanilla tree this time of year it was laden with small green applelike fruit they looked tasty but even the sap was as caustic as lye ponce del rey a spanish explorer had eaten one and had died in agony as a small child stone tree had done the same hed grown ill but mysteriously hadnt died afterward his father had named him declaring him as strong as a stone tree ahead croaker saw movement and he froze joe came slithering out of the sawgrass and white mangrove eager to see who was invading its territory joe was an eightfoot indigo snake that lived with stone tree croaker went to his knees held out his biomechanical hand for joe to smell the constrictor did this by flicking its tongue over the manmade substances then it curled itself around the hand and slithered up croakers arm its head touched croakers cheek and again its forked tongue flicked out this time it tasted salt sweat bennie croaker said its okay were here but there was no reply bennie had passed out as croaker had transported him off the boat croaker whistled softly as he rose and went up the mossencrusted wooden steps to the shack the door opened and a towering figure was silhouetted by the flickering light of myriad candles and a single coleman lantern stone tree was thin as a reed at the edge of the water where he lived you are expected stone tree said all is in readiness croaker was unsurprised stone tree knew things others did not as croaker put bennie gently down in the center of the room stone tree said joe remembers adventures past as always he is partial to friends this was the nature of stone trees greeting it feels right to be back croaker replied stone tree nodded it was time walking ibis croaker had earned his comingofage name the first time stone tree had seen him extrude a stainlesssteel nail from the tip of his biomechanical finger stone tree said it looked like an ibiss needlelike bill stabbing for fish croaker watched stone trees gaunt lined face as he went to work he was as tall as the first indians here the calusa whose men were almost seven feet in height with cool watchful eyes the color of a misty backcountry dawn he wore his white hair long pulled back from his wide forehead by a beaded deerskin headband it hung in a ponytail the end of which was tied in a thick knot that bumped against his back like a pendulum whenever he moved he possessed a wry sense of humor dry as a perfect martini for all his isolation stone tree had a worldly inquisitive mind where he got his detailed knowledge of the planet croaker hadnt a clue perhaps the kites and cormorants crested herons and frigate birds that passed by overhead delivered the daily news he pressed his withered left hand against bennies forehead he hadnt been born with that hand hed come by it unnaturally a young man had come to him with terminal cancer stone tree had healed him but in doing so stone tree had taken the cancer inside himself now it was encapsulated like a cyst i could see it withering as the healing progressed he had told croaker there are all kinds of pain this is surprising to most people but why should it not be so arent there all kinds of love of course this was a good pain i was privileged to experience it with his right hand stone tree broke off a large piece of sage placed it in a shallow bowl in which several coals burned whitehot instantly the sage smoldered producing a chalky graygreen smoke stone tree used his hands to scoop the smoke as if it were a liquid in this way he wafted it over every part of bennies body starting with his head and ending with his feet he did this until all the sage had turned to ash then with two long slender fingers he plucked the bottommost coal from the bowl and placed it over the makeshift bandage that croaker had wrapped around the knife wound croaker had seen stone tree handle coals with his bare hands before so he wasnt surprised the heat was so intense croaker started to sweat when stone tree noticed this he smiled you have felt this heat before and instantly croaker recalled the snakebite that stone tree had treated like the warmth given off by the guarani spiritstones this heat had a healing effect that was difficult to categorize the coal burned through the layers of bloody cotton until it lay against the open wound bennie didnt thrash or cry out neither did his eyes open the heat increased until croaker felt as if he were inside an oven in the meantime stone tree had taken up three panther claws large and wickedly curved they were black as obsidian as if stained by long use one by one he inserted them into bennies fleshone into each cheek the third beside the place where the whitehot coal rested stone tree was ready when the black liquid began to ooze out of the incisions hed made he used the small bowl with the coals to catch the fluid when the coals were completely covered and cooled the liquid stopped its flow stone tree handed the bowl to croaker go outside and find a clear area dig with only your hands and bury this be sure not to get any of its contents on your skin croaker did as stone tree bade him when he returned bennie had stopped bleeding there was a peaceful look on his face his beathing was deep and even stone tree was stirring an iron pot that hung over a pit filled with glowing coals an aromatic soup brewed of rootstock and herbs infused the shack with pungent aromas your friend sleeps stone tree said now we take care of ourselves the two of them sat beside the coals eating grilled fish mashed vegetables and dried fruit stone tree ate so little that croaker suspected hed already had dinner but it would have been impolite to let croaker eat alone in silence they listened to the sounds of the backcountry the tree frogs bleeping the insects whirring the haunted calls of small predators the lapping of the nearby water the soughing of the wind through the buttonwood and jamaican dogwood all drowned out now and again by wild deluges of rain croaker ate slowly meals were a ritual of concentration punctuated by animated conversation this time however stone tree had no amusing stories to tell you come into my home tonight walking ibis you bring a wounded friend death stalks you and yet there is something beyond these circumstances that is different change is working itself inside you he reached out his withered hand and pressed it against croakers forehead as he had done before with bennie the hand was dry and cool as old wood do you know what is meant when people say i walk with the spirits you know things croaker said which way the winds will blow when the storms will come and how bad theyll be you knew i was coming and why you speak to the animals youre open to the cycles of nature stone tree nodded but there was a wry look to his face all these things are true as far as they go but whats really meant is that i talk to those who have passed beyond the world you and i know stone tree put down his food bowl tonight i see you on my porch from the blood i divine the nature of the storm that has followed you here but in your eyes i see the change working itself through you i see the healers mark on you as if by a tattooers needle croaker felt his stomach constrict my friends grandfather was a great guarani healer a sukia yes stone tree said i have heard of them they use stones to gather power and to store it soulcatchers croaker thought of humaits spiritstone in heitors possession and he was filled with sudden dread he remembered estrellas fear when hed shown her humaits dark stone do you know something about the spiritstones stone tree shook his head very little and what t do know is legend rumor call it what you will it is said that under proper circumstances the sukia swallowed these stones then they became like gods what does that mean stone tree shrugged with a single touch of their hand they could heal the sick and infirm or they could destroy their enemies it is the most terrible of the sukias transformations because it is permanent the stone stays inside but because great power is gained something of equal value must be lost this is the nature of the universe it didnt happen with this sukia croaker said he was killed many years agomurdered by the brothers whove followed us here before he died he told my friend that he would return as a shark five days ago we encountered a tiger shark it was very large very fierce my friend was sure that it was humait croaker stared dumbfounded how did you know his name stone tree smiled and lightly tapped croakers forehead with his withered hand he told me walking ibis it scribed a circle on croakers forehead he is here inside you tonight you also walk with the spirits croaker felt a sudden chill stone tree it cant be i dont believe stone tree used a small shard of buttonwood charcoal to draw something on the floorboards between them croaker stared at it it was an eye with a double iris here he is stone tree said isnt it so walking ibis croaker nodded thats humaits symbol your friend awakes stone tree turned ladled soup into a gourd bowl feed him he gave croaker the bowl give him life he walked silently outside croaker arranged himself with bennies head in his lap slowly and laboriously he fed him the rootstock and herb soup bennie drank without protest his eyes were red rimmed and he seemed thoroughly dazed croaker didnt blame him he looked at the wound it was raw and red and caked with dried blood but it was closed just as if it had been sutured by a surgeon the wind rose outside mangrove branches scratched against the thin frame of the shack and rain drummed intermittently against the tin roof the tree frogs remained bleeping incessantly but the insects had ceased to whir croaker continued to feed bennie while joe dozed on his shoulders in time the gourd was empty croaker put it aside looked down at bennie he thought about humait he thought about spirit possession chills crawled like worms through his insides then dissipated he didnt believe in spirit possession it didnt exist bennies eyes moved he stared up at joe comfortably curled on croakers shoulders amigo am i dreaming he said in a dry and crusty voice what the hells that joe hes an indigo constrictor friendly as hell nuts the both of you not in the least besides having a personality hes convenient to have around he hunts other snakes including the pygmy rattler which could give you a pretty nasty bite he get the water moccasins too i fuckin hate water moccasins none here croaker said no water snakes at all the backcountrys too salty bennie closed his eyes dios croaker listened to the storm it was approaching quickly he could feel the pressure drop like popping in his ears as if in confirmation thunder rolled ominously he looked down at the man in his arms survivors of earthquakes or bomb blasts had that look of blankness as if their souls had been blasted into the background bennie how do you feel bennies eyes snapped open not dead not alive not yet he seemed unnaturally subdued rueful even listen amigo i have some things to say not now croaker said rest if not now when croakers silence spurred him on i wont deny i lied to you pero esto es agua pasada no mueve molino thats all in the past see i had to my grandfathers bonestheyre all i have left of him i had to make sure they didnt fall into the wrong hands like antonio and heitor that would be a disaster bennie acknowledged all my grandfathers powers would be theirs then they didnt have them are you for real theyd like never agree to sell them back to me theyd never even let on they had em croaker watched the flicker of the candle flames they seemed symbols of the storm and of the uncertain future so who had them who did you have to meet at midnight roubinnet rafe come on you can do better than that bennie sighed im like you know unsurprised you dont believe me disappointed but unsurprised i brought this on myself but god hear me its the truth why should i believe you bennie tried unsuccessfully to laugh i can think of no good reason at all he closed his eyes briefly he seemed to be summoning up some hidden wellspring of strength mira amigo i made a mistake i didnt trust you what will you do now will you condemn me for like life is there no way i can redeem myself for good or ill im in your hands lewis croaker was silent for some time he stared at nothing listened to everything just as stone tree had taught him tell me about you and rafe he said at length bennie sighed as if hed been holding his breath for croakers decision while he was still mayor of miami roubinnet went into business with a colombian named gabriella gabriella was a real wise guy got in over his head an he went to jail what happened croaker asked shit happened thats what bennie was clearly disgusted the idiot decided to use rafes money an get into the drug trade why not he imagined tons of money the high flashy life buckets of power he got sucked into the whole damn thing bennie shook his head anyway gabriella he buys this big german shepherd see an he takes him to a boyhood pal of hisa vet the vet slits open the dogs abdomen and gabriella like gives him a dozen plastic bags of coke which the vet sews into the abdominal cavity then gabriella ships him off to the states okay then what so gabriella hes a novice at this kind a thing and the vethes nervous an he forgets to sterilize the plastic bags the shepherd gets infected and customs they see a sick animal and turn him over to the stateside vets who take xrays and find the bags of coke whamo they nail gabriella to the fuckin wall bennie was silent for a moment resting rafe knows nothingor at least he says he knows nothing he continued but he calls me an like asks me to get in the middle of the mess to you know extricate him from his partnership like after the fact because the fallout could kill him politically but the gabriella case gets messytoo messy for me to deal with the colombian authorities alluva sudden they dont wanna dealthey dont wanna talk to meperiod which i gotta say considering who i know there is very fucking weird i even get a death threat so i back off rafe gets pissed hangs up on me then reappears coupla days later offering me a deal i get him off the hook with this hot potato and hell get me my grandfathers bones croaker glanced down at bennie that sounds like a bribe yeah it did to me too bennie looked away for a moment but the temptation was too great i got him free i chewed up a coupla favors muy precioso very precious i fixed it so nobody knew nobody could ever link him to gabriella and that stinking drug deal but that wasnt the end of it fuck no bennie bit his lower lip at the memory i come to rafe for payment an he says the deal for the bones fell through que lastima what a pity but all the while im looking in his eyes an i like see the truth an it isnt pretty the truth is the fuckers changed his mind hes got my grandfathers bones but he doesnt want to give them up offered to pay me for my time a generous amount no doubt there didnt matter what the amount was though hed fucked me good i showed him what to do with that money and let me tell you he didnt like it one bit bennie looked up at croaker god hear me that gent has one hairy ass the two of them laughed and to croaker it felt very good yeah but bennie howd you know rafe was lying i called the sonuvabitch on it and guess what he admits that yeah maybe he can still get the bones but its like gonna cost me can you fuckin picture this ive just done him this like humongous service an hes fucked me an on top of that now i gotta do some more shit for him then i get my grandfathers bones tonight was to be the payoff i was supposed to meet him at midnight but this fuckin storm blew up because i wasnt in a like proper boat to ride out the storm in the bay i had to get back to shore what did rafe ask you to do mediate what else its my specialty no but talk about a small world one of the principals is juan garcia barbacena roubinnet is aware of my history with this bastard but he like asks me anyway what the hell does he care if it puts acid in my belly so you agreed so i agreed what else could i do it seems barbacena had finally gotten too highhanded hed become power mad dangerously independent and contrary the people who hired him want a final arbitration with himone last try at getting him back under their control i mean lewis my impression these people were ready to chop him if he wouldnt knuckle under croakers pulse quickened let me guess barbacena wouldnt budge yeah you could say that bennie got a little smile on his face he as much as told them to fuck off seemed to me when he walked out of the meeting hed like signed his own death warrant when was this beginning of the year now it all began to make sense gunn had needed time to work out a way of terminating barbacena so that the actfs hands were absolutely clean let me take another guess croaker said the people he was working for were department of justice man named spaulding gunn gunn must have been desperate to involve a civilian like bennie croaker thought but what choice did he have bennie was numero uno at this kind of negotiation he also had a long history of being absolutely discreet so this was the extent of your involvement if the doj swore you to secrecy i can understand why you couldnt tell me it was department of justice amigo i saw the badge but the mans name wasnt gunn at least the name on the id wasnt gunn he shifted slightly and it seemed to take a lot out of him it was ross darling with his heart in his mouth croaker said bennie this is very important can you describe him sure when hed caught his breath bennie said he was like medium height and build he had this you know heavy deliberate way of moving like a boxer or wrestler and white hair like an old man only he wasnt all that old had these red cheeks like you see on mountaineers or veteran drunkards this man was cold sober though could see it in his eyespale blue like ice god hear me ive seen this kind of man before lewis wouldnt hesitate to kill anyone who crossed him if he ever had a conscience you can be damn sure hed strangled it in the darkness of one childhood night croakers blood ran cold bennies description was right on the money the only trouble was it wasnt spaulding gunn he was talking about it was ross darling everything darling had told croaker about the interbureau war between dictrib and the actf was the truth only in reverse darling and dictrib were the ones running barbacena and the mexican operation croakers outfit the actf was trying to stop it in a moment of revelation croaker could see how the scenario had happened alienated agents from the actf had left gunns aegis and forming a clandestine alliance with certain senators and businessmen had recreated dictrib in their own image dictribs sole purpose then was to be the think tank and the conduit for the mexican operation that would eventually put control of the mexican government in the hands of an elite few americans darling had cut croaker off from ever contacting anyone inside the actf of course if croaker had hed have found out the truth and because the actf had lost touch with him and could not account for his movements they had assumed hed crossed over and joined dictrib which explained the attempt on his life at the brickell bridge how ironic croaker thought it was antonio bonita whod told him that everyone was lying to him everyone that is but antonio himself fatone tree crouched beneath a buttonwood surrounded by darkness and the rain croaker hunkered down beside him hed left joe back in the shack to guard bennie ive been tracking the storm stone tree said from rain and wind you have nothing to fear he held a forked twig between his knobby fingers as for the storm that followed you here hes hidden in the hammock hammock was the indian word for forest real close now croaker nodded im going to have to find him stone trees gaze locked with croakers remember everything i taught you youll take care of bennie until i get back your friend will be safe croaker was about to get up when stone tree put his good hand on his arm its a damned waste of energy to hate the storm find the way to its heart the problem is thats been tried before these brothers were able to murder the sukia because of his compassion stone tree lifted one fist force he lifted his other hand only begets more force he cocked his head listen to everything decide for yourself what is truth and what is merely perception croaker almost laughed why not ever since i got involved with the bonitas almost everyone ive met has lied to me are you surprised walking ibis he lifted his hands this world is a lie beyond it the truth pulses like light on the ocean floor the spirits speak when i walk with them existence isnt limited to this world we see with our eyes were butterflies pinned to a page only if we allow it his head turned quickly though croaker heard nothing but the soughing of the wind through the buttonwood and the sawgrass the energetic splash of rain go now stone tree said and as croaker rose he added you believe this storm is deadly do not be deceived walking ibis for you it is something else altogether croaker moved silently through the hardwood hammock rain pattered down every so often gusting through the mangroves within thirty yards stone trees encampment had disappeared from view on either side mangrove rose like spectral fingers they swayed in the wind like netting over a beehive croaker paused beside the manzanilla momentarily unsure which way to go once again he was overcome by the thought of how at home he felt in the darkness in new york hed worked while others slept and because of his work they could sleep more soundly but there was an odd thing that happened when you were at home in the night you became dislocated the normal rhythms of lifewaking in the morning eating breakfast at eight being at work at ninewere disrupted as the connections to the world around you were slowly severed you found yourself becoming more selfreliant all this he saw as helpful to him during the day there was a steady buzza cacophony of frenzied movement that kept people alert and fixated on their own immediate problems at night when sleep overtook them this static was reduced to a murmur then the rhythms of what stone tree called the larger reality rose like spectral sounds in the forest in the rainfilled night croaker could sense heitor heitor was a hunter this is what hed been itching for ever since the two of them had met predator and prey together in the wilderness what was it heitor had said a man is understood only when he stands alone a gust of wind brought him a whiff of ozone he plucked a small green apple with his biomechanical hand and set off down the spine of the hardwood hammock thunder rumbled and the sky cracked open in a cool bluewhite glare the storm made tracking impossible not only was the physical spoor obliterated but the rain took all scent out of the air gradually he became aware that he was being watched moving cautiously between the strangler figs he was able to pick out a pair of amber eyes in the sawgrass underbrush he reached the end of the hammock all around him were mangrovewhite on the land black at the edge of the water red arching out into the waterway itself he made a clicking sound and the amber eyes disappeared he plunged quickly into the mangrove following he was close enough now to partially see the shadow the tiny movements of leaf and grass stalks as the body brushed by gaining ground he saw that they were paralleling the edge of dry land three hundred yards farther on he knew the waterway curved inward reducing the mangrove islet to a narrow isthmus he made his move then leaping in front of the shadow just as it ran out of land it turned and as he came up on it reared onto its hind legs its jaws hinging open as it spat and hissed he recoiled christ it was a bobcat croaker willed himself to freeze he watched those lambent amber eyes staring at him as the beast snarled and raked the air with a forepaw slowly never taking his eyes from the bobcat he began to back away that was when heitor took him heitor seemed to fly through the wind and the rain as he leaped from his hiding place within the black mangrove landing on croakers back he drove a fist into croakers side and they both pitched into the tangle of arched mangrove roots that made up the shoreline instantly heitor plunged a forked stick into the muck pinioning croakers biomechanical hand with the hand embedded in the black viscous detritus croaker was deprived of the leverage he needed to use it effectively dimly he was aware of heitors lopsided appearance as he favored the shoulder where hed been shot he wanted to take advantage of the wound but heitor didnt seem in the least bit weakened on the contrary heitor astride him smashed his fist into croakers face this is for the first time you broke my nose his fist drove into croaker face again this is for the second time and this is for the scar you left me croaker tasted his own blood consciousness flickered in and out as heitor pummeled him the assault ceased as abruptly as it had begun croaker opened eyes caked with blood and muck heitor had humaits soulcatcher in one hand a scalpel in the other the cut croaker had made in his right cheek looked raw and angry as if it pulsed with heitors rage antonio said to wait for him he said not to tackle you on my own he sneered cautious one foolish one not tonight mira seor how humaits secrets heal my shoulder tonight belongs to the hunter he bent low over croaker look into my eyes i want you to recognize your death there croaker did indeed see something dark and squirmy in heitors eyes and something inside him quailed was it real or the power of suggestion in his present position he knew he had no chance in a physical struggle but there must be another way heitor he said tell me how it can be that antonio is still in love with rosa what nonsense is this heitors scalpel hovered motionless above croakers face do you think you can sway me with lies croaker pressed on giving himself that most precious commodity time didnt you know thats where his affinity for me lies theres a connection between rosa and sonia antonio felt it when we met at sonias house i didnt know he was there there was an uncertain flicker behind heitors eyes he didnt tell me of course he didnt croaker was working his biomechanical hand in the muck manufacturing room to maneuver if he did youd want to know why he was there and he wouldnt dare tell you the truththat hed come to revisit rosas murder to confess to me heitors eyes had clouded over why would he want to do that because you were right rosa had changed him she told him he was damned and the very act of your murdering her proved it to him for the first time i think he understood the nature of the evil the two of you had created a certain amount of relief showed on heitors face now i know youre lying if what youre saying was true why would antonio continue simple he couldnt stop himself croaker had burrowed his biomechanical hand deep enough to regain some motion your way of life had become an end in itself it had taken on a life of its own isnt that true heitor the game yes yes heitors tone was dismissive madre de mentims youre just stating the obvious except that antonio can no longer live with what youve created slowly in the muck croaker turned his biomechanical hand on edge so the thumb was uppermost in fact he never could humait recognized this spark of humanity in antonio and tried to play him against you im right arent i heitor humait heitors jaw clenched as he hissed out the single world like an epithet from the first he insisted on separating us he said we were different individuals he ignored the bond between us no no the dark stones know thats wrong he worked to sever our bond hijo de putanal why didnt he understand that the two of us couldnt survive separately croaker was beginning to understand you mean you cant survive on your own dont you heitor no heitors face was dark with rage and remembrance the two of us everything is the two of us not everything one roll of the dice croaker knew this was all that was left him life or death depended on the truth of his supposition it wasnt the two of you who murdered humait was it silence the wind soughing through the mangrove was like someone in pain the two of us yes heitor was like a child clinging to a cherished belief that had saved him from the hideous truth no croaker said it was you you were always the hunter the one with the insatiable blood lust you murdered humait on your own heitor was back in asuncion on that dark night on the paraguay river that night i killed him it was like this stormy filled with an evil rain i drowned him i remember the bubbles dribbling from his mouth as the air escaped his lungs beautiful and he was so calm like hed known all along what would happen it made me tremble heitor licked his lips afterward antonio said id slipped my leash he used that word deliberately to show me what an animal i could be ive been so careful with you he said and he had time and again hed told me how important humait was to us but i knew the truth i could see how the old man was trying to destroy us to sever our special bond though it caused me pain i hid this truth even from antonio the dark stones know he wouldnt have understood i knew hed try to stop me hed jerk my leash make me crouch by him panting and so angry i would lose my breath oh yes how many times had he done it before that night antonio could no longer be your keeper croaker said rosa was right when you murdered humait you damned him he turned from being your failed conscience to your eventual abettor thats whats eating him alive with a wordless cry heitor drove the scalpel toward croakers throat in the same instant croaker smashed upward with all his strength his biomechanical hand splintered the thick hardwood stick the edge of the scalpel glanced off the polycarbonate shell but such was heitors strength of determination that the scalpel pierced the meat of croakers right shoulder heitor screamed the spurting of croakers blood seemed to inflame him all the more and he twisted the scalpel in the wound pain streaked through croakers body driving him to the edge of unconsciousness he felt himself slipping away he was astonished then terrified at the ease with which he could let go of everything fall backward into the endless abyss then he saw the dark outline of his biomechanical hand and he remembered that tiny spark of memory fueled the terror adrenaline surged into his bloodstream the ripped seams of consciousness stitched themselves together for a few more precious moments he ground his fingers against his palm the pressure crushing the tiny sphere he held there then his biomechanical fingers flowered open and he jammed the pale paste into heitors open mouth immediately he jabbed the knuckles of his right hand into heitors adams apple heitor swallowed he couldnt help himself his eyes watered as he ingested the pulp and sap of the manzanilla apple heitor screamed it was a bloodcurdling sound that terrified even the bobcat who bounded over them and quickly disappeared into the black maze of the hammock arching up heitor flung himself this way and that he clawed at his throat then his chest and belly his eyes were open wide and rolling the whites were bloodshot and his mouth worked spastically then he caught sight of croaker and with a supreme effort of will he managed to regain some control over himself with a trembling hand he produced humaits spiritstone he pressed it against the center of his chest for a moment nothing seemed to happen the squally rain had ceased to fall some time ago now even the wind had died it was as if the night itself was holding its breath there seor you see heitor sat up he was no longer trembling his face had lost that white pinched look held i prevents me from being poisoned you cannot harm me seor i welcome you to try his voice failed him from one instant to the next his eyes bugged out as his abdomen started to inflate horror crossed his face sweat broke out on his forehead ran in rivulets down his cheeks and beside his ears his contorted expression appeared to mirror a terrible struggle going on inside him ii heitors eyes rolled up until only the whites shone lambent as neon his lower jaw dropped open and a protracted hissing could he heard emanating from deep within him when eventually it died out his abdomen was completely deflated croaker approached him with caution as he knelt over him he could smell a peculiar odor it seemed to rise from his open mouth as well as from every pore in his body even before he checked heitors pulse croaker knew he was dead he reached out took the soulcatcher from heitors lax grip the pain in his shoulder made him turn away he needed to find a jamaican dogwood he wanted to strip off a section of bark press the underside against his wound decades ago the calusa and seminoles dried and ground this bark spreading the powder on the water its powerful narcotic would stun the fish that ate it theyd float up to the surface where the fishermen netted them by the dozen he set off for the hardwood hammock certain hed find the dogwood there but hed only taken a pace or two when he had an instant flash of antonios face thered been no sound at all to warn him he reacted but it was too late a section of buttonwood thick and long as a cudgel smashed into the side of his head and he fell to the ground unconscious when croaker had been on the force theyd had an unofficial saying it was written on the precincts readyroom wall your gun is your right arm and your right leg dont become a cripple believe it we live and die by that commandment hed been told on his first day for the powers that be its a purely fiscal policy they dont want you to lose the damn thing for me its a matter of face if youre shot with your own sidearm it goes on my fucking record as well as yours upon awakening croaker had cause to remember this incident looking down at his body he saw that he was a cripple all over again he wiped the rain out of his eyes and stared in disbelief at the stub of his left forearm somehow antonio had managed to disengage his biomechanical hands locking mechanism croaker felt as naked as if all his clothes had been stripped off he sat up and immediately put a hand to his head he was groggy and there was a dull throbbing he couldnt stop he took a couple of deep breaths then looked around he was on the boat he and bennie had used to get to stone trees shack with his right hand he dug into his pocket his heart sank humaitas spiritstone was gone now antonio had every advantage croaker hauled himself to his feet as he made his way aft he almost stumbled he brought himself up short hed become accustomed to the weight of the biomechanical hand without it he seemed like a ship without a rudder he stared into the water where an alligator lay still as death eyeing him with dispassion he moved on his eyes on the deck hadnt bennies been left on the deck now there was no sign of it the gun has been disappeared seor antonio said from behind him antonio stepped from the shadows at the bow of the boat leveling a mack machine pistol at croaker the mack was a compact automatic weapon that could spew out bullets at an appalling rate isnt that a bit of overkill im only one man but such a man antonio said quite seriously heitor had humaits soulcatcher yet you killed him antonios face seemed a mask beneath which muscles twitched as if they were emotions long held in check what secret weapon did you use i wonder croaker lifted his stub what weapon you managed to get my hand off even though it was locked in place antonio didnt appear to hear him his amber eyes were clouded with a swirl of emotion seor i cried for him verdad i had sworn to protect himand i did to the best of my abilities but in the end heitor had a will of his own and he followed that will come what may croaker said he always did you know it all detective antonio had tried to inject a note of contempt in his voice but failed he jerked his head did you wonder why i kept you alive i need you to navigate through this cursed storm where are we going antonio flicked the ugly blunt muzzle of the mack indicating croaker should move aft where do you think of course tt was obvious it should have been all along dont want to tell me dont think i know antonio was laughing at him were going to make bennies rendezvous im going to get humaits bones finally i can imagine how much you covet the bones croaker said as he was herded aft i understand the power in them makes the soulcatcher insignificant not insignificant no antonio shrugged but together seor if i had them both it would almost be as if humait is resurrected he closed his hand into a fist pressed it to his chest and all his knowledge all his power would be here inside me for croaker that possibility was a frightening thought indeed he knew hed have to stop antonio from getting humaits bones at all cost what i cant figure out is why you let heitor do it he said as he took the wheel humait had taught you everything he believed in you with him alive your life was set and yet you decided to burn all of that on his funeral pyre you helped heitor even forgave him the two of you hid the truth and went on i had no choice seor thats nonsense croaker started up the engine threw it into reverse in the end choices are all we have to call our own theyre what define us antonio theyve certainly defined you antonio grunted madre de mentims life is sweet when you have all the answers croaker thought antonio sounded bitter as he slowly backed the boat through the channel that stone tree had handdug off the main waterway he looked at the shallow water and thought of fate in southeast asia where he had spent much time fate was a big thing it ruled a persons life from the moment of birth to the instant of death the chinese for example believed that it was wrong to struggle against your fate acceptance of what would inevitably come was counseled croaker could never quite buy that line of thinking to him it was like lying down like a dog in the street to die couldnt do it never would it wasnt good to think of such things he knew he barely understood the concept of fate let alone whether or not he believed in it but the alternative to thinking these thoughts was worse for then hed have to grapple with the realization that he was going to die here facedown in two feet of brackish water just like in jennys spiritstone vision such profound silence seor antonio said mockingly you must be contemplating your death actually i was thinking of yours antonio laughed you know seor despite all the grief you have caused me i do believe i am going to miss you dont for a minute think the feelings mutual croaker maneuvered the boat into wilderness waterway head south out of the channel antonio ordered with a flick of the macks stubby barrel well catch up with roubinnet in snake bight the bight was a kind of cove to the east that fronted the much larger florida bay beyond the bay were the keys flung off the tip of the mainland in an arc as slim and flexed as a womans arm in repose you and rafe friends fuck no antonio settled himself close enough to croaker to keep an eye on him but not so near that croaker could reach him in a lunge but speaking of old friends is bennie dead yet you seem to know everything else why dont you know that antonio cocked his head hit a nerve yes seor oh i think so he was wearing a goldcolored polo shirt and chinos the wind flipped his collar back and forth bennies a very clever man but not so clever as he thinks maybe thats because hes sentimental yes bennie he has deep sentiments for his grandfather curious considering they never really got along he grunted i bet bennie never told you this whatever he told me is confidential sos this but ill tell you anyway antonio said its fitting in a way between us such intimates linked by death he smiled the truth isnot that youll believe methe truth is that humaiti was a monster oh yes he was a perfectionist a slave driver with children even more than with adults and dios mio the arrogance of the man bennie found him intolerable i didnt blame him the old man wanted things from bennie so many things from me as well but i was clever i took from humait what i could he drove me to exhaustion and on my knees i devoured the hints of power he dropped for me heitorhe couldnt take it and benniewell bennie wanted none of it at all croaker took them around the last bend toward the southern mouth of the waterway ahead lay the bayand snake bight what are you saying that at one time you and heitor and bennie all studied hetd i with humait now youve got the picture they were nearing the mouth of the waterway and antonio stood the rigors caused bennie to wash out early they put heitor under extreme pressure and what did they do to you antonio shrugged qnien sabe who knows he was alert now peering forward into the night filthy with rain and wind as croaker swung the boat to the east heading toward the scimitar edge of snake bight now for the big question how did you and heitor get recruited by ross darling antonio turned his head to glance in croakers direction that peon seor let me tell you my brother and i would not waste our time with darling if not darling then who hes the director now antonio seemed interested remember sero there really is a man codenamed sero but its not bennie oh like all of us your dear bennie eventually became involved with dicktribe he told me he mediated barbacenas last meeting with the feds antonio said nothing who is sero croaker fairly shouted this question goddamnit i want an answer antonio cocked his head its killing you isnt it the not knowing maybe antonio had spent too long in the company of dtctribs rogue agents he and his brother fit right into this new breed of men who plotted revolutions not for political or ideological ends but for economic gain dictribs plan to fund the chiapas rebellion in mexico in order to put their people into place was something antonio and heitor could savor croaker had to admire all over again how cleverly darling had switched his black hat for a white one all to keep croaker walking their side of the moral tightrope theyd set up for him up ahead in snake bight lights could be dimly seen through the squally weather evidence of another boat antonio stirred now that juan garcia barbacena has gone to his just reward i will take his place he went on as sero planned except that heitor was supposed to be with me you see juan garcia had passed over the line the power dicktribe had given him was for him like mainlining heroin he was an addict for it as a consequence hed become increasingly arrogant abusive contrary he wanted only what was good for juan garcia then late last year we discovered that hed begun to build his own power base quite apart from us fantasy had replaced reality gone from his mind entirely was the fact that he was owned body and soul by dicktribe judging by the space between the running lights the boat looked to be sixty or so feet long it could very well be rafes fleet catamaran an uncharacteristic agitation had come into antonios body he seemed to be vibrating to the rhythm of his anticipation in this way croaker could judge the fever pitch of his desire for humaitas bones at the beginning of this year a meeting took place between dicktribe and barbacena antonio continued barbacena walked out unwilling to negotiate even the smallest point he had his power base and he thought that made him invulnerable subsequently a determination was made to terminate him but how to do it first heitor and i were contracted to take over the operation he was spearheading then the planning of his termination got under way in earnest we wanted it done discreetly that meant no direct intervention we couldnt do it because by then we were too deeply involved with the dicktribe operation it was essential that there be no hint of dicktribes involvement to do so would bring questions about what the bureau was doing in latin america wed risk exposing the entire mexican operation antonio smiled sweetly we chose you seor you were the ideal choice an excop you had a history of homicide justifiable or not when a man has killed he has taken a life period so you had the credentials the ability but best of all you had worked on and off for the actf what could be better you had the wherewithal to kill barbacena and afterward we could use your parttime affiliation to put the blame on the actf croaker was appalled but you knew you couldnt just sell me on a coldblooded murder even if barbacenas half as cruel as everyone says he is so you found out about rachel you poisoned her with ethylene glycol un poco serior just a little croaker almost leaped at antonio with great effort he calmed himself down then you hired majeur to offer me the dealrachels life for barbacenas it all came down to me i was the perfect assassin for you i had the credentials the skills and if i was caught i had tenuous ties to the actf whatever happened dicktribe would be in the clear antonio nodded all rather neat dont you agree and as far as we were concerned clean as a cats whisker he frowned except you learned just a little bit more at every turn than we had anticipated so darling stepped in he had no choice you became insistent on contacting the actf we couldnt allow that could we and you began isolating me we did our best antonio pursed his lips the less resources the more difficulties it is forever to your credit seor that you did not falter not even once on the contrary you somehow enticed majeur into becoming your ally that was something none of us had anticipated madre de mentiras even heitor was forced to admire your ingenuity croaker didnt think much of the compliment in the end it didnt matter you had thought of everything didnt you he said you even had a plan in place if i failed to kill barbacena that was heitors idea i must admit but then the urge to kill burned bright inside him so bright it consumed him antonio nodded pobre poor one one thing i still dont understand through the rain the first outlines of the catamarans monstrous pontoons became visible you knew once you were employed by dicktribe theyd own you body and soul as you said theyd already done it with barbacena why did you allow yourselves to be recruited as you have no doubt guessed heitor fought against it in fact he became somewhat embittered antonio shrugged but heitor he was always more comfortable in the jungle he had no use for civilization but i understood that times had changed we had to move up or step aside for the juan garcia barbacenas of the world and this i would not tolerate he smiled besides seor i am smarter than all of them our organ harvesting was our insurance policy as in latin america we supplied some of the most powerful people in your government they came to rely on us for our unique service if danger presented itselfif darling ever got the unjudicious idea to terminate usthey would put pressure on him that surely would alter dicktribes outlook joe kemp key was a dark and misshapen lump passing along their port side they crossed snake bight channel where the water was briefly as deep as a man was tall then they were into the bight proper where the depth was only a couple of feet despite its mammoth size rafes cat was perfect for sailing here croaker realized it had almost no draft the catamaran loomed out of the darkness like a sea monster croaker could see that the running lights on the landward side had been turned off whats going to happen once we get on board he asked antonio leveled the muzzle of the mack hasnt the great detective figured it out yet no you are not going on board seor there is simply no need you have served your purpose it seems to me antonio that for you at least ive served many purposes really seor croaker was slowing the boat the closer he came to rafes cat the nearer he was to his own death the one i cant figure out is confessor why tell me about rosa even heitor was surprised at that antonio jerked the barrel of the mack andale seor dont dawdle now not when i am so close to the bones he inhaled deeply ay i can smell them even from this distance yeah what do they smell like antonios eyes opened wide the pupils were dilated power seor more than you could ever imagine all of humaits secretsthe ones he never taught me or anyonethere just waiting for me to suck them out like marrow rosa croaker prompted you were going to tell me was i no no seor he waggled the mack only on the point of my death there came a hail from aboard rafes cat and antonio turned the curve of his long jaw was dimly outlined by the running lights in that instant of inattention croaker left the wheel and leapt across the deck perhaps antonio had been expecting such a move or perhaps hed seen the blur of movement out of the corner of his eye it did not matter he pulled the trigger and a spray of bullets arced into the rain their bright sparks followed croakers shallow dive overboard stone tree had showed him how to move in water that was often so shallow it only came up to your shins croaker sped forward not down still his chest scraped against the muddy bottom as he made for the cat he was all too aware that this was jennys vision come to sickening life he was facedown in shallow water in mortal fear of his life bullets peppered the water as he made it to the edge of the closest pontoon it loomed huge as a dirigible on the surface of the water he edged his way along until he found a handhold then he climbed over the pontoon losing himself in the shadows beneath the cat for what seemed a long time after that nothing happened then he heard the deep roar of the cats chevies as the huge boat picked up speed he began to slip backward along the slick top blown like a leaf in a windstorm he almost fell caught himself then slid backward at an appalling rate hi desperation he reached out hooked his arm around a strut for a long painful moment he swung out over the water then he scrambled back onto the pontoon the cat was gaining speed at this rate hed never stay on croaker looked all around him there was nothing but the strut to hold on to and given his overall state of fatigue and the injury to his shoulder he couldnt maintain his grip for much longer but he had to in his minds eye he could see antonio confronting rafe how much damage would antonio inflict on the restaurateur unless croaker could intervene he remembered sonia vonda estrella and pablo leyes majeur all victims of the bonitas he couldnt let the same thing happen to rafe but how to get into the house then he remembered something he glanced upward near the rear of the cats house he saw the dark circular rim it was the outside of the cover hed noticed when hed been in the head earlier that afternoon it was a myth that catamarans couldnt capsize they couldand didunder certain adverse conditions when they did they wouldnt sink but you would be trapped inside the house with no way out rafe had provided for that possibility hed had an escape hatch built into the floor that way if the cat ever turned over hed just pop that hatch and crawl to safety croaker began to inch up the strut rafes prudence might just provide for croakers own escape at the base of the cats superstructure he wrapped his legs around the strut and transferred his handhold to one of the aluminum bars that ran beneath the house he took a deep breath and let go with his legs for a moment he swung beneath the house below him the pontoons skimmed across black water ruffled by the driving wind if he fell now chances were hed be crushed he reached up hooked his left arm around the bar edging farther along toward the center of the house in this way he moved with agonizing slowness transferring his weight from the crook of one arm to the other each time he put pressure on his left shoulder his teeth ground together with the pain that lanced through him he felt a heat then a burning beneath the makeshift bark bandage he was bleeding again not a good sign he didnt yet feel weakened but that was a false reading that could only end in disaster the massive amounts of adrenaline his system must be pumping out would mask any such debility until it was too late hed need to make a rush at antonio and hed be too slow or the energy wouldnt be there at all and antonio would cut him down without serious effort or thought his teeth began to chatter as the cat picking up ever more speed began to hit real waves he peered out from underneath the house they had been motoring southeast and had now hit the open deeper water of whipray basin dead ahead lay the small chain of the buttonwood keys croaker reached the center of the house and looked up he saw the rubber seal around the hatch a black halo that seemed to beckon him holding on to the aluminum bar with his left arm he reached up rain and wind took his breath away once he had to close his eyes momentarily as vertigo swept over him he felt around in the darkness but all he encountered was a smooth fiberglass surface where was the mechanism that opened the hatch perhaps there was none on this side he hung his head if the hatch had no egress from outside he was doomed he took several deep breaths and tried again still nothing then on the third try his fingertips discovered a seam he hadnt felt it before because of the heavy chattering of the boat over the waves his hopes rose digging his fingernails into the seam he tried to pry it up he screamed into the wind at the intense pain that lanced through his left shoulder with a pop halfmuffled by the wind the fiberglass panel came off inside was a shallow well within which was housed a small wheel croaker allowed himself an instants elation as he turned the wheel to the left when it couldnt go anymore he lifted the hatch up and using his elbows scrambled through inside the head he propped himself against a bulkhead and shivered he took the rag rug and wrapped it around himself he could smell his own blood feel it warm and sticky running down his side he wanted to put his head back and go to sleep with a start he roused himself panic gripped him hed almost passed out he shucked the rug off his shoulders as he rose he noted that he was a bit unsteady as he reached for the door also waves of blackness kept lapping at his consciousness to keep himself awake he began to count backward by the hour to the last time hed slept mistake he started again finding himself leaning against the door his head lolling he slapped himself hard then he turned the knob and slowly and silently opened the door no one was in rafes stateroom but through the halfopen door he could hear voices drifting in from the main salon had to be rafe and antonio the crewmen were all surely on deck manning the cat in this rough weather as he crossed rafes stateroom the inflections of the voices came more clearly to him yes rafe and antonio were talking in the main salon from behind the door he could see the two of them they were at the front of the salon limned by the golden teardrops from a single lamp and the galley lights they appeared like figures projected on a screenboth larger than life and unreal in their twodimensionality rafe was on the galley side of the counter antonio on the salon side the halfbulkhead was symbolic of their conversation of course it had to do with humaits bones from what croaker could make out rafe had them all right but what the hell was he going to do just hand them over to antonio antonio was telling rafe that he had no choice as croaker stole into the deep shadows at the rear of the salon he opened a long vertical cabinet inset into the port bulkhead inside was stored the scuba gear croaker got out a shortie a neoprene wet suit with short sleeves and legs that came to midthigh he pulled it on inside rafes stateroom in lieu of a proper tourniquet the closefitting neoprene would help stanch the flow of blood from his shoulder wound back at the cabinet he pushed aside other suits and took out a serratedblade dagger in its sheath attached to a belt he strapped this on using his stump to hold the buckle tight against his belly then he removed a speargun from its hook he slid a bolt into the slot cocked the action by this time the animated conversation between antonio and rafe had become acrimonious threats were flying back and forth like a hail of needles as much as croaker admired rafes forceful personality he was no match for antonio besides croaker was determined that no one else would get hurt give them here antonio beckoned with the fingers of one hand as croaker doublechecked the action on the speargun escuchame seor rafe replied as i have told you the bones are a nonnegotiable point period fuck negotiation antonio said this goes beyond negotiation you dont have your automatic weapon now seor rafe spread his hands wide you see why i could not let you on board with it power power antonio was apparently holding himself in check by an extreme force of will or perhaps he was just waiting for the right moment to strike whos got the power i do apparently rafe said as a wave rattled the glasses and bottles on their shelves the bones are power dont be dense its power ill never let you have no need to elaborate further verdad he appeared not in the least bit intimidated but then he didnt know antonio bonita that should be sufficient warning rafe had overstepped his advantage as croaker knew men like antonio and heitor did not react well to verbal warnings antonio was all but climbing over the counter in his zeal to get at rafe croaker had seen that feverish look before in the eyes of hunt dogs that had treed the fox a tiny snik presaged antonios attack with his stilettobladed gravity knife the bolt croaker fired from the speargun caught him in mid lunge it pierced his side with such force it passed clear through him embedding itself in the bulkhead behind him antonio was flung backward to the foot of the doorway what the hell rafe with a stunned expression on his face watched croaker emerge from the shadows compadre que pasa where did you come from something was up because the catamaran had abruptly changed course it was coming about stay away from this bastard croaker warned pointing to antonio as he hurried across the salon he bumped into ends of furniture was that because the boat was lifting and falling in the swells or because he was close to passing out hes still as dangerous as a scorpions tail jesus christ compadre dont croaker lurched away from rafes grab because antonio had pulled himself upright and had jerked the door open the hoarse voice of the storm invaded the salon rain struck their faces in quick spits nevertheless antonio with one hand pressed to his side swung out onto the foredeck por favor leave him rafe urged but croaker was past hearing out on the deck the wind had changed he could see that the storm had abruptly shifted it was sheering off to the east forcing the cat to motor south out of whipray basin they were now making directly for the bight behind him he could see rafes tall frame silhouetted by the light streaming from inside the house then rafe followed him onto the deck antonio was heading aft around the side of the house croaker wondered if he wanted to take control of the cat but he could already see antonio climbing across the webbing that spanned the aft space between the pontoons what was he after he couldnt be making for one of the wheels even if he overpowered the crewman there was a second wheelman on the other pontoon the cat could not be driven by one man then croaker saw the dark shape bucking between the cats twin wakes they were towing the boat croaker and antonio had used to get to snake bight that was antonios immediate destination because thats where hed left the mack croaker knew he couldnt allow antonio to get it out on the webbing croaker was almost blown overboard he had only one hand to hang on with and his shoes kept slipping on the wet nylon he kicked them off because he wasnt wearing socks he could dig in with his bare toes the wind was lowering as the storm continued to sheer off to the east it soughed through the cat twanging rigging bound fast to mast and deck pins one or two first magnitude stars played peekaboo with fastscudding clouds the rain had ceased altogether antonio croaker cried antonio antonio paused then turned he was on all fours bouncing as he clung to the webbing periodically waves slapped upward drenching both of them a smile wreathed his face ўhola senor we have come to our inevitable conclusion staring into croakers eyes he took out a dark stone he held it on the tip of his tongue for a long moment maybe he was deciding whether or not to take this final step but most likely he wanted croaker to understand the import of what he was about to do he swallowed now it comes his shout was so strong that croaker could hear him clearly over the soughing wind power that burns brighter than a sun croaker began to scramble aft but a firm hand on his arm stopped him rafe let go not yet compadre rafes hard gaze locked onto his from now on this is a joint venture comprende rafe you dont get it no one threatens me compadre no one as they watched antonio ran crabwise to the edge of the webbing then somersaulted over the edge but he did not fall instead he dropped into the water striking out in a path parallel to the line that ran between the cat and the trailing boat which rocked in the cats churning wake theres a better way rafe said in croakers ear he lifted an arm and the crew manning the cats wheels responded the cat came about behind it the smaller boat began to curve in an arc away from antonio now rafe scrambled aft with croaker following him onto the starboard pontoon he grabbed a small electronic winch and began to draw in the line attached to the small boat here he said ceding the controls to croaker as the boat approached he climbed to the edge of the webbing then flipped off it into the smaller boat croaker stopped the winch overhead stars blazed hard as grit croaker clambered to the edge of the webbing ўcompadre rafe lifted one arm in a gesture of victory moonlight glinted off articulated metal surfaces ўmira look what i found he was holding croakers biomechanical hand croaker flipped onto the smaller boat headed toward him rafe was grinning hey compadre what did the buddhist say to the hot dog vendor make me one with everything thats quite a joke rafe the only problem is buddhists dont eat meat rafe frowned i didnt think of that maybe it should be a vegetarian hot dog vendor not funny neither is this rafe had dropped croakers biomechanical hand at his feet now he was holding antonios mack this is some mean mother weapon eh he eyed it curiously you would have more experience with something like this than i would he turned it back and forth in his hand tell me how many rounds per minute does it shoot later croaker stopped four paces from rafe let me have my hand i dont think so rafe leveled the muzzle of the mack at croakers head compadre do you realize that if i pull the trigger now therell be nothing left of your head the short hairs at the base of croakers neck stirred do me a favor he said aim some other place would you i think not rafe put one foot up on the gunwale as he gazed at croaker please remove your belt youre much too dangerous a man i want to know that youre quite unarmed christ rafe do as i fucking say compadre oh christ all of a sudden the bottom seemed to fall out of the world as he numbly complied with rafes barked order croaker was possessed with the suprareal clarity of senses that comes with profound revelation in this moment of insight the last puzzling pieces of the enigma hed penetrated fell into place at last the whole picture stunned him into momentary immobility as he stared at rafe he was acutely aware of his surroundings the bottom of the boat his biomechanical hand lying quiescent at rafes feet the water lapping the nearby cat the full moon appearing like a gemstone in the furred darkness of the storms aftermath rafe was grinning what is it compadre you look as if youd seen a ghost in a way rafe was right at long last croaker was seeing the ghost in the dictrib machine it wasnt bennie it wasnt antonio and it certainly wasnt ross darling croaker felt a fierce wave of rage take hold of him trying to keep his voice from cracking he said heres the thing rafe something has been bothering me the bonitas put a homing device on the mustangthats how they tracked me down here but before that when i was driving my own tbird how did antonio know id be at sonias i wondered about that for some time rafe shrugged a small thing so small it means nothing on its own i might have forgotten about it croaker admitted he lifted his left arm but then antonio took my biomechanical hand he couldnt resist but he didnt chop it off he unlocked it while i was unconscious how do you suppose he did that rafe no way for him to have known the combinationand yet he did rafe stood in the rocking boat silent the rage was like a living thing beating with its own heart inside croakers chest of course you do you were there when i unlocked it yesterday afternoon on the cat you were so close you could have seen me work the combination if youd wanted to and as for antonio knowing id be at sonias there was only one way for him to have found out you told him you asked me where i was going that day i told you id be there so what rafes expression was so bland it made croaker grind his teeth so this who were the bonitas reporting to at dicktribe darling despite all his experience hes an exgrunt and even if theyre as ambitious as darling seems to be all exgrunts get to be is middle management if theyre as lucky as he was so darling has a boss who is it rafe grinned almost distractedly sero the rage was consuming croaker it was like a beast shaking itself free of all restraints croaker recognized this beast it had raised its head when hed shot the psycho killer ajucar martinez when hed killed don rodrigo the man whod ordered his father murdered because these men were like rafe they had violated every moral code croaker held dear you told me you didnt know the bonitas but that was a lie croaker managed to get out jesus christ rafe how many lies did you tell me you were a friend of mine i confided in you i trusted you and all the while you were fucking me over the way you fucked bennie out of his grandfathers bones how the hell can you live your life like that what kind of bastard are you the cleverest bastard i know rafe seemed to be enjoying this croaker took a deep breath the enormity of rafes betrayal was so painful it threatened to bury him you were running the bonitas the mexican operation was your brainchild rafe you conceived of it while you were in office thats why you quit your day job you wouldve won reelection hands down but you refused now that decision makes sense you already had another line of work how long have you been working for the feds well before we set you up by having that wise guythreaten me rafe said that miami mobster you ran down was a dicktribe undercover agent as a result a bond was formed you and i became friends what could have been simpler or more effective he shrugged but im sure thats not what you meant as director of dicktribe ive carved out my own empire im as secure as the bullion inside fort knox the washington bureaucracy is so enormous its easy as shit to get yourself lost inside the machine a few good friends a number of power contacts a handful of loyal peoplehell thats all you need the power feeds on itself youd be surprised it grows and compounds like interest until one day you find youre at the top of everest and let me tell you compadre that long look down on everyone and everything is one motherfucking rush you engineered everything didnt you croaker felt chilled to his marrow he was shaking with anger this man who had masqueraded as his friend was a reptile a coldblooded mastermind without conscience a consummate actor he had fooled even croaker who was used to prying up public personas to see what lay underneath the moment you determined that barbacena had to be terminated you came up with the scheme to extort me into doing your dirty work so your hands would be clean you ordered rachel poisoned christ almighty how could you do that to an innocent girl what you really mean is how could you have so misjudged me rafe was unremorseful in fact he appeared contemptuous in politics as in life compadre expediency becomes its own principle you cant see that i know youre a cripple in more ways than one croaker felt the rage like a hot ball of wax in his throat he wanted to gag but he kept his cool he had to he knew the longer he kept rafe talking the better chance hed have of figuring out how to get to him how did you come by humaits bones that was the simplest part rafe said thefts of that nature happen all the time desperate people will sell anything to stay alive but because of humaits notoriety these needed special care they were hidden for some years then smuggled into miami along with a boatload of coke thats where i heard about their existence you paid for them rafe laughed no way compadre one of the benefits of being the mayor i had the police engineer a raid the cops found their drugs and i had what i wanted croaker saw the tension come into rafes gun hand and he prayed as he prayed he imagined his biomechanical hand was still attached and contracted the tendons at the end of his severed wrist at rafes feet the biomechanical hand jumped as if struck by lightning rafe already on edge the adrenaline pumping through him started as he stared down at the inanimate thing that had suddenly shockingly moved croaker strode forward and struck him flush on the nose with his right fist rafe arched backward the mack flying across the deck as a ropy spurt of his own blood arced through the moonlit night croaker kicked rafe in the ribs and rafe groaned rafe rolled smashed his fist into the side of croakers knee croaker went down and rafe delivered a tremendous twohanded blow to his temple croaker fell back against the gunwale rafe panting like a laboring engine crawled toward the mack croaker shook his head to clear it he reached out picked his biomechanical hand out of the river of blood at the bottom of the boat and reattached it rafes fingers closed around the machinepistols trigger and with a grimace of pain he swung it up toward croaker croakers biomechanical fingers clenched into a fist a fireball had coalesced in his chest the titanium polycarbonate and stainlesssteel hand crashed down like the hammer of god it smashed the mack out of rafes grasp and over the side of the boat it slammed into rafes sternum so that the splintered bone pierced his heart croaker stared into rafes pale face while the night buzzed on around him he slipped to his knees in pain and fatigue but after so long in the treacherously shifting sands of rafes scheming his heart felt light and free goddamnit compadre he whispered to the dead man you fucked with the wrong man ўbravo seor antonio called from the aft of the catamaran ўque macho eh he stood grinning balancing himself against the swells now there is only the two of us he shrugged what more could i ask for his face suddenly fell unless your prior exertions have left you lifeless in that event the game is over i have already won croaker knew he should ignore antonios mocking that at this final stage he should take the time to think things through but he couldnt the response was of one animal for another he had no choice he gathered himself and went after antonio he clasped the line connecting the two boats swinging his legs up and crossing his ankles to hold on hand over hand he inched upward below the water rose up to meet him like an angered friend slapping his back repeatedly once it submerged him entirely high overhead in the expanding sky more stars appeared as the storm clouds tumbled away to the east it was dark as sin there but here at the southern edge of whipray bay the full moon peered down at him with a pearly grace its reflection repeated on each wave etched a phosphorescent trail that seemed to go on forever croaker could see that antonio was crouched down on the edge of the webbing he was laughing as he drew his gravity knife and sawed through the line severing the small boat from the catamaran croaker plunged into the water a heartbeat later antonio followed him moonlight turned the water eerily pellucid ghostly fingers penetrated the shallows turning human skin white as bleached bones and it was in these shallows that antonio caught up with croaker the water was barely five feet and antonio jerked him upward the two armed men faced each other antonio with his gravity knife croaker with his biomechanical hand antonio smiled almost benignly his arms opened wide and he dropped the gravity knife into the water if only we were evenly matched seor but now that ive swallowed the dark stone it will be a poor showing he waded toward croaker perhaps on reflection it is better this way it will be over quickly i have much work remaining undone with each step antonio took croaker could see blood dark as pitch in the moonlight leaking from his side it spread out in the water like the diaphanous veils of a dancers costume croaker backed away you arent going to kill me like this antonio not now not yet theres something you want from me i dont think so seor antonio reached out and closed his hand around the extruded nails of croakers biomechanical hand blood continued to leak from the wound in his side but none spurted from his fingers dont bother denying it croaker could see that the small boat was drifting away from them in the periphery of his vision he saw rafes cat maneuvering to come alongside it from the beginning you said we were friends that wasnt true never but there was something a connection antonios fingers crept along the ridges of the stainlesssteel nails they were very close to croakers fleshandblood wrist what would happen when they touched him what kind of connection could there be seor detective that familiar derision had crept into antonios voice croaker knew he was onto something but he also knew hed better get to it before antonio touched him in truth he did not know whether he believed in the spiritstones ultimate sukia transformation but he had already seen some of its power at this time in this place he was not inclined to take the chance that the rest was pure fantasy croaker wanted to tug his hand away but something he could neither explain nor understand stopped him you yourself said there was a connection between sonia and rosa now i think theres something more antonio would not let go the feeling is inescapable seor through the chill of the storms aftermath croaker felt the heat emanating from antonios hand it crawled up croakers fleshandblood forearm just as antonios fingers were crawling over the back of croakers titanium and polycarbonate hand so it was all true antonio whispered just as heitor dreamed it the heat felt as if it were burning croakers flesh what did heitor dream that humait was returning on the wheel of the sun and the moon that he had touched the spirit of someone living someone we knew so he could sow the seeds of his revenge croaker felt an involuntary shiver of recognition shoot through him something i think you should know the moonlight picked out each aristocratic feature of antonios face accenting the bone structure so that it seemed possible to recognize other people thereancestors perhaps powerful in their own day but long buried the answer to your question seor i could have prevented rosas death but i would have had to kill heitor what croaker shook his head i dont understand humaits hetd i training was too much for bennie forever after he resented his grandfather if you ask him he will deny it of course this is bennie but believe me it is the truth antonios grip on croakers hand never relaxed in this way his life was changed but so was heitors the training brought out something sinister in him heitor had multiple personalities one of them was homicidal itand the othersexisted uneasily inside him submerged like lead in water until the hetd i training the drugs the fasting the neardeath experiences leached the other personalities to the surface and there they remained damning heitor to a kind of hell you and i can never imagine the bonitas the truth about them was even more horrific than the legend they had created antonio had hidden the fact of his twins personality disorder from everyoneperhaps even from heitor himself hed done his best to try to protect heitor but when the killing madness arose and heitor slipped his leash antonio was forced to protect him i could not stop him from killing rosa antonio said as if in a trance of remembrance or juan garcia barbacena but there was your guapayour woman he would have killed her too in his minds eye croaker could vividly see antonio pulling heitors hands away from jennys neck how could he feel profoundly grateful to this man and yet he did for antonio this overwhelming devotion to his twin had had the most profound price it had meant the death of bennies sister rosa perhaps the only person who could have saved him the only person hed ever loved and perhaps worst of all antonio had had to become an accomplice after the fact covering up the evidence of heitors crime croaker had no more time to consider the irony of this because his attention was caught by a familiar movement in the water an unnameable chill swept over him he watched the certain purling in the wave trough behind antonio farther out in whipray basin it was heading directly toward them his blood ran cold and for a moment he forgot all about the bonitas hed seen that signature water movement many times before he knew they were not alone in the bay seor que pasa croaker glanced at the blood spilling into the water from antonios side under the moonlight glare he followed it outward as the current took it farther into the bay oh christ he thought antonio let go of my hand never seor then were both going to die he ignored antonios disbelieving smirk theres a very large predator shark coming our way what else would you have me believe seor he laughed this water is too shallow for sharks normally yes croaker said he could see the dorsal fin the rough crown of the back it was very long jesus god he thought how the hell big is it but storms like this one disturb shark hunting patterns then theres the ton of blood leaking from your side combined with our thrashing the sharks got its own picture of whats going on here it thinks were prey in its death throes once it gets hold of us itll make that mistake a reality antonio took a quick glance down clapped his free hand over the wound too late croaker said now let go he looked into antonios amber eyes both boats are too far away swimming will only create more thrashing my hand is our only chance antonio turned slowly the beast was almost upon them ўmadre de mentiras he let go of croakers hand as they sank down into the water antonio said this shark is enormous seor that damned hand of yours wont save us but i have swallowed the world todo el mundo comprende under the water the world was striped pearl and black moonlight glowed in the depths reminding croaker of what stone tree had said this world is a lie beyond it the truth pulses like light on the ocean floor the shark swam into their view here was their truth it was a monster croaker estimated it must be over a thousand pounds it had caught the scent of blood all right and it was nosing forward accelerating as the blood became fresher as it passed through a patch of waterfiltered moonlight croaker saw that it was a tiger shark in size the twin of the one he and bennie had encountered five days ago something passed through him a kind of shiver like a lightning strike a tingling began at the base of his neck spreading upward into his scalp he is here inside you stone tree had said speaking of humait tonight you also walk with the spirits the tiger shark was so close so huge it became their world sharks were almost all cartilage one of the reasons they were so difficult to kill but if you were lucky enough to slit open their belly before they hit you might be okay unfortunately that was almost an impossibility instead croaker smashed the heel of his biomechanical hand against the beasts snout that should have discouraged it this shark however was different it shook its body from side to side veered away from croaker and headed directly toward antonio antonio stood his ground in an eerie way he seemed to be eager for this encounter perhaps it was only to demonstrate the power of his transformation but croaker did not think so how could he be sure but it seemed as if antonio saw in this tiger shark exactly what croaker did so antonio remained motionless as the living missile came on he extended his left arm like a healer about to bless a maimed pilgrim certain that one touch would extinguish its life the tiger sharks jaws opened and it was as if the moon had gone into eclipse there were few things in the world as terrifying as seeing the triple set of teeth coming headon nevertheless antonio did not flinch no fear showed on his face as the jaws clashed shut snapping off his arm from fingertips to shoulder croaker on his knees on the bay bottom lanced upward with the tips of his stainlesssteel fingernails at the perfect angle he used the beasts own forward momentum holding firm as the bladelike projections pierced the sharks underside the razorsharp nails split open the belly as the beast shot past antonio a swirl of blood and entrails muddied the water and at last croaker at the end of his endurance was pulled off his feet he jerked the nails free the shark turned but with its insides spilling out it was canted over drifting in an erratic pattern antonio was floating on the water when croaker reached him his amber eyes were halfglazed over in shock blood pumped in heavy gouts from where his left arm had been there was nothing at all croaker could do for him antonio the lean predatory head turned handsome as a god in the pale moonlight he smiled as he looked down at his limbless left side now truly we are the same seor youre mistaken antonio were nothing alike no no dont you see i never lied to you because the first time i met you i saw all the way down to your soul i recognized a man as cut off from his past as i was strangers in a strange present seor croaker held him closer feeling the life spilling out of him with every beat of his heart the amber eyes stared up at croaker with the full knowledge of what was to come antonio shivered seor i believe now i was damned in my mothers womb i embraced evil with full knowledge but always i tried to save heitor from himself my penance for both deeds is forever carrying rosas memory in my heart antonio loved rosa it was true croaker thought the enormity of the tragedy struck him antonio could have been saved by her if only he knew what love was antonio gasped suddenly and his good hand gripped croakers with a fierce strength it feels good to have her there now doesnt it croaker said yes i feel calm now he whispered here at last was the end of antonios search ever since rosas death he had been seeking the meaning of his feelings for her he had connected with her the way a shadow falls across a garden and is gone hed been a ghost in her life nothing more it was all hed been capable of but afterward hed found that she had touched him in a profound way he longed for that human connection again in whatever form it might come to him the first time i met you i saw all the way down to your soul this is the way rosa had changed antonio in severing mokoihis lifeline to heitorshe had shattered the hermetic seal within which the twins had existed in consequence an entire world full of possibilities had flooded in unprepared as he was to absorb those possibilities antonio had nevertheless been left with her imprint rosa had shown him that with times fleeting passage even the most improbable of human connections was to be cherished antonio had told his terrible secrethis and heitors secretto just one person croaker the only one he knew would understand the only one he felt something for croaker felt shaken to his core waves lapped at them and in the distance he could hear the cats mammoth engines rumbling as it slowly brought the smaller boat back to the area where they stood a wave of convulsions racked antonio he had very little time left but it didnt matter there was nothing left to say then croaker was staring into antonios dead eyes antonios corpse rocked on the waves floating facedown in the shallow water in its pool of blood croaker remembering jennys spiritstoneinduced vision let him go he dove back under the water it seemed important now to retrieve antonios gravity knife as if allowing any trace of him to remain here was a sin he recalled stone tree telling him that it wasnt death that awaited him in the backcountry it was something else now he knew improbably there were gifts that antonio and croaker were destined to bestow upon each other he had shown antonio that he could be loved and what in return had antonio given him antonio had loved his brother unconditionally that was what it meant to have family for croaker that had been a hard lesson to learn a movement out of the corner of his eye made him turn his head he saw the shark it was still swimming slowly but less erratically than it had before it was a miracle that it was still alive what could be left inside it but its breathing apparatus but that was its nature until the moment of death it needed to move forward so water could flow through its gills keeping one eye on it croaker searched the moonlit bottom for the gravity knife he spotted it in a rippled lozenge of moonlight it lay on the bottom propped against a rock from which tendrils of seaweed curled like oily smoke he was obliged to swim closer to the mortally wounded shark in order to get it this he did as slowly as he could he held his stainlesssteel nails at the ready though how else he could wound the beast he was at a loss to say the shark sensed him it came forward croaker tensed on it came through darkness and moonlight when it was very near him it paused then with a weak flick of its tail it sheered away from him as it turned croaker caught a glimpse of one eye a shock ran through him and he felt numbed to his marrow maybe he was nuts but it seemed to him as if that round eye had two pupils epilogue un a sultry cloudless afternoon six weeks later croaker completed his final check of the captain sumo as it lay tied up at his marina in islamorada he was not alone on board were bennie matty jenny and rachel they were all together to celebrate rachels first full day out of the house shed been home for almost two weeks and had begun to drive matty crazy because she was itching to get up and around by that time dictrib was just a memory ross darling the last remaining operative of rank had been captured in a sting croaker had dreamed up it was based on simple necessity darling needed to debrief croaker to find out what had happened to antonio and heitor without piecing together the cause of their deaths he could never consolidate his power within the agency croaker had no way of contacting darling but that was okay because he knew darling would come after him at the first possible opportunity this had happened on a stormcharged afternoon a week after croaker and bennie emerged from the everglades they had been drinking espressos at the boneyard antonio and heitors club on lincoln road in sobe hed wanted to see it croaker had told bennie because it was where rachel had collapsed but inside he felt oddly nostalgic as if he was somehow closer to antonio darlings men had picked them up there and by black lincoln had deposited them in the future car park below a concrete and steel skeleton of a hotel on collins avenue there they rendezvoused with ross darling it had taken the actf who had been carefully monitoring their movements five minutes to secure the car park and take darling and his agents into custody that was when croaker had met spaulding gunn the director of the actf for the first time he was a man of modest stature grayhaired and balding with steelrimmed spectacles and a neatly groomed beard he looked like nothing more than a college professor but when he spoke that image immediately vanished by god hed said to croaker its good to finally shake your hand as croaker worked on the boat he kept one eye on the dock lew matty called when are we getting under way croaker saw she was helping bennie stow the food for lunch rachel was at the other end of the boat mother and daughter hadnt said two words to each other since rachel had decided to tell her about gideon soon as i finish here he turned as jennys arms slid around his waist what were you thinking just now nothing you looked so serious she cocked her head skeptically was it about majeur it was touchandgo for a while but hes responding well to rehab actually i was thinking about my time in the service of the us government cmon lew she hugged him no gloomy thoughts this is supposed to be a coming out party for rachel funny you should say that he said spotting a slim figure on the dock taking jennys hand he led her to the dock side of the boat someone i want you to meet gideon came toward them in her hipswaying walk her hair shone pale gold in the sun she was wearing a pair of cutoff denim shorts which shed dyed black and an oversize buffalo brand tshirt whose sleeves she had snipped to the shoulders she was barefoot and she carried an acoustic guitar on her back as if shed hitchhiked down us from miami she saw croaker and waved her stack of beatencopper and beadwork bracelets jangled happily hi she half ran to the boat thanks for inviting me that was sweet she was wearing revo sunglasses she took them off displaying her catseye contacts croaker laughed gideon this is jenny rachies doctor i know gideon stuck out her hand and jenny took it pleasure to meet you the pleasures all mine jenny said rachies told me a lot about you it seemed to croaker almost as if gideon blushed as they brought her on board rachel looked up she stood in her huge sunglasses she looked as thin and pale as kate moss how long has it been croaker asked havent even smoked pot inwhatmore than a month gideons giving up drugs had been croakers one stipulation for her continuing to see rachel are you doing okay jenny asked gideon laughed dont look so concerned doc amazing as it is to me being clean as a cats whisker has distinct advantages while matty watched stonefaced rachel melted into gideons arms gideon swung her around in what could only be termed gentle exuberance matty walked over to croaker carefully avoiding the two girls i suppose this was your idea as well croaker had counseled his niece to come out to her mother i thought you were fed up being shut out i am but this matty your daughter has her own life to live the sooner you accept that the sooner shell let you into it matty gestured but what kind of life is this what can she expect from it someone to love and cherish her right now that seems to be a good deal more than you have matty walked away silent and thoughtful what do you think shell do jenny asked he turned to her what would you do if rachel were your daughter jenny hopped onto the dock and cast off the lines while he started the engine hed taken her out a number of times in the past month and found her a quick study she loved to learn and was justly proud of her sea legs she jumped on board and croaker backed the captain sumo out of her berth id want her to be happy jenny said as she joined croaker at the wheel so does matty deep down thats all shes ever wanted he maneuvered the boat around took her at slow out of the marina some time later matty came aft bennie was sitting in a captains chair smoking a cigar as he chatted with jenny he must have been telling her some of his stories because she was laughing a lot rachel and gideon were lying side by side on the bow deep in conversation matty stared at the two girls i dont think i can do it if you cant you cant she looked at him sharply thats an attitude i never expected from you whats that defeatist matty what is it you want i want you to convince me this is right for rachel he turned captain sumo to port heading out to sea i cant do that why not thats not my job in life matty even as your brother brilliant sunlight sent dazzling sparks across the wave tops the breeze was fresh and strong it made croaker wish they were on rafes big cat with the engines off and the sails full out it was a spinnaker kind of afternoon when running before the wind could make you fly at last he said i can see a lot of selfhatred inside rachel you can too youre not blind maybe gideon can get through to that walledoff place inside her i dont know but look whats happened to the two of you donald put the fear of god into you you stopped talking to rachel i talk to her all the time matty said defensively she simply doesnt want to listen then you keep trying matty shook her head what if that doesnt work there are no guarantees in life he said but i know this if you dont talk to each other youll have nothing when they were far out at sea bennie served lunch it was uncharacteristic of him to be so domestic but he seemed to be enjoying himself so croaker refrained from commenting during croakers first week at the nypd precinct his commander had addressed the rookies hed said you may come to hate your life here i wouldnt be surprised if at times it angered you you may even learn to like it but one thing i can assure you a year from now you wont be the same man or woman you are today thats the best and only advice i can give you for what youre about to encounter remember it embrace it and youll be okay guaranteed it occurred to croaker now that everyone on the captain sumo had changed including himself while the others talked croaker watched rachel and gideon there was an animation to his nieces face that warmed him to the marrow perhaps coming out to her mother was part of it there were enough secrets in the family without having to shoulder another one croaker had spent some time with her when hed handed over her diary mutely shed known that he had read it in her eyes he could see that relief she could not bring herself to articulate and when hed said to her this is between you and matty shed nodded you have to show her the entries hed said you have to talk about it openly theres no longer any room inside you to hold it in that moment hadnt happened yetit was too soon for both of them but croaker knew it would next week next month soon watching her now in the brilliant sunlight it seemed to him that she had for a long time dwelled in the dark and evil place known as isolation having begun to emerge she had done more than just survive he could see that transformations were not only for sukia matty had seated herself beside gideon midway through the meal they had begun to talk stiffly at firstan odd combination of wariness and formality but as the lunch went on their conversation had become more natural at some point rachel had noticed how hard her mother was trying and seemed a shade less hostile to her for dessert bennie served a huge triplelayer chocolate cakerachels favorite it said welcome back rack in yellow frosting across the top and was decorated with green and yellow stars it was so good everybody had two pieces while bennie served the second helpings rachel came up behind croaker and put her arms around him thanks uncle lew she whispered in his ear for everything when he reached up and kissed her cheek he felt hot tears in his eyes after lunch bennie went aft to smoke another cigar croaker joined him ever since you gave me the bones you found on rafes boat i cant like stop thinking about my grandfather bennie blew a soft stream of smoke that was borne away on the wind even before that maybe he was silent for a long time and croaker thought of what antonio had said humaitds heta i training was too much for bennie forever after he resented his grandfather at last croaker said a force of nature was waiting for us isnt that what you said bennie humait was that all right bennie stared at the glowing end of his cigar and shook his head in wonderment see it was an amazing thing what you told me about you know the tiger shark in whipray bay i mean what the hell was it doing there could have been following tin can channel i suppose waters deeper there but still it wasnt like a natural occurrence he sucked on his cigar it went after antonio that beast like it was looking for him like it had a debt to settle could have if it wanted to chewed you down to like dog meat but it didnt the curious thing was i had no fear of it croaker said to have no fear of a shark bennie took the cigar out of his mouth thats fucking something to keep in your mind forever i feel as if your grandfathers spirit has been hovering over my shoulder ever since you and i took on the first tiger shark a small smile spread across croakers face he was there with me at the end bennie crazy as it seems i know its true i have no doubt amigo bennie held up his hand and croaker grasped it cause see hes with me now they looked at each other for a long moment and something unseen passed between them some brilliant spark that transcended speech and memory at length bennie nodded the truth lewis i wish to god i had known him better in those days he wanted something for me i didnt for his sake i tried but as a healer i was no good money and power that was my meat i wasnt interested in spiritual things he knew it and didnt like blame me bennie took another puff of his cigar but see the thing of it is i blamed him hed been real tough on me and i couldnt you know get it i thought he was one hardhearted sonuvabitch so did antonio croaker had told bennie some of what antonio had said but not all secrets were meant to be kept bennie nodded yeah i suppose it would seem like that to any boy going through hetd i training its only in like my memory that i can see what he needed to do with us believe me amigo i rue the day i walked away from him his expression grew uncharacteristically dark you know i its as if ive convinced myself that if id like stayed id have prevented his murder you cant know that more probably youd have been killed too bennie shrugged anythings possible amigo but hed said it in a way that made it clear he still blamed himself he pointed with his cigar this was a neat idea you know all the people you love together family croaker said he thought of what antonio had said the first time i met you i saw all the way down to your soul i recognized a man as cut off from his past as i was transformation was just another word for healing croaker thought speaking of which bennie said croaker turned his head what family bennie took the cigar out of his mouth speaking of family im going back to asuncion sunday croaker said for how long the truth i dont know he clapped croaker on the back no long faces amigo you had a hand in my decision when you gave me humaits bones i realized what i needed to do with them was return them to the paraguay youll bury them in the river bennie looked out to sea at first i thought i would then i thought not theyre too great a gift he turned back to croaker smiled see i realized i can no longer like do what ive been doing too much has happened for me to like go back at first i thought i was just you know in need of a rest but now i know better im not the bennie i was seven weeks ago the old things i used to covet he shrugged what to do now i asked myself then i realized the answer was staring me right in the face he beckoned and together they went into the cabin croaker saw an old scuffed and scarred leather gladstone bag bennie pulled it out from underneath a bench he opened it and took out a large bone it looked like a femur it was smooth and warmlooking the buttery sunlight lent it the color of ivory the first time i touched them the bones told me just as if my grandfather was you know still alive reverently he put the bone back inside the bag fastened the brass hasp he turned to croaker see im going back to study the bones will help me a library of knowledge is stored inside them im going to find a sukia and learn hetd i its what humait always wanted for you no amigo bennie ushered croaker back out on deck its what i want for myself croaker could hear gideon picking out a tune on her guitar she began to sing he recognized a sarah mclachlan song fumbling towards ecstasy croaker looked out the window to the west was the everglades the backcountry before you go he said why dont we pay another visit to stone tree i think hed appreciate seeing humaits bones one healer to another eh amigo croaker could see that this suggestion made bennie happy bueno bennie said i owe him a great debt we both do croaker said jenny stuck her head into the open companionway okay for a little company as they came back on deck she slid her arm around croakers waist or is this conversation confidential croaker hugging her to him was looking at rachel she was deep in conversation with her mother there was something about them limned by the green water and the bright sun at this distance they might have been sisters or even twins confidential croaker gazed into jennys eyes they were almost the same astonishing color as the ocean i dont think theres much need of that around here anymore
