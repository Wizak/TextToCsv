elric at the end of time book of elric by michael moorcock contents introduction elric elric at the end of time the last enchantment the secret life of elric of melnibone sojan the swordsman jerry cornelius and co new worldsjerry cornelius in lighter vein the stone thing introduction elric at the end of time was the last story i wrote about the albino prince in some ways its an affec tionate commentary on the kind of fantasy hero with whom im most closely identified and its also based on the remark made some years ago by m john harrison that the people who inhabit my end of time stories might from elrics perspective seem to be the very lords of chaos themselves the story brings together elements from most of the series which by the midseventies i was completing it was finished in originally for a book which big o intended to publish and which rodney matthews would illustrate big o effectively folded before the book could appear the rodney matthews paintings all exist but only a few of them have been seen which is a great pity since they represent some of his best and most ambitious work the only previous ap pearance of the story was in terri windlings and mark arnolds elsewhere anthology which came out in the usa in the last enchantment was meant to be the final elric story it was written in only a short while after the first had appeared in magazine form and before i wrote what was to become stormbringer i gave the story to ted carnell for his magazine sci ence fantasy but he didnt want a last elric story he persuaded me to write some more novellas and in his capacity as my agent sent the last enchantment to america where it was rejected some fifteen years later teds successor les flood came across the story and returned it to me it eventually appeared in ariel magazine in the us in illustrated by tim conrad that was its only publication until now like elric at the end of time it has never been pub lished in england and this is its first appearance in book form the sojan stories are my first fantasy tales to be professionally published they were begun in the s for tarzan adventures before i came to edit the magazine i was seventeen when they started to appear and they were not published in book form until dave britton and mike butterworth republished them as sojan the first book they did as savoy edi tions it was reillustrated by jim cawthorn the origi nal illustrator who has worked with me through my whole career as a writer of fantastic fiction this book was primarily a compendium of my earliest work together with some of my writing about my own fiction and i have included one or two other pieces from sojan here the stone thing was written in response to a re quest from eric bentcliffe editor of the fanzine triode which i used to write for in the fifties it is one of several parodies of my own work which ive done over the years some of which it could be argued were not published as such and its one im par ticularly fond of triode specialised in humorous fan fictionstories written about actual personalities in the sf fieldand dates from the period in which science fiction fans did not take themselves quite so seriously as nowadays and those who made religion from an enthusiasm were generally mocked for it i hope the story itself will show some readers that i am neither in touch with secret supernatural forces nor the spokesman for an illuminating new mystical knowledge as a matter of fact im by nature ex traordinarily sceptical of the supernatural i have always conceived my fantastic stories simply as that fantastic stories escapist entertainment which hopes to give some pleasure to the reader any profundi ties in those romances are a tribute to the one who discovers them rather than to me for a long while the exaggerated reaction of some readers to my fan tasies caused me to try to dismiss them altogether however i should like to say that i denigrate nei ther the stories nor their readers though i do prefer my comedies to my melodramas and personally would put a greater value on books such as gloriana the condition of muzak byzantium endures or the brothel in rosenstrasse ive always had a happy facility for fantasy and i suppose its common enough for some one to make less of something which comes easily to them some of the nonfiction pieces about elric and co which were in the original sojan selection edited by dave britton are still here for whatever interest they provide i have dave britton and mike butterworth to thank for many things not least their willingness to sift through longforgotten piles of paper and find manuscripts and tearsheets the golden barge would never have been published had it not been for their retaining a copy of the manuscript which i had thought permanently lost and i should also like to recognise once again ted carnells encouragement as the editor of my first elric stories peter ledeboers kindness as the publisher who originally commis sioned the title story as a vehicle for rodney mat thews illustrations the present publishers alison peacock simon scott and nick webb of nel and the encouragement inspiration and friendship of many people amongst them jim cawthorn eric bentcliffe ron bennett alan dodd arthur thom son and ethel lindsay who have known me since as an enthusiastic and im sure sometimes irritating fifteenyearold i first began to write the sojan stories michael moorcock fulham road july elric elric at the end of time in which mrs persson detects an above average degree of chaos in the megaflow returning from china to london and the spring of una persson found an unfamiliar quality of pathos in most of the friends she had last seen as far as she recalled during the blitz on her way back from then they had been desperately hearty it was a comfort to understand that the condition was not permanent here at present pierrot ruled and she felt she possessed a better grip on her power this was she admitted with shame her favourite moral climate for it encouraged in her an enormously gratifying sense of spiritual superiority the advan tage of having been born originally into a later and probably more sophisticated age the s some women she reflected were forced to have children in order to enjoy this pleasure but she was uneasy so she reported to the local time centre and the bearded sullen features of ser geant alvarez who welcomed her in white apologis ing for the fact that he had himself only just that morning left the lower devonian and had not had time to change its the megaflow as you guessed he told her operating toggles to reveal his crazy display sys tems weve lost control we never really had it she lit a shermans and shook her long hair back over the headrest of the swivel chair opening her military overcoat and loos ening her webbing is it worse than usual much he sipped cold coffee from his battered silver mug it cuts through every plane we can pick upa rogue current swerving through the dimen sions something of a twister jerry hes dormant we checked but its like him certainly most probably another aspect oh sod una straightened her shoulders thats what i thought said alvarez some ones going to have to do a spot of rubato he studied a screen it was greek to una for a moment a pattern formed alvarez made a note yes it can either be fixed at the nadir or the zenith its too late to try anywhere in between i think its up to you mrs p she got to her feet wheres the zenith the end of time well she said thats something she opened her bag and made sure of her jar of instant coffee it was the one thing she couldnt get at the end of time sorry said alvarez glad that the expert had been there and that he could remain behind its just as well she said this periods no good for my moral wellbeing ill be off then someones got to alvarez failed to seem sym pathetic its chaos out there you dont have to tell me she entered the makeshift chamber and was on her way to the end of time in which the eternal champion finds himself at the end of time elric of melnibone shook a bonewhite fist at the greedy glaring starsthe eyes of all those men whose souls he had stolen to sustain his own enfeebled body he looked down though it seemed he stood on something solid there was only more blackness falling away below him it was as if he hung at the centre of the universe and here too were staring points of yellow light was he to be judged his halfsentient runesword stormbringer in its scabbard on his left hip murmured like a nervous dog he had been on his way to imrryr to his home to reclaim his kingdom from his cousin yyrkoon sail ing from the isle of the purple towns where he had guested with count smiorgan baldhead magic winds had caught the filkharian trader as she crossed the unnamed water between the vilmirian peninsula and the isle of melnibone she had been borne into the dragon sea and thence to the sorcerers isle so called because that barren place had once been the home of cran liret the thief of spells a wizard infamous for his borrowings who had at length been dispatched by those he sought to rival but much residual magic had been left behind certain spells had come into the keeping of the krettii a tribe of nearbrutes who had migrated to the island from the region of the silent land less than fifty years before their shaman one grrodd ybene eenr had made unthinking use of devices buried by the dying sorcerer as the spells of his peers sucked life and sanity from them elric had dealt with more than one clever wizard but never with so mindless a power his battle had been long and exhausting and had required the sacrifice of most of the filkharians as well as the entire tribe of krettii his sorcery had become increasingly desperate sprite fought sprite devil fell upon devil in planes both physical and astral all around the region of the sorcerers isle eventually elric had mounted a massive summoning against the allies of grrodd ybene eenr with the result that the shaman had been at last overwhelmed and his remains scattered in limbo but elric cap tured by his own monstrous magickings had fol lowed his enemy and now he stood in the void crying out into appalling silence hearing his words only in his skull arioch arioch aid me but his patron duke of hell was absent he could not exist here he could not for once even hear his favourite protege arioch repay my loyalty i have given you blood and souls he did not breathe his heart had stopped all his movements were sluggish the eyes looked down at him they looked up at him were they glad did they rejoice in his terror arioch he yearned for a reply he would have wept but no tears would come his body was cold less than dead yet not alive a fear was in him greater than any fear he had known before oh arioch aid me he forced his right hand towards the pulsing pom mel of stormbringer which alone still possessed energy the hilt of the sword was warm to his touch and as slowly he folded his fingers around it it seemed to swell in his fist and propel his arm up wards so that he did not draw the sword rather the sword forced his limbs into motion and now it challenged the void glowing with black fire singing its high gleeful battlesong our destinies are intertwined stormbringer said elric bring us from this place or those destinies shall never be fulfilled stormbringer swung like the needle of a compass and elrics unfeeling arm was wrenched round to go with it in eight directions the sword swung as if to the eight points of chaos it was questinglike a hound sniffing a trail then a yell sounded from within the strange metal of the blade a distant cry of delight it seemed to elric the sound one would hear if one stood above a valley listening to children playing far below elric knew that stormbringer had sensed a plane they might reach not necessarily their own but one which would accept them and as a drowning mari ner must yearn for the most inhospitable rock rather than no rock at all elric yearned for that plane stormbringer take us there the sword hesitated it moaned it was suspicious take us there whispered the albino to his rune sword the sword struck back and forth up and down as if it battled invisible enemies elric scarcely kept his grip on it it seemed that stormbringer was fright ened of the world it had detected and sought to drive it back but the act of seeking had in itself set them both in motion already elric could feel him self being drawn through the darkness towards some thing he could see very dimly beyond the myriad eyes as dawn reveals clouds undetected in the night sky elric thought he saw the shapes of crags pointed and crazy he thought he saw water flat and ice blue the stars faded and there was snow beneath his feet mountains all around him a huge blazing sun overheadand above that another landscape a desert as a magic mirror might reflect the contrasting character of he who peered into ita desert quite as real as the snowy peaks in which he crouched sword in hand waiting for one of these landscapes to fade so that he might establish to a degree his bearings evidently the two planes had intersected but the landscape overhead did not fade he could look up and see sand mountains vegetation a sky which met his own sky at a point halfway along the curve of the huge sunand blended with it he looked about him snowy peaks in all directions abovedesert everywhere he felt dizzy found that he was staring downward reaching to cup some of the snow in his hand it was ordinary snow though it seemed reluctant to melt in contact with his flesh this is a world of chaos he muttered it obeys no natural laws his voice seemed loud amplified by the peaks perhaps that is why you did not want to come here this is the world of powerful rivals stormbringer was silent as if all its energy were spent but elric did not sheath the blade he began to trudge through the snow toward what seemed to be an abyss every so often he glanced upward but the desert overhead had not faded sun and sky remained the same he wondered if he walked around the surface of a miniature world that if he contin ued to go forward he might eventually reach the point where the two landscapes met he wondered if this were not some punishment wished upon him by his untrustworthy allies of chaos perhaps he must choose between death in the snow or death in the desert he reached the edge of the abyss and looked down the walls of the abyss fell for all of five feet before reaching a floor of gold and silver squares which stretched for perhaps another seven feet before they reached the far wall where the landscape continued snow and cragsuninterrupted this is undoubtedly where chaos rules said the prince of melnibone he studied the smooth chequered floor it reflected parts of the snowy ter rain and the desert world above it it reflected the crimsoneyed albino who peered down at it his fea tures drawn in bewilderment and tiredness i am at their mercy said elric they play with me but i shall resist them even as they destroy me and some of his wild careless spirit came back to him as he prepared to lower himself onto the chequered floor and cross to the opposite bank he was halfway over when he heard a grunting sound in the distance and a beast appeared its paws slithering uncertainly on the smooth surface its seven savage eyes glaring in all directions as if it sought the instigator of its terrible indignity and at last all seven eyes focused on elric and the beast opened a mouth in which row upon row of thin vicious teeth were arranged and uttered a growl of unmistakable resentment elric raised his sword back creature of chaos you threaten the prince of melnibone the beast was already propelling itself towards him elric flung his body to one side aiming a blow with the sword as he did so succeeding only in making a thin incision in the monsters heavily mus cled hind leg it shrieked and began to turn back elrics voice was the brave thin squeak of a lem ming attacked by a hawk he drove at the things snout with stormbringer the sword was heavy it had spent all its energy and there was no more to give elric wondered why he himself did not weaken possibly the laws of nature were entirely abolished in the realm of chaos he struck and drew blood the beast paused more in astonishment than fear then it opened its jaws pushed its back legs against the snowy bank and shot towards the albino who tried to dodge it lost his footing and fell sprawling backwards on the gold and silver surface in which una persson discovers an unexpected snag the gigantic beetle rainbow carapace glittering turned as if into the wind which blew from the distant mountains its thick flashing wings beating rapidly as it bore its single passenger over the queer landscape on its back mrs persson checked the instruments on her wrist ever since man had begun to travel in time it had become necessary for the league to de velop techniques to compensate for the fluctuations and disruptions in the spacetime continua perpetu ally monitoring the chronoflow and megaflow she pursed her lips she had picked up the signal she made the semisentient beetle swing a degree or two sse and head directly for the mountains she was in some sort of enclosed environment these mountains as well as everything surrounding them lay in the territory most utilised by the gloomy naturalborn werther de goethe poet and romantic solitary seeker after truth in a world no longer differ entiating between the degrees of reality he would not remember her she knew because as far as werther was concerned they had not met yet he had not even if una were correct experienced his adventure with mistress christia the everlasting con cubine a story on which she had dined out more than once in duller eras the mountains drew closer from here it was pos sible to see the entire arrangement a creation of werthers very much in character a desert land scape a central sun and inverted above it winter mountains werther strove to make statements like so many naive artists before him by presenting sim ple contrasts the world is bleakthe world is coldbarren am i as i grow oldtomorrow i die entombed in coldfor silver my poor soul was sold she remembered he was perhaps the worst poet she had encountered in an eternity of meetings with bad poets he had taught himself to read and write in old old english so that he might carve those words on one of his many abandoned tombs half his time was spent in composing obituaries for himself like so many others he seemed to equate selfpity with artistic inspiration in an earlier age he might have discovered his public and become quite rich self pity passing for passion in the popular understand ing sometimes she regretted the passing of whel drake so long ago so far away in a universe bearing scarcely any resemblances to those in which she normally operated she brought her wavering mind back to the prob lem the beetle dipped and circled over the desert but there was no sight of her quarry she was about to abandon the search when she heard a faint roaring overhead and she looked up to see another characteristic motif of werthersa gold and silver chessboard on which upside down a monstrous doglike creature was bearing down on a tiny whitehaired man dressed in the most abomina ble taste una had seen for some time she directed the aircar upwards and then revers ing the machine as she entered the opposing grav ity downwards to where the barbarically costumed swordsman was about to be eaten by the beast shoo cried una commandingly the beast raised a befuddled head shoo it licked lips and returned its seveneyed gaze to the albino who was now on his knees using his large sword to steady himself as he climbed to his feet the jaws opened wider and wider the pale man prepared shakily to defend himself una directed the aircar at the beasts unkempt head the great beetle connected with a loud crack the monsters eyes widened in dismay it yelped it sat on its haunches and began to slide away its claws making an unpleasant noise on the gold and silver tiles una landed the aircar and gestured for the stranger to enter she noticed with distaste that he was a somewhat unhealthy looking albino with gaunt fea tures exaggeratedly large and slanting eyes ears that were virtually pointed and glaring halfmad red pupils and yet undoubtedly it was her quarry and there was nothing for it but to be polite do please get in she said i am here to res cue you shaarmraaam torjistoo quellahm vyeeanr said the stranger in an accent that seemed to una to be vaguely scottish damn she said thats all we need she had been anxious to approach the albino in private be fore one of the denizens of the end of time could arrive and select him for a menagerie but now she regretted that werther or perhaps lord jagged were not here for she realised that she needed one of their translation pills those tiny tablets which could engineer the brain to understand a new language by a flukeor perhaps because of her presence here so oftenthe people at the end of time currently spoke formal early twentiethcentury english the albinowho wore a kind of tartan divided kilt kneelength boots a blue and white jerkin a green cloak and a silver breastplate with a variety of leather belts and metal buckles here and there upon his personwas vehemently refusing her offer of a lift he raised the sword before him as he backed away slipped once reached the bank scrambled through snow and disappeared behind a rock mrs persson sighed and put the car into motion again in which the prince of melnibone encounters further terrors xiombarg herself thought elric as he slid beneath the snows into the cave well he would have no dealings with the queen of chaos not until he was forced to do so the cave was large in the thin light from the gap above his head he could not see far he wondered whether to return to the surface or risk going deeper into the cave there was always the hope that he would find another way out he was attempting to recall some rune that would aid him but all he knew depended either upon the aid of elementals who did not exist on this plane or upon the lords of chaos themselvesand they were unlikely to come to his assistance in their own realm he was marooned here the single mouse in a world of cats almost unconsciously he found himself moving downwards realising that the cave had become a tunnel he was feeling hungry but apart from the monster and the woman in the magical carriage had seen no sign of life even the cavern did not seem entirely natural it widened there was phosphorescent light he realised that the walls were of transparent crystal and behind the walls were all manner of artefacts he saw crowns sceptres and chains of precious jew els cabinets of complicated carving weapons of strangely turned metal armour clothing things whose use he could not guessand food there were sweetmeats fruits flans and pies all out of reach elric groaned this was torment perhaps deliber ately planned torment a thousand voices whispered to him in a beautiful alien language biemeee biemeee the voices murmured baagen baa gen they seemed to be promising every delight if only he could pass through the walls but they were of transparent quartz lit from within he raised stormbringer halftempted to try to break down the barrier but he knew that even his sword was at its most powerful incapable of destroying the magic of chaos he paused gaping with astonishment at a group of small dogs which looked at him with large brown eyes tongues lolling and jumped up at him o nee tubbens intoned one of the voices gods screamed elric this torture is too much he swung his body this way and that threatening with his sword but the voices continued to murmur and promise displaying their riches but never allow ing him to touch the albino panted his crimson eyes glared about him you would drive me insane eh well elric of melnibone has witnessed more frightful threats than this you will need to do more if you would destroy his mind and he ran through the whispering passages look ing to neither his right nor his left until quite sud denly he had run into blazing daylight and stood staring down into pale infinitya blue and endless void he looked up and he screamed overhead were the gentle hills and dales of a rural landscape with rivers grazing cattle woods and cottages he expected to fall headlong but he did not he was on the brink of the abyss the cliffface of red sandstone fell immediately below and then was the tranquil void he looked back baagen o nee tubbens a bitter smile played about the albinos bloodless lips as decisively he sheathed his sword well then he said let them do their worst and laughing he launched himself over the brink of the cliff in which werther de goethe makes a wonderful discovery with a gesture of quiet pride werther de goethe indicated his gigantic skull it is very large werther said mistress christia the everlasting concubine turning a power ring to adjust the shade of her eyes so that they perfectly matched the day it is monstrous said werther modestly it re minds us all of the inevitable night who was that enquired goldenhaired gaf the horse in tears at present studying ancient legendry sir lew grady i mean death werther told him which over whelms us all well not us pointed out the duke of queens as usual a trifle literal minded because were im mortal as you know werther offered him a sad pitying look and sighed briefly retain your delusions if you will mistress christia stroked the gloomy werthers long dark locks there there she said we have compensations werther without death intoned the last romantic there is no point to life as usual they could not follow him but they nodded gravely and politely the skull continued werther stroking the side of his aircar which was in the shape of a large flying reptile to make it circle and head for the left eye socket is a symbol not only of our morality but also of our fruitless ambitions fruit bishop castle drowsing at the rear of the vehicle became interested his hobby was currently orchards less my pinetrees you know are prov ing a problem the apples are much smaller than i was led to believe the skull is lovely said mistress christia with valiant enthusiasm well now that we have seen it the outward shell werther told her it is what it hides which is more important mans foolish yearnings are all encompassed therein his greed his need for the impossible the heat of his pas sions the coldness which must finally overtake him through this eyesocket you will encounter a little invention of my own called the bargain base ment of the mind he broke off in astonishment on the top edge of the eyesocket a tiny figure had emerged whats that enquired the duke of queens cran ing his head back a random thought it is not mine at all the figure launched itself into the sky and seemed to fly with flailing limbs towards the sun werther frowned watching the tiny man disap pear the gravity field is reversed there he said absently in order to make the most of the paradox you understand there is a snowscape a desert but he was much more interested in the newcomer how do you think he got into my skull at least hes enjoying himself he seems to be laughing mistress christia bent an ear towards the thin sound which grew fainter and fainter at first but became louder again hes coming back werther nodded yes the fields no longer re versed he touched a power ring the laughter stopped and became a yell of rage the figure hurtled down on them it had a sword in one white hand and its red eyes blazed hastily werther stroked another ring the stranger tumbled into the bottom of the aircar and lay there panting cursing and groaning how wonderful cried werther oh this is a traveller from some rich romantic past look at him what else could he be what a prize the stranger rose to his feet and raised the sword high above his head defying the amazed and de lighted passengers as he screamed at the top of his voice heegeegrowinaz good afternoon said mistress christia she reached in her purse for a translation pill and found one i wonder if you would care to swallow this its quite harmless yakooom oom glallio said the albino contemptu ously aha said mistress christia well just as you please the duke of queens pointed towards the other socket a huge whirring beetle came sailing from it in its back was someone he recognised with plea sure mrs persson una brought her aircar alongside is he in your charge asked werther with undisguised disappointment if so i could offer you im afraid he means a lot to me she said from your own age mistress christia also recognised una she still offered the translation pill in the palm of her hand he seems a mite suspi cious of us id noticed said una it would be useful if he would accept the pill however if he will not one of us i would be happy offered the generous duke of queens he tugged at his green and gold beard werther de goethe mrs persson perhaps i had better said una nodding to werther the only problem with translation pills was that they did their job so thoroughly you could speak the language perfectly but you could speak no other werther was for once positive lets all take a pill he suggested everyone at the end of time carried translation pills in case of meeting a visitor from space or the past mistress christia handed hers to una and found another they swallowed creatures of chaos said the newcomer with cool dignity i demand that you release me you cannot hold a mortal in this way not unless he has struck a bargain with you and no bargain was struck which would bring me to the realm of chaos its actually more orderly than youd think said werther apologetically your first experience you see was the world of my skull which was deliber ately muddled i meant to show what confusion was the mind of man may i introduce mistress christia the everlast ing concubine said the duke of queens on his best manners this is mrs persson bishop castle gaf the horse in tears werther de goetheyour unwitting hostand i am the duke of queens we welcome you to our world your name sir you must know me my lord duke said elric for i am elric of melnibone emperor by right of birth inheritor of the ruby throne bearer of the actorios wielder of the black sword indeed said werther de goethe in a whispered aside to mrs persson what a marvellous scowl what a noble sneer you are an important personage in your world then said mistress christia fluttering the eyelashes she had just extended by half an inch perhaps you would allow me i think he wishes to be returned to his home said mrs persson hastily returned werther was astonished but the morphail effect it is impossible not in this case i think she said for if he is not returned there is no telling the fluctuations which will take place throughout the dimensions they could not follow her but they accepted her tone aye said elric darkly return me to my realm so that i may fulfill my own doomladen destiny werther looked upon the albino with affectionate delight aha a fellow spirit i too have a doom laden destiny i doubt it is as doomladen as mine elric peered moodily back at the skull as the two aircars fled away towards a gentle horizon where exotic trees bloomed well said werther with an effort perhaps it is not though i assure you i have looked upon hellborn horror said elric and communicated with the very gods of the ut termost darkness i have seen things which would turn other mens minds to useless jelly jelly interrupted bishop castle do you in your turn have any expertise with for instance blackbird trees your words are meaningless elric told him glowering why do you torment me so my lords i did not ask to visit your world i belong in the world of men in the young kingdoms where i seek my weird why i have but lately experienced adven tures i do think we have one of those bores mur mured bishop castle to the duke of queens so common amongst timetravellers they all believe themselves unique but the duke of queens refused to be drawn he had developed a liking for the frowning albino gaf the horse in tears was also plainly impressed for he had fashioned his own features into a rough likeness of elrics the prince of melnibone pretended insouciance but it was evident to una that he was frightened she tried to calm him people here at the end of time she began no soft words my lady a cynical smile played about the albinos lips i know you for that great unholy temptress queen of the swords xiombarg herself i assure you i am as human as you sir human i human i am not human madam though i be a mortal tis true i am of older blood the blood of the bright empire itself the blood of rlin kren aa which cran liret mocked not under standing what it was he laughed at aye though forced to summon aid from chaos i made no bar gain to become a slave in your realm i assure youumyour majesty said una that we had not meant to insult you and your presence here was no doing of ours i am as it happens a stranger here myself i came especially to see you to help you escape ha said the albino i have heard such words before you would lure me into some worse trap than this tell me where is duke arioch he at least i owe some allegiance to we have no one of that name apologised mis tress christia she enquired of gaf who knew ev eryone no timetraveller none gaf studied elrics eyes and made a small adjustment to his own he sat back satisfied elric shuddered and turned away mumbling you are very welcome here said werther i cannot tell you how glad i am to meet one as essen tially morbid and selfpitying as myself elric did not seem flattered what can we do to make you feel at home asked mistress christia she had changed her hair to a rather glossy blue in the hope perhaps that elric would find it more attractive is there anything you need need aye peace of mind knowledge of my true destiny a quiet place where i can be with cymoril whom i love what does this cymoril look like mistress christia became just a trifle overeager she is the most beautiful creature in the uni verse said elric it isnt very much to go on said mistress christia if you could imagine a picture perhaps there are devices in the old cities which could visualise your thoughts we could go there i should be happy to fill in for her as it were what you offer me a simulacrum do you not think i should detect such witchery at once ah this is loathsome slay me if you will or continue the torment ill listen no longer they were floating now between high cliffs on a ledge far below a group of timetravellers pointed up at them one waved desperately youve offended him mistress christia said werther pettishly you dont understand how sen sitive he is yes i do she was aggrieved i was only being sympathetic sympathy elric rubbed at his long somewhat pointed jaw ha what do i want with sympathy i never heard anyone who wanted it more mis tress christia was kind youre like a little boy really arent you compared to the ancient lords of chaos i am a child aye but my blood is old and cold the blood of decaying melnibone as well you know and with a huge sigh the albino seated himself at the far end of the car and rested his head on his fist well what is your pleasure my lords and ladies of hell it is your pleasure we are anxious to achieve werther told him is there anything at all we can do some environment we can manufacture what are you used to used to i am used to the crack of leathery dragon wings in the sweet sharp air of the early dawn i am used to the sound of red battle the drumming of hooves on bloody earth the screams of the dying the yells of the victorious i am used to warring against demons and monsters sorcerers and ghouls i have sailed on magic ships and fought hand to hand with reptilian savages i have encountered the jade man himself i have fought side by side with the elementals who are my allies i have battled black evil well said werther thats something to go on at any rate im sure we can lord elric wont be staying began una persson politely you seethese fluctuations in the mega flownot to mention his own destiny he should not be here at all werther nonsense werther flung a black velvet arm about the stiff shoulders of his new friend it is evident that our destinies are one lord elric is as grief haunted as myself how can you know what it is to be haunted by grief murmured the albino his face was half buried in werthers generous sleeve mrs persson controlled herself she rose from werthers aircar and made for her own well she said i must be off i hope to see you later everybody they sang out their farewells una persson turned her beetle westward towards castle canaria the home of her old friend lord jagged she needed help and advice in which elric of melnibone resists the temptations of the chaos lords elric reflected on the subtle way in which laughing lords of chaos had captured him apparently he was merely a guest and quite free to wander where he would in their realm actually he was in their power as much as if they had chained him for he could not flee this flying dragon and they had al ready demonstrated their enormous magical gifts in subtle ways primarily with their shapechanging only the one who called himself werther de goethe plainly a leader in the hierarchy of chaos still had the face and clothing he had worn when first encountered it was evident that this realm obeyed no natural laws that it was mutable according to the whims of its powerful inhabitants they could destroy him with a breath and had subtly enough given him evidence of that fact how could he possibly escape such danger by calling upon the lords of law for aid but he owed them no loyalty and they doubt less regarded him as their enemy but if he were to transfer his allegiance to law these thoughts and more continued to engage him while his captors chatted easily in the ancient high speech of melnibone itself a version of the very language of chaos it was one of the other ways in which they revealed themselves for what they were he fingered his runesword wondering if it would be possible to slay such a lord and steal his energy giving himself enough power for a little while to hurl himself back to his own sphere the one called lord werther was leaning over the side of the beastvessel oh come and see elric look reluctantly the albino moved to where werther peered and pointed the entire landscape was filled with a monstrous battle creatures of all kinds and all combinations tore at one another with huge teeth and claws shape less things slithered and hopped giants naked but for helmets and greaves slashed at these beasts with great broadswords and axes but were borne down flame and black smoke drifted everywhere there was a smell the stink of blood what do you miss most asked the female she pressed a soft body against him he pretended not to be aware of it he knew what magic flesh could hide on a shewitch i miss peace said elric almost to himself and i miss war for in battle i find a kind of peace very good bishop castle applauded you are beginning to learn our ways you will soon become one of our best conversationalists elric touched the hilt of stormbringer hoping to feel it grow warm and vibrant under his hand but it was still impotent in the realm of chaos he ut tered a heavy sigh you are an adventurer then in your own world said the duke of queens he was bluff he had changed his beard to an ordinary sort of black and was wearing a scarlet costume quilted doublet and tightfitting hose with a blue and white ruff an elaborately feathered hat on his head i too am something of a vagabond as far of course as it is possible to be here a buccaneer of sorts that is my actions are in the main bolder than those of my fellows more spectacular vulgar like yourself sir i admire your costume elric knew that this duke of hell was referring to the fact that he affected the costume of the southern barbarian that he did not wear the more restrained colours and more cleverly wrought silks and metals of his own folk he gave tit for tat at this time he bowed thank you sir your own clothes rival mine do you think so the helllord pretended plea sure if elric had not known better the creature would seem to be swelling with pride look cried werther again look lord elric we are attacked elric whirled from below were rising oddlywrought vessels something like ships but with huge round wheels at their sides like the wheels of waterclocks he had seen once in pikarayd coloured smoke issued from chimneys mounted on their decks which swarmed with huge birds dressed in human clothing the birds had multicoloured plumage curved beaks and they held swords in their claws while on their heads were strangely shaped black hats on which were blazed skulls with crossed bones beneath heave to squawked the birds or well put a shot across your bowels what can they be cried bishop castle parrots said werther de goethe soberly oth erwise known as the hawks of the sea and they mean us no good mistress christia blinked dont you mean pirates dear elric took a firm grip on his sword some of the words the chaos lords used were absolutely mean ingless to him but whether the attacking creatures were of their own conception or whether they were true enemies of his captors elric prepared to do bloody battle his spirits improved at least here was something substantial to fight in which mrs persson becomes anxious about the fu ture of the universe lord jagged of canaria was nowhere to be found his huge castle of gold and yellow spires an embellished replica of kings cross station was pop ulated entirely by his quaint robots whom jagged found at once more mysterious and more trustwor thy than android or human servants for they could answer only according to a limited programme una suspected that jagged was himself upon some mission for he too was a member of the league of temporal adventures but she needed aid somehow she had to return elric to his own dimensions without creating further disruptions in the fabric of time and space the conjunction was not due yet and if things got any worse might never come so many plans depended on the con junction of the million spheres that she could not risk its failure but she could not reveal too much either to elric or his hosts as a guild member she was sworn to the utmost and indeed necessary se crecy even here at the end of time there were certain laws which could be disobeyed only at enormous risk words alone were dangerous when they described ideas concerning the nature of time she racked her brains she considered seeking out jherek carnelian but then remembered that he had scarcely begun to understand his own destiny be sides there were certain similarities between jherek and elric which she could only sense at present it would be best to go cautiously there she decided that she had no choice she must return to the time centre and see if they could detect lord jagged for her she brought the necessary coordinates together in her mind and concentrated for a moment all memo ries all sense of identity left her sergeant alvarez was beside himself his screens were no longer completely without form instead peculiar shapes could be seen in the arrangements of lines una thought she saw faces beasts landscapes that had never occurred before the instruments at least had remained sane even as they recorded insanity its getting worse said alvarez youve hardly any time left what there is ive managed to bor row for you did you contact the rogue she nodded yes but getting him to return i want you to find jagged jagged are you sure its our only chance i think alvarez sighed and bent a tense back over his controls in which elric and werther fight side by side against almost overwhelming odds somewhere it seemed to elric as he parried and thrust at the attacking birdmonsters rich and rous ing music played it must be a delusion brought on by battlemadness blood and feathers covered the carriage he saw the one called christia carried off screaming bishop castle had disappeared gaf had gone only the three of them shoulder to shoul der continued to fight what was disconcerting to elric was that werther and the duke of queens bore swords absolutely identical to stormbringer perhaps they were the legendary brothers of the black sword said to reside in chaos he was forced to admit to himself that he experi enced a sense of comradeship with these two who were braver than most in defending themselves against such dreadful unlikely monstersperhaps some creation of their own which had turned against them having captured the lady christia the birds be gan to return to their own craft we must rescue her cried werther as the flying ships began to retreat quickly in pursuit should we not seek reinforcements asked elric further impressed by the courage of this chaos lord no time cried the duke of queens after them werther shouted to his vessel follow those ships the vessel did not move it has an enchantment on it said werther we are stranded ah and i loved her so much elric became suspicious again werther had shown no signs previously of any affection for the female you loved her from a distance werther explained duke of queens what can we do those parrots will ransom her savagely and mishandle her objects of virtue dastardly poltroons roared the huge duke elric could make little sense of this exchange it dawned on him then that he could still hear the rousing music he looked below on some sort of dais in the middle of the bizarre landscape a large group of musicians was assembled they played on apparently oblivious of what happened above this was truly a world dominated by chaos their ship began slowly to fall towards the band it lurched elric gasped and clung to the side as they struck yielding ground and bumped to a halt the duke of queens apparently elated was al ready scrambling overboard there we can follow on those mounts tethered near the dais was a herd of creatures bearing some slight resemblance to horses but in a variety of dazzling metallic colours with horns and bony ridges on their backs saddles and bridles of alien workmanship showed that they were domestic beasts doubtless belonging to the musicians they will want some payment from us surely said elric as they hurried towards the horses ah true werther reached into a purse at his belt and drew forth a handful of jewels casually he flung them towards the musicians and climbed into the saddle of the nearest beast elric and the duke of queens followed his example then werther with a whoop was off in the direction in which the bird monsters had gone the landscape of this world of chaos changed rapidly as they rode they galloped through forests of crystalline trees over fields of glowing flowers leapt rivers the colour of blood and the consistency of mercury and their tireless mounts maintained a headlong pace which never faltered through clouds of boiling gas which wept through rain through snow through intolerable heat through shallow lakes in which oddly fashioned fish wriggled and gasped until at last a range of mountains came in sight there panted werther pointing with his own runesword their lair oh the fiends how can we climb such smooth cliffs it was true that the base of the cliffs rose some hundred feet before they became suddenly ragged like the rotting teeth of the beggars of nadsokor they were of dusky purple obsidian and so smooth as to reflect the faces of the three adventurers who stared at them in despair it was elric who saw the steps cut into the side of the cliff these will take us up some of the way at least it could be a trap said the duke of queens he too seemed to be relishing the opportunity to take action although a lord of chaos there was some thing about him that made elric respond to a fellow spirit let them trap us said elric laconically we have our swords with a wild laugh werther de goethe was the first to swing himself from his saddle and run towards the steps leaping up them almost as if he had the power of flight elric and the duke of queens fol lowed more slowly their feet slipping in the narrow spaces not meant for mortals to climb ever aware of the dizzying drop on their left the three came at last to the top of the cliff and stood clinging to sharp crags staring across a plain at a crazy castle rising into the clouds before them their stronghold said werther what are these creatures elric asked why do they attack you why do they capture the lady christia they nurse an abiding hatred for us explained the duke of queens and looked expectantly at werther who added this was their world before it became ours and before it became theirs said the duke of queens it was the world of the yargtroon the yargtroon elric frowned they dispossessed the bodiless vampire goatfolk of kia explained werther who in turn destroyed or thought they destroyedthe grashtuxem a race of old ones older than any old ones except the elder old ones of ancient thriss older even than chaos asked elric oh far older said werther its almost completely collapsed its so old added the duke of queens elric was baffled thriss chaos said the duke elric let a thin smile play about his lips you still mock me my lord the power of chaos is the great est there is only equalled by the power of law oh certainly agreed the duke of queens elric became suspicious again do you play with me my lord well naturally we try to please our guests werther interrupted yonder doomy edifice holds the one i love somewhere within its walls she is incarcerated while ghouls taunt at her and devils threaten the birdmonsters began elric chimerae said the duke of queens you saw only one of the shapes they assume elric understood this aha but how can we enter it werther spoke almost to himself we must wait until nightfall said elric and enter under the cover of darkness nightfall werther brightened suddenly they were in utter darkness somewhere the duke of queens lost his footing and fell with a muffled curse in which mrs persson at last makes contact with her old friend they stood together beneath the striped awning of the tent while a short distance away armoured men mounted on armoured horses jousted were injured or died the two members wore appropriate cos tumes for the period lord jagged looked handsome in his surcoat and mail but una persson merely looked uncomfortable in her wimple and kirtle i cant leave just now he was saying i am laying the foundations for a very important develop ment which will come to nothing unless elric is re turned she said a knight with a broken lance thundered past covering them in dust well played sir holger called lord jagged an ancestor of mine you know he told her you will not be able to recognise the world of the end of time when you return if this is allowed to continue she said its always difficult isnt it but he was listening to her now these disruptions could as easily affect us and leave us stranded she added we would lose any freedom we have gained he bit into a pomegranate and offered it to her you can only get these in this area did you know impossible to find in england in the thirteenth cen tury at any rate the idea of freedom is such a nebulous one isnt it most of the time when angry people are speaking of freedom what they are actu ally asking for is much simplerrespect do those in authority or those with power ever really respect those who do not have power he paused or do they mean power and not freedom or are they the same really jagged this is no time for selfindulgence he looked about him theres little else to do in the middle east in the thirteenth century i assure you except eat pomegranates and philosophise you must come back to the end of time he wiped his handsome chin your urgency he said worries me una these matters should be handled with delicacyslowly the entire fabric will collapse unless he is re turned to his own dimension he is an important factor in the whole plan well yes i understand that he is in one sense at least your protege i know but not my responsibility you must help she said there was a loud bang and a crash a splinter flew into mrs perssons eye oh zounds she said in which the castle is assaulted and the plot thickened a moon had appeared above the spires of the castle which seemed to elric to have changed its shape since he had first seen it he meant to ask his com panions for an explanation but at present they were all sworn to silence as they crept nearer from within the castle burst light emanating from guttering brands stuck into brackets on the walls there was laughter noise of feasting hidden behind a rock they peered through one large window and inspected the scene within the entire hall was full of men wearing identical costumes they had black skull caps loose white blouses and trousers black shoes their eyebrows were black in dead white faces even paler than elrics and they had bright red lips aha whispered werther the parrots are cele brating their victory soon they will be too drunk to know what is happening to them parrots said elric what is that word pierrots he means said the duke of queens dont you werther there were evidently certain words which did not translate easily into the high speech of melnibone sshh said the last romantic they will capture us and torture us to death if they detect our presence they worked their way around the castle it was guarded at intervals by gigantic warriors whom elric at first mistook for statues save that when he looked closely he could see them breathing very slowly they were unarmed but their fists and feet were disproportionately large and could crush any intruder they detected they are sluggish by the look of them said elric if we are quick we can run beneath them and enter the castle before they realise it let me try first if i succeed you follow werther clapped his new comrade on the back very well elric waited until the nearest guard halted and spread his huge feet apart then he dashed forward settling like an insect between the giants legs and flinging himself through a dimly lit window he found himself in some sort of storeroom he had not been seen though the guard cocked his ear for half a moment before resuming his pace elric looked cautiously out and signalled to his companions the duke of queens waited for the guard to stop again then he too made for the window and joined elric he was panting and grin ning this is wonderful he said elric admired his spirit there was no doubt that the guard could crush any of them to a pulp even if this was all some sort of complicated illusion another dash and werther was with them cautiously elric opened the door of the store room they looked onto a deserted landing they crossed the landing and looked over a balustrade they had expected to see another hall but instead there was a miniature lake on which floated the most beautiful miniature ship all motherofpearl brass and ebony with golden sails and silver masts surrounding this ship were mermaids and mermen bearing trays of exotic food reminding elric how hungry he still was which they fed to the ships only passenger mistress christia she is under an enchantment said elric they beguile her with illusions so that she will not wish to come with us even if we do rescue her do you know no counterspells werther thought for a moment then he shook his head you must be very minor lords of chaos said elric biting his lower lip from the lake mistress christia giggled and drew one of the mermaids towards her come here my pretty piscine mistress christia hissed werther de goethe oh the captive widened her eyes which were now both large and blue at last you wish to be rescued said elric rescued only by you most alluring of albinoes elric hardened his features i am not the one who loves you madam what i am loved by whom by you duke of queens sshh said elric the demons will hear us oh of course said mistress christia gravely and fell silent for a second ill get rid of all this shall i and she touched one of her rings ship lake and merfolk were gone she lay on silken cushions attended by monkeys sorcery said elric if she has such power then why it is limited explained werther merely to such tricks quite said mistress christia elric glared at them you surround me with illu sions you make me think i am aiding you when really no no cried werther i assure you lord elric you have our greatest respectwell mine at leastwe are only attempting to there was a roar from the gallery above rank upon rank of grinning demons looked down upon them they were armed to the teeth hurry the duke of queens leapt to the cush ions and seized mistress christia flinging her over his shoulder we can never defeat so many the demons were already rushing down the circu lar staircase elric still not certain whether his new friends deceived him or not made a decision he called to the duke of queens get her from the castle well keep them from you for a few mo ments at least he could not help himself he behaved impulsively the duke of queens sword in one hand mistress christia over the other shoulder ran into a narrow passage elric and werther stood together as the demons rushed down on them blade met blade there was an unbearable shrilling of steel mingled with the cacklings and shrieks of the demons as they gnashed their teeth and rolled their eyes and slashed at the pair with swords knives and axes but worst of all was the smell the dreadful smell of burning flesh which filled the air and threatened to choke elric it came from the demons the smell of hell he did his best to cover his nostrils as he fought certain that the smell must overwhelm him before the swords above him was a set of metal rungs fixed into the stones leading high into a kind of a chimney as a pause came he pointed upward to werther who understood him for a moment they managed to drive the demons back werther jumped onto elrics shoulders again displaying a strange lightness and reached down to haul the albino after him while the demons wailed and cackled below they began to climb the chimney they climbed for nearly fifty feet before they found themselves in a small round room whose windows looked out over the purple crags and beyond them to a scene of bleak rocky pavements pitted with holes like some vast unlikely cheese and there rolling over this relatively flat land scape in full daylight was the duke of queens in a carriage of brass and wood studded with jewels and drawn by two bovine crea tures which looked to elric as if they might be the fabulous oxen of mythology who had drawn the warchariot of his ancestors to do battle with the emerging nations of mankind mistress christia was beside the duke of queens they seemed to be waiting for elric and werther its impossible said the albino we could not get out of this tower let alone those crags i wonder how they managed to move so quickly and so far and where did the chariot itself come from stolen no doubt from the demons said werther see there are wings here he indicated a heap of feathers in the corner of the room we can use those what wizardry is this said elric man cannot fly on bird wings with the appropriate spell he can said werther i am not that well versed in the magic arts of course but let me see he picked up one set of wings they were soft and glinted with subtle rain bow colours he placed them on elrics back mur muring his spell oh for the wings for the wings of a dove to carry me to the one love there he was very pleased with himself elric moved his shoulders and his wings began to flap excellent off you go elric ill join you in a moment elric hesitated then saw the head of the first de mon emerging from the hole in the floor he jumped to the window ledge and leapt into space the wings sustained him against all logic he flew smoothly towards the waiting chariot and behind him came werther de goethe at the windows of the tower the demons crowded shaking fists and weapons as their prey escaped them elric landed rather awkwardly beside the chariot and was helped aboard by the duke of queens werther joined them dropping expertly amongst them he removed the wings from the albinos back and nodded to the duke of queens who yelled at the oxen cracking his whip as they began to move mistress christia flung her arms about elrics neck what courage what resourcefulness she breathed without you i should now be ruined elric sheathed stormbringer we all three worked together for your rescue madam gently he re moved her arms courteously he bowed and leaned against the far side of the chariot as it bumped and hurtled over the peculiar rocky surface swifter swifter called the duke of queens cast ing urgent looks backward we are followed from the disappearing tower there now poured a host of flying gibbering things once again the crea tures had changed shape and had assumed the form of striped winged cats all glaring eyes fangs and extended claws the rock became viscous clogging the wheels of the chariot as they reached what appeared to be a silvery road flowing between the high trees of an alien forest already touched by a weird twilight the first of the flying cats caught up with them slashing elric drew stormbringer and cut back the beast roared in pain blood streaming from its severed leg its wings flapping in elrics face as it hovered and attempted to snap at the sword the chariot rolled faster through the forest to green fields touched by the moon the days were short it seemed in this part of chaos a path stretched skyward the duke of queens drove the chariot straight up it heading for the moon itself the moon grew larger and larger and still the demons pursued them but they could not fly as fast as the chariot which went so swiftly that sorcery must surely speed it now they could only be heard in the darkness behind and the silver moon was huge there called werther there is safety on they raced until the moon was reached the oxen leaping in their traces galloping over the gleam ing surface to where a white palace awaited them sanctuary said the duke of queens and he laughed a wild full laugh of sheer joy the palace was like ivory carved and wrought by a million hands every inch covered with delicate designs elric wondered where is this place he asked does it lie outside the realm of chaos werther seemed nonplussed you mean our world aye it is still part of our world said the duke of queens is the palace to your liking asked werther it is lovely a trifle pale for my own taste said the last romantic it was mistress christias idea you built this the albino turned to the woman when just now she seemed surprised elric nodded aha it is within the power of chaos to create whatever whims it pleases the chariot crossed a white drawbridge and en tered a white courtyard in it grew white flowers they dismounted and entered a huge hall white as bone in which red lights glowed again elric began to suspect mockery but the faces of the chaos lords showed only pleasure he realised that he was dizzy with hunger and weariness as he had been ever since he had been flung into this terrible world where no shape was constant no idea permanent are you hungry asked mistress christia he nodded and suddenly the room was filled by a long table on which all kinds of food were heaped and everything meats and fruits and vegetables was white elric moved to take the seat she indicated and he put some of the food on a silver plate and he touched it to his lips and he tasted it it was delicious forget ting suspicion he began to eat heartily trying not to consider the colourless quality of the meal werther and the duke of queens also took some food but it seemed they ate only from politeness werther glanced up at the faraway roof what a wonderful tomb this would make he said your imagination improves mistress christia is this your domain asked elric the moon oh no she said it was all made for the occasion occasion for your adventure she said then she fell silent elric became grave those demons they were not your enemies they belong to you belong said mistress christia she shook her head elric frowned and pushed back his plate i am however most certainly your captive he stood up and paced the white floor will you not return me to my own plane you would come back almost immediately said werther de goethe it is called the morphail effect and if you did not come here you would yet remain in your own future it is in the nature of time this is nonsense said elric i have left my own realm before and returnedthough admittedly mem ory becomes weak as with dreams poorly recalled no man can go back in time said the duke of queens ask brannart morphail he too is a lord of chaos if you like he is a colleague could he not return me to my realm he sounds a clever being he could not and he would not said mistress christia havent you enjoyed your experiences here so far enjoyed elric was astonished madam i think well what has happened this day is not what we mortals would call enjoyment but you seemed to be enjoying yourself said the duke of queens in some disappointment didnt he werther you were much more cheerful through the whole episode agreed the last romantic particularly when you were fighting the demons as with many timetravellers who suffer from anxieties said mistress christia you appeared to relax when you had something immediate to capture your attention elric refused to listen this was clever chaos talk meant to deceive him and take his mind from his chief concern if i was any help to you he began i am of course he isnt very grateful mistress christia pouted elric felt madness creeping nearer again he calmed himself i thank you for the food madam now i would sleep sleep she was disconcerted oh of course yes a bedroom if you have such a thing as many as you like she moved a stone on one of her rings the walls seemed to draw back to show bedchamber after bedchamber in all manner of styles with beds of every shape and fashion elric con trolled his temper he bowed thanked her said goodnight to the two lords and made for the nearest bed as he closed the door behind him he thought he heard werther de goethe say we must try to think of a better entertainment for him when he wakes up in which mrs persson witnesses the first sign of the megaflows disintegration in castle canaria lord jagged unrolled his antique charts he had had them drawn for him by a baffled astrologer in they were one of his many affec tations at the moment however they were of con siderably greater use than alvarezs electronics while he used a wrist computer to check his fig ures una persson looked out of the window of castle canaria and wondered who had invented this particular landscape a green and orange sun cast sickening light over the herds of grazing beasts who resembled from this distance at any rate nothing so much as gigantic human hands in the middle of the scene was raised some kind of building in the shape of a vast helmet vaguely greek in conception beyond that was a low grey moon she turned away i must admit said lord jagged that i had not understood the extent exactly she said you must forgive me a certain amount of amnesiaeuphoria perhapsalways comes over one in these very remote periods quite he looked up from the charts weve a few hours at most her smile was thin her nod barely perceptible while she made the most of having told him so lord jagged frowned turned a power ring and pro duced an already lit pipe which he placed thought fully in his mouth taking it out again almost immedi ately that wasnt dunhill standard medium he laid the pipe aside there came a loud buzzing noise from the win dow the scene outside was disintegrating as if melt ing on glass an eerie golden light spread everywhere flooding from an apex of deeper gold as if forming a funnel thats a rupture said lord jagged his voice was tense he put his arm about her shoulders ive never seen anything of the size before rushing towards them along the funnel of light there came an entire city of turrets and towers and minarets in a wide variety of pastel colours it was set into a saucershaped base which was almost cer tainly several miles in circumference for a moment the city seemed to retreat the golden light faded the city remained some dis tance away swaying a little as if on a gentle tide a couple of thousand feet above the ground the grey moon below it thats what i call megaflow distortion said una persson in that inappropriately facetious tone adopted by those who are deeply frightened i recognise the period jagged drew a telescope from his robes second candlemakers empire mainly based in arcturus this is a village by their standards after all earth was merely a rural park during that time he retreated into academe his own response to fear una craned her head isnt that some sort of vehicle heading towards the city from the moon good heavens theyve spotted it already are they going to try to put the whole thing into a menagerie jagged had the advantage of the telescope i think not he handed her the instrument through it she saw a scarlet and black chariot borne by what seemed to be some form of flying fairground horses in the chariot armed to the teeth with lances bows spears swords axes morningstars maces and almost every other barbaric handweapon clad in quasimythological armour were werther de goethe the duke of queens and elric of melnibone theyre attacking it she said faintly what will happen when the two groups intersect three groups he pointed out untangling that in a few hours is going to be even harder and if we fail he shrugged we might just as well give our selves up to the biggest chronoquake the universe has ever experienced youre exaggerating she said why not everyone else is the attack on the citadel of the skies melnibone melnibone cried the albino as the char iot circled over the spires and turrets of the city they saw startled faces below strange engines were being dragged through the narrow streets surrender elric demanded i do not think they can understand us said the duke of queens what a find eh a whole city from the past werther had been reluctant to embark on an ad venture not of his own creation but elric realising that here at last was a chance of escape had been anxious to begin the duke of queens had in an instant aided the albino by producing costumes weapons transport within minutes of the citys ap pearance they had been on their way exactly why elric wished to attack the city werther could not make out unless it was some test of the melniboneans to see if his companions were true allies or merely pretending to have befriended him werther was learning a great deal from elric much more than he had ever learned from mongrove whose ideas of angst were only marginally less no tional than werthers own a broad flat blue ray beamed from the city it singed one wheel of the chariot ha they make sorcerous weapons said elric well my friends let us see you counter with your own power werther obediently imitated the blue ray and sent it back from his fingers slicing the tops off several towers the duke of queens typically let loose a different coloured ray from each of his extended ten fingers and bored a hole all the way through the bottom of the city so that fields could be seen below he was pleased with the effect this is the power of the gods of chaos cried elric a familiar elation filling him as the blood of old melnibone was fired surrender why do you want them to surrender asked the duke of queens in some disappointment their city evidently has the power to fly through the dimensions if i became its lord i can force it to return to my own plane said elric reasonably the morphail effect began werther but realised he was spoiling the spirit of the game sorry the blue ray came again but puttered out and faded before it reached them their power is gone cried elric your sorcery defeats them my lords let us land and demand they honour us as their new rulers with a sigh werther ordered the chariot to set down in the largest square here they waited until a few of the citizens began to arrive cautious and angry but evidently in no mood to give any further resistance elric addressed them it was necessary to attack and conquer you for i must return to my own realm there to fulfill my great destiny if you will take me to melnibone i will demand nothing further from you one of us really ought to take a translation pill said werther these people probably have no idea where they are a meaningless babble came from the citizens elric frowned they understand not the high speech he said i will try the common tongue he spoke in a language neither werther the duke of queens nor the citizens of this settlement could understand he began to show signs of frustration he drew his sword stormbringer by the black sword know that i am elric last of the royal line of melnibone you must obey me is there none here who under stands the high speech then from the crowd stepped a being far taller than the others he was dressed in robes of dark blue and deepest scarlet and his face was haughty beautiful and full of evil i speak the high tongue he said werther and the duke of queens were nonplussed this was no one they recognised elric gestured you are the ruler of the city call me that if you will your name i am known by many names and you know me elric of melnibone for i am your lord and your friend ah said elric lowering his sword this is the greatest deception of them all i am a fool merely a mortal said the newcomer his voice soft amused and full of a subtle arrogance are these the renegades who helped you renegades said werther who are you sir you should know me rogue lords you aid a mortal and defy your brothers of chaos eh said the duke of queens i havent got a brother the stranger ignored him demigods who thought that by helping this mortal they could threaten the power of the greater ones so you did aid me against your own said elric oh my friends and they shall be punished werther began we regret any damage to your city after all you were not invited the duke of queens was laughing who are you what disguise is this know me for your master the eyes of the stranger glowed with myriad fires know me for arioch duke of hell arioch elric became filled with a strange joy arioch i called upon thee and was not answered i was not in this realm said the duke of hell i was forced to be absent and while i was gone fools thought to displace me i really cannot follow all this said the duke of queens he set aside his mace i must confess i become a trifle bored sir if you will excuse me you will not escape me arioch lifted a languid hand and the duke of queens was frozen to the ground unable to move anything save his eyes you are interfering sir with a perfectly werther too was struck dumb and paralysed but elric refused to quail lord arioch i have given you blood and souls you owe me i owe you nothing elric of melnibone nothing i do not choose to owe you are my slave no said elric i serve you there are old bonds but you cannot control me lord arioch for i have a power within me which you fear it is the power of my very mortality the duke of hell shrugged you will remain in the realm of chaos forever your mortality will avail you little here you need me in my own realm to be your agent that too i know lord arioch the handsome head lowered a fraction as if arioch considered this the beautiful lips smiled aye elric it is true that i need you to do my work for the moment it is impossible for the lords of chaos to interfere directly in the world of mortals for we should threaten our own existence the rate of en tropy would increase beyond even our control the day has not yet come when law and chaos must decide the issue once and for all but it will come soon enough for you elric and my sword will be at your service lord arioch will it elric elric was surprised by this doubting tone he had always served chaos as his ancestors had why should i turn against you law has no attractions for one such as elric of melnibone the duke of hell was silent and there is the bargain added elric return me to my own realm lord arioch so that i might keep it arioch sighed i am reluctant i demand it bravely said the albino oho arioch was amused well mortal ill reward your courage and ill punish your insolence the reward will be that you are returned from whence you came before you called on chaos in your battle with that pathetic wizard the punishment is that you will recall every incident that occurred since thenbut only in your dreams you will be haunted by the puzzle for the rest of your lifeand you will never for a moment be able to express what mysti fies you elric smiled i am already haunted by a curse of that kind my lord be that as it may i have made my decision i accept it said the albino and he sheathed his sword stormbringer then come with me said arioch duke of hell and he drifted forward took elric by the arm and lifted them both high into the sky floating over distorted scenes halfformed dreamworlds the whims of the lords of chaos until they came to a gigantic rock shaped like a skull and through one of the eyesockets lord arioch bore elric of melni bone and down strange corridors that whispered and displayed all manner of treasures and up into a landscape a desert in which grew many strange plants while overhead could be seen a land of snow and mountains equally alien and from his robes arioch duke of hell produced a wand and he bade elric to take hold of the wand which was hot to the touch and glittered and he placed his own slender hand at the other end and he murmured words which elric could not understand and together they began to fade from the landscape into the dark ness of limbo where many eyes accused them to an island in a grey and stormtossed sea an island littered with destruction and with the dead then arioch duke of hell laughed a little and vanished leaving the prince of melnibone sprawled amongst corpses and ruins while heavy rain beat down upon him and in the scabbard at elrics side stormbringer stirred and murmured once more in which there is a small celebration at the end of time werther de goethe and the duke of queens blinked their eyes and found that they could move their heads they stood in a large pleasant room full of charts and ancient instruments mistress christia was there too una persson was smiling as she watched golden light fade from the sky the city had disappeared hardly any the worse for its experience she had managed to save the two friends without a great deal of fuss for the citizens had still been bewil dered by what had happened to them because of the megaflow distortion the morphail effect would not manifest itself they would never understand where they had been or what had actually happened who on earth was that fellow who turned up asked the duke of queens some friend of yours mrs persson hes certainly no sportsman oh i wouldnt agree you could call him the ultimate sportsman she said i am acquainted with him as a matter of fact its not jagged in disguise is it said mistress christia who did not really know what had gone on this is jaggeds castlebut where is jagged you are aware how mysterious he is una an swered i happened to be here when i saw that werther and the duke were in trouble in the city and was able to be of help werther scowled a very good copy of elrics own scowl well it isnt good enough it was a jolly adventure while it lasted you must admit said the duke of queens it wasnt meant to be jolly said wertherit was meant to be significant lord jagged entered the room he wore his famil iar yellow robes how pleasant he said when did all of you arrive i have been here for some time mrs pers son explained but werther and the duke of queens just got here explained the duke i hope were not intruding only we had a slight mishap and mrs persson was good enough always delighted said the insincere lord would you care to see my new im on my way home said the duke of queens i just stopped by mrs persson will explain i too said werther suspiciously am on my way back very well goodbye werther summoned an aircar a restrained figure of death in rags with a sickle who picked the three up in his hand and bore them towards a bleak horizon it was only days later when he went to visit mongrove to tell him of his adventures and solicit his friends advice that werther realised he was still speaking high melnibonean some nagging thought remained with him for a long while after that it concerned lord jagged but he could not quite work out what was involved after this incident there were no further disrup tions at the end of time until the beginning of the story concerning jherek carnelian and miss amelia underwood in which elric of melnibone recovers from a variety of enchantments and becomes determined to return to the dreaming city elric was awakened by the rain on his face wearily he peered around him to left and right there were only the dismembered corpses of the dead the krettii and the filkharian sailors destroyed during his battle with the halfbrute who had somehow gained so much sorcerous power he shook his milkwhite hair and he raised crimson eyes to the grey boiling sky it seemed that arioch had aided him after all the sorcerer was destroyed and he elric remained alive he recalled the sweet bantering tones of his patron demon familiar tones yet he could not remember what the words had been he dragged himself over the dead and waded through the shallows towards the filkharian ship which still had some of its crew they were by now anxious to head out into open sea again rather than face any more terrors on sorcerers isle he was determined to see cymoril whom he loved to regain his throne from yyrkoon his cousin in which a brief reunion takes place at the time centre with the manuscript of colonel pyats rather dan gerous volume of memoirs safely back in her brief case una persson decided it was the right moment to check into the time centre alvarez should be on duty again and his instruments should be registering any minor imbalances resulting from the episode concerning the gloomy albino alvarez was not alone lord jagged was there in a disreputable norfolk jacket and smoking a battered briar he had evidently been holidaying in victorian england he was pleased to see her alvarez ran his gear through all functions sweet and neat he said it hasnt been as good since i dont know when weve you to thank for that mrs p she was modest certainly not jagged was the one your disguise was wonderful jagged how did you manage to imitate that character so thoroughly it convinced elric he really thought you were whatever it wasa chaos duke jagged waved a modest hand i mean said una its almost as if you were this fellow arioch but lord jagged only puffed on his pipe and smiled a secret and superior smile the last enchantment through the blue and hazy night ran a shuddering man he clutched terror to him his bloated eyes full of blood first behind him and then seemingly ahead of him came the hungry chuckles the high whis pered words here toothsome here sweetmeat he swerved in another direction moaning like a huge husk he was like a hollow ornament of thin bone with his great rolling head swaying on his shoulders resembling a captive balloon the wet cav ern of his wide mouth fully open and gasping the yellow spikes of teeth clashing in his head awkwardly he ran sometimes scuttling like a wounded spider something lurching mooing to him self through the tall and ancient forest his feet sink ing into the carpet of wet pungent bracken and rotting roots he held in his hand that long white metalcoloured claw a glowing black talisman held it out and cried oh teshwanaid me teshwan aid me in the sluggish brew that was the contents of his rolling skull a few words swam to the surface and seemed to lie there moving with the tide of his mind and the voice which spoke them was sar donic how can teshwan aid thee little mortal but this relic of disoriented flesh could not form a coherent thought could not answer save to scream its fear so teshwan took his presence away and it was left to the horseman to find the horrorcrazed man elric of melnibone heard the voice and recognized the name he sensed other more ominous deni zens lurking about him in the forest moodily he curled his hands about the reins of his mount and jerked its head guiding it in the direc tion of the screams he only casually considered aiding the man and he rode his horse toward him more from curiosity than anything elric was un troubled by the terrors that the forest held regard ing them as another more normal man might regard the omnipresent song of birds and the rustle of small rodents in the undergrowth great tremblings shuddered through slorgs ruined body and he still heard the sharp whisperings were they carried on the air or were they slithering about in his jellied brain he gasped as he turned and saw the whitefaced horseman riding like a grim handsome god into the moonglazed glade the horsemans long sharply delineated skull was leperwhite as if stripped of flesh and his slightly slanting eyes gleamed crimson he wore a jerkin of black velvet caught at the throat by a thin silver chain his britches too were of black cloth and his leather boots were high and shining over his shoul ders was a highcollared cape of scarlet and a heavy longsword slapped at his side as he pulled his steed to a standstill his long flowing hair was as white as his face the horseman was an albino the shock of confronting this new and more tangi ble figure jerked slorg back into halfsanity and bro ken words sidled from his lips who are you aid me i beg you aid me elric laughed lightly now why should i my friend tell me that i have beenbeen profanedi am slorg i was once a manbut thosehe rocked his body and flung his rolling head backwards the curved lids falling down to cover his bulging eyes i have been profaned elric leaned forward on the pommel of his saddle and said lazily this is none of my business master slorg the great head darted forward the eyes snapped open and slorgs long lips writhed over his teeth like a camels address not me by a mundane title i am siletah slorgsiletah of oberlornrightfullyright fully the title was unknown to elric my apologies o siletah he mocked for now i observe a man of rank a man no longer whispered slorg and began to sob help me are you then in danger aye dangermy kinsmen have set the hungry whisperers upon me do you not hear them and elric cocked his head to listen yes he heard sibilant voices now where are you morsel oh help me help me begged slorg and lurched toward elric the albino drew himself up and pulled his horse back no closer he warned i am elric of melnibone slorgs tattered face squeezed itself into a frown ah the name and the face he mumbled to him self the face and the name elric of melnibone outcast indeed smiled elric but no more than you it seems now i must bid you farewell and suggest by way of friendly advice that you compose yourself soon it is better to die with dignity siletah slorg i have powers outcast of melnibonei have pow ers still help me and i will tell you secretssuch secrets elric waved a disdainful hand a moonbeam caught for an instant the flash of the rare actorios ring which reposed on his finger if you know me you should also know that im no merchant to bargain i ask nothing and give nothing farewell i warn you elrici have one power left i can send you screaming from this placeinto another it is the power which teshwan gives all his servantsit is the one he never takes back why not send your hungry friends into this other place they are not human but if you leave me i shall lay my last enchantment upon you elric sighed your last perhaps but not the last or the first to be laid upon me now i must go and search for a quieter place than this where i can sleep undisturbed he turned his horse and his back on the shaking remnant of a man and rode away he heard slorg calling again as he entered another part of the forest untainted by the siletah or those he had termed the hungry whisperers teshwanreturn return to do me one last servicea deed of vengeancea part of our bargain teshwan a short time later elric heard a thin wailing scream come flowing out of the night behind him and then the whole forest seemed alive with horrible laughter satiated triumphant chuckling his mood altered by his encounter elric rode through night not caring to sleep and came out of the forest in the morning glad of the sight of the green pla teau stretching ahead of him well he mused teshwan disdained to aid slorg and it seems there is no enchantment on me i am half regretful now slorg resides in the bellies of those he feared and his souls at home in hell then the plateau changed quite suddenly to grey rock swiftly elric wheeled his horse the plateau and the forest was behind him he spurred his mount quickly forward and the plateau and forest faded away to leave a vast and lonely expanse of flat grey stone above him the sun had disappeared and the sky was bright and white and cold now said elric grimly into silence it seems i was wrong in my assumption the plateauits atmospherereminded him of an other environment in which he had once found him self then he remembered clearly a time years before when he and two companions had sought an an cient volume called the dead gods book their quest ing had led them to a cavern guarded at its entrance by the symbol of the lords of chaos in that cavern they had discovered an underground sea which had had unnatural qualities there was the same sense of a sardonically amused presence here as there had been in the caverns of chaos teshwan was a lord of chaos hastily elric pulled his runesword stormbringer from its thick scabbard the sword was dead normally the blade forged by unhuman smiths for elrics royal ancestors was alive with sentience throbbing with the life force it had stolen from a hundred men and women whom elric had slain once before it had been like thisin the caverns of chaos long ago elric tightened his lips then shrugged as he re placed the sword in its scabbard in a world completely dominated by the forces of chaos he said i cannot rely on the powers which normally aid me in my sorcery thank arioch i have a good supply of drugs about me or i would indeed be doomed in earlier times elric had relied on his soulstealing runesword to give him the energy which as an albino he lacked intrinsically but recently he had rediscovered a cleaner way of counteracting his defi ciency by taking herbs he had discovered in the forest of troos where many unlikely things grew both flora and fauna by my fathers plagueinfested bones he swore i must find a way off this granite plain and discover who if anyone rules in this world i have heard of the powers invested in teshwans worshippersand i seem to remember a hint of why the lords of chaos confer such peculiar talents upon them he shuddered he began to sing a ululating hatesong of old melnibone elrics ancestors had been clever haters and on he rode beneath the sunless sky he could not tell how much time had passed be fore he saw the figure standing out strongly against the featureless horizon now on the flat waste of stone there were two points at which the monotony was broken elricwhite black and scarlet on a grey gelding the morose man black hair lying like a coat of lacquer on his rounded skull dressed in green a silver sword dangling in his right hand elric approached the man who raised his eyes to regard the albino this is a lonely place said the stranger sucking at his fleshy cheeks and he stared at the ground again true replied elric halting his horse is this your world or were you sent here also oh its my world said the man without look ing up where are you bound for nowhere seeking something where do you journey ioh i go to kaneloon for the rites of course all things it is said are possible in the world of chaos elric murmured and yet this place seems unusually barren the man looked up suddenly and jerking his lips into a smile laughed sharply the rites will alter that stranger did you not know that this is the time of the change when the lords of chaos rest before reforming the world into a fresh variety of patterns i did not know that said elric i have come here only recently you wish to stay no the lords of chaos are fickle if you wished to stay they might not let you now that you are re solved to leave they might keep you here farewell you will find me therein he lifted his sword and pointed a great palace of greenstone appeared at once the man vanished this at least will save me from boredom elric said philosophically and rode towards the palace the manypinnacled building towered above him its highest points hazy and seeming to possess many forms shifting as if blown by a wind at the great arch of the entrance a huge giant semitransparent with a red scintillating skin blocked his way over the archway as if hanging in the air above the giants proud head was the symbol of chaos a circle which produced many arrows pointing in all directions who visits the palace of kaneloon at the time of the change enquired the giant in a voice like lim bos music your masters i gather know mefor they aided their servant slorg in sending me hither but tell them it is elric of melnibone nonethelesselric destroyer of dreaming imrryr kinslayer and outcast they will know me the giant appeared to shrink to solidify and then to drift in a red mist pouring like sentient smoke away from the portal and into the palace and where he had been a portcullis manifested itself to guard the palace in the giants absence elric waited patiently until at length the portcullis vanished and the giant reformed himself my masters order me to inform you that you may enter but that having once come to the palace of kaneloon you may never leave save under certain conditions those conditions of these they will tell you if you enter are you recklessor will you stand pondering ill avail myself of their generosity smiled elric and spurred his nervous horse forward as he entered the courtyard it appeared that the area within the palace was greater than that outside it not troubling to seek any mundane explanation for this phenomenon in a world dominated by the lords of chaos elric instead dismounted from his horse and walked for nearly a quarter of a mile until he reached the entrance of the main building he climbed the steps swiftly and found himself in a vast hall which had walls of shifting flame in the glow from the fiery walls there sat at a table at the far end of the hall nine menor at least men or not they had assumed the form of men different in facial characteristics they all had the same sardonic air in the centre of these nine was the one who had first addressed elric he leaned forward and spoke words carefully from his red lips greetings to you mortal he said you are the first for some time to sit with the lords of chaos at the time of the change beholdthere are others who have had the privilege a rent appeared in the wall of flame to disclose some thirty frozen human figures some men and some women they were petrified in positions of many kinds but all had madness and terror in their eyesand they were still alive elric knew he lifted his head i would not be so impertinent my lords as to set myself beside you all insofar as powers are con cerned but you know that i am elric of melnibone and that my race is old my deficient blood is the royal blood of the kings of the dreaming city i have little pity or sentiment of any kind within me for sentiment whether love or hate has served me badly in the past i do not know what you require of me and i thank you for your hospitality nonethe less but i believe that i can conduct myself better in most ways than can any other mortal let us hope so elric of melnibone for we would not wish you to fail know that besides you are not fully mortal as humans understand the word now know you that i be teshwan and these need not be named and may be addressed singly or collectively by the name of lords of chaos elric bowed politely lord teshwanmy lords of chaos they returned his bow by slightly inclining their heads and broadening a trifle their sardonic crooked smiles come said teshwan briskly sit here beside me and i will inform you of what we expect you are more favoured than others have been elric and in truth i welcomed the opportunity given me by my vengeful servant slorg before he died elric climbed upon the dais and seated himself in the chair which appeared beside teshwan about him the walls of flame soared and tumbled mum bled and roared sometimes shadow engulfed them sometimes they were bathed in light for a while they all sat in silence pondering at last teshwan spoke now he said decisively heres the situation in which we have decided to place you you may leave only if you can create something which it has never occurred to us to create but you surely are the masters of creation said elric in puzzlement how may i do this your first statement is not strictly true and in qualifying it i can give you a hint of the answer to your question we of chaos cannot make anything newwe may only experiment with combinations of that already created do you understand i do said elric only the greatest power of which we know little more than do humans can create fresh concep tions the greatest power holds both law and chaos in perpetual balance making us war only so that the scale will not be tilted too far to one side we wish not for poweronly for variety thus every time we weary of our domain and let our old creations fade and conceive new ones if you can bring a fresh element to our domain we shall free you we create jokes and paradoxes conceive a better joke and a better paradox for our entertainment and you may leave here surely you expect the impossible from me you alone may assess the truth of your question now we begin and elric sat and watched pondering his problem as the great lords of chaos began their mighty experiments the walls of fire slowly flickered and faded and again he saw the vast and barren plain of flat stone then the air darkened and a sighing wind began to moan over the plain in the sky clouds blossomed in myriad shapes alien dark unfamiliar blacks and smoky orange at the same time familiar the rock heaved like lava became liquid rearing upwards and as it reared it became giants moun tains ancient beasts monsters gryphons basilisks chimerae unicorns forests bloomed their growths huge and exotic elephants flew and great birds crushed boiling mountains beneath their feet fin gers of brilliant colour climbed the sky crisscrossing and blending a flight of wildly singing lions fell from the firmament towards the forest and soared upwards again their music lonely as the forest melted to become an ocean a vast army of wizened homunculae came tramping from its depths dragging boats behind them for a short while they marched over the seething waters and then with precision began in ordered style to climb into the flaring sky when they had all left the ocean behind them they righted their boats set their sails laughed and screamed and shouted waved their arms climbed into the boats and with fantastic speed streamed towards the horizon all creation tumbled and poured malleable in the domain of chaos all was gusto craze and roaring terror love hate and music mingled the sky shook with multicoloured mirth blos soming white shot through with veins of blue and purple and black searing red splattered with spread ing flowers of yellow smeared smeared smeared with ghoulish green across this seething backdrop sped bizarre shapes the lords of chaos shouted and sang their weird creation and elric shouting also thought the frozen statues he had seen were weeping and laughing a grotesque combination of man and tree sent roots streaming towards the earth to tug mountains from the caverns it exposed and set them peak first like inverted pyramids into the ground upon the flat surfaces dancers appeared in bright rags which fluttered and flared around them they were warped unhuman pale as dead beauty grinning fixedly and then elric saw the strings attached to their limbs and the silently laughing puppetmaster bearlike and gi gantic controlling them from another direction sped a small blind figure bearing a scythe that was a hundred times bigger than the bearer with a sweep he cut the strings and with that action the whole faded to be replaced by a gushing brilliance of green and orange flame which formed itself into streamers of zigzagging disorder all this went on around them the lords of chaos smiled to themselves now as they created but elric frowned watched with wonder and no little plea sure but puzzled how he might emulate such feats for long hours the pageant of chaos continued as the lords took the elements of elrics world and shook them about turned them inside out stood them on end made startling strange beautiful un holy combinations until they were satisfied with the constant movement of the scene about them the perpetual shifting and changing they had set a pattern that was no pattern which would last until they became bored with their domain again and brought about another time of the change then their heads turned and all regarded elric expectantly teshwan said a trifle wearily thereyou have seen what we can do you are artists indeed said elric and i am so amazed by what i have witnessed that i need a little time to think will you grant it me a little timea little time onlywe want to see what you prepare for us while the excitement is still upon us and elric placed his white albinos head upon his fist and thought deeply many ideas occurred to him only to be discarded but at length he straightened his back and said give me the power to create and i will create so teshwan said smilingly you have the power use it well a joke and a paradox is all we require the reward for failure to be forever conscious at this elric shivered and put his mind to concen trating searching his memory until a manlike figure formed before him then he placed features on its head and clothes on its body until there stood before elric and the lords of chaos a perfect replicaof elric puzzledly teshwan said this is splendid imper tinence i grant youbut this is nothing newyou already sit there beside us indeed replied elric but look in the mans mind they frowned and did as he asked then smiling they nodded the paradox is good said teshwan and we see your point we have for an eternity created the effect you in your pride and innocence have created the cause in that mans mind was all that could ever exist you have noted the paradox asked elric anx ious that the correct interpretation had been divulged of course for though the mind contains the variety beloved of we of chaos it contains the order that those barren lords of law would foist on the world truly young mortal you have created every thing with a stroke and thank you also for the joke the joke why truly the best joke is but a simple state ment of truth farewell remember friend mortal that the lords of chaos are grateful to you and with that the whole domain faded away and elric stood on the grassy plain in the distance he observed the city of bakshaan which had been his original destination and nearby was his horse to take him there he mounted flapped the reins and as the grey gelding broke into a trot he said to himself a joke indeed but it is a pity that men do not laugh at it more often reluctantly he headed for the city the secret life of elric of melnibone some years ago when i was about eighteen i wrote a novel called the golden barge this was an allegori cal fantasy about a little man completely without selfknowledge and with little of any other kind going down a seemingly endless river following a great golden barge which he felt if he caught it would contain all truth all secrets all solutions to his problems on the journey he met various groups of people had a love affair and so on yet every action he took in order to reach the golden barge seemed to keep him farther away from it the river represented time the barge was what mankind is always seeking outside itself when it can be found inside itself etc etc the novel had a sad ending as such novels do also as was clear when id fin ished it my handling of many of the scenes was clumsy and immature so i scrapped it and decided that in future my allegories would be intrinsic within a conventional narrativethat the best symbols were the symbols found in familiar objects like swords for instance up until i was twenty or so i had a keen interest in fantasy fiction particularly swordandsorcery sto ries of the kind written by robert e howard clark ashton smith and the like but this interest began to wane as i became more interested in less directly sensational forms of literature just as earlier my interest in edgar rice burroughs tales had waned i could still enjoy one or two swordandsorcery tales particularly poul andersons the broken sword and fritz leibers grey mouser stories a bit before this casting off of old loyalties i had been in touch with sprague de camp and hans santessen of fantastic universe about doing a new series of conan tales i think it was in the autumn of when i was working for sexton blake library and reading sf for suspense that i bumped into a colleague at fleetway publications andy vincent who was an old friend of harry har risons who had also freelanced for fleetway for some time andy told me he was meeting harry and ted carnell in the fleetway foyer and suggested i went along as i remember that was where i first met harry previously id sold a couple of stories to ted one in collaboration with barry bayley and had had more bounced than bought later on in a pub ted and i were talking about robert e howard and ted said hed been thinking of running some conan type stuff in science fantasy i told him of the fantas tic universe idea which had fallen through when fantastic universe folded and said i still had the stuff id done and would he like to see it he said he would a couple of days later i sent him the first chapter and outline of a conan story to tell you the truth writing in howards style had its limitations as did his hero as far as i was concerned and i wasnt looking forward to producing another words of the story if ted liked it ted liked itor at least he liked the writing but there had been a misunderstanding he hadnt wanted conanhe had wanted something on the same lines this suited me much better i decided that i would think up a hero as different as possible from the usual run of sands heroes and use the narrative as a vehicle for my own serious ideas many of these ideas i realise how were somewhat romantic and coloured by a long drawnout and to me at the time tragic love affair which hadnt quite finished its course and which was confusing and darkening my outlook i was writing floods of hack work for fleetway and was getting sometimes ј or ј a week which was going on drink mainly and as i remember involved rather a lot of broken glass of one description or another i do remember with great pride my main achievement of the winter of or which was to smash en tirely an unbreakable plateglass door in a wellknown restaurant near piccadilly and the management apologised i mention this to give a picture of my mood at the time of elrics creation if youve read the early elric stories in particular youll see that elrics outlook was rather similar to mine my point is that elric was me and the mingled qualities of betrayer and betrayed the bewilderment about life in general the search for some solution to it all the expression of this bewilderment in terms of violence cynicism and the need for revenge were all characteristic of mine so when i got the chance to write the dreaming city i was identifying very closely with my herovillain i thought myself some thing of an outcast another romantic notion largely unsubstantiated now that i look back and emphasised elrics physical differences accordingly his bizarre dress was tasteless and gaudy and did not match his sensitive face and long fingered almost delicate hands yet he flaunted it since it emphasised that he did not belong in any companythat he was an outsider and an outcast but in reality he had little need to wear such outlandish gearfor was a pure albino who drew his power from a secret and terrible source the story was packed with personal symbols as are all the stories bar a couple the secret and terrible source was the sword stormbringer which symbolised my own and others tendency to rely on mental and physical crutches rather than cure the weakness at source to go further elric for me symbolised the ambivalence of mankind in general with its lovehates its meangenerosity its confident bewilderment act elric is a thief who believes himself robbed a lover who hates love in short he cannot be sure of the truth of anything not even of his own emotions or ambitions this is made much clearer in a story containing even more direct allegory the second in the series while the gods laugh unfortu nately ted left out the verse from which the title was taken i while the gods laugh the worlds vortex am maelstrom of passions in that hidden sea whose waves of alltime lap the coasts of me and in small compass the dark waters cram mervyn peake this i think gave more meaning to both title and story which involved a long quest after the dead gods booka mythical work alleged to contain all the knowledge of the universe in which elric feels he will at last find the true meaning of life he expresses this need in a somewhat rhetorical way when the wingless woman shaarilla asks him why he wants the book he replies i desire if you like to know one of mis printed as or in magazine version two things does an ultimate god exist or not does law or chaos govern our lives man needs a god so the philosophers tell us have they made one or did one make them etc etc here as in other passages the bewilderment is expressed in metaphysical terms for at that time due mainly to my education i was very involved with mysticism also the metaphysical terms suited the description of a swordandsorcery hero and his magical lowtechnology world it may seem odd that i use such phrases as at that time and so on as if im referring to the remote past but in many ways being a trifle more mature perhaps happily married with a better sense of di rection etc all this does seem to have taken place in the remote past the dead gods book is eventually located in a vast underground world which i had intended as a wombsymbol and after a philosophical conversa tion with the books keeper elric discovers it this passage is to me now rather overwritten but for better or worse it was a huge bookthe dead gods book its covers encrusted with alien gems from which the light sprang it gleamed it throbbed with light and brilliant colour at last elric breathed at lastthe truth he stumbled forward like a man made stupid with drink his pale hands reaching for the thing he sought with such savage bitterness his hands touched the pulsating cover of the book and trembling turned it back with a crash the cover fell to the floor sending the bright gems skipping and dancing over the pav ing stone beneath elrics hands lay nothing but a pile of yellowish dust the dead gods book and the golden barge are one and the same they have no real existence save in the wishful imagination of mankind there is the story says no holy grail which will transform a man overnight from bewildered ignorance to com plete knowledgethe answer already is within him if he cares to train himself to find it a rather over emphasised fact throughout history but one gener ally ignored all the same the stealer of souls the third story continues this theme but brought in rather different kinds of sym bols coupled with the jungian symbols already in herent in any tale using direct mythic material i used freudian symbols too this was a cynical at tempt and a rather vulgar attempt to make the series popular it appeared to work the stealer of souls whatever else it may be is one of the most porno graphic stories i have ever written in freudian terms it is the description of if you like a nights love making which brings me to another point although there is comparatively little direct description of sexual encounters in the stories and what there are are largely romanticised the whole elric saga has in its choice of situations and symbols very heavy sexual undertones this is true of most swordandsorcery stories but i have an idea that i may be the first such author to understand his material to this ex tent to know what hes using if i hadnt been a bit fedup by the big response received by the stealer of souls i could have made even greater use of what i discovered other critics have pointed out the close relation ship the horror story and often the sf story for that matter has with the pornographic story so theres no need to go any deeper into it here the pornographic content of the elric saga doesnt interest me much but i have hinted at the relation ship between sex and violence in several stories and indeed there are a dozen syndromes to be found in the stories particularly if you bear in mind my own involvement with sexual love expression in violence etc at the time the stories were first conceived even my own interpretation of what i was doing is open to interpretation in this case the allegory goes through all ten stories includ ing to rescue tanelorn which did not feature elric in science fantasy but it tends to change its emphasis as my own ideas take better shape and my emotions mature when in the last elric story of all the sword his crutch stormbringer turns and slays elric it is meant to represent on one level how mankinds wishfantasies can often bring about the destruction of part of mankind hitler for in stance founded his whole socalled political creed on a series of wishfantasies this is detailed in that odd book dawn of magic recently published here again this is an old question a bit trite from being asked too often maybe but how much of what we believe is true and how much is what we wish were true hitler dreamed of his thousand year reich chamberlain said there will be no war both were convincedboth ignored plain fact to a frightening extent just as many people not just politicians whose public statements are not always what they really believe ignore plain facts today this is no new discovery of mine it is probably one of the oldest discoveries in the world but in part this is what nearly all my published work points out working as i did once as editor of a party journal allegedly an information magazine for party candidates this conviction was strengthened the buildup of a fan tasy is an odd process and sometimes happens to digress a bit like this the facts are gathered related a picture emerges the picture though slightly coloured by the person alities of the factrelaters is fairly true the picture is given to the politician if the politician is a man of integrity he will not deliberately warp the facts but he will present them in a simplified version which will be understood by the general public this involves a selection which can change a picture out of all recognition though the politician didnt deliberately intend to warp the facts the other kind of politician almost automatically selects and warps in order to prove a point he or his party is trying to make so the fantasy begins soon the real picture is almost irrevocably lost therefore this reliance on pseudoknowledge which seems to prove something we wish were true is a dangerous thing to do this is one of the main messages of the elric series though there are several others on different levels dont think im asking you to go back over the stories looking for these allegories and symbols the reason i abandoned the golden barge was because among other thingsit wasnt entertaining the elric stories are meant to entertain as much as anything else but if anyone cares to look for substance beyond the entertainment level they might find it one of the main reasons though for taking this angle when alan asked me to write a piece on elric was because i have been a little disap pointed at the first book being dismissed by some professional critics who evidently didnt bother to read it closely if at all as an imitation of conan when you put thought and feeling into a story thought and feeling which is yoursyou dont much care for being called an imitator or a plagiarist how ever good or bad the story probably the millionth novel about a young advertising executive in love with a deb and involved with a married woman has just been published yet the author wont be accused of imitating anyone or plagiarising anyone it is the use to which one puts ones chosen material not that material which matters sojan the swordsman daughter of a warrior king a myat trotted peacefully across the broad seem ingly neverending plain which made up the land scape as far as it was possible to see no sound issued from the cloven hoofs muffled by the moss like substance which clothed the ground in a mantle of vivid colourpurple green and yellow with a trace of crimson or violet here and there nothing grew upon that plain it was a wilderness barren desertedthe greatest desert on the planet of zylor a wandering warrior sat astride the myats broad back at his steeds side hung a shield a virtually unknown accoutrement on zylor but the tribe to which sojan belonged had perfected it as a valuable asset the beast upon which he rode was a big sturdy animal from both sides of its huge head grew long sharp horns curving outward more like a reptile than a mammal its head tapered like a snakes its tail was thick and it too tapered sojan was clothed in a bright blue jerkin reaching to his knees his legs were bare and tough boots of myat hide were upon his feet reaching to about two inches from his knees over the jerkin was a leather harness of simple designtwo straps across his shoul ders coming to the waist and attached to a broad belt whereupon hung his weaponsa sword a dirk long and sharp and a holster containing his big roundbutted airpistol the mercenarys hair was long and held by a fillet of leather at the back of his big saddle were two saddlebags a container of water and rolled across these his crimson cloak the man himself was tall broadshouldered and slimwaisted with smooth muscles rippling beneath his jerkin the perfect fightingman keeneyed and wary suddenly sojan caught a flash of marble to the west and knew that he had sighted vermlot the capital city of hatnor the greatest warrior nation of a warrior world a rich city was vermlot rich in fightingmen and weapons of war rich in terms of gold rich in beauty and splendour as he neared the city walls a guard bade him halt and state his business i come in peace he cried to offer my sword my loyalty and my life to his imperial highness the war lord of hatnor i am a mercenary my only possessions are the clothes i wear the weapons i carry and the myat i ride i have travelled half a world to offer my services to your ruler he was admitted to the city and made his way to one of the many taverns situated within the protec tion of the mighty walls his strange protective weapon aroused much interest a certain warrior made mock of him and his shield oh he laughed what a brave mercenary he has travelled half a worldto give us his protection for with his great shield in front of him he will be able to withstand all our enemies perhaps he cannot fight without it thats so is it not mercenary sojan halted and gazed up at the man who was leaning against a pillar on the balcony above grimly quietly he spoke but his tones were cold and his words were acid i do not like your attitude he said and i like your words less draw your swordif you know how to use itand defend yourself perhaps you will be hiding behind the shield before i have fin ished with you the warrior stiffened and his face flushed he put one hand on the balcony rail and vaulted into the street below drawing his long vilthor a sabrelike weapon as he did so sojan unslung his shield from the myat and drew his own long blade the warrior of the palace struck first aiming a wicked slash at sojans legs with his curved vilthor but the mercenary from ilthoth jumped high in the air and attacked the other with a weav ing arc of steel driving him further and further back then the man saw his chance and slashed at an exposed limb of the mercenarys but was too slow there was a dull thud as the sword hit and rebounded from the shield then he was made to duck beneath a vicious slash from sojan the vermlotian slowly lost ground until with a flick of his wrist sojan disarmed his opponent then from a secondstorey window a figure dropped first to the balcony of the firststorey and from there to the ground he removed his cloak and with a smile upon his lips came forward with drawn sword i fancy you will not disarm me so quickly this time sojan was not so lucky for the new comer was as quick as the proverbial cobra his sword weaved an invisible circle around sojans guard and the newcomer soon had him at his mercy be fore he knew it the mercenarys sword flew from his grasp and clattered to the earth ten feet away yield questioned the victor i yield panted he you are a great fighter who are you sir perhaps you have heard of me smiled his late adversary i am nornos kad war lord of the im perial empire of hatnor sir said sojan with a bow i who came to enlist in your service and offer my aid to you begin by fighting you i crave your forgiveness nornos kad laughed never mind you did very well against my warrior here to best him is a test indeed and i feel that i would do well to enlist your services he signed to a servant who was waiting in a doorway come you will be my guest until i have need of you here oumlat take sojan to one of the best guest rooms and see that he is well looked after for a week or so sojan enjoyed the privileges of the royal guest until one morning a messenger came to say that nornos kad had asked for him i summoned you sojan nornos kad said when they were alone because you are to accompany me on a journey our mission is to take ilthat princess of sengol back to her fathers country i desire to bring sengol into the hatnorian alliance without bloodshed if possible and the king would think well of it if his daughter was personally escorted home by the war lord himself you had better prepare your weapons and be ready to move from your quarters by dawn tomorrow ten warships heavily armed with hatnorian air guns which worked on the simple principle of com pressed air with a range of over half a mile and the royal airship were ready to take to the air early the next morning they rose majestically hovered for a few moments and then with motors purring the great gasbags veered off towards sengol which lay far to the north within three or four hours they had crossed the outermost boundary of hatnor and her satellites and were winging their way at a steady eighty miles an hour over veronlam a country which owed no alle giance to hatnor and which although fearing the mighty empire was constantly stirring up petty strife between the minor hatnorian nationals they had nearly reached the border of veronlam when the soft purr of motors was heard and a shell whistled past them and exploded in their rear air container veronlam pirates yelled the foregunner quickly the small fleet formed a protective barrier about the royal ship one airship was hit a dozen times in as many different places and hurtled down wards flames roaring from the gasbag and the crew jumping overboard rather than die in the flames nornos kad realised at once that to fight against so many would soon end in disaster for his fleet and he ordered them to turn about and flee back to hatnor he decided to rely upon his speedier en gines to aid them rather than their powerful guns the hatnorian fleet circled and fled nornos kad was the last to leave the battle and hastily turned about to follow his ships but alas it was too late for three wellaimed shots in their main tank sent them spiralling slowly to earth to land with a sicken ing crash amidst a tangle of redhot girders and flaming fabric being on the platform of the ship nornos kad sojan and ilthat were flung clear of the main wreckage to lie stunned sojan did not know how long it was he lay amidst the wreckage of the royal airship but when he awoke it was dawn he knew that none could have escaped if they had been trapped in the wreckage but nevertheless he spent a fruitless two hours search ing for his companionsall he found were two or three charred corpses but none lived convinced that his companions were dead he took the only unbroken water bottle and set off in the direction of hatnor sojans eye caught the gleam of white stone far to the south of his position with a sigh of relief he began to walk quickly towards the gleam which grew soon into a patch and from that into a city its walls towering fifty paces in places knowing that he was still probably in veronlam he knew that it would be useless to try to gain admission on the strength of his allegiance to nornos kad the war lord stripping himself of his hatnorian navycloak and also his navytype gauntlets he stood arrayed as when he had first entered hatnor as a mercenary swordsman he easily gained admittance to the city of quentos as mercenaries were always welcome to swell the ranks of any army by mimuk friend youre the third to pass through these gates this day the guard said as he was allowed to enter the city the third thats strange is it not guard re plied sojan three people in one day mimuk you must be joking i joke not friend mercenary strange as it seems two others have preceded you and one of them was a woman our warriors found them near the wreck of an airship some say the ones we captured were nornos kad himself and ilthat daughter of hugor of sengol two prizes indeed if it be the truth sojan strode off in the direction indicated by the friendly guard arriving at the tavern he hired a room and or dered himself a meal finishing his repast he was horrified to find that the only money he had was that of hatnor if he tried to pass this he knew that the suspicions of the keeper of the tavern would be instantly aroused what should he do he had brought nothing with him to the tavern save his sword shield and poinard and the clothes he wore he reasoned that the only chance he stood was to try and slip quietly out of the door before the propri etor spotted him and ordered him to pay his bill just as he thought he had reached the safety of the street a hand fell on his shoulder and the leering face of the landlord was brought close to his going so soon my lord methinks you would like to stay and sample some more of our victuals before you make yourerhasty departure he said with ponderous sarcasm now pay up or my menll make sure you pay for your mealin blood you threaten me by mimuk cried sojan his easily roused temper getting the better of him you dare threaten me draw your weapon hey tytho zatthum wanrimcome and save me from this murdering bilker cried the keeper of the tavern in terror instantly three ruffians appeared in the narrow doorway and drawing their blades rushed at sojan causing him to release his grasp upon the unfortu nate man and turn to face this new danger zatthum went down in the first minute with an inch of steel marking its path through his heart the remaining two were not so easily defeated back and forth across the narrow street the three fought sparks flying from their blades the clang of their weapons resounding upon the rooftops sojan was marked in a dozen places but his adversaries were bleeding in as many as he was with a quick thrust a parry and another thrust the mercenary succeeded in dispatch ing the second man now only tytho was left sojan allowed himself to be headed off and the man edged him completely around so that they were now retracing their path with a mighty effort sojan who was still tired after his narrow escape from the air ship gathered his remaining strength together and made a vicious lunge in tythos direction he cried out in pain when sojans blade found the muscles of his left arm but did not relax his grip upon his own sword again sojan was forced further back towards the gaping crowd which had collected outside the tavern his shield saved him from the thrust de signed to end the fight but he knew he could not last longer for he was rapidly tiring suddenly his foot caught in the trappings of one of the dead mens harnesses and he fell backwards across the corpse a grim smile graced tythos face as he raised his sword to deliver the final thrust kill him tytho kill him the crowd roared in frenzied bloodlust sojan entangled in the harness of the man he had slain tried to rise but was stopped from doing so by a shove from tythos booted foot the hireling raised his sword again and the crowd leaned forward suddenly there was a disturbance at one end of the street and the crowd quickly began to disperse as it did so tytho saw the city patrol scourge of the city thieves was the cause of the crowds disap pearance looking hurriedly about him for a way of escape he found none he dropped his sword and began to run foolishly along the street the leader of the patrol raised his pistol there was the slight hiss of escaping air and the running hireling gave a short cry threw up his arms stum bled and dropped on the cobbles of the street whats happening here by this time sojan had disentangled himself from the harness of his late opponent and was standing legs asprawl hand to head youve saved my life sir he gasped these ruffians attacked me for my money i succeeded in killing two but unfortunately became tangled up with this fellow he indicated the body tytho was about to finish me when you arrived the leader laughed you certainly accounted very well for yourself he said these three are among the worst of the type with whom we have to con tend ruthless murderers perfect swordsmen again he laughed or almost perfect you did us a service and i am grateful he surveyed sojans bloodstained and tattered clothing youre a stranger here are you not he enquired a mercenary swordsman perhaps yes i am named sojanthey nickname me shieldbearer as i use this sojan pointed to his shield well sojan shieldbearer how would you like to bear a shield and wield a sword in the patrol instantly sojan saw his chance if he could get a post in the organised militia of the city he might be able to contact his prisoned friends it has always been my ambition to serve in the veronlamite guard he lied but to become a mem ber of the great patrol is a chance for which i had not dared hope then come with us and well enlist you immedi ately and he added get you a decent jerkin and harness before he could become a fullfledged patrolman sojan had to undergo a course of basic training when this was finished his duties were to patrol with his men a certain section of the city and arrest any thieves footpads or similar wrongdoers the justice was rough indeed and was not appreciated by the population all the time he heard rumours and from these rumours he gleaned that nornos kad and ilthat were imprisoned somewhere in the prison of zholuna mighty towered building situ ated near the centre of the city sojan knew well that the patrols duties included patrolling the prison and acting as guards to special prisonersand he was hoping that he would be given this assignment soon sure enough one day his hopes were fulfilled and he was assigned to guard a section of zholun prison with his eyes wide open sojan learned where the two were imprisoned one is in the east towerthe other in the west nornos kad lies in the east tower a guard told sojan one night after sojan had plied him with enough ale to get him drunk sojan had to work fast there were rumours that his friends were to die by the sword in two days time his first loyalty was to nornos kad he contrived to enter the east tower wherein nornos kad was imprisoned stealthily he made his way to the metal studded door of the cell nornos kad he whispered he heard the rattle of chains and through the bars of the door saw his chieftains handsome face drawn and pale through lack of food and sleep sojan exclaimed the war lord i thought you died in the crash i am alive and here to save you if i can i was assigned to guard the west wing so it will be more difficulthowever i shall try and get the keys until i returnhave hope and with that sojan crept back along the gloomy passage on return he found that the patrolman on duty was talking to someone he waited until the man had left and then walked into the little room which was being used to house guards hullo stontor cried sojan whats up stontor looked worried its my wife sojan shes been taken ill and i cant leave my post sojan saw his chance well you go and help her he said ill stay here until you get back dont worry thanks a lot sojan youre a friend indeed here are the keysshouldnt think therell be much doing tonight and with that he picked up his cloak and ran down the long passage hastily sojan picked up the keys and ran back to nornos kads cell unlocking the door he helped nornos kad from his chains i was luckya coincidenceguards wife illbut the main trouble will be getting out of the city he panted as he unlocked the heavy padlocks together they returned to the guards room here sojan left nornos kad then he made his way back to the west wing where it was a simple matter to get the princess from her cell silently they returned to nornos kad keeping to the sidestreets and the shadows the three sped along towards the city gates suddenly nornos kad hissed stop stop sojan there may be an easier way he pointed to a flat area dotted with hangers and anchored airships with one of those we would have a better chance of escaping but how enquired sojan again nornos kad pointed you see that small ship nearest to usthe one anchored down by a couple of ropes the ship of which he was speak ing was fifteen feet above them held to the ground by anchors attached to heavy ropes with luck we could gain the ship and climb the ropes stealthily they padded along the side of the field keeping well into the shadows all the time a single guard lolled on the ground sojan crept behind him and reversing his pistol knocked the man uncons cious with sojans and nornos kads help ilthat was able to climb the rope and they boarded the ship as they clambered over the rail a light suddenly ap peared from one of the cabins and an armed man appeared on deck he was followed by three others mimuk he cried what have we here there was no time for words and handing nornos kad his long dirk and ilthat his pistol sojan drew his sword and engaged the man and his compan ions nornos kad was close behind him back and forth across the narrow deck the six men fought and the four crewmen were no mean battlers nornos kad weak from his sojourn in zholun prison still put up a good fight together they succeeded in killing two of their opponentsbut the other two were better swordsmen the clash of steel echoed across the silent field sojan was blinded by the sudden flash of a searchlight and taking advantage of this his opponent cut past his guard and made a painful gash in his side the pain was like fire and sojan could barely restrain himself from crying out he stumbled to the deck and with a cry of triumph the crewman raised his sword a sudden hiss and a strangled gasp and he collapsed over sojan turning his head he saw ilthat with the pistol in her hand thanks was all he could say as he struggled to his feet and ran to help nornos kad while nornos kad threw the bodies overboard sojan started the engines below them they heard shouts of a patrol and two searchlights were now levelled on the swaying airship soon they heard cries as the bodies of the crewmen were found with two sword strokes nornos kad cut the an choring ropes and the ship rose swiftly into the air there was a coughing roar and the propellers began to turn the searchlights followed them all around them shells whistled suddenly behind them they saw that three battlecruisers of the fastest and heaviest type had risen to follow them more speed sojan more speed cried nornos kad make for sengol its nearer with a glance at the compass sojan turned the ships nose towards the north nearer and nearer came the battlecruisers guns popping softly ilthat a true daughter of a warrior king climbed into the gunners rearseat and aimed the guns of their own ship at the pursuing cruisers she pressed the trig gers and the twin muzzles of the gun gave a jerk a hiss and there was an explosion what all a gun ners skill could not easily have accomplished ilthat had done with luckbrought down a cruiser in its most vulnerable spotthe main gasbag flames roared from the fabric and the ship lost height faster and faster it went as the earth pulled it downwards the engines roaring to the last it crashed with a flash of orange and crimson flame but the other two ships had still to be accounted for and ilthat was not so lucky this time for two hours the chase continued neither gain ing and all the time the shells from the veronlam craft were getting closer and closer as the gunner perfected his aim they will catch us soon cried ilthat who still sat in the reargunners seat they seem to be draw ing closer then we shall have to land and hope that were not still in veronlam yelled nornos kad above the shrieking wind it will be a long time for us to do so sir sojan told nornos kad we have no anchors and to re lease the gas in the gasbag would mean that while we lost height we should also lose speed then theres only one thing we can do cried the emperor and thats this raising his sword he cut deep into the nearest gasbag he was thrown to the deck as the contents rushed out and almost at once the ship began to drop dangerously fast the three stood by the side ready to jump with a hard jolt the ship touched the ground bumped along it and stopped over the side the three companions went and ran over soft moss to the sheltering shadows of some rocks as the veron lamite searchlights began to stab into the darkness but it was easy to hide in the rocks and the caves sheltered them when the veronlams landed and made a vain search for them in the morning it was an easy matter to walk to the nearest sengolian city and thence to the capital where the king gratefully took his daughter and promised that sengol would always be an ally to hatnor mission to asno motors purring captains shouting orders the rustle of the canvas guncovers being drawn back gay flags flashing steel flying cloaks of many hues a hatnorian warfleet rose rapidly into the sky on the deck of the flagship stood a tall strong figurethat of sojan nicknamed shieldbearer sec ond in command to the great war lord of hatnor himselfnornos kad at his side was a long broadsword upon his back his round shield his right hand rested on the butt of his heavy airpistolan incredibly powerful weapon clad in a jerkin of skyblue a divided kilt of deep crimson and boots of dark leather over his shoulder his leathern warharness he was the typical example of a zylorian mercenary whose love of bright garb was legendary the great warfleet was destined for asnoa coun try far to the north of hatnor where the king so the spies told was raising an army of mercenaries to attack yundrota colony of the hatnorian empire to stop a major war nornos kad decided to send a mighty fleet to crush the attack before it was started having other business he assigned sojan to take his place and instructed him to completely wipe out any signs of an attack only too pleased at the chance of battle sojan had readily assented and was now on his waythe en tire fleet under his command soon the fleet was winging its way over asnoa land of snow and ice fierce beasts great tracts of uninhabited icefieldsuninhabited that is by civilised beings in another hour it would be over boitil the capital city gunners take your positions sojan roared through cupped hands and picking up a megaphone for there was no radio on zylorshouted the same orders which went from ship to ship until every gunner was seated in his seat guns loaded and ready for firing drop two hundred feet sojan roared again to the steersman and repeated these orders to the other captains who in turn shouted them to their own steersmen prepare hand weapons and fasten down loose fixtures check gasbag coverings every man to posi tion sojan shouted when the ships had all dropped two hundred feet slow speed the ships slowed into second speed in zylorian naval terms there are five speeds speed no is fastest possible speed no is a fifth of this slower and so on when a commander gives the order to slow when travelling at speed no the ship automatically adjusts to speed no if going at no and told to slow it changes to no now they were over the outskirts of the city drop ping lower and lower until sojan thought they would touch the very towers of boitil scanning the squares and flyingfields for signs of the army halfway over the city a message was passed to sojan that a great army camp had been spottedjust on the outskirts of the city at the same time someone yelled for him to look and doing so he saw that a fleet almost as large as his own was rising from flyingfields all over the vast city prepare for battle he shouted as one the safety catches of the guns were pushed off shoot as you will sojan ordered there was a muffled pop and the hiss of escap ing air as the explosive shells of the hatnorian craft were sent on their mission of destruction almost at once the enemy retaliated two hatnorian ships one only slightly damaged the other a mass of roaring yellow and blue flame dropped earthwards for twelve hours the great airbattle was fought developing into shiptoship duels as the opposing sides became mixed bit by bit the battle moved southwards until it was over the great ice wastes but expert handling of their craft superior marks manship and a slightly superior weight of numbers on the part of the hatnorian fleet was slowly but surely weakening the asnogian fleet sojan now with a gun mounted on the officers platform was taking an active part in the battle his uncanny abil ity to hit almost whatever he aimed at was taking great toll everywhere ships were hurtling earth wards crashing in an inferno of flame or merely bouncing gently when a gasbag was only slightly punctured at last one by one the enemy began to flee the other ships seeing their companions escape disen gaged and followed them the hired ships manned mainly by mercenaries flew in every direction but that of asno while the asnogian craft turned and headed for their home base in this direction went the hatnorian fleet reforming to a close formation and turning to no speed if they overtook a ship it was ruthlessly shot down but half a dozen or so were lucky and escaped them in three hours they were back over asno and bombing the troop en campment with incendiaries until nothing remained of the great camp but smouldering fabric and twisted steel through the south gate of the city streamed forth ragged bands of hired soldiers bent on escap ing while they could the planned attack on a hatnorian colony had not even begun a just repri sal on nornos kads part a reprisal carried out in full by sojan but his business was not finished and landing on part of an undamaged airfield sojan ordered the frightened commanding officer to take him to king tremorn of asno i bring a message from my emperor he cried when he was in the vast chamber which housed the kings court all around him stood courtiers and servants worried and anxious to hear his terms great pillars supported the roof and brilliant tapes tries hung from the ceiling murals on the walls depicted scenes of battles on land water and in the air speak your message ordered the king what are your terms i admit that i am beaten for the present he added for all time sir while a member of the nornis family sits on the throne of hatnor sojan replied now do you wish to hear my terms speak the first is that you acknowledge allegiance to hatnor and pay a tribute of five hundred young men to train in our armies every tenth year the second is that you disband any army you still have save for policing your city on signs of attack you will notify the empire who will come to your aid as a mem ber of the empire you will be subject to all laws and trading terms of the empire and in times of major war shall enlist twothirds of your fighting strength in the armies of hatnor and the remaining third if called upon you will not make warships or weap ons of war save hand weapons for your own use but all warships and arms shall be sent direct to the capital do you recognise these terms the king paused and turning to his major domo whispered a few words to him the man nodded yes i recognise your terms he sighed then sign your name and oath to this document and seal it with your royal seal upon the breaking of your word the lapse shall be punished according to the magnitude sojan handed the paper to a courtier who carried it to the king the act of bowing to a king is un known upon the planet zylor instead the subject places his right hand upon his heart to signify com plete allegiance so it was that sojan achieved his purpose but more adventures were yet to come before he could return to his palace at hatnor revolt in hatnor sojan sojan the call rang across the clear zylorian sky as a small scoutship veered towards the larger warship the flagship of sojan secondincommand to the war lord of hatnornornos kad who are you sojans lieutenant roared through a megaphone i bring urgent tidings from the court of nornos kadthe land is in turmoil come alongside the man roared as the scoutship drew alongside an armed man jumped from it and rushed up the ladder to the platform whereon sojan stood sojan while the fleet has been at war revolution has swept through the land nornos kad has been deposed and a tyrant sits on the throne of hatnor there is a price upon your head and upon the heads of all whom you command flee now sojan while you have the chance trewin the upstart controls the city and half the empire the other half is in a state of unrest unsure whether to support one emperor or another i cannot flee while my emperor rots in chains tell me who still cries loyalty to the nornis family none openly sojan a few are suspected but they are still powerful nobles and even trewin dare not arrest them without cause sojans face became grim and he clenched his hand upon his sword hilt lun he cried order the fleet to turn about and adjust to speed one a look of surprise crossed his lieutenants face were not running sojan do as i say turn about and adjust to speed one lun shouted through his megaphone at once the great fleet turned gracefully about and adjusted speed by speed until it was flying at maxi mum speed there were puzzled looks in the eyes of many of sojans captains but they obeyed his order tell them to set a course for poltoon he ordered lun lun did so and soon every ship was heading southto the steaming jungles and burning deserts of the heat lands why do we sail for poltoon sojan asked lun but sojans only reply was you will see and he resumed his earnest conversation with the messen ger who had brought him the news on the third day they were sailing at no speed over a vast belt of jungle seemingly impenetrable but sojans eyes less atrophied by civilised living caught what he had been looking fora patch of green lighter than the dark green which predomi nated stop he roared stop and hoverno one is to drop anchor the flying machines of the zylorian nations are usually very similar to our airships the gondola is supported by steel hawsers depending from the main gasbag the propeller is adjustable and can be slung either fore or aft of the shipit is usually slung aft they are steered by two methods a rudder aft plus manipulation of the propeller a normal sized war ship usually mounts five gunstwo very powerful ones fore and aft a smaller one on the captains platform and two mounted in a platform on top of the huge gasbag the gunners reach this platform by means of ladders from the deck to the platform this position is extremely dangerous and if ever the gasbag is hit it is unlikely that a gasbag gunner could ever escape the ships stopped as ordered and while they waited sojan had his ship drop downwards nearer and nearer to the little patch of green which became a small clearing just large enough to land one ship but for a fleet of over fifty ships to land here was impossible with a slight bump the ship dropped to the ground and the anchor was thrown into the soft grass sojan ordered that the gasbags be deflated they could always be inflated again as every ship carried a large supply of gascylinders now the ship was only a third of the size and was dragged into the undergrowth which was not at all thick sojan told his crew of eight to get to work and chip down all the small growth but to leave the huge forest giants standing this they did and very soon the clearing widened and as it did so a new ship dropped down until the fifty were all deflated and covering a large area of ground under the trees the cabins made excellent living quarters so there was no difficulty about housing the men rations were also plentiful and a spring of fresh water was nearby i know this part of the country well sojan told his men that night the inhabitants are for the most part friendly while they are not civilised they are not savages and i believe that they will give us some help but now we sleep and tomorrow we shall rouse the tribes next morning sojan with a small party of his men set off for the village of his barbarian friends the chief greeted him warmly and was interested in sojans need for soldiers you know me and my people soyin he said using the nearest poltoonian equivalent of sojans name we all love to fightand if theres a bit of loot thrown in whos to say no then i can depend on you by all meansi shall form a council immediately and recruit as many of my fellow chiefs as possible between us we should muster a few thousand fight ing men by zylorian standards where most nations are comparatively small to earth nations a thousand men is quite a large number then have them ready by the third day my friend sojan replied blood will stain the usurp ers robes before the month is gone the hordes attack the day of the invasion was drawing nearer and sojan began to work harder and harder in the train ing of his barbarian hordethe poltoonians spies brought word that there was more and more unrest in the outlying provinces of hatnor the time is right to strike sojan told his cap tains and the wild chiefs we must invade now or our cause will be lost and we will never again have the opportunity to win hatnor back from the usurper and restore nornos kad to his rightful throne his airships camouflaged by the mighty trees of the steaming poltoonian jungle were provisioned and ready to do battle his captains were word perfect in his plan of invasion everyone had his orders and knew how to carry them out a day later a horde consisting of thousands of mounted barbarians led by sojan himself moved towards the northand hatnor two days later the faster moving airships rose into the air like a swarm of hornets armed with stings a hundred times more powerful as they passed the horde the ships slowed to minimum speed and followed flying low just above them in another day they would arrive at the boundaries of hatnor and blood would run in the gutters of all who op posed them sojan was sure that very little blood would flow as the army would be on his side it was the criminal population egged on by an evil and powermad noble who had risen and overthrown their emperor while the bulk of his army was crushing a rebellion in an outer province there would always be unrest in any regime sojan knew this but there was no cause for the people to grumble about their ruler as always the unrest had been caused by a powerseeker intent on turning a nation into a bloodbath for his own selfish ends now the once happy people groaned beneath the tyrants yoke no man woman or child could count themselves safe from his oppression not only men made up the barbarian army their maidens rode beside them armed with knife sword shield and spear in their left hands they carried charm sticks to keep their men and themselves from harm most of these girls were extremely beautiful and the armour they wore did not detract from their good looks in any way rather it enhanced them at last they reached the outer boundaries of the empire and found little opposition here it would be later when news of their invasion reached the city of hatnor that the fighting would begin sojan was finding it difficult to keep the barbarians in order they had decided that anyone could be slain as long as they got their loot but after a council meeting with the chiefs he was sure that they would be reliable for a time two days later found them at the gates of vermlot gates which were securely locked and guarded the barbarians were all for laying violent siege to the place but sojan realised that they could hold out for an eternity you are forgetting our ships he said we have the whole of the hatnorian airforce under our con trol they will not last as long as they hope his flagship sailed gracefully down for him and then shot up again when he was aboard orders were shouted from ship to ship and the fleet dipped downwards towards the great city square aboard were hundreds of soldiers the most reliable of the barbar ian horde and as soon as the ships reached the ground not without some opposition they swarmed from the ships and ran to engage the rather fright ened militia who barred their way wild cries strangely woven banners raised against a background of flashing steel and muffled poppings of the airpistols and rifles it was impossible to use the heavier artillery into the square they poured and soon it was im possible to tell friend or foe as the fighting surged back and forth spreading outwards into the streets into the very houses themselves attacked from the inside as well as at their walls the tyrants men were uncertain whom to attack and while they wavered the barbarians took the opportunity to batter in one of the minor gateways and clamber over the inner wall the streets were slippery with blood echoing with the ring of steel and the cries of the wounded sojan was in front hewing and hacking with his great blade his long hair streaming behind him and a grim smile upon his lips to the palace to the palace he cried take the palace or our cause is lost and like a tidal wave the army surged over their enemies in the direction of the great palace the doors would not open to their thunderous knocking so battering rams were brought in as the main door flew open sojan and his men drew back in horror there stood nornos kad their ruler worn and in rags a filthy stubble on his face and surrounding him a body of trewins personal guard behind them stood their leader come another step closer sojan and ill be forced to kill your precious emperor he called sojan and his men were in a quandary what were they to do it was checkmate if not defeat for them an idea sprang into sojans mind aiming a pistol at nornos kad he pulled the trigger the emperor fell to the ground with a moan and lay still there dog ive done your dirty work for you he laughed in a rage trewin fired blindly at sojan the swords man flung himself to the ground and the bullet whis tled by to catch one of his men in the shoulder lifting his own pistol sojan fired twice trewin in the act of fleeing up the staircase flung up his arms and toppled down the great stairway blood trickling from his mouth he landed with a thud at the feet of his guards with a cry sojan his sword glistening in the light of the torches suspended around the wall charged for the astounded guards who without thinking threw down their weapons and fled nornos kad picked himself up from the floor with sojans help a clever move sojan he grinned but it took some clever shooting too he examined the hole which sojans bullet had made in his coat it was a minor risk sir if i had not taken it the city would even now be in the hands of trewin at the moment it seems to be in the hands of your poltoonian barbarians laughed the war lord let us go to the rescue of our fellow countrymen peace had come once more to hatnor the purple galley to describe the wonderful pageantry the colours the races and the myriad weapons which flashed in that great hall would be impossible the gleaming white stones of the hall hung with vivid tapestries of red black gold yellow orange green and pur ple almost reflected the equally scintillating colours of the uniforms and dresses of the men and women who stood before the throne of nornos kad but there was one uniform missing one tall figure which should have been there was not one sword did not flash in the great hall and the faces of the nobles were sadfor the missing man was nornos rique prince of hatnor the war lords son my people said nornos kad softly and very sadly my son has been missing for thirteen days now and still no news of him or the princess asderma has anyone anything to reportyou sojan have you found any traces of my son no sire although i have searched the whole nation i can only conclude that your son is not in the hatnorian empire then we must find him sojan take the men you requireand return with my son if it is possi ble then you are the man to find him the sun was just setting when a weary and travel stained rider guided his myat into the small collec tion of stone and wooden buildings which was the border town of erm he had ridden for days stop ping only to eat and gather a few hours sleep when he could no longer stay awake his clothes were good and were mainly made of durable hide his weapons nestled in welloiled sheaths and scabbards his shield was covered with canvas it was easy to see that here was the typical soldier of fortunea zylorian mercenary he dismounted at the small tavern and called through the door which was ajar hey there is there a stable for my animal and a bed for me yes my lord came a womans voice from the tavern and a girl of about eighteen appeared in the doorway hey kerk she called fetch a blanket for this gentlemans myat and take him to the stables this way my lord said the battlescarred vet eran who came to do the womans bidding whats trade like he added with a grin as they neared the wooden building which served as a stable for the beasts of the whole village not too bad the mercenary smiled as long as men are men and their tempers are the same then ill never be out of a job there was an uprising in hatnor some months ago that was a good scrap if ever there was one aye i heard about it from another gentleman who came this way soon after it happened didnt say much thoughmost untalkative type if you ask me he wasnt a hatnoriannor a northerner for that matter that was easy to see what do you mean the mercenary was obvi ously interested more than casually so he was a shortani man you cant mistakeem shortanis a big continentdid you hear him say what country in shortani wait a minute i believe he did say something the old man paused and tugged at his grizzled beard he frowned thinking hard yes ive got itit was raining at the time like it does most of the time in these parts kerk laughednever seems to stop it dont yes the mercenary was impatient but what did he say what oh yes the country well he said when he got here that it was never like this in uffjir yes that was it uffjir hmm thats right on the farthest side of shortani and even then he may not have been returning there it probably isnt anything but it seems strange for an uffjirian to travel so far from his tropi cal lands especially in winter what did he look like this man oh the usual type you know small a bit fat wore one of them fancy jewelled swords which snaps as soon as you cross it with a good bit of turani steel why i remember when i was a youngun that would have been a bit before your time we didnt have none of them newfangled flying ma chines in those days i can tell you we had to do all our travelling by myator more likely on our feet yes the mercenary was almost crying with im patience by this time but can you describe the uffjirian well he had a beard if thats any good and it was curled up a bitlooked as if hed put oil on it wore fancy clothes too no good for travelling but expensiveyes they were certainly expensive he was a nobleman by the look of himhired a whole crowd of the village men and they all went off to gether somewhere they aint back yet have you any idea where they went only the direction they went off in the opposite direction to the one from which you came mounted too and although they wouldnt admit it every one of them has a sword hidden in his blankets they cant fool me i have to look after their myats the myat had been rubbed down and was in his stable by this time attended by the two men one an aged veteran with over a hundred years of fighting behind him and the other equally a veteran with not much more than twenty years behind him they lived short lives on zylor for most men died of a sword thrust by the time they were seventy or eighty their life span of years was rarely reached that night the mercenary sat in the corner of the tavern drinking and cleaning his heavy pistol there were two other visitors at the tavern a young man of seventeen years or so and his father they were friendly men and the mercenary and he found mu tual ground in that they were both veterans of the findiankintonian wars the mercenary had fought for the findians and the manorfilhad fought on the side of the kintonians but there was no bad feeling between the men for at that time orfil had also been a mercenary now he was a merchant dealing in precious jewelsand he and his son were travelling to aborgmingi a small group of islands in the shortani sea the mining of precious stones was unknown there he said and he found it worth his while to travel the distance over land and sea to sell them as they obtained prices which were over five times as much as those in fria his own country ride with us he invited there is always a greater amount of safety if there is a greater amount of men and i would be glad of your company i ride towards shortani said sojan but whether i shall for long depends on circumstances the merchant knew better than to ask what cir cumstances they were for privacy means life on zylor and those who ask too many needless ques tions are liable to find themselves in an alleyway keeping close company with a knife the three men retired to their respective rooms and the mercenary was glad to get some rest wea rily he sank on to the notsosoft bed and lay down to sleep in the morning he awoke at his accustomed hour and attempted to rise he could not for his hands were bound he was strapped to the bed and the only thing he could move was his head looking down at him with a smile on his face wasorfil the merchant and his son only his son had donned her skirts again and was an extremely pretty girl well my nosy soldier youve put your nose into one game too many this time laughed orfil who seemed to be enjoying a great joke the girl behind him was not so amused her whole bearing was tense and the hand that gripped the pistol at her side gleamed white at the knuckles perhaps i should introduce myself continued the man my name is orfil i am the captain of the spies guild in rhan this lady prefers to remain unknown although where youre going the gods will know it anyway youre going to kill me then yes and am i permitted to enquire why certainly i am afraid that i shall be forced to kill youthough i regret it sir for i like you you see you have been enquiring just a little too pointedly to be harmless i suspect that you are more than a common mercenarythat perhaps you are in the pay of uffjirand if this is so then it will be more of a pleasure to kill you i am no uffjirian you oaf and i am not involved in any intrigue i seek my war lords son who disappeared some time ago think not that i would sink so low as you the smile vanished from the rhanians face and his right hand clenched on his long sword then i am sorry you see nornos rique is in this right up to his lancetip and with that he raised his sword the girl turned away and just as orfil was about to deal the death thrust the door opened slowly and he saw the face of the uffjirian nobleman behind him were half a dozen burly swordsmen yit take you parijh cried the spy and then to the girl quick get behind me and open the win dow ill hold them back there are myats awaiting and with that he rushed upon the uffjirian who for a moment was so taken aback that he could hardly defend himself from the furious attack of orfils sword quick men he yelled seize him kill him dont let him escape but the narrow doorway would not permit more than one man to enter at a time and orfil easily pushed parijh back and swung the heavy bar into position as the door shut no time to slay you now he panted as he clambered over the window ledge perhaps some other time the girl had by this time scrambled from the win dow and was waiting with the myats the soft thud of their hooves was drowned by the yells of the man from uffjir and the surly answers of his companions silence fell as the men gave chase to orfil and the girl the mercenary still lay strapped to the bed the door was barred from the inside and he had begun to think that he would soon starve to death when someone knocked on the door get me out of here he yelled is there anything the matter sir this was too much even for a hardened warrior yes there is he roared and if you dont let me out right nowill tear the place down with my bare hands a rather vain boast considering his position murmurs at the door and the retracing of steps down the creaking staircase he waited expectantly hearing occasional voices then there were tramping feet on the stairway and in a few moments the door fell inwards closely followed by two men with a battering log and be hind them old kerk i said there was something up he exclaimed triumphantly it was a matter of minutes to untie the mercenary for him to gather up his accoutrements to pay kerk and to find and saddle his myat then he was off down the long forest track following the trail of orfil and his pursuers for three hours he followed a trail which was easily found once or twice he thought he heard movements in the forest but although he kept his hand ever ready on his sword he was not attacked then just as he turned the bend in the trail they were there the uffjirians men lined across the narrow path swords drawn and pikes at the ready but the mercenary was trained to quick thinking and at the same moment as his heels dug into his myats flanks he drew sword unhooked shield and brought his lance to bear as he thundered down upon his foes his crimson cloak flying behind him like a vampires wings soaked in blood and a blood curdling warshout on his lips taken aback they wavered but at the uffjirians shouts behind them pushed forward to meet the charging lancer down went one with a brilliantly tufted shaft protruding from his throat the lance was wrenched out of the mercenarys hands and his steed reared and snorted flailing with its cloven hooves his face was alight with battlelust he ducked beneath the guard of another man and dealt him a cut which put him down shrieking and calling to some unknown god in an agony of death he whirled his steed about hoping to gain a little ground by retreating but it was too late for he was surrounded by a solid ring of pikes and blue steel he caught blow after blow on his shield and the flat of his sword one man lunged upwards with his heavy pike and the myat snorted in pain before his deadly hooves beat the man down leaping from the wounded myat the lone swords man found himself surrounded by four of parijhs men he bled from a dozen superficial cuts and still he fought with the skill and ferocity of a trained crinja cat then there was a gap in their ranks and he was through rushing for a tethered myat twenty yards away howling like werewolves they followed him across the glade and reached him just as he cut the tether ing rope of the myat with his sword and leaped into the high saddle they attempted to cut at his ani mals legs but a swift arc of blue steel drove them back as he passed the body of the man whom he had first slain he stooped and wrenched the lance from the corpse and then he was away down the long trail in the direction orfil had taken all his wouldbe captors heard was a grim laugh which echoed through the tall trees of the forest turning in the saddle the mercenary saw them run to their mounts and parijh come from behind scolding and cursingfor among other things the fine beast the mercenary had taken had belonged to the uffjirian and it soon proved its worth for he easily outdis tanced them and was again following orfils tracksa trail which was to lead to the weirdest adventure in his whole career the sea wolves two days after his fight with the uffjirians men the mercenary rode into the port of minifjar in the coun try of barj there were several ships in the harbour mer chantmen mainly but here and there rose the tall prows of warships although their airships are motorpowered the zylorians have not found an engine capable of mov ing their ships or for carrying them for very far and since steampower also is unknown they still rely on sails and oars for motive power most of the ships were equipped with both sails and oars but two of them were built for sails only from every one of them long barrels poked from strategic ports for it was only a suicidal madman who would sail anything but the calm waters of the asnogi channel and the shortani sea unarmed there was one ship a galley which stood out from the others its tall prow triumphantly above the rest and its sails and paintwork were predominantly purple purple like black on earth is the colour of death on zylor so it attracted much attention from the inhabitants of the small town the mercenary sought out the only presentable inn and bought a meal and a bed for the night as he lugged his equipment wearily up the flight of narrow stairs he looked up and caught a glimpse of a familiar facethat of orfil of rhans girl com panion evidently she had been watching him and the warrior kept a wary hand on his sword and resolved to make sure that his door was firmly barred that night but soon after he had dumped his belongings on the dirty bed he heard the rattle of harness and from his small window he saw the spy and the girl leaving the walled entrance to the innthey had none of their possessions with them which told the mercenary a great deal they had gone for reinforce ments he sat on the edge of the bed pondering what he should do he had decided that it would be wiser to leave when there came the sound of myats hooves and a squad of barjite cavalry fully armed with lances swords long rifles and pistols clad in uniforms of blue red and green with shining breastplates hel mets and leg greaves of bright steel they clattered to a halt outside the inn thank yit the mercenary murmured for he recognised the captain of the mounted men as an old friend who had fought beside him in an expedi tion barj had made when bandits had been raiding their caravans of merchandise red he cried opening the window red you son of a crinja cat red or as his men knew him captain jeodvir vollitts son of chathja turned then as he saw who called him a wide grin took the place of his previously astonished expression and he passed a hand through the shock of hair which gave him his nickname sojan what are you doing in this particular bit of hell and you one of king vixians crack lancers commanding a coast patrol the king doesnt like me any more sojan laughed the warrior not since i pressed for better pay for the cavalry and nearly started a civil war at the last council it was sojans turn to laugh you couldnt plead for better conditions for the underpaid infantry i suppose what and have them get the idea that theyre up to cavalry standard the rivalry between infantry and mounted divi sions in barj was very real and at times became a threat to the internal peace of that nation the brawls between the better trained cavalry generally inherit ing the right to become an officer and the recruited infantry were cursed in every town from erm to ishtamzhem the capital but sojan was not con cerned with this he had an ally now no need to run he could stay and fight like a man looking for a fight red he said dying to be killed why enquired red using an expression which was currently popular among fighting men because i have a feeling that we will be in one soon good ill tell my men to be prepared thanks ill need some help i think unusual for you to admit that shut up im coming down in the courtyard of the inn sojan told red what he knew about orfil and what had happened to him since he left the court of hatnor to search for his rulers son and as he finished orfil and a band of some twenty mounted men in seamens clothes rode into the courtyard the captains squad consisted of ten menso they were outnumbered almost twotoone the seamen had no lances but the cavalry had left their rifles pistols and lances with their myats sad dles and other equipment now they were armed only with long sabres and small battle axes it took orfil less than a second to take stock of the situation and with a curse he bore down upon the group yelling a blasphemous battleshout so full of evil that it made sojans hair tingle his men fol lowed him hardened seawolves these all of them by rights fodder for the executioners axe scarred wildeyed men in exotic clothes of many hues and nations black green white and red from every nation on zylor they bore weapons which were equally variedbattleaxes maces pikes hooked swords and broadswords vilthors and blades resem bling scimitars all were there and many so strange that they defied simple description sojan blocked orfils lance thrust with his own long sword and unslung his shield from his back in a hurry but not soon enough for orfils lance stabbed again and flung the mercenary backward against a wall luckily the lance tip broke on sojans breast plate and orfil swore to his dark gods as he wheeled his steed about and attempted to cut at sojan with his broadsword but now sojan was up again back against the wall shield up and blade screaming as he cut past orfils guard but orfil was swept away as the fight eddied back and forth across the courtyard there a green man of poltoon went down with a lancer on top of him stabbing again and again near him a huge red man bearded with one of his small horns broken and splintered staggered towards his tethered steed spit ting blood from a punctured lunghe never made the myat a lancer was crushed by sheer weight of numbers as four howling longhaired black men from shortani bore him down and almost tore him to pieces everywhere was chaos and sojan hardly knew who it was he fought there were so many of them finally he singled out another red giant who whirled a shrieking twinbladed axe around his head and laughed through his black beard all the time he bled from a flesh wound in his left arm and his face streamed blood from a superficial sword cut but he never seemed to tire sojan caught a blow of the axe on his shield which dented so much that it almost broke his arm discarding it he skipped nimbly away from the arc of bloodstained steel ducked beneath it and ripped upwards with a thrust that caught the giant in the throat and threw him groaning to the cobbles before sojan lost sight of him as a fresh wave of seaspoilers pushed towards him the warshout of his people was upon sojans lips and it rose above the screams and curses of the men spurred red and his men on to greater feats of magnificent swordsmanship until the sailors were driven back slowly very slowly they gave ground and just as victory seemed in the hands of sojan and his allies from the courtyard walls dropped scores of wellarmoured axemen it was impossible to defend themselves against this sudden onslaught and the last thing sojan heard as an axe haft fell on his helmet and blackness fol lowed blinding light was take them alive they will suffer more tonight sojan at sea sojan awoke with a piercing pain in his head which quickly disappeared looking about him he found that he was lying on a comfortable couch in a well furnished room which seemed to have an indefin able something wrong with it then he realised what it was every article of furniture was clamped to the floor and the windows were small square openings in the walls just below eyelevel he was in a ships cabin obviously one of the ships in the harbourthat was why the men who had attacked him had worn seafaring garb which ship though he didnt know doubtless he would find out soon enough could it be the purple ship of death which swayed at anchor in minifjar harbour it was likely this business was mysterious enough for anything he walked over to the port hole and looked out no the purple ship could be seen from there then what ship was this he went back to the couch after trying the door which he found locked as he had expected he waited an houra long houruntil the bar on the door was lifted with a creak and the door swung open to his surprise he found himself staring into the face of parijh the ufffjirian who said welcome aboard the sea crinja my friend but the man who stood behind parijh caught the adventurers attention most of all it was his war lords son nornos rique of hatnor shiltain swore sojan when he saw him what explanation later sojan we were lucky to rescue you right now youre not very welcome my fault i suppose for giving no hint that i would be going but there was no time but how did i get out of orfils hands its a long storytoo long to relate here mean while we sail for the sea of demons what were sailing dangerous waters sojan for we play a dangerous game in which the whole planet is at stake do you want to come on deck thanks the three men climbed the long ladders to the poopdeck nornos rique shouted orders as sails were set and men moved to their oars all the men were well built fighting men sojan looked back to where the huge purple galley swayed at anchor like a dead ship becalmed in the terrible weed jungle of the black ocean she gave no signs of following and soon the sails were billowing oars creaked in unison and they were on the open sea bound for the mysterious sea of demons like all ships there was continual movement aboard men scurrying up and down the rigging guns oiled and cleaned the shouts of the mate giving orders the ship comprised three decks two raised fore and aft and a middle deck which was little more than a raised platform over the oarsmens pits on port and starboard in the centre of this deck there was another slightly raised platform measuring about thirty feet upon which was the single mast at the base of this mast a drummer satbeating out a steady rhythm which was followed by the oars who took their timing from the drum on this platform also was the heavy artillery and something which sojan had never seen before harpoon guns twelve of them five a side and an other two fore and aft it was obvious that peaceful trading with the tribes along the shortani coast was not the object of this particular voyage suddenly sojan remembered his comrades what happened to my friends he asked theyre all aboard the purple arrow that cursed ship of death you saw in minifjar harbour an swered rique you see sojan we only had time to free you before we were discovered my men and i swam across and boarded her silently last night we finally found you and judging by your snores you were in a drugged sleep there were four others with you but they were so much dead weight that we could only take you and secretly leave knives in their shirts with which to aid themselves if they have the chance im sorry sojan but it is too late to go back for them now even if it were practical you are right of course rique answered sojan but i would that i could help them now the tall sea crinja was in open waters beyond sight of land bound for the terrible sea of demons where few ships ever sailedand returned and in the days they sailed towards their destination sojan pieced together the ominous tale of the old ones and how the priests of rhan sought to conquer zylor with their evil aid it seemed that word of the plot was brought to uffjir first this country lies due north of rhan on the shortani coast and is generally better informed about the island of mystery as it is sometimes called than is the rest of zylor the uffjirian monarch king ashniophil had feared to make public the news as it would very likely force the rhanian priesthood into swifter action instead he had sent a messenger to enlist nornos riques aid as if the worst ever happened hatnor was the most powerful country on the whole planet nornos rique naturally had not thought it wise to notify his father at once as he knew the others aptitude to make quick but sometimes hasty decisions and this is what uffjir was trying to prevent unfortunately at the time of the messengers com ing the princess asderma had been with rique and had overheard everything she threatened to betray nornos rique to the rhanians unless he paid her a fabulous amount of money knowing that even when she had the money she would be dangerous rique decided to go into hid ing he had had to kidnap the girl and ride for rhan in an effort to come to terms with the rulers or if this failed destroy or capture their leaders and their strange unhuman allies after several detours he finally reached minifjar but not before the princess had escaped and fled to orfil who had promptly ridden for minifjar himself where a ship one of the purple fleet of the rhanian theocracyor priest rulers awaited him in case just such an emergency as this should occur the mercenarys questions had aroused his interest when he had overheard them at the inn and he had taken sojan prisoner only to be foiled by the uffjirian messenger who was acting as a rearguard for nornos rique the rest sojan knew now it was a race to get to rhan first the sea of demons it was a race to get to rhan first the purple arrow would take the comparatively safe way there by sail ing down the coast of poltoon until safer waters were reached and back to rhan via these waters the crinja however would attempt to sail through the demon sea cutting off a considerable part of the distance they knew little of what they had to fight against the arrow did not know of their plan and was relying on the greater speed to catch the crinja and either destroy it or beat it to rhan and have it destroyed then if the crinja could reach rhan first it would have several days start and the fate of the world would be decided in those days why the arrow had not sailed earlier they knew not but guessed that they were waiting for someone it was a days sail until they would reach the demon sea and in that time sojan got to know his companions better parijh the uffjirian proved to be a humorous man cheerful in the face of every danger they had had to meet when necessary he was an excellent swordsman but preferred to keep out of what he called unnecessary brawling this often gained him a reputation of cowardliness but as he said it was an asset rather than otherwise for what better oppo nent is there than the one who underestimates you sojan had to agree with this statement and a strong feeling of comradeship and mutual respect grew be tween them as they sailed ever nearer to the sea of demons nornos rique himself captained the crinja rique was a tall man with a face that though not hand some had a dependable and rockhard ruggedness and eyes of steel grey the mate was as is usual on zylorian naval craft either privateer or part of an authorised navy a cavalry captain by the name of andel of riss who although inclined to make independent decisions without consulting anyone first was a good man in any kind of fight and worth four of any man in the crew who were all fine men and who admired him and respected him as only seamen can respect a man they would also prove this in a fight with man or the elements the custom of placing cavalry men as secondsin command of ships is not as strange as it seems and the custom evolved thus at one time in the notsoancient history of zylor a strong rivalry developed between seamen and landsmen it became so bad that if a war came the land forces could never rely on the naval forces and vice versa it was the idea of assigning landsmen to learn the ways of the sea and naval officers to get to know the cavalry and infantry that saved them from chaos and nowadays the two forces worked together in perfect harmony later on the evening of the third day out of minifjar they were sailing a sea which was similar to any other sea but which according to the maps was the feared sea of demons wed better anchor here and sail on at daybreak nornos rique decided and he gave the order to drop anchor the anchor chain rattled down for sev eral seconds before stopping with a jarring clank waters too deep sir anchor wont take yelled andel then we darent drift ship oars and set sail on your course yes sir night fell forming an atmosphere of decay and death which could almost be smelled or touched but apart from this nothing happened save a faint scraping from time to time along the side of the boat which was attributed to some heavy seaweed or a piece of drift wood the twin suns rose and the green dawn came sending shadows and atmosphere scurrying over the horizon the sea was green and shone like dark jade with some of jades intangible mistiness oars smashed into it ploughing it in bright foam flecked furrows and the monotonous beat of the drum began sojan and his comrades ate breakfast in an atmo sphere of gloom its this confounded sea suddenly roared andel rising from his chair and crashing his fist into his open palm yit by the time this voyage is over therell be mens lives lost and most likely well all be on the bottom calm down andel well come to any danger when we get to it nornos rique said andel grunted sullenly and subsided two depressed hours followed until yit take us this oath was followed by a piercing scream which tailed off into a choking gasp the four men rushed on deck most of the crew were at the starboard rail staring downward to where a red foam flecked the white turn back sir you must turn back one hyster ical seaman rushed towards nornos rique screaming calm down and tell me what happened fear was in the mans eyes a terrible fear border ing on madness he babbled out his tale aa thingsirit crept up on mitesh andoh sirit grabbed him by the throat and jumped over board is that all its enough sir muttered another of the men what did this thing look like who saw it clearly i did sir it was the man who had commented a second before well it was a kind of green and brown scaly by yit sir it looked like a man might look if his mother had been a fish you mean this animal washuman not human sir but it had a mans body sure enough and his face was pointed like sir and his eyeshis eyes were green like the rest of him and seemed to rot you when he stared at you all right thank you take this man below and give him something to drink yes sir do we turn back no you all knew there was danger danger yes sir but not fromfrom devils get belowwe sail on back in their cabin sojan spoke ive heard old folktales rique about occurrences such as this one now i know why the ancients called this the sea of demons do you think they areorganised in any way ive never heard of them being anything but in large numbers perhaps this was a warning then i think it might have been wed better set all guns in readiness those har poons will come in useful i had them mounted in case of meeting any of those large saurians that inhabit the poltoonian ocean but it looks as if theyll be needed for a different game now the ships oars began to creak again but was the beat of the drum less sure were the oars a heartbeat slower it seemed to the men standing on the poopdeck that this was so towards the middle of the day the atmosphere of death grew and suddenly from the sea on four sides of the vessel the weird inhabitants of the sea of demons rose and attempted to board them but this time they were ready and the guns sent forth a steady stream of deadly missiles driving the shrieking horde back into the sea they went quickly enough yelled andel jubi lantly too quickly theyll be more wary next time and theyll be back at night for sure and night did fall and with it strange sounds which rose from the water and chilled the blood of the men on board but this time the crew were prepared and their searchlights stabbed the gloom picking out the gro tesque figures of the seapeople the crew moved forward their yells mingling with the strange hissing cries of the seapeople sabres flashed in the searchlight glare and the blood of seamen and the manlike monsters mingled on the deck making it difficult to get a footing the ship was a contrast of glaring light and total blackness men leaped from shadow into blinding gleam or disappeared into murky darkness mens breath was streaming in the cold night air mens battle cries pierced the shadows where light failed and sojan and his companions were in the thick of it their swords lashing this way and that at their inhuman adversaries sojans warcry spurred on the men and slowly then swiftly they pushed them back and the body of the last monster to invade their ship crashed over the rail to splash into the murky waters below there was an audible sigh from the sweating men weve pushed em back once lads and by yit well push them back from here to rhan if needs be cried sojan with the thrill of victory still in their hearts their pulses tingling with conquest the mens voices rose in assent a brief count found two sailors suffering from wounds where the talons of the seapeople had ripped them while three more men were missing obvi ously dragged down by the seapeople we should reach rhan in a day said nornos rique or the bottom broke in andel gloomily but the monotonous day ahead was broken only by the screaming of seabirds as they passed the outlying islands of the immortal theocracy of rhan as it was called this immortal theocracy was little more than rhan itself and a group of four islands inhabited mainly by primitive tribes most of whom dwelt in the interior anyway and had probably never heard of rhan as they neared rhan sojan felt misgivings would they succeed in carrying out their plan or would their perilous journey be in vain it was with these odd questions in his mind that he followed his friends down the gangplank and down a series of narrow lanes to a private house owned by a society known to those few holding positions of trust in the hatnorian empire as the friends of hatnor these friends were generally native hatnorians carrying forged or as in some cases real papers giving assumed names as well as assumed nationalities three long knocks and two short ones three times repeated gained them admission as they walked along the narrow corridor to the main living room they began to feel just a little more secure even though they were deep in the heart of the enemys cityjhambeelo but as the door swung open and friendly light flooded into the dark corridor they were taken aback hullo sojan grinned red i dont think ive met your friends by yit red how did you get here before us cried sojan simple i flew what no airship could make the distance youre quite right i didnt come by airship banjar here brought me for the first time the comrades noticed what ap peared to be a hunchbacked rather tall man with piercing blue eyes and aquiline features darkhaired with a swarthy complexion to snap the bow in half said red using a term common on zylor which means roughlyto cut a long story short jik wanwif selwoon and myself succeeded in staving a rather large hole in the bot tom of the purple arrow naturally enough it was not long before we were beginning to regret this as the water was rising steadily in the hold then as we were all good swimmers i thought that the only way to escape drowning would be to enlarge the hole and get out that way so in turns we widened the hole and with a great deal of difficulty pulled ourselves under the keel of the boat and up into the open water we lost wanwif im sorry to say he didnt make it well after that we found that we would have been better off drowning in the ship as there was no sight of land i learned afterwards that we were in the black ocean and this didnt help as the stories ive heard of the black ocean are any thing but cheerful but believe it or not after swim ming in a westerly direction for an hour or so we were picked up by a little fishing vessel oared only manned by some natives of yoomik which is the largest of the rhanian group next to rhan itself the people looked after us but soon we got weary of hanging around their village and decided that an exploratory trip into the interior of the island would be the only thing to break the monotony we trekked for several days until coming upon the village of banjars peoplethe ascri the ascri at one time were enslaved by the rhanian priesthood and still bear a grievance against them it was banjar who when he had heard that i believed you were going to rhan suggested that he fly me there we landed at night and made our way here banjars people are advanced in many of the crafts and sciences and they have an asset which helps them tremendously show sojan and his friends your asset banjar banjar grinned and stood up unfolding a pair of huge wings my people i believe are descended from the ancient winged mammals who used to live on zylor just an offshoot of evolution i suppose but one which has proved of great help to my people who can travel great distances at great speeds and al though we are few in number we can elude any enemies by leaving the ground and escaping that way as my friend says it is a great asset formal introductions were made and food eaten but when this was finished sojan spoke to red have you managed to find out anything which might prove useful to us red i have indeed my friend i have found out some thing which with your courage and skill and a great deal of luck will save the world from chaos prisoners in stone reds plan was simple enough members of the se cret society of the friends of hatnor had found an ancient plan of the great temple which was both chief place of worship and the centre of the priest hoods rule in rhan there were three tunnels lead ing into it old sewers long since disused two were culdesacs having been walled up but in the last the walling had been a hasty job and the bricks used to seal it had collapsed however these tun nels were still guarded at the other end some said by palace guardsbut others said simply that they were guarded by something even if the foe was human it would take an incredibly brave man to venture the rotting tunnels why not an army asked andel surely a great many men would be safer than one safer yes but certainly not so secret every ac tion we make must not be detected by the priest hoodotherwise we are lost we can only make a very wide guess at what power these old ones wield and it is our aim to stop them using itnot bring it down upon our headsand the rest of the worlds heads also i see said parijh then let me be the one to go i offer not out of heroicswhich are extremely bad taste in any casebut i am more accustomed to stealth than these swordswinging barbarians with me he grinned ho so thats what we are are we roared andel ill have you know but the comrades would never hear the rest of andels forthcoming witticism for red broke in be a bit quieter andel or youll have the whole of the rhanian soldiery on our heads sorry said andel no continued red i think sojan should go he is better for the job than anyone else he has barbarian training he is catfooted lynxeyed and can hear a sword sing in its scabbard a mile away i think he will succeed in getting through more than any other man in our company then it will be i thats settled said sojan with satisfaction when and where do i start you start now and i will lead you to the en trance of the tunnel i suggest that you take a rifle an axe your shield and your long sword halfarmour would be advisable also then i shall take your advice sojan laughed and proceeded to don halfarmour this consisted of greaves for his legs and a breastplate and helmet then he was ready and prepared to follow red down winding backstreets to a small turning near the great temple here red lifted a rusted cover to reveal an equally rusted ladder leading down into darkness good luck was all he said as sojan slipped down into the gloom and sought about for hand and footholds on the ageworn rail then the lid was replaced and sojan found himself in utter darkness down he fumbled sometimes missing footing where one of the metal bars had rusted away once nearly falling when his groping hand instead of clos ing on solid metal closed on damp air but at last he was on the uneven floor of the disused sewer peer ing into the gloom he followed the wall along for what seemed an eon stumbling over fallen bricks and refuse at last he sensed an obstruction ahead and he unsheathed his sword and felt the reassuring butt of his heavy pistol in his hand on he went past the fallen wall untilsuddenlythere was no more tunnel or so it seemed his right hand which had been groping along the wall touched nothing but after the first brief shock he grinned to himself this was the right hand turn of the tunnel soon he would meet the guardians and meet them he did for with a soulshaking shriek two of the mysterious guardians were upon him huge reptilian things redeyed and redmouthed with teeth reaching a foot long and razor sharp sojan shocked by their sudden attack took a step backwards hitched his rifle to his shoulder and fired straight into the mouth of the foremost beast it shrieked again but still came on hastily he dropped the rifle and replaced it with his heavy axe and long sword but before the beast reached him it had stum bled and fallen with crumpling forelegs writhing in a fit of agony which ended with one abrupt shudder of death the other monster was checked for a moment sniffed the corpse of its companion and then voiced another spinechilling shriek which was half hiss and half human cry sojan met it with sword lashing and axe whining through the air about his head back went the monster but it returned in an instant clutch ing at sojan with its claws which almost resembled human handsthough hands with six inch steel tal ons on the ends of each finger sojan stumbled back wards his axe cutting and hacking at the hideous thing his sword slashing into its throat again and again until at last it was down in a death agony that lasted minutes pausing to wipe his weapons clean of blood and to pick up his rifle sojan moved on down the tunnel feeling a little more cheerful now that he knew his foe and had conquered it and abruptly he was at the end of the runnel and a similar steel ladder in better condition lead ing upwards warily he clambered up rifle axe and shield strapped across his broad back and his sword firmly clenched in his teeth there was a metal cover here too and he lifted it cautiously to be blinded for a moment by the sudden gleam he had been so long in darkness and the semidarkness of the tunnel that he blinked hard for several seconds until his eyes became accustomed to the light silently he eased his body through the narrow hole and just as softly replaced the cover he was in a lighted corridor with torches on either side the corridor was short and had a door at each end which door he decided immediately to take the door which led farthest away from the tunnel at least he would be a little deeper into the temple and nearer the inner room in the centre which housed the old ones gradually he pushed the door until it swung open he thanked the gods of light yit and corrunj that they had not been locked down another corridor he sped catfooted as ever wary hands on sword and rifle his armour glinted in the torchlight and his shadow loomed black and huge on the wall most of the priests would be at rest he knew but it was equally certain that guards would be posted at strategic points and absolute caution was necessary he had a rough plan of the temple printed in his mind but the maze of corridors which he was follow ing and which ran deeper and deeper into the heart of the temple were complicated and were probably or more recent origin for the map had been very old but cautious as he knew he must be he was cer tainly not slow for every heartbeat counted he had to reach the chamber of the old ones somehow and discover whoor whatthey were and what their motives were for allying themselves with the evil priesthood of rhan the murmurs of voices the laughs of men the clank of swordscabbard against armour at last a guarded entrance was he near the strange sanctu ary of the old ones the mens backs were to him this was not the time for heroics for a cry would mean discovery and discovery he must avoid he raised his rifle and brought it down on the head of one guard while with his other hand he chopped at the back of the other mans neck they both collapsed without a murmur looking up and down the intersecting cor ridor to make sure he had not been seen he grabbed the two bodies by their loose clothing and pulled them back into the shadows no time to hide them and no time to hide himself for the clank of steel shod feet resounded down the corridor he hugged the wall and prayed to his ancient gods that he would not be discovered sojan heard the steps come nearer and nearer and then miraculously fade away again risking discovery he peered round the wall and saw an other passageway down it strode two guards and one of the infamous high priests of rhan the rulers of the place catfooted as usual he followed them this corridor was not very well lighted but unlike the others it had doors set in the walls sojan hoped that one of these would not open suddenly the priest stopped wait here sojan heard him say no time to think now he must act into the nearest apartment and pray to yit that it was unoccupied luck the rooms were empty these sojan could see were the apartments of the high priests no monkish sparsity of furniture herethese rooms were lavishly furnished and decorated grinning sojan bounced down on to the bed and breathed a prayer of relief then he was up again and taking in his surroundings on one wall hung several of the long flowing robes which the high priests wore one of the customs of these men was to go veiledto give them a little more security from the assassin sojan guessedand also to enable them to slip from the temple and mingle with the people without fear of being recognised this was one of the reasons why the people of rhan were so easily kept in subjection by the evil priestrulers but there was a chance though sojan knew it was a slim one that he could don one of these robes and enter the inner chamber and meet the mysterious old ones face to face quickly he slipped into the robe stuffing all but his sword and pistol under a nearby couch and hoping that they would not be discovered his sword and pistol were well hidden by the folds of the robe and he could keep his armour on out now and down the passage past the loung ing soldiers who sprang to attention and saluted him with the usual zylorian saluteclenched fists against temples and a short bow from the waist sojan acknowledged the salute by a curt nod of his head the veil hid his features entirely and if he was unmasked by some mishaponly the other high priests would know whether he was a fraud or not so comparatively safe sojan moved along the corri dor towards the huge metalstudded door which was the portal to the inner chamber it was unlocked and the guards on each side of it stood away respectfully as sojan opened it at first he could see nothing the room was lit by one torch which cast shadows everywhere then from one corner of the large chamber a voice spoke it was a voice of infinite weariness full of lost hope and the knowledge of an eternity of despair why trouble us again priest we have promised to do your bidding and we keep our wordif you do not sojan realised that instead of the evil forces he had expected here were prisoners slaves rather than allies of the priesthood im no priest he said if i knew who you were i might help you even is this another trick priest murmured the voice although this time there was a little hope in it no trick im a sworn enemy of the priesthood of rhan i represent the rest of zylor who have no wish to become enslaved bythe rhanians yet rumour has it that you are allied with them he squinted into the darkness who are youor what we are the old inhabitants of zylor we lived here before ever the shining ships of humanity sprang from distant planets in a desperate attempt to reach another habitable planet they thought that the end of their world had come as it happened their world did not die but it was too late then they had taken all their knowledge out into space with them and in the long journey from galaxy to galaxy much of their knowledge perished for the journey took cen turies to complete by the time the new generations reached this planet their ancestors had died and man had to start again almost from the beginning these men who called themselves lemurians lived peacefully with us for many hundreds of years and we helped them as much as possible for we are a very ancient race and had more knowledge than ever the ances tors of the lemurians although of a different kind for while man concentrated on improving his body we concentrated on improving our minds and could control mighty elements with our wills eventually the men became frightened of us and sent us away there were only a few of us living in farflung colo nies then now we are even less but how did you become the slaves of these priests asked sojan what happened although there were many men who feared us and called us things of evil and similar names there were others who began to worship us for our pow ers calling us gods and setting up altars and tem ples to us just as some men are foolish some of our num ber were foolish and began to think that perhaps they were gods after all they dwelt in the temples and had sacrifices made to them and took part in meaningless rituals the priests soon found their weaknesses however and decided that they could rule the people if they frightened them by telling them of the wrath of the gods and so on they succeeded in capturing us and imprisoning us i was one of the foolish ones our contemporaries have long since left this planet in search of another unin habited by man with whom they cannot live in peace you may have read in your history scrolls of the mighty theocracy which dominated the world at one time rhan is now all that is left of the theo cracya remnant of a great and terrible nation the people rose against their oppressors country by coun try until the evil priesthood was driven back further and further to seek refuge on this island the origi nal capital of the old imperial theocracy it was here that the cult based on worship of us was spawned and if you can help us it is here that it will die otherwise a new black age shall cover the world in a cloak of death but cried sojan if you do not wish them to rule man then why do you help them why do you lend them your powers to destroy the great nations of zylor they have promised us freedom o man free dom after thousands of decades freedom after eons of despair we would follow our brothers we would travel the infinite lengths of space and time were we once released we would see suns and planets green things seas and plains for us these things are worth more than life we are of them more than manfor we like the planets and the stars and the grass that grows for ever are almost immortal we have no bodies as man knows bodies no senses as man interprets senseswe are minds you can see that the temptation is great we were not strong willed to begin with we were proud of mans petty ceremonies now that he offers us light and free dom again we must accept unless there is another way there may be another way sojan said if you will but tell me how you are imprisoned perhaps i can release you there are certain minerals rare and almost un known which have the properties that lead has com pared to radium radium cannot harm or pass through lead similarly although we can pass through most minerals and life forms we are imprisoned if we enter a certain precious stone we can enter it but by some strange trick of nature our beings can not pass back through it thus we were enticed centuries ago into these blocks of ermtri stone the only way in which we can escape is by someone outside boring shafts into the blocks and thus cut ting channels through which we can pass do you understand dimly sojan understood though his brain was shaken by the effort of trying to imagine beings so utterly alien to man yet in some ways akin to him he picked up the torch and cast its light towards the centre of the hall there on an altar covered by a crimson cloth rested five large blocks of some dark cloudy blue substance likelike blue jade it was a stone that sojan who had travelled the whole of his planet almost had never seenhad never what is more heard ofnot even in legends i understand he said what tool will cut it steel sharp steel will bore into it have you steel yes will it hurt you no it will leave no impression wiping sweat from his forehead and hands sojan moved towards the blocks he drew his sword and clambered up on to the altar placing the sharp point of his blade on top of the first block he turned it round and round feeling it bite deeper and deeper into the strange substance he became aware of a strange tingling which seemed to flow up his sword and into his body he couldnt define it but it was not unpleasant suddenly there was a dazzling burst of green and orange brightness and something seemed to flow from the hole that he had bored flow out and upwards lighting the room he heard no words but in his mind there was a great sense of joyof thanks then one by one he saw the other blocks broken by the same strange power open and the green and orange brightness flow from them then they took on a slightly more solid shape until sojan could make out eyes and circular bodies these then were the old ones perhaps in a mil lion million years man too would have succeeded in being able to form the atoms of his body into whatever shape he desired perhaps these beings once were men that would explain the strange kinship sojan felt for them a kinship which his lemurian ancestors felt also before their witnessing of such alien powers changed their finer feelings into those of fear and hate before you leave sojan begged i crave one request as a price for your release anything then when i am out of this building and safely at sea destroy this place of evil so that the power of the priests will be shattered for all time and such an evil can never rise again gladly we grant you this we will wait here until you are at sea but tread carefully we cannot help you to escape thanking them sojan turned about and left sword in hand but in his exultation he had forgotten the soldiers outside and they stared in amazement at the sword in his hand and the sweat on his face this did not seem to them any high priest taking quick stock of the situation sojan spoke to them ii had a little difficulty with one of the bolts on the interior he lied i had to use this sword to loosen it with a puzzled look the men bowed and saluted but there was doubt in their eyes a priest would not go unveiled for anything he heard one of them murmur as he entered the room which he had left previously he doesnt seem a priest to me here you stop a minute but sojan had bolted the door and was hastily donning his weapons again the men began to bang on the door and more men came to see what the noise was about thats no priest he heard someone say the high priest thoro is conducting the ceremony of death in the outer temple he wont be back for hours batter the door down you fools came a voice that was obviously that of one in authority probably a high priest anxiously sojan looked for another exit there was only a curtained window he parted the curtain and looked outside it was still dark he looked down a courtyard scarcely ten feet below with luck he thought i can jump down there and escape as best i can he put a foot on the ledge and swung himself over dropping lightly to the grass of the courtyard in the centre of the court yard a fountain splashed quietlya scene of peace and solitude but not for long he saw a face at the window he had so recently quit hes down there one of the soldiers shouted sojan ducked into the nearest doorway opposite the room he had left he ran down a short dark corridor and up a flight of steps no sign of pursuit yet panting heavily he ran in the direction he knew an exit to be it would be guarded now he knew for the whole temple was by this time alert and so it was with his usual good luck sojan had succeeded in making the exit unchallenged but there would be no such luck here with five huge soldiers coming at him again he had no time for heroics his pistol came up and two of his wouldbe killers went down the other three were on him now and his sword cut a gleaming arc about his head his battleaxe shrieked as if for blood as he carried the attack towards his foes instead of they to him nonplussed for a sec ond they fell back that falling back was for them death for now sojan had some kind of advantage and he made full use of it as he drove blow after blow thrust after thrust into the men bleeding himself from several wounds sojan came on down went one man then another now the last warrior fighting with desperation hacked and par ried and sought an opening in sojans amazing guard none came the man sought an opening too often lunged forwardand almost pinioned himself on sojans blade back he tried to leap clumsily a perfect target for a whistling battered axe to bury itself in helmet and brain leaving his axe where it had come to rest sojan fled the temple his heart pounding he finally reached the house where his friends waited come he cried im successfulbut we must make the ship immediately all of us else we all die i dont know what they intend to do his companions realised that there was no time for an explanation and followed him wordlessly a frantic race for the docks one brief skirmish with a city patrol and then they were on board up anchor out oars castoff and as the ship sped from the harbour they looked back there came a blinding flash and then a deep rolling roar as the great temple erupted in a sudden burst of flame then as they peered back at the city there was blackness again the temple was not burningthere was no temple now to burnit had been dissolved as they watched sojan and his friends saw five streaks of blue and orange flame rise skyward and rocket upwards and outwardstowards the stars what was that gasped nornos rique the old ones smiled sojan ill tell you a tale which you may not believe but it is a tale which has taught me muchas well as giving me a valuable history lesson the voyage back was not a boring one for sojans companions as they listened to his strange tale but what of the purple galley you ask what of orfil and the princess who betrayed rique that readers is a story which is short and sad they too attempted to sail through the sea of demons in pursuit of sojan and his companions but they were not so lucky the plain of mystery the wind tore at the rigging of the tiny aircruiser as it pushed bravely into the howling storm four men clung to the deck rails whilst a fifth strove to steer the tossing gondola keep her headed north yelled nornos rique to sojan at this rate well be tossed on to shortani unless the wind shifts he yelled back parijh the uffjirian grimaced ive been meaning to go home for some time he called youll be home for your own funeral unless some one gives me a hand with this wheel cried sojan sojan nornos rique parijh andel and red the five men who had saved their planet of zylor from the evil priestrulers of rhan some months ago were returning to hatnor after being the guests of honour at several banquets held to celebrate their triumph sojan rique andel and red had been uncomfort able about the whole thing only parijh always glad of the limelight had enjoyed himself thoroughly the storm had sprung up quickly and they were now battling to keep the little dirigible into the wind which drove them steadily southwards wouldnt it be better to land sojan andel shouted it would be my friend if we knew where we were theres every likelihood of getting out of this trouble into something worse suddenly there was a loud snapping sound and the wheel spun throwing sojan off balance and on to the deck what was that yelled parijh steerings gone we cant attempt to repair it in this weather well just have to drift now the five trooped down into the tiny cabin even there it was not warm and they were all depressed as they shivered in their cloaks and attempted to get some sleep morning came and the storm had not abated it lasted all through that day the wind ripping into the ship and sending it further and further south theres never been a storm like this in my mem ory nornos rique said the others agreed further north said andel theyre quite fre quent lasting for days so they say thats true said sojan by midnight of the next night the storm finished and the sky cleared of the clinging cloud the stars their constellations unfamiliar to earth eyes shone brightly and sojan took a quick bearing were over shortani all right he muttered well over in fact i believe were near the interior of the continent beneath them the scene was one of peace rather than that of death and mystery great plains wa tered by winding rivers lush forests rearing moun tains proudlike gods looking down upon men here and there herds of strange animals could be detected for the moons were very bright they were drinking and did not look up at the airship gliding silently above them in the morning sojan and andel set to work on repairing the broken steeringlines whilst the others looked down at the peacefulseeming country be neath them all the time they worked they drifted further and further into the interior if we drift much further sojan we wont have enough fuel to get us out again remember we only had enough for a short journey parijh called up to him where he was working on the steering gear yit take us i hadnt thought of that cried sojan but theres nothing we can do until this steering is fixed work as fast as possible andel or well be stranded here but repairing the steering wires and readjusting the rudder especially sitting in the rigging with only a flimsy safety line between you and oblivion isnt easy and it took sojan and andel several hours be fore the motors could be started up again theres not enough fuel to make it back to hatnor sojan said but if were lucky well make a civilised country on the shortani coast now there was nothing they could do but hope and the men relaxed watching the wonderful sce nery beneath them and speculating on what kind of men if any lived there red who played a zylorian instrument called a rinfrita kind of eightstringed guitar sang them a song based on an old legend about these parts the first verse went something like this theres many a tale that has been told of phek the traveller strong and bold but the strangest one ive ever heard is when he caught a shifla bird whats a shifla bird enquired andel curiously oh its supposed to be as big as an airship and looks like a great lizard his companions were amused at this story and all but sojan who was looking over towards the west laughed dont worry too much said sojan calmly but is that anything like your shifla bird and there rising slowly from the forest was the largest animal any of the adventurers had ever seen earth men would call it a dragon if they saw it its great reptilian jaws were agape and its huge bat wings drove it along at incredible speed it seems there was some truth in the legend muttered red licking dry lips and automatically fin gering his pistol at his belt theres always some truth in legends said sojan however incredible the thing was almost upon them now obviously taking their cruiser for some kind of rival it was as big as their cruiser although its body was about half the size whilst its wings made up the rest of its bulk it was a kind of blueish grey its great mouth a gash of crimson in its head whilst wicked eyes gleamed from their sockets making it look like some supernatural demon from the zylorian halls of the dead drop sojan drop cried nornos rique as the men stood for a moment paralysed at this sight of something which they attributed only to the story scrolls of children sojan whirled rushed over to the controls and pushed several levers which opened valves in their gasbag and caused the ship to lose height quickly the shifla swooped low overhead barely missing them and causing them to duck automatically sud denly there came a crashing of branches the ripping of fabric and the harsh snap of breaking wood the ship had crashed into the forest the men had been so busy trying to escape from the danger above them that they had forgotten the forest beneath them sojan lifted his arm to shield his face and flung himself backwards as a branch speared through the ship as if it were a fish and nearly speared him at the same time eventually the noise stopped and al though the ship was swaying dangerously and threat ening to fall apart any moment sending the men to destruction sojan and his friends found that they had only bruises and scratches sojans barbarian instincts came to the rescue cat footed as ever he clambered out of the wreckage on to the branch which had almost killed him quick he yelled after me his friends followed him quickly parijh panting with the effort they moved cautiously along the branch and finally reached the trunk of the tree down they clambered easily now for the tree was full of strong branches and it was only a drop of four or five feet to the ground sojan looked up to where the airship dangled its great gasbag deflated the gondola smashed and torn when that falls he said wed better be some distance away for its likely that the engine will explode there go our supplies and rifles and ammuni tion said nornos rique quietly weve got our livesfor the present at least sojan reminded him well have to head steadily northwards and hope that we dont strike a moun tain range if we are lucky we can follow a river across a plain several plains adjoin civilised or semi civilised territories dont they parijh one of them runs into my own country of uffjir sojan but theres one chance in fifty of making it then it looks as if well have to chance it parijh sojan replied slowly looking over towards the east but at least we shall be able to ride theresee they looked in the direction in which he was pointing about a mile away a herd of myats grazed placidly fan outwe should catch them easily if we organise properly sojan called slowly so that they would not disturb the ani mals sojan and his friends closed in on the myats once trapped they were easily caught for unlike most animals used as beasts of burden myats were bred originally for the sole purpose of carrying man now that they were mounted the friends made good time in the direction in which they were headed some days later sojan caught sight of a strange gleam in the distanceas if the sun was glancing off a highly polished surface head in that direction he called to his compan ions there seems to be a building of some kind over there and sure enough it was a building a great glis tening domed construction rising hundreds of feet so it seemed into the air it was built of a similar stone to marblebut what was it and why was it standing alone in such a savage wilderness and this troubled the companions more than anything were there men using it now the only way to find out who or what is in there is to go nearer said andel youre right agreed sojan lets go they forced their steeds into a quick trot they dismounted silently and made their way cau tiously to the wide entrance of the place which seemed to be unguarded there were windows high above them seeming to be set in rooms situated at different levels in the building part of the roof was flat but most of it rose in a magnificent dome although there were no signs of corrosion at all the men got the impression that the building was centuries old there seem to be no stairs in the place mused sojan looking around him at the gleaming marble halls which they had entered to his left were two sheets of shining metal seemingly set into the walls for no reason to his right was an archway leading into a room just as bare as the one in which they now stood wonder what these are red said brushing his hand across one of the metal sheets instantly there was a faint hum and the sheet of metal disappeared upwards revealing a smallwas it a cupboard red stepped warily into the alcove sword in hand at once the sheet of metal hummed downwards behind him by yit hes trapped cried sojan he brushed his own hand across the metal but nothing happened for several minutes he tried to open the metal door but it seemed impossible how red had done it they could not tell suddenly from the outside came a yell rushing into the sunlight they looked upand there was red looking very cheerful grinning down on themfrom a window of the tenth storey the one nearest the roof how did you get up there called nornos rique the cupboard took me up its a kind of moving box which lifts you up to any storey you wish though i had to go all the way up there were lots of buttons to press but i dare not press any of them after id got out the doors closed again i tried to get back in but the doors at that end wouldnt move it looks as if im stuck here for life he didnt look as if he was particularly worried about the prospect comprehending sojan rushed back into the great hall and again passed his hand over the metal door it hummed upwards he didnt step in immediately but waited for his friends to join him the ones who built this place must have been wonderful engineers remarked sojan and by the way i recognised the language in which the direc tions for the operation of that thing were writtenits old kifinian what exclaimed parijh you mean that the ancestors of the kifinians built this obviously otherwise how do you explain the language from what you learned at the temple of rhan sojan mused nornos rique the ancestors of the entire planet so far as human beings like ourselves are concerned came from another planet thousands of years agoperhaps this was built before the race spread and degenerated but what could it be i think i know answered sojan notice how the whole area around the building is entirely treelessa flat plaina few shrubs now and other vegetation but for the most part flat this place was a landing field for airships of some kind we have as you know similar landing fields all over the civi lised parts of zylor this place was a control station probably suddenly red who had been standing by the win dow called to his friends look down there he yelled savages hundreds of them below them swarmed a silent mass of strange near human creatures they all carried spears and broad bladed swords they were covered in short matted hair and had long tails curling behind them we seem to have violated taboo ground judging by their actions said parijh who knew the people better than the rest for his race occasionally traded with them they wont enter themselves but they will wait until we come outas come out we must for food the best thing we can do said andel is to look around this place and see if there is any other way out good idea agreed sojan if you see any more of those metal plates try to open them they split up and each explored a certain section of the floor soon they heard andel call from the centre of the building rushing to the room from which he had called they were astounded to see a large opened panel this one revealed a kind of bridge spanning a drop which must have gone right down to the foundations of the building the bridge led to a huge streamlined shell of gleaming metal fitted with triangular fins they stepped on to the bridge and moved single file across it until they reached a door scowling faintly sojan deciphered the ancient hieroglyphics on it here we are he said pressing a button to open and open it did its obviously an airship of some kind said andel who was the most mechanically minded of the five probably a ship similar to the ones in which our ancestors came to this planet you mean an airship capable of travelling through space said sojan perhaps said andel but also travelling from continent to continent probably if only we knew how to operate it they finally managed to find the control room of the ship all around them were tiers of dials and instruments working quickly now that the script was becoming more familiar to him sojan deciphered most of the captions on the instruments set on the main control panel were levers marked automatic emergency poltoon automatic emergency jhar etc the names were those of continents we cant stay here all the time said sojan if we stay we will starve to death if we go outside we die we might as well risk it so saying and with out waiting for his friends advice he pulled the lever marked poltoon and stood back there came a gentle hum as the door through which they had entered closed another hum grew steadily louder and the entire roof of the building opened out letting in the sunlight then a hiss and a rumble like thunder and sojan and his companions were thrown to the floor still the rumble increased until blackness overcame them and they lost con sciousness sojan was the first to recover looking through the forward porthole he saw a sight which to him was terrifying the velvet blackness of outer space stars set like diamonds in its ebony beauty there was another rumble from the depths of the ship with animal tenacity he sought to cling to consciousness but it was no good he collapsed once more on the floor of the ship he awoke a second time to see a blue sky above him and green vegetation beneath him his friends rose on shaky legs were not much better off it seems grinned sojancheerful now were in the poltoonian wil derness the nearest civilised land is tigurn see over there are the remains of a port similar to the one on the shortani plain he pulled another lever immediately the port holes disappeared and they had the sensation of moving downwards at great velocity a high pitched whine and they stopped a panel slid open and a small bridge moved outwards over a drop of some five feet above the ground there was probably a landing stage at this point said sojan with the air of an ancient professor deliv ering a lecture anyway he laughed we can drop the last few feet when they reached the ground they stood back then the faint purr of machinery and the doors closed another sound not quite so smooththe chugchug of an airship motor the companions turned and saw several large airships of standard pattern circling above them they flew the banner of pelira a country which had allegiance to hatnor flying low the captain of the airship inspected them saw that they were not the strange monsters he had expected and landed his craft lightly fifty feet away from them they ran towards it the look of astonishment on the captains face was ludicrous he immediately recognised the com panions who since their conquest of the priestrulers of rhan had become national heroes whatwhat was all he could get out at first howre you fixed for fuel friend laughed sojan weweve got a full tank sir but how then head for hatnor grinned the adventurer well explain on the way the sons of the snakegod who seeks to set foot in dharimjak a harsh voice rang across the harbour to the mer chantman kintonian trader which ran at anchor there the captain cupped his hands into a megaphone and roared back at the soldier sojan shieldbearer late of the court of nornos kad in hatnor mercenary swordsman seeking employment ive heard of him very well we need good sword arms in dharimjak tell him he may land traani captain of the trader called down to sojan who sat sprawled in his cabin they say you can land sojan right ill get my gear together ten minutes later a tall figure stepped on to the deck of the ship his long fair hair was held back from his eyes by a fillet of metal his dark blue eyes had a strange humorous glint in them over a jer kin of green silk was flung a heavy cloak of yellow his blue breeches were tucked into leather boots upon his back was slung a long and powerful air rifle on his left arm he carried a round shield from a belt around his waist were hung a long vilthor and a pistol holster sojan the swordsman was looking for work later that day in an inn near the city centre sojan met the man to whom he had been directed when he had told the authorities of the harbour what kind of employment he was seeking youre looking for employment in the ranks of the regular military i hear what qualifications do you have he said i was commander of the armies of imperial hatnor for nearly a year in that time i succeeded in stop ping a rising in veronlam a similar rising in asno i organised the poltoonian barbarians when nornos kad was deposed and restored him to his throne i and four others were instrumental in utterly destroy ing the wouldbe conquerors of zylorthe rhanian theocracy i have been involved in several minor border wars but of late things have quietened down and i thought that i would try my luck somewhere else i heard of the impending war between the city states of dharimjak and forshmai and decided that i would like to take part i have heard of you sojan your remark about rhan jogged my memory i feel that you would be a great asset to us we need more professional sol diers of your calibre as you know both dharim jak and forshmai have been on friendly terms for hundreds of years neither of us had any use for regular armies then about a year ago this new reli gious cult took over the ruling of forshmai and quickly formed an army of soldiers spies trouble makers and all kinds of undercover men it was only recently that our own spies brought us the news that as we suspected forshmai was preparing to march into dharimjak and take over our republic have you any idea when they intend to attack in two weeks time no less im sure then we must work fast i would be grateful to know what kind of command you intend giving me i shall have to discuss that with my superiors i will naturally let you know as soon as possible edek rose downed the last of his drink and with a short nod left the inn just as sojan was rising there came a scream from the alley outside sword out he rushed for the door to see a girl struggling in the grip of several burly fighting men they were obviously bent on kidnapping her and sojan lost no time in engaging the nearest hirelng the man was an expert swordsman his thrusts were well timed and it was all sojan could do at first to parry them the mans companions were still holding the girl who seemed to be making no attempt to get free the clash of steel was music to him and a grim fighting smile appeared on his lips suddenly he felt a hard blow on the back of his head and the lights went out he regained consciousness in a small room barred on both door and windows standing over him were two men one held a water jug in his hand with which he was dousing sojan so our hardheaded mercenary is at last awake i see the tone was gloating the mans face did not belie the impression his voice gave his thick black locks and beard were curled and oiled upon his fingers were heavy rings his nails were tinted with gold sojan looked at him in disgust the bejewelled fop signalled to his companion to throw some more water at sojan instantly sojan rose and knocked the jug flying across the small cell if your manners were as fine as the silks you wear my friend i should take you for some sort of man the fops face twisted for a moment and he half raised his hand then he smiled and dropped the hand to his side well allow the wolf some time in which to cool the heat of his temper as water seems to be no use he murmured come yuckof let us leave this placeit smells sojan signalled to the guard who was locking the door what place is this friend youre in the castle of yerjhi swordsman we caught you nicely didnt we that ruse in getting a girl to pretend that she was being captured was lord yerjhis idea hes a clever one youd be better off to be a little more civil to him he is thinking of employing you several hours later yerjhi returned with the same escort now sojan he smiled i can understand your annoyance at being locked up in this placebut it was the only way in which we couldumconvince you of our sincerity when we offer you fifty thou sand derkas to take command of our armies and lead them to glorious victory for the state of forshmai we the sons of the snake will conquer all every thing will be yours what say you man is that not a fair proposition aye its fair sojans eyes narrowed he de cided to bluff for a while fifty thousand you say that and any spoils you can take for yourself when we loot dharimjak but whats this sons of the snake you mention do i have to join some secret society to wield a sword for fifty thousand derkas that is a necessary part of our offer sojan we are after all doing this for the glory of rij the snake lord of the world and the after world mas ter of darkness ruler of the yes yes well forget that for a moment what does it involve first a meeting of all the major disciples myself the generalincommand who will take orders from you while the conquest is in progress my major domo the two priests who inventhmmwho spread the truth of the snake but why this mumbojumboif you want to con quer your enemy why not just do it i cant under stand what youre trying to do then briefly i will explain the two cities have been at peace for hundreds of years men and women from the states have intermingled with each other intermarried apart from the names and boundaries we are practically the same people we need an excuse man dont you see we cant send a man to march against his brother or even son unless he thinks that there is something worth fighting for this my dear sojan is ahmmholy war quite legitimate we arehow shall i put itspreading the word of the snake god with the sword of jus tice part of our indoctrination campaign actually that last bit right ill join sojan had hit on a daring plan when do i become an initiate an hour later sojan stood in a darkened room in front of him was a long table and at it sat men dad in robes decorated with serpents let the ceremony begin he intoned now was the time to act they had given sojan back his sword along with his other equipment and he now drew it with the blade humming he downed the two nearest men three left three wary men and led by one who had been described as the finest swordsman in shortani luckily only two of the men were swordsmen the other was almost helpless in the fore yerjhi cowl flung back and his face a mask of hate trick me would you he hissed well show you what we do to dogs who try to turn on yerjhi sojan felt a lancing pain go through him and he felt the warm blood as it trickled down his left arm with renewed energy he launched himself at yerjhi who was taken off guard for a moment clean steel pierced a tainted heart and the man toppled back wards with a short deathscream with the fake sons of the snake god exposed for what they were what amounted to civil war was averted and the two cities resumed their friendly relations once again sojan had done a major service for a cause in which he believed the devil hunters of norj the last rays of zylors second sun were just wan ing when sojan reined his myat and stared down into the green valley below he glanced at the crude map before him this must be the valley of norj it seems to be unexplored according to the map strange that no one has ventured into it strange it was for even in the dusk sojan could see that the valley was lush and green a river wound through it and brightly plumed birds sang from the branches of tall trees a seeming paradise it will make an excellent place to camp thought the mercenary as he guided his mount downwards later that night he made his camp in a small natural clearing in the forest his myat was tethered nearby and his campfire glowed cheerily the night was warm and full of forest smells after eating his meal sojan climbed between his blankets and was soon asleep it was just after midnight when the strange noises awakened the warrior there they were againa peculiar hissing screech and the pounding of hooves the cries ofmen and the vicious cracks of whips sojan raised himself on one elbow hand reaching for his sword the myat stirred uneasily and swished its great tail from side to side the noises drew nearer and then subsided as they fell away towards the west of the valley sojan did not sleep any more that night but kept a watchful eye open the rest of the night was un eventful and in the morning sojan cooked himself a big meal which was meant to last him the day for he intended to investigate the noises he had heard the night before riding slowly with eyes always scanning the ground sojan soon found the tracks that the inhabi tants of the valley had made there were two dis tinct sets of tracks one similar to those of a myat although with subtle differences seemingly lighter the others were entirely unfamiliar threetoed tracks like and yet unlike those of a birdand considera bly larger the beast that had made them as obvi ously a quadruped of some kind but other than that sojan could not tell what kind of animal had made themthere were fourlegged birds he could think ofand none of these he had heard about were as large as this there had been at least ten riders and it seemed that they had been chasing one or perhaps two of these birdbeasts probably some kind of hunt thought sojan yet what kind of men were they who hunted at the dead of night sojan rode on following the tracks in the hope that he would find some clue to the mystery he came across a steep inclination the tracks ended here in a flurry of mud andblood then the tracks of the beasts the men had been riding continued and they had ridden for a short while parallel with the bluff and then forced their animals to ride up it sojan did the same the beast slipped occasionally and nearly slid back but eventually it reached the top from there sojan saw a strange scene a battle of some kind was going on between two groups of men near a squat blackstoned tower five men one mounted were endeavouring to check a horde of armoured warriors who rushed from the tower beasts similar to sojans myat but hornless and almost tailless stood waiting the mounted man held the tethering reins of the other four animals while he cut at two of the armoured men with a battleaxe held in his right hand although the mounted man was clad in armour the other four were dressed only in jerkins of coloured cloth and divided kilts of leather they were unshod and carried no sheaths for the weapons mainly swords with which they defended themselves it seemed to sojan that they were attempting to escape from the armoured warriors one of whom dressed more richly and darker than the other stood in the rear and urged them on in a language which was unfamiliar yet strangely familiar to sojans ears but there was no time to ponder over this now the men needed help and sojan in a more curious than chivalrous mood intended to aid them and perhaps find some answer to the mystery his long spear was out his shield up and he forced the myat into a wild gallop down the hill screaming to his gods in a barbarian warshout his savage thrust caught the first of the armoured warriors in the throat and stayed there the spear jerking like a tufted reed in a storm his sword screamed from its scabbard as he pushed deeper into the melee of cursing men taking this chance of escape while the enemy were still confused the other men quickly mounted their beasts sojan was still in the thick of it sword lashing everywhere and dealing death with every stroke one of the riders looked back saw the mer cenary still engaged and spurred his own beast back to where sojan fought grinning his thanks to sojan he covered the mer cenarys retreat with his own slim blade then followed howling the warriors attempted to pursue on foot were brought back by their leaders frantic cries and scrambled round the back of the building the armoured rider called to sojan in the familiar yet unintelligible tongue and pointed towards the east sojan understood and turned his myat in that direction behind them their pursuers were whip ping their steeds in an effort to overtake them deep into the forest they rode leaving their ene mies farbehind for perhaps three hours they de toured until they reached the end of the valley where a sheer cliff rose brushing aside some shrubbery the armoured man disclosed an opening in the base of the cliff ducking their heads the six rode through the last man replacing the camouflage the passage ended in several connecting caves and it was in one of these that they stabled their mounts and continued on foot to the cave at the far end here they slumped into chairs grinning with relief at their escape the leader the man in armour began to speak to sojan who stood bewilderedly trying to understand the language in which they questioned him vaguely he began to realise what it wasit was his own tongue yet so altered as to be scarcely recognisable in an hour he could understand most of their speech and in two he was telling them how he had come to the valley of norj but i am curious to find out who you areand why men hunt giant fourlegged birds at midnight he said who were the men from whom you escaped it is a long story to explain in a few words said jarg the leader but i will first attempt to tell you a little of the political situation here in norj there are two distinct races living heremen like ourselvesandanother race whom i scarcely like to define as men ages ago our people reached this valley after a long sea voyage and trek across shortani we came to this valley and settled in it and it was not for some time that we learned that another peo ple lived at the far end of the valley a race of grim blackhaired and blackeyed men who hunted at night with steeltipped flails and who remained in their castles during the day they did not trouble us at first and eventually we became used to the hunts even though they sometimes passed through our fields and destroyed our crops we were secure we thought in the valley and there was no man curious enough to venture too near the blackstoned castles of the cergii but soon men and womeneven childrenof our people began to disappear and the hunts be came more frequent for the cergii had found a new sporta different quarry to the devilbirds which they breed and release at night to hunt with their whips it was then that the mangled bodies of our tribesmen began to be foundlashed to death they were capturing our peopleand hunting them so it was that we declared war upon these beasts these whom we had never harmed nor at tempted to harm over the years traitors to our race went over to the enemy and became their warriorsyou saw some of them todayour once great race dwindledand became fugitives living in caves andif captured the quarry of the hunters of norj still we carry on warfare with thembut it is hit and run fighting at best the four you see here were captured recently and it was more by luck than anything that i man aged to bribe a guard to release them i came last night with weapons and myatsyou see that the breed had changed as has our speech unfortunately the timing was imperfect and the first sun arose before we could make good our escape we were seen and would all be dead or captured had it not been for you there must be some way to defeat them cried sojan and if there is a wayi swear that i will find it sojan and the fighting men of norj some sixty in all stood in the main cave waiting for nightfall plans of sojans attempt to overcome the cergii who hunted men with steeltipped flails had been discussed and sojan and jarg the leader had reached a decision the cergii were few it seemed about ten in num ber they were immortal or at least their lifespans were incredibly long and the race had gradually dwin dled to ten evil sorcererwarriors whose only plea sure was the midnight hunts at dusk sojan rose went over the final plan with his friends and left heading eastwards towards the castles of the cergiisome twenty in all mostly in an advanced state of decayonly one which housed the cergii and their norjian slaves and hirelings the tiny zylorian moons gave scant light and sojan found it difficult picking his way through the rubble of the ruined outbuildings there came a faint scuffling behind him a sound which only a barbarians senses could have heard sojan ignored it and carried on even when the scuffling came nearer he ignored it the sudden blow on the back of his head was impossible to ignore however and a blind sense of survival set him wheeling round hand groping for his sword hilt before blackness deeper than night swam in front of his eyes and he lost consciousness he awoke in a dampsmelling cell only lit by torchlight which filtered through a tiny grille in the wall the cell was obviously on a corner for the large barred door was not in the same wall as the grille peering through this door was an unkempt war rior clad in dirty armour and holding a spear he glared shortsightedly at the mercenary with halfmad eyes his mouth gaped pen showing bad teeth and he chuckled loudly youre the next game for the hunters of cergii he cackled oh what a feast the beasts will have tonight sojan ignored these words turned over and at tempted to ease the pain in his aching head after many hours in which he attempted to get some rest sojan was jabbed roughly awake by the guards spear butt what is it now he enquired as he raised him self to his feet and dusted off the straw in which hed been sleeping heh heh cackled the man its almost mid nighttime for one of our little hunts sojan became tense he had a plan based on the knowledge that if he was captured he would most certainly be forced to partake in one of the hunts of the cergiias the quarry very well he said trying to sound as fright ened as possible the courtyard was dark and gloomy one moon showing through a gap in the ruins the strange smell of an unknown animal came to sojans nostrils and he gathered that these were the hounds of the cergii that jarg had told him about he heard the stamping of the myats hooves and the jingle of harness and as his eyes became accus tomed to the darkness made out the vague outlines of tall mounted men is the quarry ready called out a voice as dead and cold as the ruins around them yes master he is here then tell him that he will be given quarter of an hours startthen we will be upon his scent the voice went on the guards stood aside and sojan was offalong a route already planned nights ago his plan was a daring one and one which called for a great deal of courage he was acting as a human snare for the hunters down a narrow forest trail he ran the trees and grasses rustling in the cold night breeze the sound of small animals calling to each other and the occa sional scream as a larger animal made its kill the air in his lungs seemed to force itself out as he ran faster and faster the time was getting short and he had several more minutes yet until he could reach the agreed spot soundsnot the sounds of the forest but more ominousbegan to reach his ears the sounds of cracking whips and thundering hooves as the hunt ers and their silent hounds rode in pursuit faster and faster he ran keeping his eyes open for the landmark which would afford him comparative safety at last it came into sight just as the cracking of whips and pounding hooves seemed to be on top of him past the tall rock he ran into a tiny gorge flanked on each side by towering rock walls up the side of the cliff he scrambled as the hunt ers entered the gorge then now roared sojan and as he did so sixty death tipped arrows flew down and buried themselves in the bodies of many of the cergii their curses and frantic screams were music to sojan and his friends as they fitted new arrows and let fly at the sounds sojan leapt down the rocks again a long sword in his right hand a shadowy rider loomed out of the darkness and an evil face white teeth flashing in a grin of triumph aimed a blow at sojan with his own blade sojan cut upwards catching the rider in the leg he screamed and tumbled off his steed putting it between himself and sojan he came upright limping rapidly in the merce narys direction sojan ducked another savage cut and parried it down lunged his opponents sword attempting to wound sojans swordarm he again parried the stroke and counterthrust towards the mans chest following up this move with a thrust to the heart the mercenary ended the evil hunters life most of the cergii were now either dead or mor tally wounded and it did not take sojan and his friends long to finish off the job they had started now for their hirelings yelled sojan goading his myat in the direction from which they had come his sword dripping red in the moonlight his hair tousled and a wildness in his eyes the sixty riders thundered down the narrow for est trail towards the castles of the dead cergii sojan at their head voicing a battlecry which had been shouted at a dozen great victories for the men whom sojan had led straight into the courtyard they swarmed catch ing the soldiers entirely unawares dismounting they crashed open the doors of the castle and poured in guard the doors yelled sojan and all other exitswell exterminate every traitor in the place his first call was in the dungeonsfor there he knew he would find the man who had been his jailer during the previous day the halfcrazed warrior cringed when he saw sojan enter sword in hand but one look at the tall merce nary told him that he could expect no mercy drooling with fear he yanked his own sword from its scabbard and swung a blow at sojan which would have cut him in two had it not been deflected by sojans blade coolly sojan fought while his opponent became more and more desperate slowly the warrior was forced back as sojans re lentless sword drove him nearer and nearer the wall his madness gave him immense stamina and grad ually he began to fight with more skill heh heh he cackled you will soon die man think not that you escaped death when you escaped the cergii sojan smiled a grim smile and said nothing suddenly the maddened warrior wrenched a spear from the wall and hurled it at sojan it plunked heavily into his left arm causing him to gasp with pain then his eyes hardened and the warrior read his fate in them youll die for that said sojan calmly almost immediately the warrior went down be fore a blurring network of steel and died with an inch of steel in his throat sojan returned to the main hall of the castle where his friends were finishing off the rest of the cergiis warriors well he laughed cheerfully i must be off jarg turned he saw the wound inflicted by the madmans spear you cant ride in that state sojan he cried oh it will heal sojan smiled it is only a super ficial cut but you have work to do restoring your farms now that the cergii are vanquished i should like to staybut this is an interesting continent with lots to see if i hurry i might be able to see it all before i die with that he strode from the room mounted his myat and cantered off up the steep track which led out of the valley of norj there goes a brave man murmured jarg as he watched him disappear over the hilltop jerry cornelius and co new worlds jerry cornelius new worlds began as a magazine founded by sf enthusiasts in the middle s a consortium pub lished the first few issues this consortium consisted of among others bill temple ted carnell leslie flood john wyndham frank arnold and steve fran ces later maclarens took it over though the com pany remained independent as nova publications ltd and published it for the best part of its career with ted carnell as editor ted published the first ballard stories and the work of thenstarting authors like brunner aldiss roberts etc in the circu lations of the magazines science fantasy was also edited by ted were very low and maclarens decided to fold the titles david warburton of roberts and vinter ltd heard they were folding and decided to buy them ted wanted to edit his new anthology series new writings in sf and so recommended me as editor warburton wanted two editors one for each of the magazines i chose new worlds and kyril bonfiglioli became editor of science fantasy my first issue in a paperbackstyle format but a magazine in all other respects appeared for may june we ran as a bimonthly for a short time and then went monthly with issue many people expected me to opt for the editorship of science fantasy since most of my work had pre viously appeared in that magazine but in fact i was interested in broadening the possibilities of the sf idiom and new worlds being a much more open title seemed the best place to do it my first editorial stated pretty much the policy i have followed ever since though perhaps im a little more sophisticated now also i was naive in thinking there were a lot of authors who shared the sense of frustration which ballard and i had felt for some years i tried to find good young authors and follow what one might call a policy of enlightened conservatismpublishing the best of the old and the best of the new there were a lot of outcries when we started dealing with explicit sex and so on also when the first ballard fragmented narratives began to appear with the atrocity exhibition also with the rather astringent criticism of golden age masters of sf etc but gradually readers began to realise that there was value in the new stuff and it didnt take long before they were criticising the newer stuff in its own terms we were crusading but we werent thinking in terms of tabubreaking and so on be cause the restrictions here had never been as marked as they were in the us we were seriously attempt ing to find new ways of dealing with new subject matter and we always placed substance before style people have since confused our revolution with a stylistic revolution but our principal aim was con cerned with substance and structureit had little to do with what judy merril and harlan ellison for instance later came to term the new wave in us sf we were specifically out to perpetuate if you like the european moral tradition in literature we hardly rejected the us pulp tradition because it had never much influenced us anyway some of the writers indeed were quite conservative in their tastes and stylesdisch for instance who became closely associated with the magazine while having no prejudice against it and admiring much of it we had little in common with the aims appar ently represented in the work of the newer or re generated us writers like ellison delany zelazny lafferty or silverberg we also of course published most of those writers at some stage and were pleased to do so because we always strove for a broad representation of the best work of its kind i feel we published some of the best work done by them zelaznys for a breath i tarry later reprinted i think in amazing and several others ellisons boy and his dog delanys time considered as a helix etc but our main raison detre became the publishing of what some would call experimental work and when in roberts and vinter suffered severe financial setbacks brian aldiss was responsible for suggesting to the arts council responsible for encouraging and maintaining the arts a governmentfinanced agency that they help us thanks largely to the enthusiasm of angus wil son then chairman of the council and letters from various distinguished critics and academics rallied by brian we received an award which while not enough to support us in any waysave as a little magazinegave us the moral support we needed and i became partpublisher putting my own money into the magazine and going to the large glossy format we then adopted unfortunately the two busi ness partners i had to begin with showed them selves overcautious and pulled out so that the magazine schedules were thrown into confusion dur ing we followed an erratic schedule culminat ing in the banning of two issues by the two major british distributors and the banning of the magazine in south africa new zealand australia etc all of these areas were fairly crucial to us and if it hadnt been for advertising we should have had to fold also the newspapers came out in our favour and the ban was technically lifted it was at this time that a question was asked in the house of commons about public money being spent on a pornographic mag azine and it seemed for a while that we would lose the grant this blew over and i became sole pub lisher of the magazine foolishly i didnt form a company to publish the magazine so that i became personally responsible for the debts from to published new worlds in it emerged that the distributors had been receiving large quantities of new worlds and had deliberately refrained from distributing them without telling us because they wanted to avoid any further newspaper publicity effectively we lost the income on six months issues and i suddenly found myself owing over ј which i didnt have this was at a time when thanks particularly to charles platt who was editing the magazine and running the business affairs new worlds had become viable i was forced to wind new worlds up publishing a last subscription only issue no in as an independent company tom dardis of berkley expressed an interest in doing new worlds as a quarterly and anthony cheetham was very enthusiastic about doing it through sphere in this country so i did four issues for berkley who then decided that sales didnt merit their continuing the series i decided though the sphere sales were on the increase to cut back to two issues a year for the time being since the sphere advance alone wasnt sufficient to cover what i wanted to do and were still partially financing the british editions through subsidiary income derived for instance from my editing fees for the best of new worlds series and so on and of course im still paying off the creditors for the large size issues the daily routine it varied depending on who was publishing the magazine or for that matter who was editing it since i didnt of course edit it for the whole time the early days were fairly quiet with just lang jones and myself doing the whole thing from an office i had in southwark later i began to work from home going into the publishers office about once a week and later still charles platt joined the staff as art editor and much improved the appearance of the paperback size issues that pe riod too was the only time i was actually getting paid to do it by and large i tend to set one or two days aside for reading lang jones is our best copy editor and he would tend to do that after id done the rough copyediting we never change stories without consultation with the author and the authors viewpoint is always respected where we have changes to suggest we tend to xerox the manuscript make the suggestions on the xerox and send them to the author for his or her comments if the author disagrees well discuss alternatives until were both satisfied this extends even to titles the office always ran on democratic lines with every editor being encouraged to encourage authors who suited his particular taste this meant of course that id sometimes publish stories i couldnt stand or that i would include stories others didnt like but we reached a fairly satisfactory compromise ill put this story in i think is brilliant because youre put ting in that story you think is brilliant i dont be lieve theres such a thing as objective literary judge ment for someone running a magazine and it seemed the best way of ensuring the representation of as many different kinds of writing as possible the special new writers issues we have done have largely been the work of people like jim sallis gra ham hall mike harrison graham charnock and charles platt through most of the magazines ca reer there was always something of a commune feel about the daytoday editing with authors and staff getting together to discuss specific stories or general policy the issues about which i am happi est i suppose are the first few of the large size issues where my own policies found their strong est expression to me these were the best issues say from to where we got a good balance between science and art features artwork good con ventional fiction and good experimental fiction particular issues came after that which i particularly liked but not as a run i enjoyed doing the special st issue labelled our special good taste issue and containing a distinctly victorian feel the last thing i can think of to say about the daytoday running of the magazine was that it filled the minds of a fairly large group of us for a long timeie social life for many of us was centred around the magazine it dominated our days a rather heady and hectic love affair in which the magazine could be seen from time to time as either an inspiring mistress or a vampiric femme fatale certainly the publishing problems dominated my days and nights for several years i think we accomplished a fair amount without doubt we altered the attitudes of many publishers towards the newer ideas we were promoting we encouraged many authors to do their best andor most interesting work many authors for instance claimed that without new worlds they would have given up writing or that they would have become cynical about their writing or that they wouldnt have put so much work into something aldiss ballard disch sladek roberts and others have all said at different times that new worlds encouraged them to do their best work we were responsible for interesting many critics academics and journalists in what might be called the sf renaissance i think we achieved an enormous amount if what we were trying to do has been misinterpreted in america this has largely been because most people received their impressions at secondhand through say the judith merril years best and england swings anthologies judy did a lot to publicise new worlds and was a good friend but her interpretations were often some what at odds with our views new worlds became a banner in judys own crusadeand judy after all started the ball rolling in the us if the issues be came clouded in rhetoric about new wave specula tive fiction or the new thing it wasnt much to do with us harlan ellison followed judy with dan gerous visions and i think its fair to claim that again if obliquely new worlds supplied the impetus i think however that battles are being fought in the states which have been over in this country for some years everyones settled down to doing their own thing there was never any danger of one idea superceding another but it was necessary to make room for other ideas and that if nothing else is what new worlds achieved and our influence if that isnt too pomp ous a phrase extended well beyond the sf world in this country if nowhere else we know many rock musicians whove claimed that new worlds gave them the impetus they were looking for for we know artists nonsf writers and poets who think the same a lot of our ideasand indeed our contributors turned up in the pages of the alternative press we still meet readers of the large size new worlds who tell us it was the only magazine which gave them any hope or spoke to them in a vocabulary which made sense to them and we have possibly influenced the vocabulary both in terms of ideas and language of sfbroadened its possibilities fail ures we claimed too much for what we were doing in the early days and are only now beginning to see the results we never licked the distribution problem until it was too lateand so never reached as many readers as we might have done we failed completely to convince the majority of fans that we felt writers like heinlein were shortchanging them with bad writing and simpleminded notions we failed to im prove the standard of writing in sf which in the main remains abominable on the other hand we offered an alternative to readers who couldnt face that kind of writing and of course we still do weve certainly failed to convince the majority of us publishers concerning the merits of typical new worlds fiction for they plainly prefer to publish the sensa tionalistic and poorlyconceived sf they have always publishedand their preference doesnt appear to be dictated by commercial reasoning weve failed perhaps to produce a large market for the kind of fiction we like best but we have produced a large enough one to make publishing that fiction a viable proposition and by and large weve failed to get across to most sf fans the seriousness of our intentions the pur pose of our intentions this again perhaps is be cause our particular point of view has been obscured by interpreters certainly new worlds policy has lit tle to do with what most us fans would identify as the sf new wave which i suppose almost brings us to jerry cor nelius jerry cornelius began as a version of elric of melnibone when in late i was casting around for a means of dealing with what i regarded as the hot subject matter of my own timestuff associ ated with scientific advance social change the my thology of the midtwentieth century since elric was a myth character i decided to try to write his first stories in twentiethcentury terms the final programme was written in first draft in about ten days in january it began as a kind of rewrite of the first two elric stories the dreaming city and while the gods laugh by doing this i found a style and a form which most suited what i wanted to write about i was elated i borrowed as much from the hammett school of thriller fiction as i borrowed from sf and i think i found my own voice as a writer influences included ronald firbank and to a minor extent william burroughs two not dissimilar figures in my estimation i felt at the time that i had at last found a way of marrying serious fiction with popular fiction and i had always believed that science fiction was the form which could most easily act as it were as the ideal environment in which this marriage could take place this incidentally was the idea which was behind much of the new worlds policy sf knew how to cope with much of the subject matter and was a vital and popular form but was largely unable to deal with the traditional and sophisticated moral questions found in the best fiction largely because its accepted forms had de nied any attempt authors might make to incorporate these questionsthe form as it stood distorted and simplified the problems just as ballard found his remedy in the form he used for atrocity exhibition and the later stories published from onwards i felt id found my remedy in the form i used in the final programmeby using a character who accepted the moral questions without discussing them the dialogue tends to take for granted the readers famil iarity with the questions and doesnt detail them doesnt spell them out and by supplying the reader with a straightforward dynamic narrative which he could enjoy for its own sake the plot while being unimportant was supplied for those who required a plot to keep them reading moreover i prefer in the main books with a straightforward plot too so i was trying to produce something id enjoy reading i was very pleased with the book and thought that everyone else would enjoy it too if only for its ironies and sensations a couple of british publish ers asked to see it and surprised me with their strong reactionsid written the book to shock they said and i wouldnt get anywhere like that it hadnt occurred to me that the book would do anything but amuse i despaired became cynical put the book aside a copy went out automatically to my then agents scott meredith in the book was bought enthusiastically by george erns berger then an editor at avon parts of it had been published in new worlds in and as an experiment in cutting up chunks and putting them in a different order by this time i had begun what was eventually published as a cure for cancer i had started the book using another characters name and hadnt got very far when i realised that this was effectively a sequel to the jerry cornelius novel i put what id written aside and thought about it all eventually conceiving the notion of writing a tetralogy of books about jerry each one expanding upon the various moral questions raised in the final programme i visited new york in and told george ernsberger about my scheme and george was again enthusiastic eventually in i had a contract from avon for the remaining three books by this time the final programme had been bought by allison and busby who were equally enthusiastic and had also bought behold the man in its novel version they too were pleased with the tetralogy idea and guaranteed to publish them in england it gave me the necessary encouragement to carry on with a cure for cancer which took in all some three years to write appear ing first as a serial in new worlds in the final programme was published at the time when jim sallis had come over to work on new worlds jim read the book and was very enthusiastic about it when lang jones was commissioned to edit the big hardback anthology for hutchinson the new sf he asked me for a story and i decided that i would try to write a jerry cornelius story this was the peking junctiondeveloping some of the techniques i was beginning to feel happy with while working on a cure for cancer jim sallis asked me then if i had any objection to his writing a jerry cornelius story since in his opinion the jc stories were a form in themselves i had none of course he wrote jeremiad which was published in new worlds taking up part of a theme id put into my second jc short the delhi division he expanded from there and wrote an en tirely different story taking up part of his theme i wrote it back into delhi division which hed so far only seen in rough draft the delhi division was the first jc short to appear in new worlds and was quickly followed by jeremiad once this had happened sev eral others who had enjoyed the final programme felt that theyd like to do a story about jerry so shortly afterwards there appeared stories by brian aldiss norman spinrad a poem by lang jones and other stories by m john harrison maxim jakubowski and one other by me the tank trapeze most of these were eventually published in a book called the na ture of the catastrophe in the meantime i had also begun a comic strip for it then the leading underground paper in britain with mal dean who had illustrated many of the jc stories the it strip sent up many of the current obsessions of the undergroundthe mysticism the political na ivete and so on we began to alternate with mike harrison and richard glyn jones taking up our themes and us taking up their themes turn by turn the strip ran for about a year in it as the adventures of jerry cornelius the english assassin part of the strip was also published in the nature of the catastrophe in our terms we found a cool way of dealing with hot material the essence of the stories is their irony their attempts to concentrate as much information as possible into as small a space as possible their ob session with contemporary imagery their strong re liance on metaphorical imagery drawn from many disparate sourcespop music astronomy physics cybernetics etc they are ideally deeply serious in intention unfortunately many critics have missed the serious points of the stories even if theyve found the stuff entertaining sexual ambiguity for instance is taken for granted in the jc storiesa fact of lifebut critics continue to see that element among others as daring in this country at any rate the stories receive their most intelligent responses from that section of the public most at ease with whats these days called the alternative society was ear lier called beat and before that called bohemian ie people who by and large do take certain things for granted which are regarded as shocking by the average middleclass person im not here suggest ing that this is good or bad but it is a fact judy merril for instance regarded the final programme as an evil book other people have expressed similar reactions i find them almost impossible to under stand perhaps people will get a better idea of the jc novels when the whole tetralogy is complete the english assassin will be out in england this year after three years in the writing i dont know when the last book the condition of muzak will appear probably in a couple of years maybe three or four ill just have to wait patiently until then at present while having reservations about the first two books im very satisfied with assassinits the first book of mine ive been able to proofread without wincing all the way through presumably holt reinhardt who did cure will be doing assassin in the states sometime next year i havent had any information either from avon or from holt as yet maybe final programme will get its points across better as a film the rights have been bought and the script written and its being produced by the company who did performance which has something in common with final programme i heard jagger turned down the jc part as being too freaky and i dont know if the film ever will be made but it would be interesting to see how the public reacted to it i think the jc stories have matured considerably since final programme becoming better written and more complexand it does disappoint me when people dont enjoy them or find them obscure i remember the delight i felt at producing a book which i was sure everyone would find at very least entertaining i was puzzled when some people reacted in a puzzled or even antagonis tic way my own wavelengths changed somewhere at some time these days for instance i cant un derstand sfi read the words and they no longer mean anything to me even when written by a writer i used to enjoy so i suppose i can appreciate how people feel when they find a jc story they cant focus on it isnt incidentally anything to do with radical alterations in lifestyle on my part it just happened at some point ho hum in lighter vein a note on the jerry cornelius tetralogy part of my original intention with the jerry corne lius stories was to liberate the narrative to leave it open to the readers interpretation as much as possibleto involve the reader in such a way as to bring his own imagination into play the impulse was probably a result of my interest in brechtan interest id had since the midfifties although the structure of the tetralogy is very strict the scope for interpretation is hopefully much wider than of a conventional novel the underlying logic is also very disciplined particularly in the last three volumes its my view that a work of fiction should contain nothing which does not in some way contribute to the overall scheme the whimsicalities to be found in all the books are in fact not random not mere conceits but make internal references that is to say while i strive for the effect of randomness on one level the effect is achieved by a tightly con trolled system of internal reference puns ironies logicjumps which no single reader may fairly be expected to follow thus in a scene in condition of muzak the end of the section called outcast of the islands there is a short discussion about the japanese invasion of aus tralia and jerry makes a reference to big egoes and hitler shakey mo then asks if he was a character in a childrens comic and then immediately asks if hit ler wasnt a police chief theyd met in berlin the first reference is to big ego a cartoon ostrich in the dandy or the beano the second reference is to an earlier story of mine called the pleasure garden of felippe sagittarius where hitler was a rather pathetic police chief in an imagi nary berlin leading to a reference to the fact that the historical adolf hitler doesnt exist in this world all this happens in a couple of sentences or so and should give the effect among others of time in a state of flux men in a state of introverted confusion close to fugue and so on but its internal logic is straightforward the two characters know exactly what they are talking about to explain all this to editorialise would be to break the mood break the dramatic tensions and ruin the effect i was trying to achieve the apparent obscurity should not confuse the reader because the narrative should be moving so rapidly that he shouldnt care if he doesnt under stand every reference similarly if he was watching a richly textured film he would not expect to per ceive consciously every detail of every scene dia logue music etc they are maintained primarily by a complicated series of prefiguring images which are developed as the book progresses the stone thing a tale of strange parts our of the dark places out of the howling mists out of the lands without sun out of ghonorea came tall catharz with the moody sword oakslayer in his right hand the cursed spear bloodlicker in his left hand the evil bow deathsinger on his back together with his quiver of fearful runefletched arrows heartseeker goregreedy soulsnatcher orphan maker eyeblinder sorrowsower beanslicer and sev eral others where his right eye should have been there was a jewel of slumbering scarlet whose colour sometimes shifted to smouldering blue and in the place of his left eye was a manyfaceted crystal which pulsed as if possessed of independent life where catharz had once had a right hand now a thing of iron wood and carved amethyst sat upon his stump nine fingered alien cut by catharz from the creature who had sliced off his own hand catharz left hand was at first merely gauntleted but when one looked further it could be observed that the gauntlet was in fact a many jointed limb of silver gold and lapis lazuli but as catharz rode by those who saw him pass remarked not on the murmuring sword in his right hand not on the whispering spear in his left hand not on the whining bow upon his back or the grumbling arrows in the quiver neither did they remark on his right eye of slumbering scarlet his left eye of pulsing crystal his ninefingered right hand his shining metallic left hand they saw only the fearful foot of cwlwwymwn which throbbed in the stirrup at his mounts right flank the foot of the aching god cwlwwymwn root ripper whose ambition upon the old and weary earth had been to make widows of all wives cwlw wymwn the striker whose awful feet had trampled whole cities when men had first made cities cwlw wymwn of the last ones last of the last ones who had been driven back to his island domain on the edge of the world beyond the western ice and who now came limping after catharz screaming out for vengeance demanding the return of his foot sliced from his leg by oakslayer so that catharz might walk again and continue upon his doomladen quest bearing weapons which were not his protec tion but his burden seeking consolation for the guilt which ate at his soul since it was he who had been responsible for the death of his younger brother forax the golden for the death of his niece libia gentleknee for the living death of his cousin wertigo the unbalanced seeking the whereabouts of his lost love cyphila the fair who had been stolen from him by his archenemy the wizard tomekoopr most powerful most evil most lustful of all the great sorcerers of this magicclouded world and there were no friends here to give aid to catharz godfoot he must go alone with shudder ing terror before him and groaning guilt behind him and cwlwwymwn screaming vengeful limping cwlwwymwn following always and catharz rode on rarely stopping scarcely ever dismounting anxious to claim his own ven geance on the sorcerer and the foot of cwlwwymwn last of the last ones was heavy on him as well it might be for it was at least eighteen inches longer than his left foot and naked for he had had to abandon his boot when he had found that it did not fit now cwlwwymwn possessed the boot it was how he had known that catharz was the mortal who had stolen his green seventeenclawed limb attach ing it by fearful sorcery to the flesh of his leg catharz left leg was not of flesh at all but of lacquered cork made for him by the people of the world beneath the reefs when he had aided them in their great fight against the gods of the lowest sea the sun had stained the sky a livid crimson and had sunk below the horizon before catharz would allow himself a brief rest and it was just before dark that he came in sight of a small stone cottage shel tered beneath terraces of glistening limestone where he hoped he might find food for he was very hungry knocking upon the door he called out greetings i come in friendship seeking hospital ity for i am called catharz the melancholy who carries the curse of cwlwwymwn rootripper upon him who has many enemies and no friends who slew his brother forax the golden and caused the death of libia gentleknee famous for her beauty and who seeks his lost love cyphila the fair pris oner of the wizard tomekoopr and who has a great and terrible doom upon him the door opened and a woman stood there her hair was the silver of a spiderweb in the moonlight her eyes were the deep gold found at the centre of a beehive her skin had the pale blushing beauty of the tearose welcome stranger said she wel come to all that is left of the home of lanoli whose father was once the mightiest in these parts and upon beholding her catharz forgot cyphila the fair forgot that cwlwwymwn rootripper limped after him still forgot that he had slain his brother his niece and betrayed his cousin wertigo the unbalanced you are very beautiful lanoli he said ah said she that is what i have learned but beauty such as mine can only thrive if it is seen and it has been so long since anyone came to these lands let me help your beauty thrive he said food was forgotten guilt was forgotten fear was forgotten as catharz divested himself of his sword his spear his bow and his arrows and walked slowly into the cottage his gait was a rolling one for he still bore the burden that was the foot of the last of the last ones and it took him some little time to pull it through the door but at length he stood inside and had closed the door behind him and had taken her in his arms and had pressed his lips to hers oh catharz she breathed catharz it was not long until they stood naked before one another her eyes travelled over his body and it was plain that the eyes of scarlet and crystal were lovely to her that she admired his silver hand and his ninefingered hand that even the great foot of cwlwwymwn was beautiful in her sight but then her eyes shy until now fell upon that which lay between his legs and those eyes widened a little and she blushed her lovely lips framed a question but he moved forward as swiftly as he could and embraced her again how she murmured how catharz it is a long tale and a bloody one he whispered of rivalry and revenge but suffice to say that it ended in my father xympwell the cruel taking a terrible vengeance upon me i fled from his court into the wastes of grxiwynn raving mad and it was there that the tribesmen of velox found me and took me to the wise man of oorps in the mountains beyond katatonia he nursed me and carved that for me it took him two years and all through those two years i remained raving living off dust and dew and roots as he lived the engravings had mystical sig nificance the runes contain the sum of his great wisdom the tiny pictures show all that there is to show of physical love is it not beautiful more beau tiful than that which it has replaced her glance was modest she nodded slowly it is indeed very beautiful she agreed and then she looked up at him and he saw that tears glistened in her eyes but did it have to be made of sandstone there is little else he explained sadly in the mountains beyond katatonia from the outcast of kitzoprenia volume in the history of the purple poignard
