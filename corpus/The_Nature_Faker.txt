 the nature faker by richard harding davis richard herrick was a young man with a gentle disposition much money and no sense of humor his object in life was to marry miss catherweight for three years she had tried to persuade him this could not be and finally in order to convince him married some one else when the woman he loves marries another man the rejected one is popularly supposed to take to drink or to foreign travel statistics show that instead he instantly falls in love with the best friend of the girl who refused him but as herrick truly loved miss catherweight he could not worship any other woman and so he became a lover of nature nature he assured his men friends does not disappoint you the more thought care affection you give to nature the more she gives you in return and while so he admitted in wooing nature there are no great moments there are no heartaches jackson one of the men friends and of a frivolous disposition said that he also could admire a landscape but he would rather look at the beautiful eyes of a girl he knew than at the lakes of killarney with a full moon a setting sun and the aurora borealis for a background herrick suggested that while the beautiful eyes might seek those of another man the lakes of killarney would always remain where you could find them herrick pursued his new love in connecticut on an abandoned farm which he converted into a model one on it he established model dairies and model incubators he laid out oldfashioned gardens sunken gardens italian gardens landscape gardens and a game preserve the game preserve was his own especial care and pleasure it consisted of two hundred acres of dense forest and hills and ridges of rock it was filled with mysterious caves deep chasms tiny gurgling streams nestling springs and wild laurel it was barricaded with fallen treetrunks and mosscovered rocks that had never felt the foot of man since that foot had worn a moccasin around the preserve was a high fence stout enough to keep poachers on the outside and to persuade the wild animals that inhabited it to linger on the inside these wild animals were squirrels rabbits and raccoons every day in sunshine or in rain entering through a private gate herrick would explore this holy of holies for such vermin as would destroy the gentler animals he carried a gun but it was turned only on those that preyed upon his favorites for hours he would climb through this wilderness or seated on a rock watch a bluebird building her nest or a squirrel laying in rations against the coming of the snow in time he grew to think he knew and understood the inhabitants of this wild place of which he was the overlord he looked upon them not as his tenants but as his guests and when they fled from him in terror to caves and hollow treetrunks he wished he might call them back and explain he was their friend that it was due to him they lived in peace he was glad they were happy he was glad it was through him that undisturbed they could live the simple life his fall came through ambition herrick himself attributed it to his too great devotion to nature and natures children jackson he of the frivolous mind attributed it to the fact that any man is sure to come to grief who turns from the worship of gods noblest handiwork by which jackson meant woman to worship chipmunks and plymouth rock hens one night jackson lured herrick into new york to a dinner and a music hall he invited also one kelly a mutual friend of a cynical and combative disposition jackson liked to hear him and herrick abuse each other and always introduced subjects he knew would cause each to lose his temper but on this night herrick needed no goading he was in an ungrateful mood accustomed to food fresh from the soil and the farmyard he sneered at hothouse asparagus hothouse grapes and coldstorage quail at the music hall he was even more difficult in front of him sat a stout lady who when she shook with laughter shed patchouli and a man who smoked american cigarettes at these and the steam heat the nostrils of herrick trained to the odor of balsam and the smoke of open wood fires took offense he refused to be amused the monologue artist in whom jackson found delight caused herrick only to groan the knockabout comedians he hoped would break their collarbones the lady who danced salome and who fascinated kelly herrick prayed would catch pneumonia and die of it and when the drop rose upon the countess zichys bears his dissatisfaction reached a climax there were three bears a large papa bear a mamma bear and the baby bear on the programme they were described as bruno clara and ikey they were of a dusty brown with long curling noses tipped with white and fat tancolored bellies when father bruno on his hind legs and bare feet waddled down the stage he resembled a hebrew gentleman in a brown bathing suit who had lost his waistline as he tripped doubtfully forward with mincing steps he continually and mournfully wagged his head he seemed to be saying this water is much too cold for me the mamma bear was dressed in a poke bonnet and white apron and resembled the wolf who frightened little red ridinghood and ikey the baby bear wore rakishly over one eye the pointed cap of a clown to those who knew their vaudeville this was indisputable evidence that ikey would furnish the comic relief nor did ikey disappoint them he was a wayward son when his parents were laboriously engaged in a boxingmatch or dancing to the merry widow waltz or balancing on stepladders ikey on all fours would scamper to the footlights and leaning over make a swift grab at the head of the first trombone and when the countess zichy apprised by the shouts of the audience of ikeys misconduct waved a toy whip ikey would gallop back to his pedestal and howl at her to every one except herrick and the first trombone this playfulness on the part of ikey furnished great delight the performances of the bears ended with bruno and clara dancing heavily to the refrain of the merry widow waltz while ikey pretended to conduct the music of the orchestra on the final call madame zichy threw to each of the animals a beer bottle filled with milk and the gusto with which the savagelooking beasts uncorked the bottles and drank from them greatly amused the audience ikey standing on his hind legs his head thrown back with both paws clasping the base of the bottle shoved the neck far down his throat and then hurling it from him and cocking his clowns hat over his eyes gave a masterful imitation of a very intoxicated bear that exclaimed herrick hotly is a degrading spectacle it degrades the bear and degrades me and you no it bores me said kelly if you understood nature retorted herrick and natures children it would infuriate you i dont go to a music hall to get infuriated said kelly trained dogs i dont mind exclaimed herrick dogs are not wild animals the things theyre trained to do are of use they can guard the house or herd sheep but a bear is a wild beast always will be a wild beast you cant train him to be of use its degrading to make him ride a bicycle i hate it if id known there were to be performing bears tonight i wouldnt have come and if id known you were to be here tonight i wouldnt have come said kelly where do we go to next they went next to a restaurant in a gayly decorated cellar into this young men like themselves and beautiful ladies were so anxious to hurl themselves that to restrain them a rope was swung across the entrance and page boys stood on guard when a young man became too anxious to spend his money the page boys pushed in his shirt front after they had fought their way to a table herrick ungraciously remarked he would prefer to sup in a subway station the people he pointed out would be more human the decorations were much of the same turkishbath school of art and the air was no worse cheer up clarence begged jackson youll soon be dead tomorrow youll be back among your treetoads and sunsets and let us hope he sighed no one will try to stop you what worries me is this explained herrick i cant help thinking that if one night of this artificial life is so hard upon me what must it be to those bears kelly exclaimed with exasperation confound the bears he cried if you must spoil my supper weeping over animals weep over carthorses they work those bears are loafers theyre as well fed as pet canaries theyre aristocrats but its not a free life protested herrick its not the life they love its a darned sight better declared kelly than sleeping in a damp wood eating raw blackberries the more you say retorted herrick the more you show you know nothing whatsoever of natures children and their habits and all you know of them returned kelly is that a cat has nine lives and a barking dog wont bite youre a nature faker herrick refused to be diverted it hurt me he said they were so big and goodnatured and helpless ill bet that woman beats them i kept thinking of them as they were in the woods tramping over the clean pine needles eating nuts and and honey and buns suggested jackson i cant forget them said herrick its going to haunt me tomorrow when im back in the woods ill think of those poor beasts capering in a hot theatre when they ought to be out in the open as god meant they well then protested kelly take em to the open and turn em loose and i hope they bite you at this herrick frowned so deeply that kelly feared he had gone too far inwardly he reproved himself for not remembering that his friend lacked a sense of humor but herrick undeceived him you are right he exclaimed tomorrow i will buy those bears take them to the farm and turn them loose no objections his friend could offer could divert him from his purpose when they urged that to spend so much money in such a manner was criminally wasteful he pointed out that he was sufficiently rich to indulge any extravagant fancy whether in polo ponies or bears when they warned him that if he did not look out the bears would catch him alone in the woods and eat him he retorted that the bears were now educated to a different diet when they said he should consider the peace of mind of his neighbors he assured them the fence around his game preserve would restrain an elephant besides protested kelly what you propose to do is not only impracticable but its cruelty to animals a domesticated animal cant return to a state of nature and live cant it jeered herrick did you ever read the call of the wild did you ever read retorted kelly what happened at the siege of ladysmith when the oats ran low and they drove the artillery horses out to grass they starved thats all and if you dont feed your bears on milk out of a bottle theyll starve too thats what will happen cried jackson those bears have forgotten what a pine forest smells like maybe its a pity but its the fact ill bet if you could ask them whether theyd rather sleep in a cave on your farm or be headliners in vaudeville theyd tell you they were devoted to their art why exclaimed kelly theyre so far from nature that if they didnt have that colored boy to comb and brush them twice a day theyd be ashamed to look each other in the eyes and another thing continued jackson trained animals love to show off theyre children those bears enjoy doing those tricks they enjoy the applause they enjoy dancing to the merry widow waltz and if you lock them up in your jungle theyll get so homesick that theyll give a performance twice a day to the squirrels and woodpeckers its just as hard to unlearn a thing as to learn it said kelly sententiously you cant make a man who has learned to wear shoes enjoy going around in his bare feet rot cried herrick look at me didnt i love new york i loved it so i never went to bed for fear id miss something but when i went back to the land did it take me long to fall in love with the forests and the green fields it took me a week i go to bed now the same day i get up and ive passed on my high hat and frock coat to a scarecrow and ill bet you when those bears once scent the wild woods theyll stampede for them like croker going to a third alarm and i repeat cried kelly you are a nature faker and ill leave it to the bears to prove it we have done our best sighed jackson we have tried to save him money and trouble and now all he can do for us in return is to give us seats for the opening performance what the bears cost herrick he never told but it was a very large sum as the countess zichy pointed out bears as bears in a state of nature are cheap if it were just a bear he wanted he himself could go to pike county pennsylvania and trap one what he was paying for she explained was the time she had spent in educating the bruno family and added to that the time during which she must now remain idle while she educated another family herrick knew for what he was paying it was the pleasure of rescuing unwilling slaves from bondage as to their expensive education if they returned to a state of ignorance as rapidly as did most college graduates he knew he would be satisfied two days later when her engagement at the music hall closed madame zichy reluctantly turned over her pets to their new manager with ikey she was especially loath to part ill never get one like him she walled ikey is the funniest fourlegged clown in america hes a naturalborn comedian folks think i learn him those tricks but its all his own stuff only last week we was playing paolis in bridgeport and when i was putting bruno through the hoops ikey runs to the stagebox and grabs a pound of caramels out of a girls lapand swallows the box and in st paul if the trombone hadnt worn a wig ikey would have scalped him say it was a scream when the audience see the trombone snatched baldheaded and him trying to get back his wig and ikey chewing it they went crazy you cant learn a bear tricks like that its just genius some folks think i taught him to act like he was intoxicated but he picked that up too all by himself through watching my husband and ikeys very fond of beer on his own account if i dont stop them the stage hands would be always slipping him drinks i hope you wont give him none i will not said herrick the bears ikey in one cage and bruno and clara in another travelled by express to the station nearest the herrick estate there they were transferred to a farm wagon and grumbling and growling and with ikey howling like an unspanked child they were conveyed to the game preserve at the only gate that entered it kelly and jackson and a specially invited house party of youths and maidens were gathered to receive them at a greater distance stood all of the servants and farm hands and as the wagon backed against the gate with the door of ikeys cage opening against it the entire audience with one accord moved solidly to the rear herrick with a pleased but somewhat nervous smile mounted the wagon but before he could unlock the cage kelly demanded to be heard he insisted that following the custom of all great artists the bears should give a farewell performance he begged that bruno and clara might be permitted to dance together he pointed out that this would be the last time they could listen to the strains of the merry widow waltz he called upon everybody present to whistle it the suggestion of an openair performance was received coldly at the moment no one seemed able to pucker his lips into a whistle and some even explained that with that famous waltz they were unfamiliar one girl attained an instant popularity by pointing out that the bears could waltz just as well on one side of the fence as the other kelly cheated of his free performance then begged that before herrick condemned the bears to starve on acorns he should give them a farewell drink and herrick who was slightly rattled replied excitedly that he had not ransomed the animals only to degrade them the argument was interrupted by the french chef falling out of a tree he had climbed it he explained in order to obtain a better view when in turn it was explained to him that a bear also could climb a tree he remembered he had left his oven door open his departure reminded other servants of duties they had neglected and one of the guests also on remembering he had put in a longdistance call hastened to the house jackson suggested that perhaps they had better all return with him as the presence of so many people might frighten the bears at the moment he spoke ikey emitted a hideous howl whether of joy or rage no one knew and few remained to find out it was not until herrick had investigated and reported that ikey was still behind the bars that the house party cautiously returned the house party then filed a vigorous protest its members with jackson as spokesman complained that herrick was relying entirely too much on his supposition that the bears would be anxious to enter the forest jackson pointed out that should they not care to do so there was nothing to prevent them from doubling back under the wagon in which case the house party and all of the united states lay before them it was not until a lawntennis net and much chicken wire was stretched in intricate thicknesses across the lower half of the gate that herrick was allowed to proceed unassisted he slid back the cage door and without a moments hesitation ikey leaped from the wagon through the gate and into the preserve for an instant dazed by the sudden sunlight he remained motionless and then after sniffing delightedly at the air stuck his nose deep into the autumn leaves turning on his back he luxuriously and joyfully kicked his legs and rolled from side to side herrick gave a shout of joy and triumph what did i tell you he called see how he loves it see how happy he is not at all protested kelly he thought you gave him the sign to roll over tell him to play dead and hell do that tell all the bears to play dead begged jackson until im back in the billiardroom flushed with happiness herrick tossed ikeys cage out of the wagon and opened the door of the one that held bruno and clara on their part there was a moment of doubt as though suspecting a trap they moved to the edge of the cage and gazed critically at the screen of trees and tangled vines that rose before them they think its a new backdrop explained kelly but the delight with which ikey was enjoying his bath in the autumn leaves was not lost upon his parents slowly and clumsily they dropped to the ground as though they expected to be recalled each turned to look at the group of people who had now run to peer through the wire meshes of the fence but as no one spoke and no one signalled the three bears in single file started toward the edge of the forest they had of cleared space to cover only a little distance and at each step as though fearful they would be stopped and punished one or the other turned his head but no one halted them with quickening footsteps the bears now almost at a gallop plunged forward the next instant they were lost to sight and only the crackling of the underbrush told that they had come into their own herrick dropped to the ground and locked himself inside the preserve im going after them he called to see what theyll do there was a frantic chorus of entreaties dont be an ass begged jackson theyll eat you herrick waved his hand reassuringly they wont even see me he explained i can find my way about this place better than they can and ill keep to windward of them and watch them go to the house he commanded ill be with you in an hour and report it was with real relief that on assembling for dinner the house party found herrick in high spirits with the usual number of limbs and awaiting them the experiment had proved a great success he told how unheeded by the bears he had without difficulty followed in their tracks for an hour he had watched them no happy schoolchildren let loose at recess could have embraced their freedom with more obvious delight they drank from the running streams for honey they explored the hollow treetrunks they sharpened their claws on mossgrown rocks and among the fallen oak leaves scratched violently for acorns so satisfied was herrick with what he had seen with the success of his experiment and so genuine and unselfish was he in the thought of the happiness he had brought to the beasts of the forests that for him no dinner ever passed more pleasantly miss waring who sat next to her host thought she had seldom met a man with so kind and simple a nature she rather resented the fact and she was inwardly indignant that so much right feeling and affection could be wasted on farmyard fowls and fourfooted animals she felt sure that some nice girl seated at the other end of the table smiling through the light of the wax candles upon herrick would soon make him forget his love of nature and natures children she even saw herself there and this may have made her exhibit more interest in herricks experiment than she really felt in any event herrick found her most sympathetic and when dinner was over carried her off to a corner of the terrace it was a warm night in early october and the great woods of the game preserve that stretched below them were lit with a full moon on his way to the lake for a moonlight row with one of the house party who belonged to that sex that does not row but looks well in the moonlight kelly halted and jeered mockingly how can you sit there he demanded while those poor beasts are freezing in a cave with not even a silk coverlet or a pillowsham you and your valet ought to be down there now carrying them pajamas kelly declared herrick unruffled in his moment of triumph i hate to say i told you so but you force me go away he commanded you have neither imagination nor soul and thats true he assured miss waring as kelly and his companion left them now i see nothing in what i accomplished that is ridiculous had you watched those bears as i did you would have felt that sympathy that exists between all who love the outofdoor life a dog loves to see his master pick up his stick and his hat to take him for a walk and the man enjoys seeing the dog leaping and quartering the fields before him they are both the happier at least i am happier tonight knowing those bears are at peace and at home than i would be if i thought of them being whipped through their tricks in a dirty theatre herrick pointed to the great forest trees of the preserve their tops showing dimly in the mist of moonlight somewhere down in that valley he murmured are three happy animals they are no longer slaves and puppets they are their own masters for the rest of their lives they can sleep on pine needles and dine on nuts and honey no one shall molest them no one shall force them through degrading tricks hereafter they can choose their life and their own home among the rocks and the herricks words were frozen on his tongue from the other end of the terrace came a scream so fierce so long so full of human suffering that at the sound the blood of all that heard it turned to water it was so appalling that for an instant no one moved and then from every part of the house along the garden walks from the servants quarters came the sound of pounding feet herrick with miss waring clutching at his sleeve raced toward the other end of the terrace they had not far to go directly in front of them they saw what had dragged from the very soul of the woman the scream of terror the drawingroom opened upon the terrace and seated at the piano jackson had been playing for those in the room to dance the windows to the terrace were open the terrace itself was flooded with moonlight seeking the fresh air one of the dancers stepped from the drawingroom to the flags outside she had then raised the cry of terror and fallen in a faint what she had seen herrick a moment later also saw on the terrace in the moonlight bruno and clara on their hind legs were solemnly waltzing neither the scream nor the cessation of the music disturbed them contentedly proudly they continued to revolve in hops and leaps from their happy expression it was evident they not only were enjoying themselves but that they felt they were greatly affording immeasurable delight to others sick at heart furious bitterly hurt with roars of mocking laughter in his ears herrick ran toward the stables for help at the farther end of the terrace the butler had placed a tray of liqueurs whiskeys and soda bottles his back had been turned for only a few moments but the time had sufficed lolling with his legs out stretched in a wicker chair herrick beheld the form of ikey between his uplifted paws he held aloof the base of a decanter between his teeth and well jammed down his throat was the long neck of the bottle from it issued the sound of gentle gurgling herrick seized the decanter and hurled it crashing upon the terrace with difficulty ikey rose swaying and shaking his head reproachfully he gave herrick a perfectly accurate imitation of an intoxicated bear
