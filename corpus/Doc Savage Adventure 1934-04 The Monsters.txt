 chapter the pinheads on the fifteenth of the month bruno hen did the thing which was actually his first step toward disaster a disaster that was to affect not only himself but many others as well bruno hen sold his furs on this date most of the pelts were muskrats cunningly stolen from the trap lines of bruno hens neighbors the chief loser being big honest slowwitted carl macbride the thefts were slyly executed for bruno hen was as foxy a halfbreed as the north michigan woods held oxlike carl macbride never suspected not that carl macbride liked bruno hen one day big macbride had come upon bruno hen killing a chicken for dinner the breed had been choking the chicken to death and taking great glee in prolonging the fowls death agonies after that carl macbride held a suspicion that no more cruel a breed than bruno hen ranged north michigan the fur market was strong the day bruno hen sold his pelts brought more than he had expected so he decided to celebrate this decision was his second step toward disaster the atlas congress of wonders was showing at trapper lake that day the atlas did not amount to much as a circus being financially very much down at the heel but it was the best trapper lake offered so by way of celebrating bruno hen went to the circus that was his third step in the direction of disaster the fourth pace taken all unknowingly was when he stopped in front of the freak side show ladies and gentlemen bawled the side show barker we have here a stupendous marvelous awesome dumbfounding sight we have here the three most amazing beings ever to come from darkest africa look them over good people try to make yourselves realize that these monstrosities are actually human they are called the pinhead men they are cannibal savages from darkest africa the atlas congress of wonders was not above faking an occasional wild man or a cannibal but it chanced that these pinheads were the genuine articles they had been brought from africa by a more affluent circus which had then gone bankrupt bruno hen moved close to the platform to stare at the three pinheads he had never seen such hideous humans the pinheads were squat the tallest reaching barely to bruno hens topmost vest button they were nearly as broad as tall and they were as black as human skin could practically be they might have been oversize monkeys shaven bare of hair dyed black and given a high polish the contour of their heads was especially haunting instead of being rounded in the fashion considered normal the skulls sloped upward to a sharp point the pinpointed heads were also very small in proportion to the rest of their gnarled black bodies the pinheads had a trait of casting darting animallike looks about them at times they jumped up and down after the fashion of chimpanzees they emitted caterwauling noises apparently their way of conversing with each other trapper lake citizens looking on probably thought this behavior was part of the circus act they were mistaken the poor pinheads were beings almost devoid of mentality bruno hen looked at the pinheads and grinned from ear to ear the idea of human beings so handicapped by nature tickled him he laughed out loud that laugh was his fifth step toward disaster the pinheads stared at bruno hen their attention drawn by the laugh bruno hens smile was derisive but the pinheads did not have the intelligence to realize that they thought the grin friendly they smiled back jumped up and down and beat their chests with nubbins of fists back in the african bush that was the way one showed hearttoheart friendship bruno hen thundered another laugh it was the same kind of a laugh carl macbride had heard when he had come upon the breed slowly throttling a chicken to satisfy a lust for cruelty the utter cruelty of that loud laugh caused the barker to end his spiel abruptly and stare at bruno hen the barker ran his eyes up and down the breeds person in bruno hen he saw a bulky lout constructed on the lines of a brown bologna bruno hens clothing was frayed greasy it never had fitted properly he wore high deerskin moccasins obviously made by himself he wore a dazzling green hat and a blindingyellow necktie both new the barker was a pleasantnatured soul he did not like bruno hens laugh it sent wintry chills along his spine he decided to bullyrag bruno hen to persuade him to move on the barker sprang to one of the three pinheads and made an elaborate pretense of listening to the unintelligible cackle the fellow was making crowd right up folks he yelled an amazing thing has happened these pinhead cannibals from darkest africa claim they have just recognized a member of their tribe who was lost years ago the barker leveled an arm at bruno hen the pinheads claim this man as their brother tribesman the crowd roared its laughter the pinheads hopped about clucked and gobbled they were just happy but it looked as if they were agreeing with the barker actually they couldnt understand a word he said bruno hen glowered his fists made big knobs at his side a grinning pinhead leveled an arm at the breed and spouted gibberish the barker yelled the gentleman from africa declares that any one can tell this man is his brother by looking at that green hat and yellow necktie at this point to the barkers relief bruno hen stamped off he yanked his green hat over his eyes and loosened his yellow necktie as if it were too tight bruno hens swarthy neck was purple and he was muttering under his breath it was a tribute to his stupidity that he thought the pinheads had said what the barker declared they had accordingly he was very angry with the pinheads farther down the midway was the strongman show a fellow with remarkable muscles stood on the platform we have one of the strongest men in the world the barker was claiming raucously only ten cents a dime a tenth part of a dollar to see him perform i might even say this man is the strongest in the world the only other man who might be his equal is doc savage but unfortunately this herculean gentleman and doc savage have never matched strength we do not know who is actually the stronger bruno hen scowled blackly you may never see doc savage folks yelled the barker so step in and see one of the strongest men in the world bruno hen tried to remember who doc savage was he seemed to have heard the name before soon the breed came to a show featuring a mental marvel a fellow who claimed to be able to answer any question asked of him without consulting a reference book the mental marvel was supposed to know all things or so the barker was saying the only living man who may possibly be a greater mental marvel than this individual is doc savage extolled the barker bruno hen scratched his head trying to remember doc savage you may never meet my good people the barker howled so pay a dime and see the mental marvel who is almost his equal abruptly bruno hen remembered who doc savage was he was an almost legendary figure a man of mystery who was reputed to be a superman in strength and mental ability doc savage resided in new york he traveled to the ends of the earth punishing wrongdoers and helping others out of trouble in trapper lake stores bruno hen had heard traveling salesmen tell of doc savages fabulous feats little dreaming that doc savage to whom amazing feats were commonplace events was to play an important part in the future of trapper lake bruno hen walked on he did not give a hoot about the future of trapper lake anyway wandering over the circus grounds bruno hen soon found himself back among the tents and wagons which the performers used for living quarters he came to a stop his porcine eyes glittered he put a wide fatuous grin on his face coming toward him was a young woman with the most striking hair bruno hen could recall having seen hair the exact shade of steel the young woman had it drawn like a tight steel skullcap with steellike knobs over her ears she wore boots laced breeches and a brilliant red jacket the garments set off a shapely figure to great advantage a shiny metal revolver was belted about her waist bruno hen was nothing if not bold he prepared to accost the young woman the girl evidently knew the ways of such louts she veered off and avoided him not daunted bruno hen followed her he stopped however when he saw the young woman pick up a chair and calmly climb into a cage with several ferociouslooking maned beasts these greeted her with ugly roars the steelhaired girl was a lion tamer standing back marveling that the lions did not devour her instantly bruno hen watched the cage as it was hauled into the big top inside the big top the ringmaster was bellowing and now we are going to present that extravagant unparalleled exhibition of human nerve he paused to get the proper drama jean morris and her troop of bloodthirsty untamed lions bruno hen loitered about in hopes of getting another glimpse of the young woman with the amazing steel hair but she did not appear he concluded she must have left by another exit he got to thinking of the pinheads again and his rage arose he stalked off the circus grounds bought some groceries in trapper lake and betook himself home bruno hen had no idea that he had laid almost the full foundation for future disaster bruno hens cabin was located not far from the shore of lake superior the structure was a patchwork of logs cheap slab lumber and tar paper it had one room an open fireplace served for both warmth and cooking there was a window and plenty of cracks for ventilation except for big slowwitted carl macbride who lived half a mile down the lake shore there were no near neighbors there was no telephone and bruno hen took no newspaper hence when the atlas congress of wonders went bankrupt in trapper lake after counting the proceeds of its last performance bruno hen did not learn of the fact immediately the day following his experience at the circus he expertly robbed a gill net set by carl macbride he took only such fish as he wished to eat but instead of leaving the others in the net he removed them and tossed them aside he was not doing the fish a kindness for he knocked each finny specimen in the head before discarding it there was a peculiar twist to bruno hens brain which made him delight in cruelty the pretty circus lion tamer haunted his thoughts somewhat memory of her steelhued hair especially stuck with him the next few days bruno spent in overhauling his canoe replacing a staved rib or two and applying a coat of varnish the fishing season was near with the coming of summer he usually traveled south to a district more inhabited where he offered his services as a guide it was a week to the day after his visit to the circus when bruno hen took his next step toward disaster he was getting a late supper when he heard a noise he was frying fish over the sputter of grease he thought he heard a low moan with a quick gesture he put out the light being of an evil nature himself bruno always expected the worst from others his eyes became accustomed to the murk although there was no moon the sky was cloudless and the stars furnished fitful luminance the breed eyed the window the pane needed washing but he could discern an object outside his hair all but stood on end one frenzied leap took bruno hen across the cabin to his rifle he snatched it down then dashed outside the thing at the window had been a hideous apparition yet vaguely familiar a cold dew stood on the breeds skin as he squinted into the night hell he swore the odious specter at the window had been one of the pinhead cannibals all three of the grotesque little black fellows huddled near the window they trembled after the manner of frightened animals bruno hen seeing that they were very scared of him felt more bold what dyou want he demanded the answer was a hooting clucking conglomeration of sounds bruno hen could understand no word of it he could not tell that the unfortunate pinheads stranded when the circus went broke were slowly starving unable to speak english and lacking the intelligence to convey their needs by making signs the pinheads were in a predicament bruno hen scowled at them thinking of the mortification they had caused him at the circus get outa here he snarled the pinheads only waved their arms more vehemently and cackled louder they were desperate for food one kneeled seeking to grasp bruno hens knees in supplication bruno hen kicked the pinhead sending the unfortunate fellow sprawling away apparently pleased by the sound of his foot on human flesh the breed launched another kick he struck with his rifle barrel with his fists the pinheads weakened by lack of food could evade only a few of the blows mauled and bleeding they finally managed to drag themselves away ill do worse next time you show up bruno hen bawled after them the pinheads disappeared in the timber to the southward the breed stood in the starlight until he could no longer hear sounds of their footsteps then chuckling he entered his cabin it was possibly ten minutes later that he heard faint but terrible human screams these came from the direction the pinheads had taken they lasted only a moment and ended with unpleasant abruptness probably two of em eatin the third one bruno hen snorted the breed did not know but he had just taken his final step toward disaster chapter terror months passed bruno hen went southward during the fishing season pickings as a guide much to his disgust proved slender only two short engagements did he obtain in some ten weeks finally there was a third job this one promised to pay well bruno hen however made the mistake of trying to lift a fat wallet which his temporary employer carried in a hip pocket upon being discovered he narrowly missed getting shot to evade jail he was forced to flee back to the timber fastnesses out of which he had come if stolid carl macbride was surprised at bruno hens premature return he said nothing about it macbrides fish traps had yielded a more abundant catch during the past weeks but he had failed to attach the true significance to this if carl macbride was not surprised at bruno hens early return he was surprised when the breed paid him a visit a few nights later something was wrong macbride could see that as be admitted the breed to his cabin bruno hens eyes rolled he perspired freely although the night was cool there was a noticeable bulge in one of his coat pockets did you hear anything a few minutes ago the breed asked bluntly carl macbride shook his head he never used a word where a gesture would do he had heard only the usual night sounds insects and nocturnal birds bruno hens next question was more surprising what happens when a man goes crazy macbride did not laugh search me he has funny ideas i guess he sees things huh i reckon the visitor wiped his forehead with his palm then swabbed the palm on his corduroy pants abruptly he thrust a hand in his bulging coat pocket he brought out an enormous roll of greenbacks youre the only honest man i know macbride he said want you to do me a favor carl macbride was a great mountain of a man reddened by many winds and with eyes as blue as lake superior itself he eyed the money placidly sure ill do you a favor he rumbled but i aint takin pay for it bruno hen placed the money on a table take it he directed if anything happens to me use this kale to hire the best detective in the world carl macbride batted his lakeblue eyes i want the detective to investigate whatever happens to me bruno hen went on i want the best damn detective there is anywhere plenty of money here to pay his bill macbride eyed the currency there were many thousands of dollars in the bank roil he knew it must be bruno hens life savings whats got into you macbride rumbled this whole talk dont make sense bruno hen swallowed uneasily squirming a flush darkened his swarthy skin he seemed on the point of answering maybe it dont amount to nothin after all he mumbled but if somethin happens to me hire the detective ill do that macbride agreed bruno hen took his departure ignoring the slow questions which carl macbride asked the breed carried a flashlight and kept this blazing steadily as he made his way through the timber he washed the beam about continuously seeming to be in deathly fear of some habitant of the darkness from the door of his cabin big carl macbride watched the retreating breed he shook his ponderous head slowly somethin is sure wrong with that guy he grunted he fingered the roll of money thoughtfully bruno hen kinda acts like hed seen the devil with that last statement carl macbride came far nearer the truth than he dreamed having reached his shack bruno hen locked himself in he tore up parts of the floor and spiked the rough plank across the windows loading his rifle he placed it on the table alongside a fresh box of cartridges he charged both barrels of his shotgun and arranged a little mound of shells loading his revolver he belted it on he did not sleep at all that night he scarcely sat down around and around the hut he paced nervously stopping frequently to peer outside through the cracks there was a brilliant moon in the surrounding timber there were no stirrlngs except for the undulating of tree boughs before a gentle breeze out of the far distance came sometimes the squawling uproar of fighting lynxes a lonely wolf howled mournfully the odor of pine came with the breeze this peace of the woodland night seemed to soothe bruno hen not at all strangely the breed did not leave his cabin at all the following day literally hundreds of times he peered outside as if in deadly expectation it was apparent that he had seen something probably on the night before he visited carl macbride which had frightened him the more he thought of what he had seen the more terrified he seemed to become toward noon he slept a little he did not sleep that night the following day carl macbride came over wondered how you was comin macbride said bruno hen peered out at his neighbor through his barred window he did not invite macbride in in fact he said nothing macbride big and slow moving ambled around the shack he noted that the place had been turned into a fortress afraid of somebody he asked the breed scowled you git tend to your own business not taken back macbride grinned pleasantly ive got your money if you want it back keep that money if somethin happens to me you hire the best detective in the world like i told you i been readin in a magazine about a feller that makes a business of helpin other people out of trouble macbride offered maybe hed do whats his name doc savage bruno hen recalled the flattering references which he had heard the circus side show barkers make to doc savage a muscular hercules and a mental marvel they had termed doc savage hell do growled the breed k said macbride but listen bruno whats ailin you nothin snarled the breed you go way you must be nuts opined carl macbride and took his departure by way of paying the goodnatured giant back for that last crack bruno hen left his cabin during the afternoon and raided one of macbrides fish traps he selected several choice walleyes and turned the rest of the catch loose the breed was thoughtful as he slunk back toward his cabin i ought to have told macbride about what i seen prowlin around here the other night he said slowly hell he would think i was crazy reaching his shack he fastened himself in securely exercise seemed to have lulled his fears somewhat he lay down and slept the night was well along when bruno hen opened his eyes he lay in a sort of drawn rigidity listening to what had aroused him it was a strange wind which seemed to be blowing outside this came in puffs regularly spaced the breed shivered from head to foot the gusty sounds were too peculiar to be made by a natural wind using extreme care to make no noise bruno got up he gripped his rifle in one hand his shotgun in the other he crept to one of the timbered windows and crammed an eye to the crack what he saw caused him to shriek out in awful horror jumping back he lifted his rifle it was highpowered intended for bagging moose he fired the slug slapped through the planks as if they had been paper again the breed fired he pumped jacketed lead through the wall until the magazine was empty plugging in fresh cartridges he continued his wild firing its worsen it was before he moaned referring to the horror outside over the whacking of the rifle and the breeds moaning there sounded a tremendous rending and tearing the breed stared upward in ghastly terror parts of the roof of his shack were being torn off stout boards split apart or snapped off rafters buckled under some cataclysmic force still firing madly bruno retreated to the other side of the cabin with a final squawling of withdrawn nails and a cracking of wood a section of the roof came off something extended through the aperture the breed emitted one squawling shriek after another he dashed from end to end of the cabin he was like a trapped rabbit the breeds neighbor carl macbride unlike many big men was a light sleeper he heard the yelling and shooting coming from bruno hens cabin leaping up he yanked on his pacs grasped a rifle and ran for the uproar long before he reached the breeds cabin macbride heard bruno hens shrieking die its termination was a piercing bleating sound remindful of a mouse which had been stepped upon arriving at the shack macbride found an amazing sight the structure itself was little more than a great shapeless wad of timber and planks striking matches for light he circled the spot his gaze lighted upon a timber as thick as his leg and he whistled softly in amazement for something snapped off that timber as if it were a match stick macbride stood still straining his ears there was an occasional creak from the settling ruin of the cabin from out on the lake he thought he heard faint splashing this was very distant no other sound came the bedlam at the cabin had been so awesome that the night birds animals and insects had been frightened into complete silence macbride now dug into the cabin wreckage he found a gory wad of a thing he had to examine it for some seconds before he would believe it was the earthly remains of bruno hen bruno hen had been crushed to death in ghastly fashion carl macbride made a slow circle of the cabin and the vicinity searching then he headed for his own cabin running this is a job for that doc savage he muttered chapter plane acquaintance modern passenger planes are remarkably efficient creations not only are they capable of great speed but the cabins are soundproofed until it is possible to conduct a conversation in ordinary tones pretty hostesses serve coffee and sandwiches big carl macbride occupied a seat in one of these passenger ships as it rushed toward new york he tried to look nonchalant he balanced a cup of coffee clumsily on one calloused palm and held a tiny sandwich between thumb and forefinger of his other hand between nibbles and sips he eyed the surrounding clouds this was his first time in the air from impressions gained in a life spent on the ground he had supposed clouds were fairly solid things but he was discovering they were really of a very wispy nature with hardly more body than widely diffused cigarette smoke a fellow traveler interrupted the bulky woodsmans thoughts i see you like to read back issues of magazines the fellow remarked cart macbride turned his head he saw a tall man with a freckled nose reddish hair and a reddish mustache the latter was an artistically waxed creation the man was attired in a quiet business suit and looked prosperous the fellow had been perusing a newspaper this was folded carelessly and an advertisement was uppermost it was a strange sort of an ad it consisted simply of large black type in the center of a white space beware the monsters are coming this somewhat unusual advertisement was not in line with carl macbrides gaze however he failed to see it the big woodsman had always associated freckles with friendly individuals he smiled and said sure if the magazine aint too old i enjoy it just as much as a late one i notice you were reading about doc savage said the freckled man yep my name is caldwell the fellow traveler introduced himself quite an interesting chap this doc savage do you know him carl macbride asked eagerly oh no although id rather like to ive read of his accomplishments i guess almost every one has heard of him yep hes quite a detective i reckon detective laughed caldwell doc savage is not a detective carl macbrides jaw fell he was shocked the article in the magazine was all he knew of doc savage he had judged doc savage to be a detective for the story was one telling how doc and a group of five assistants had ferreted out a gang of villains seeking to seize the nitrate industry of the south american country of chile believing doc savage to be a detective macbride was now on his way to ask him to investigate the death of bruno hen not a detective he gulped not exactly smiled caldwell he is more in the nature of what you would call a troublebuster he goes to the far corners of the earth metes out justice to evildoers and helps those in trouble carl macbride breathed a little bit easier doc savage might be interested in bruno hens death after all what do you know about doc savage macbride asked this magazine story didnt tell very much no one seems to know a great deal about doc savage replied caldwell it is general knowledge however that he is a man who has been trained from the cradle for his present purpose in life the training was done scientifically by his father who is now dead as a result doc savage is almost a superman both in physical capabilities and in mentality how do you mean physical capabilities and mentality carl macbride asked vaguely befuddled by the to him highsounding phraseology they say that doc savage has developed his muscles until he is the strongest man ever to live caidweil explained he has also studied intensively in every branch of science he has become a mental marvel in other words he knows about everything the plane dipped sharply caldwell looked over the side were nearing new york city carl macbride showed little interest in new york city although he had never seen that impressive metropolis before what else do you know about doc savage he asked eagerly well not much more caldwell rejoined amiably doc savage has five men who help him each one of these is a worldfamous expert in some line one according to what ive heard is a chemist another a lawyer and a third is an electrical expert of ability of the other two one is an engineer and the other a geologist sounds like some crew ejaculated the big woodsman caidwell eyed carl macbride you seem rather interested in doc savage i am macbride grinned im on my way to see him caldwell looked properly impressed at this his brows rising in astonishment imagine be ejaculated say that is the most interesting thing ive beard in a long time carl macbride expanded before the flattering tones he wanted to talk about the strange demise of bruno hen anyway he proceeded to do so he told the story in detail drawing a newspaper from his pocket he exhibited it i cut that from the trapper lake ciarion as you can see by the name at the top of the sheet he explained caidwell read the clipping it says here that a peculiar tornado dipped down and demolished bruno hens cabin killing the breed he remarked that newspaper feller done some tall guessin macbride said confidentially my cabin aint very far away from the breeds place there werent no daggone tornado id have heard it anyway the sky was as clear as crystal caldwell returned the clipping and you are going to new york to get doc savage to investigate thats right bruno hen gave me the money to do it its only fair that i should live up to the promise i made him quite true caldwell agreed then broke off to watch a young woman who came down the aisle from the washroom carl macbride also eyed the girl she was a striking vision she had hair the exact hue of steel her traveling costume while neat was somewhat worn macbrides contact with pretty girls had been largely from their pictured faces in magazines this young woman was as entrancing as any photo he could recall having seen the girl passed the two men without a glance her eyes were a steel color that about matched her hair she took a seat forward a battered traveling bag reposed on the floor beside the girls seat carl macbride possessed eyesight an indian would have envied he read the writing on the tag appended to the young womans bag jean morris the worlds premier woman lion tamer the atlas congress of wonders atlas congress of wonders had a line drawn through it immediately below the circus name was written new york city carl macbride scratched his head he remembered that the atlas congress of wonders was the circus which had gone broke in trapper lake many months before macbride recalled one particular morsel of gossip there had been three pinhead savages with the stranded circus these had wandered off and mysteriously disappeared theres the new york airport said caldwell interrupting the woodsmans thoughts in the excitement of disembarking carl macbride lost track of his friendly traveling acquaintance caldwell had he been able to watch caldwell he would have received a surprise caldwell scuttled around to the deserted side of the field operations office hidden there he opened a large bag which was his only luggage he unearthed two large blue automatics and slung them in bolsters under his armpits next came a hand grenade of the small fluted type used in the world war he pocketed this the bag yielded a banjo the round body and the neckpiece of the musical instrument were in separate sections which clamped together the banjo actually held an ingenious silenced gun which could be fired simply by plucking one of the banjo strings one who knew how could aim this unusual weapon with accuracy without seeming to do so working rapidly caldwell combed out his waxed mustache he applied a chemical to it and smeared more of the same compound in his hair mustache and hair turned black he drew a ragged coat from the bag and donned it he sagged his shoulders as he walked a stooped musician with a stringy black mustache and black hair got in one of several cabs waiting near by new york is a city harboring many curious people the taxi driver thought little of it when his face querulously commanded him to wait a few minutes before starting not until carl macbride had clambered into a cab and rolled in the direction of the business district did caldwell permit his machine to move issuing terse orders he contrived to follow the hulking woodsman without calling his drivers attention to what he was doing when they had traveled twenty or thirty blocks caldwell became sure of their destination it was doc savages office he ordered his conveyance to halt while he entered a telephone booth located in a tobacco shop he got a number caidwell and the party he was calling recognized each others voices they exchanged no names exactly what we were afraid of is happening boss caldwell informed the other this lunk of a backwoodser is on his way to see doc savage you sure asked the voice at the other end of the wire he dont want to go to a lot of trouble taking care of him unless its necessary its necessary all right boss said caldwell i pumped the guy while we were on the plane he never suspected a thing came right out and told me the whole story he told you he was on his way to get doc savage to investigate what happened to bruno hen thats exactly what he told me the voice at the other end swore violently weve got to stop him before he gets to doc savage ive got a grenade my gat and that silenced pistolandbanjo contraption ill be able to stop him at doc savages office nothing as reckless as that ordered the other can you keep macbride in sight and nail him somewhere en route hes headed straight for new york on the main road guess i can overhaul him do that get him on the road somewhere caldwell his deadly banjo tucked under an arm dashed to his cab whoop it up buddy be ordered the driver if you get me downtown fast enough theres an extra twenty in it for you get the twenty ready retorted the driver and they were off chapter the killer carl macbride had never before visited a city of any consequence so he stared with great interest as they approached the cluster of towering skyscrapers the tremendous size of the structures caused a feeling of awe one building in particular reared like a great thorn of gray masonry and shining metal above the spiked tops of the other cloudpiercers not only was it among the tallest but its simple modernistic lines made it far the most impressive carl macbride made a mental note that before he left new york city he would go to the top of the towering modernistic structure to have a look at the town it had not occurred to the big woodsman that he might have difficulty in locating doc savage up in his woods country one had merely to walk into town and inquire for an individual and some one would be able to point him out every one knew everybody else it occurred to carl macbride that he had better ask where doc savage resided how do you find anybody in this town partner he asked the taxi driver look in the phone hook is one way was the reply maybe you know the feller i want to find his name is doc savage the taxi driver turned to eye his fare and almost ran off the pavement he straightened his machine out then pointed ahead to the skyscraper which carl macbride had admired everybody knows that guy he hangs out on the eightysixth floor of that building the fact that the driver knew the whereabouts of doc savages headquarters did not impress earl macbride as much as it should have in new york the average individual knows only his business acquaintances and immediate friends you got an appointment to see doc savage asked the driver taking advantage of the obvious amiability of his fare to ask questions no do i need one it had not occurred to the lumbering woodsman that an appointment might be necessary in the backwoods a business appointment was a rarity there was time for everything i dont know doc savage personally the taxi driver said ive seen him a time or two hes a big shot so youd better get an appointment howll i go about doing that phone him stop off somewhere carl macbride commanded guess ill call him the cab pulled up in a filling station which displayed a public telephone booth sign a newsboy loitering at the filling station in hopes of making a sale ran out read the latest mystery advertisement about the coming of the monsters he shouted curious carl macbride bought a paper the mystery ad was in black type in a square white space it read warning watch out for the monsters whats this mean the woodsman asked nobody knows replied the newsboy newspapers all over the country been gettin them advertisements in the mail along with money to pay for their insertion it may be a movie stunt to get people talkin about some picture thatll come out soon carl macbride frowned and tucked the paper in a pocket he entered the booth and thumbed through the directory until he found doc savages name the telephone was a dial type he was unfamiliar with the dial device and had some trouble with it eventually however he got his number the voice which came to his ears was one so profoundly impressive that he knew instinctively that the speaker must be doc savage the tones were deep vibrant with controlled power macbride had never before heard a telephone receiver reproduce with such distinctness i want an appointment with you mr savage said the woodsman its something mighty important my name is macbride you do not need an appointment doc informed him feel perfectly free to see me at any time macbride reflected that the driver had given him some bum advice ill be right up he said is your business something you would care to discuss over the telephone doc savage asked macbride was so impressed by the remarkable voice that he did not answer for a moment id rather tell you in person he said finally very well the telephone conversation terminated macbride went to his cab the machine moved toward the towering skyscraper which was doc savages headquarters big carl macbride did not know it but this chance pause to telephone was instrumental in prolonging his life caldwell had passed without observing the big woodsman in the filling station phone booth even now the murderous caldwell was hugging his deathdealing banjo and cursing ive lost the big lunk somewhere he gritted well hell ill have to catch him at doc savages office after all carl macbride was even more impressed by the big skyscraper which housed doc savages office when he alighted before it head back mouth open macbride peered upward when he entered the lobby the magnificence of the ornate place made him feel mouselike his amazement at sight of the great building accounted for the big mans failure to note a fellow with black hair and black mustache who carried a banjo and lurked in a corner of the lobby macbride lumbered into an elevator doc savages office he said he was promptly rushed to the eightysixth floor he found a door which bore in very small bronze letters the name clark savage jr there was a button but few persons had doorbells where carl macbride came from he rapped the door with his knuckles in the good oldfashioned way the door opened the unusual voice over the telephone had partially prepared carl macbride for the sight of an unusual personage when he confronted doc savage even then the bronze man was so far beyond expectations that macbride gaped in amazement doc savage had evidently opened the door by some mechanical means he stood not near the panel but some feet from it in the middle of a great office this was fitted with a costly inlaid table an enormous safe and a number of comfortable chairs that the bronze man possessed amazing physical strength was evident from the enormous tendons which bundled his neck and cabled his hands he was a giant but his proportions were symmetrical and standing in the massively furnished office he seemed little larger than an ordinary man the mighty bronze mans eyes held carl macbrides attention they were strangely impressive those eyes they had the appearance of tiny pools of flake gold which eddied and whirled continuously the bronze of doc savages hair was somewhat darker than the bronze of his skin he was attired in quiet business garb doc savage asked carl macbride although he knew he was confronting the man he sought right confirmed the remarkable man of bronze carl macbride took a step into the office an elevator door down the corridor opened a man popped out he had a black mustache dark hair and carried a banjo he raised the banjo to the level of his eyes and gave one of the strings a forcible pluck there was a chunging sound it might have been a man emitting one harsh cough a tongue of flame leaped from an almost indistinguishable round hole in the side of the banjo carl macbride opened his mouth wide and a crimson flood came out his knees buckled his hands clamped to the back of his neck where a bullet from caidwells deadly silenced gun had clubbed a hole he slammed face down upon the floor macbride felt no pain from the impact for he was dead chapter the clipping caldwell the killer was in a position where he could view doc savages office he saw the giant bronze man got a most unnerving look at the weird golden eyes he realized that doc having witnessed the killing was a menace caldwell darted his banjo weapon m doc savages direction and plucked the triggerstring the concealed gun lipped powder flame and slugs caldwells eyes threatened to jump from their sockets a weird thing had happened to his bullet it had disintegrated in a grayish lead puff in midair some feet inside the door he fired the hidden gun until it was empty he wrenched out his two automatics and squeezed the weapons at the office door they convulsed thunderously and spouted empty cartridges to all of the bullets the same fantastic thing happened they splashed into innumerable fragments in midair or became shapeless blobs which fell back to the floor caldwell spun and fled he dived into an elevator menaced the attendant with his gun and forced an instant descent as the cage sank caldwell heard a fragment of weird sound the note was not loud yet it penetrated to the descending elevator with remarkable clarity it seemed without definite source it might have been a product of the movement of the very air itself past the sinking cage it was not a whistle nor did it seem quite the emanation of vocal chords a mellow trilling which defied description the sound trickled up and down the musical scale caldwell unable to define the note dismissed it as a freakish trick played by his own ears he was wrong the strange undulating note was the sound of doc savage it was the small unconscious thing which the bronze man did in moments of stress when thinking or surprised or contemplating some unusual procedure an onlooker knowing doc savage and cognizant of the mighty bronze mans abilities would have expected pursuit of caldwell at doc savages disposal here on the eightysixth floor was a highspeed elevator capable of dropping the bronze man to the lobby level before caldwell could arrive doc did not pursue the slayer instead he moved into a room adjoining the office the walls of this chamber were banked with book shelves massive cases laden with ponderous tomes stood thickly on the floor it was doc savages library and it held one of the most complete collections of scientific works in existence the bronze man seemed to be moving without hurry but his speed was surprising beyond the library was another vast room this held glittering arrays of bottled chemicals banks of test tubes retorts and filtering devices electric furnaces and costly metalworking tools occupied the floor space in the center of the great workshoplaboratory doc savage halted he stood before a paneled cabinet a microphone dangled in front of this inset in the cabinet was a square panel that resembled frosted glass doc spoke into the microphone did you see what just happened in the outer office from a loudspeaker the grilled throat of which was almost unnoticeable on the side of the cabinet the reply came it was couched in a tiny almost babylike voice we did said the small voice ham and me both saw it and were off doc savage reached over and flicked a switch upon the panel of frosted glass a picture appeared it depicted cold concrete floors wails and an array of parked automobiles there was a door in this pictured room two men were just diving through it making a wild departure from the place doc switched off the televisorphone with which he had communicated with those two men he returned to the outer office here also but concealed cleverly in the wails was another televisorphone this one had transmitted an image of what had occurred in the office to the two men to whom doc had spoken doc savage and his five men were accustomed to keep each other in view with these devices whenever convenient thus they could witness danger which might threaten each other they had many enemies in approaching the lifeless body of carl macbride doc circled widely to avoid the agency which had caused caldwells bullets to mushroom so mysteriously in midair it was nothing more mysterious than an upright sheet of clear bulletproof glass due to the fact that he had many enemies it was docs custom to first greet strangers from behind this unnoticeable shield the giant man of bronze closed his office door to avoid the notice of passersby in the corridor then he examined the body of the unfortunate carl macbride the first thing doc brought to light was that the enormous roll of bills which bruno hen had given the big woodsman he riffled through the money in the act of doing this his nostrils quivered slightly he lifted the bundle of currency and gave it an olfactory test doc savage had a daily exercise routine of two hours which he had taken unfailingly from childhood the exercises were scientifically designed to develop his every sense touch hearing sight the sense of smell and taste his faculties were far beyond those of an ordinary man doc identified the odor easily faint though it was the scent of musk continuing his examination he brought out a newspaper clipping the one carl macbride had shown his plane acquaintance caldwell after noting that it was from a trapper lake michigan paper doc read it trapper lake man victim of weird tornado bruno hen trapper and fisherman residing near the lake shore five miles north of trapper lake met death last night in what authorities have decided was a freak cyclone hen was found crushed to death in his demolished cabin by carl macbride a neighbor macbride it is reported heard sounds from the direction of bruno hens cabin rushing to the spot he found his neighbor dead in the wreckage of his home macbride reported that he saw no evidences of a tornado and that it was a moonlight night the coroner and the sheriff however point out that a tornado is the only explanation for the demolished condition in which the cabin was found the tornado apparently dipped suddenly upon the exact spot where the cabin stood after annihilating the building the twister tore up brush and smashed down small trees over a narrow path to the lakes edge the storm evidently progressed out over lake superior without doing more damage bruno hen it will be remembered a few months ago sold the largest collection of muskrat pelts trapped in this vicinity in a long time after he finished reading doc savages fantastic trilling sound came into being so low as to be scarcely audible it existed for three or four seconds then ebbed away bruno hen had sold muskrat pelts the scent on the roll of bills was musk such as would be put there by the pawing of hands which had skinned muskrats doc savage carried the bills into the laboratory and used a fingerprinting outfit upon them he discovered a few of carl macbrides prints upon the bills but the preponderance of handling had been by another set of fingers having found musk odor on bills which carl macbride had hardly touched and which were thick with the other finger prints doc felt there was a likelihood that the money had originally been the property of bruno hen the giant bronze man returned to his search of the body the dated stub of an airways ticket showed that carl macbride had come to new york by plane that day doc brought out the newspaper which carl macbride had purchased in the filling station macbride was a laborious reader and in perusing the strange advertisement regarding the giants had traced the words with a finger nail the indentations were plainly discernible warning watch out for the monsters doc savage studied this with no little interest then he went to the library and came back bearing a tray this contained newspaper clippings one from a detroit paper read beware the monsters bring death and destruction another from a chicago paper stated terror that is what the monsters bring there were numerous others all in like vein in no ease were the advertisements signed they came from newspapers in cleveland st louis every city of consequence in the country doc savage sorted over these thoughtfully his fingers sensitive and possessed of a dazzling speed for all their superhuman strength turned to the clipping concerning the weird death of bruno hen the giant man of bronze made it his business to keep tab on all strange circumstances thus did he sometimes see danger before it struck he had collected these monster clippings because their very nature was sinister doc had newspaper connections through them he had learned that no one actually knew what was behind the monster advertisements it was no motion picture press agents buildup the ads simply came in the mail with money to pay for their insertion and in each case the ads had been mailed from trapper lake michigan chapter mystery manse it was more than an hour later when the telephone buzzer whined and doc savage picked up the instrument the tiny childlike voice which had spoken to him from the televisorphone in the laboratory came over the wire at the junction of hill road and the hudson turnpike in new jersey said the small tones be right out doc replied and hung up the bronze man took his private highspeed elevator to the skyscraper basement this lift was the product of his inventive genius and operated at hairlifting speed stepping from the elevator doc entered his basement garage this was the chamber with the array of parked cars which had appeared on the scanning screen of the televisorphone for his immediate purpose doc chose a long somberly colored roadster this machine as he wheeled it up to the street showed by its acceleration that the hood housed a powerful engine wending through traffic it attracted no attention due to its quiet hue not so the bronze man scarcely a glance rested upon him that did not become a stare so striking was the picture he presented the roadster swept over george washington bridge which connects manhattan island with new jersey when traffic thinned the machine increased speed it traveled just within the bounds of safety several times traffic policemen sprang into startled life as the car moaned past but they subsided upon observing the occupant the greenest rookie knew there was an imperative order out to extend to this man of bronze every possible cooperation hill road ran east and west and the hudson turnpike was a north and south thoroughfare the two intersected in a nest of filling stations and hotdog stands doc savage pulled into a gasoline station at the intersection and ordered fuel a few yards distant a crowd of excited children surrounded a man whose appearance was nothing if not startling he came near bearing more resemblance to an ape than to a man his furry hands dangled on beams of arms well below his knees he had a little nubbin of a head his hair grew back from his eyebrows the huge simian fellows face was likeable although entirely homely this pleasantly ugly personage was amusing the kids by calmly folding pennies between a hairy thumb and forefinger the feat of strength he performed without great exertion the gorilla of a man hardly glanced in docs direction he ceased performing for the amusement of the children and entered a large sedan which stood near by he drove westward along hill road doc savage having paid for his tank of fuel also rolled westward along hill road he topped the first hill in the valley beyond the gorillalike man had stopped his car doc came to a halt alongside the simian one wheres ham monk he queried monk grinned showing a tremendous array of large white teeth his head seemed to disappear entirely behind the grin certainly there did not seem to be room for much intelligence in his head his looks belied the truth however he was lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair whose ability as an industrial chemist had brought him worldwide fame and a fortune in money monk was one of a group of five who had associated themselves with doc savage these five men were all capable of commanding high monetary returns had they chosen to exercise the professions at which they were skilled but they loved adventure possessing ample wealth they had thrown in with doc savage in his career of punishing evildoers in the far corners of the earth monk pointed down hill road we trailed the killer to a kind of a funnylookin country estate hams watchin the place we better go on afoot doc switched off the roadster motor so silently had it operated at idling speed that cessation of movement of the ammeter needle was all that showed the cylinders had ceased firing the two men strode along hill road leaving the cars drawn into weeds beside the highway we had the televisor from your office to the basement garage turned on while we were working on a car monk said we thought you might want us or something it was lucky we did we saw the killing and got a good look at the guy who did it we caught sight of him as he left the building doc nodded i figured you would have the televisorphone turned on monk was puzzled he scratched his knob of a head and eyed the giant bronze man curiously wonder why that guywas killed he offered to shut his mouth obviously doc savage replied the killer may have been a hired slayer thats why i allowed him to escape so you fellows could trail him to the man who hired him if any monk nodded as he waddled along his legs were so bowed that his gait was grotesque he seemed momentarily on the verge of taking to all fours any idea whats behind it remember the mysterious advertisements which have been appearing in newspapers recently doc queried you mean that beware the monsters stuff thats it those ads were mailed to newspapers all over the country they were postmarked every one of them as being mailed from trapper lake michigan monk squinted his small eyes he had known of the monster advertisements but had not been aware that they had been mailed from trapper lake doc he realized had unearthed this fact in the course of his usual checking on things which night be of sinister nature whyd the murdered man want to see you doc possibly concerning the mysterious death of a trapper named bruno hen near trapper lake doc replied he had a clipping concerning the bruno hen death in his pocket what about bruno hens death he perished according to the report of the local officers in a mysterious tornado which struck on a moonlight night and did nothing but demolish bruno hens shack and tear a path to the nearby lake queer tornado monk grunted a neighbor claimed there was no tornado his name was carl macbride the man who was killed at our office door huh if not a tornado what did he claim it was the clipping didnt say monk squinted ahead his small eyes in repose were nearly invisible so deeply were they sunk in their pits of gristle hill road at this point was seldom traveled due probably to the fact that its macadam surface was uncomfortably roughened by the weather untended brush made a wall on either side that shyster lawyer ham should be waiting along here somewhere monk declared his small voice pitched even lower than usual the gentleman to whom monk referred in such undignified terms promptly stepped out of the brush he was brigadier general theodore marley brooks one of the most astute lawyers ever to be graduated from harvard you homely missing link ham whispered irately at monk one of these days im going to skin you and make a red fur rug ham was slender slimwaisted quickmoving his clothing was absolute sartorial perfection he was a tailors dream in his right hand ham carried a black cane ham was rarely seen without this the unlovely monk turned an innocent look on the enraged ham always threatenin me he complained in low tones whats on your mind now ham shook his cane in the air and turned purple he was not however making undue noise with his dramatics you left that infernal pig behind and had him follow me around monk seemed grieved habeas corpus must be takin a fancy to you he groaned i never thought that pig would stoop so low as to associate with a shyster lawyer at this point habeas corpus walked out of the brush a more astoundinglooking specimen of the pig family than habeas would be difficult to find the pig was undersized razorbacked he had the legs of a dog and ears so large as to resemble wings habeas eyed the dapper ham emitted a friendly grunt and ambled toward the lawyer ham launched a spiteful toe at the pig in dodging this habeas displayed an agility as surprising as his appearance habeas was monks pet the homely chemist had trained the pig until the porker seemed to possess a nearhuman intelligence doc lowvoiced interrupted what amounted to a perpetual quarrel wheres the killer ham he asked he went into a funnylooking place over the hill doc noted the appellation funnylooking both monk and ham had used it what do you mean funnylooking ham like many orators had a habit of making gestures when he spoke he gestured now although his words were whispered were in the country he said theres no reason for anybody having a high wall around his place but theres one around this joint its at least forty feet high forty every inch of that monk entered the conversation with his small voice i ask you doc what does any one want with a fortyfoot wall out here in the country i walked around the place ham said scowling at habeas corpus theres only one entrance thats secured by the strongest steel gate i have ever seen doc savage did not comment on the somewhat startling revelations he went forward monk and ham trailed him they exchanged throatcutting looks actually either of them would have sacrificed his life for the safety of the other should necessity for such an act materialize the pig flopping big ears at monks heels grunted contentedly put on the muffler habeas monk directed obediently the pig fell silent chapter the electrified net as doc and his two aids topped the hill the mysterious wall came into view some joint eh ham suggested the wall was so high as to conceal whatever lay behind it a somber barrier of gray it was altogether forbidding concrete ham offered softly they left the road the brush was high it grew thickly they eased through the leafy maze with little sound and came to the gate in the wall the only gap according to monk and ham this gate was notable for its size being fully fifteen feet wide and equally as high monk breathed look at the size of the bars monk possessed furry wrists almost twice as thick as those of an ordinary man the gate bars were of a diameter about equal to his wrists the gigantic gate was supported by a multiple array of ponderous hinges apparently it opened and closed through the medium of machinery they wouldnt need bars a fraction of that size to hold elephants ham said he ran a finger thoughtfully up and down the glistening black length of his cane doc savage listened for a time but detected no sound he moved along the wall eyes ranging its towering height when he had circled the place completely he had proven monk and hams declaration that there was only one entrance the wall did not enclose much of an area doc savage withdrew with his two men to a point remote from the gate of giant bars from within his clothing the bronze man produced a collapsible metal grapple hook to the shank of this was secured a long silk cord he sprung the book open then tossed it upward expertly the grapple fastened itself somewhere on the opposite side of the wall doc mounted the thin cord with an amazing ease and speed nearing the crest he slackened his pace from a pocket came a tiny periscopic device this instrument he had put to frequent use in the past its barrel was little larger than a match the average eye would fail to detect its projecting above the wall its tiny lenses were finely ground its functioning was almost equal to that of a larger instrument doc jutted the periscope above the wail not showing himself what he saw brought forth the weird trilling note which was characteristic of the bronze man he swung atop the wall crouching there he gestured to monk and ham directing them to ascend the cord monk grasped the thin thread the hairy chemist had bent copper pennies quite easily for the amusement of the children great as was his strength however he could barely cope with the task of mounting the silk thread a feat which doc had accomplished with ease monk was perspiring prodigiously from the effort when he reached the top monk had buttoned the pig habeas corpus inside his coat ham struggled valiantly to mount the silk line but his most herculean efforts got him less than ten feet from the ground his hands became sweated and he slipped back doc made gestures indicating that the lawyer should tie the cord under his arms this done doc hauled him upward the three men surveyed the enclosure for the love of mud monk gulped what kind of place is this anyway stretched over the walled area was a huge crisscrossed net of copper cables the cables were nearly three inches in thickness their mesh measured nearly a yard i dont understand this ham muttered the lawyer had retained a grip on his cane as he was hauled up now he gave the cane handle a twist and withdrew a long slender blade of steel hams innocentlooking black stick was a sword cane notice that the cables are insulated from each other doc said these insulators were substantial affairs of a brown dielectric composition the cables are built to carry a highvoltage electric current monk decided dont touch them doc warned they may be charged what gets me is the solidness of the construction ham mused from the gigantic net they dropped their attention to what lay below beneath the net stood a house of native stone it was vast undoubtedly old its state of repair was good it was two stories in height the roof top aimost reaching the thick cables ill bet that place has fifty or sixty rooms monk muttered and held habeas by an ear to keep him away from the insulated copper hawsers untended shrubbery surrounded the house it was carelessly crushed down at some points nowhere was there sign of life we make swell targets up here ham said grimly the grapple had hooked on the wall lip dangling it by the silk cord which was not a conductor of electricity doc used the hook to shortcircuit two of the crisscrossing cables there was a crackle and a bluehot spark the big net was electrified enough of a current to kill a man if you ask me monk grunted you fellows keep an eye on the place doc suggested monk and ham nodded from their clothing they drew weapons which resembled slightly oversize automatic pistols they were fitted with drum magazines and the mechanism looked somewhat intricate these were superfiring machine guns perfected by doc their rate of fire was so rapid that their roar was like the hoarse song of a gigantic bass fiddle in addition the slugs which they discharged did not produce fatal wounds being mercy bullets charged with a drug which brought only unconsciousness doc savage calculated briefly then sprang outward upon the spreading copper net he went forward in a series of agile leaps maintaining perfect balance his position was dangerous should he touch two of the metal hawsers simultaneously death by electrocution would be almost certain he was safe as long as he poised on only one conductor at a time just as a bird can perch unharmed on a high tension power line soon he was over the house roof the net mesh was amply large to permit him to drop through he did so executing the move with a batlike quietness the roof shingles were very old the bronze man listened for a time his ears attuned to the keenness of a wild animals detected vague stirrings there was also an odor a beasty odor doc worked down the steep slope of the roof from eaves to ground was an appalling drop he took it with the casual ease of a great tawny cat leaves fluttered slightly as he landed in the shrubbery docs two men still crouched on the wall alert monk shook his small head indicating he had seen no danger astir the shrubbery unclipped for months was over docs head at points from the wall crest monk howled look a rifle sounded from a window of the house to his remarkable vision developed and kept sharp by scientific methods doc owed his life he saw the rifle barrel even before monk perceived it and started his yell of warning doc saw the face behind the gun the visage of the man who had killed carl macbride a split second before the gun discharged doc veered left the bullet chopped shrilly at the space he had vacated seeming not to slacken his pace at a the bronze man gained a sheltering corner of the house from the top of the wall came an abrupt almost deafening moan monk and ham had put their supermachine pistols in action the rifleman ducked from view so quickly that he was unhit monk and ham hastily made the grappling hook fast and slid down the silk cord they used care not to touch the charged copper cables monk had his pet pig under an arm ham came up sword cane unsheathed monk lumbered on his heels the pig habeas trailing monk was as excited as the simian chemist wed better get inside doc said crisply that fellow may try to use his rifle from another window the bronze man reached a window and gave the sash a rap with his palm glass fell with a brittle clanging doc crawled in through the opening ham and monk kept at his heels the homely chemist grabbed habeas by an ear and hoisted him inside the room in which they found themselves was large apparently a smoking room the chairs were upholstered in leather the furniture was massive dark a thick layer of dust reposed over everything cigarette stubs were scattered about with great carelessness for the wellbeing of the furniture not for a long time had the place received a cleaning doc yanked open a door it gave into a hallway this too needed cleaning the men went down the hallway making no attempt at silence except when pausing to use their ears but no sound did they hear nor did they see any one they came to the room from which the rifle had been fired an empty highpowered cartridge shell lay on the floor it reeked of burned powder the rifleman had fled a scuffling sound led the trio toward the upstairs regions they mounted stairs which were carpeted from the carpet nap their feet knocked up little puffs of dust it had been long uncleaned at the top they found a corridor lined with many doors passages branched off from it youd think this place was a hotel monk breathed to their left a door opened the bright metal snout of a pistol poked out a determined feminine voice said dont move chapter the exliontamer the young woman was tall a plain traveling frock set off the enticing curves of her form almost as effectively as would have an evening dress her hair was her really striking feature young women with attractive figures were fairly common not so hair such as this it was the shade of steel and the young womans eyes were as metallic as her hair doc acted while her command still echoed his hand drifted with blinding speed to hams sword cane surprise had slackened the dapper lawyers clutch on the weapon doc swept it from his hand and flung it hilt first the hilt hit the girls gun hand she squealed and dropped her gun then sought to recover it lunging doc scooped up the gun before she got it his fingers banded the young womans wrist not tightly enough to inflict pain but with a firmness which prevented her flight the girl threw back her head and shrieked there was splintering terror in her voice ill do it she wailed ill do it that she was genuinely frightened doc could tell by her trembling her firm muscles quivered under his clutch wheres the fellow who shot at us he demanded the girl looked surprised her struggling ceased what what she seemed bewildered you mean youre not one of them who are you doc asked her the girl stared distrustfully she seemed a bit more at ease when doc released her wrists my name is jean morris she explained the name meant nothing to doc this was the first time he had heard it im a circus liontamer by profession jean morris elaborated my last job was with the atlas congress of wonders it went broke in michigan not at trapper lake doc asked sharply how did you know do you know a man named carl macbride doc queried instead of answering her the girls burnishedsteel head shook a negative no monk now addressed habeas corpus go hunt em ha beas hunt em up the pig trotted off the girl stared after the pig surprised at the unlovely porkers prompt obedience i got im trained until hes bettern a bloodhound monk grinned doc entered the room from which the young woman had accosted them it was a bedroom bleakly furnished the mattress was missing from the bed there were no curtains at the windows long disuse was apparent everywhere doc crossed to a windowly in need of washing looking out he found he could keep an eye on the gate monk stationed himself in the door apparently waiting for the return of his pig habeas corpus how did you get here doc asked the young woman her eyes snapped in answer to an ad in a circus trade journal an ad offering a job to any one who could speak the language of the pinhead tribe of african natives you speak it i do a little there were three pinheads with the atlas congress of wonders they were pitiful little fellows they used to follow me around like three black dogs i learned to speak some of their language doc savages features indicated neither belief nor disbelief he asked when did you come to new york today by plane i had been directed by telegram she thrust her fingers into a tiny pocket in her frock and brought out a folded yellow paper here it is handing it to doc doc accepted the wire and read the contents j morris care of guides hotel trapper lake michigan job yours stop catch plane immediately for new york and come to my home on hill road north of city griswold rock does griswold rock own this place asked doc a taxi driver told me he did the girl replied monk had been listening for the return of habeas now he glanced at the girl that name griswold rock sounds kinda familiar he said griswold rock is president and chief stockholder of a small railroad which serves northern michigan doc said he is well known there are several men here said the girl i dont think i saw griswold rock though you said there were three pinheads with the atlas congress of wonders doc reminded the young woman what became of them they disappeared they wandered into the country and that was the last heard of them how long ago almost a year then the circus did not go broke recently oh no it went on the rocks months ago i have been working in trapper lake as a waitress with a slow gesture doc savage indicated the high wall and the mysterious net of copper hawsers have you any idea about the meaning of all this no the girl shuddered the place gives me the jitters something mustve happened to habeas corpus monk groaned you three stay here doc directed then he was gone down the stairway into the lower regions of the house reaching the library he glanced about the furnishings while oldfashioned were not cheap condition here as elsewhere in the house indicated months of cleaning neglected the library was empty of life doc crossed to a ponderous desk which was something of an antique letters littered the top of it more letters obviously containing advertising matter had been flung upon the floor doc ran through the epistles all were addressed to the same individual griswold rock doc read several missives they pertained to routine operation of the railroad with which griswold rock was associated one thing was evident from the text of the missives griswold rock had been operating the railroad from seclusion it seemed that he had not visited the offices during recent months but had handled all business by letter telephone and telegraph just why this somewhat peculiar condition should exist the communications gave no hint doc left the library and continued his hunt monks pet pig should have returned long ago the fact that habeas had not appeared was ominous doc savage examined a kitchen a dining room and a large pantry without finding any one he did however note an enormous food supply this indicated some tremendous eaters were around doc dropped to all fours and pressed an ear to the floor the wood brought faint noises from somewhere in the house but they were too vague to be located glancing from a window doc noted ruts which seemed to be auto truck tracks swinging from the great barred gate and terminating against one wing of the house this particular wing was windowless little more than a great wooden box the peculiarity of the construction was interesting doc savage worked in that direction his intention was to investigate the box of a room a door barred his progress he tested it with his shoulder judging from its solidity the panel must be armored on the other side with sheet steel there was no peering through the keyhole it was covered on the opposite side by a swinging shield this refused to move when doc probed it with a slender metal instrument which he extracted from a pocket case doc worked at the lock with his metal probe he threw the tumblers but the door still resisted it must be barred on the inside doc moved to a window lifted it poked his head out and surveyed the surroundings he was under no delusions death was aprowl somewhere in this fantastic place for all of the quietness in the air doc saw no one he clambered outside and circling he examined the wing of the house which was like a great box at the end he found ponderous doors closed tightly nowhere was there a crack to permit inspection of whatever was inside doc tried his giant muscles against the panels the wood only groaned the sun was low the huge copper net overhead made a barred shadow pattern on the concrete walls and on the sides and roof of the house inside the house habeas corpus began squealing terribly chapter the man of fat doc savaged dived around the corner of the boxlike wing of the house and reached the open window through which he had come a few minutes before he pitched himself quickly inside the pig was squealing somewhere in the basement regions doc plunged through rooms hunting the entrance to the cellar on the stairway which led down from the upper floors monk and ham created racket they were descending evidently they had left the girl behind the sound of her feet was not mingling with theirs stay with the girl doc yelled at them monk and ham came to a stop on the stairs from behind them came a sudden awful sound a board snapped with a tremendous noise planks broke splintered nails pulled out of wood with shrieks like dying things the bedlam drowned the squealing of habeas corpus monk and ham wheeled back up the stairs reached the top and pitched down the hall aghast they skidded to a halt a fantastic thing was happening to the hall floor it was heaving upward forced by some unearthly power from beneath stringers were crashing apart planks rending and tearing beyond the point where the floor was upheaving they could see the steelhaired girl then the buckling of the floor blocked their view the hallway was dimly lighted dust was arising these two factors joined to prevent monk and ham from ascertaining the cause of the fantastic destruction the thing was smashing up from the boxlike part of the house which doc savage had sought to investigate doc savage joined monk and ham its something alive a monster monk gulped hear it breathin the breath sounds were like great windy rushes doc produced a flashlight it traced a beam like a whitehot thread this spiked out at the boiling dust clouds but could not penetrate deeply enough to show anything behind them in the lower regions habeas corpus squealed monotonously then the steelhaired girl cried out in an awful fear monk and ham held their tiny superfiring pistols they did not dare use them blindly for fear of hitting the girl the slugs were not lethal but one in an eye could do damage the clouds of dust swirling in the glittering crystal rods of the flash beam suddenly convulsed more violently wreckage splinters and small planks flew toward them back doc rapped its coming for us monk and ham found their arms grasped by docs powerful hands they were all but carried down the stairs they had moved none too quickly the monster seemed to be trying to get to them it was evidently baffled by the dust and by the strength of the timbers which composed the old house it seemed to turnback the steelhaired girl who had been briefly silent began to shriek again but her yelling suddenly decreased in loudness it was as if she had been dropped still screaming into a bottle and the bottle corked the thing yanked her down into the lower story doc said grimly monk wiped sweat off his simian features ive seen a lot of unearthly things in my time he gulped but this takes the cake in the basement habeas corpus still squealed im gonna see what ails that pig monk rapped and plunged off doc lunged toward a window before he reached it a loud throbbing roar arose this came from the boxlike room it lifted to a great syncopation of power a truck ham yelled there was a clanking of machinery the great door in the end of the house swung open a motor van lumbered out the thing was long the great closed box of a body rolling on a fourwheel truck at the rear this body was of steel and access was had by two doors at the rear these were closed the van driver was the man with the dyed black hair and mustache he who had killed carl macbride ham flipped up his machine pistol it bawled ejector spraying empty cartridges but the bullets only turned into chemicalandlead smears on the windows of the van drivers cab bulletproof glass ham growled disgustedly doc savage plucked the little superfirer from hams clutch the bronze mans fingers worked on the weapon flipping the magazine drum off in the cartridge intake chute doc inserted several special shells which he extracted from a pocket the great van had evidently run over a buried trip device in the driveway the gate of thick steel bars was opening doc lifted the gun his ability as a marksman was as accomplished as his other capacities then the gun blasted fire on the sides of the van appeared tiny grayish puffs as if snowballs had broken nothing else happened the van rolled through the great gate and was gone blast it yelled ham ham remembered that ejaculation for a long time due to what immediately followed for the floor seemed to sink several inches under their feet then jump the walls rocked a terrific explosion all but shattered their eardrums wreckage came spouting down the stairway which led to the second story walls cracked open like overripe fruit the sides of the house split to let out spurts of smoke and flame the roof over the boxlike room which had held the van spit in the middle and folded outward like a double lid smoke flame and debris propelled by the blast spurted up through the coarse net of copper cables doc and ham were catapulted the length of the room in which they stood their eardrums strained by the first concussion of the explosion registered the crash thump and bang of wreckage falling back to earth doc savage glanced through the shattered rectangle of a window the explosion had practically annihilated the mysterious wing of the house which had harbored the big van overhead boards and lath had fallen back upon the coarse net of copper dust from the explosion whirled in a great pall the girl ham gulped she couldnt have lived through that explosion the dust cloud settling and rolling aside partially dispersed flames appeared fire sweeping the wreckage of the house wing scattered tongues became scarlet bundles they licked at the wood flared up and spread the explosion scattered an incendiary compound doc rapped out the bronze giant and the slender lawyer flung out through the window and ran toward the fire waves of heat assailed them searing as they drew closer extinguishing such a blaze was beyond all possibility they circled the inferno eyes searching they discerned several things of interest the chief item being the amount of broken glass in and about the wreckage countless test tubes and bottles seemed to have been smashed here and there lay pieces of shiny intricate apparatus all battered beyond recognition there was a laboratory of some kind here ham hazarded neither man mentioned the main fact that there was no sign of the girl nor did they voice a hope both held that the girl had been carried away in the van monk had not put in his appearance he had been absent since before the blast when he had started searching for habeas corpus we gotta get him out ham wailed there was genuine concern in hams voice a marked change from the sarcasm with which he addressed monk when they were face to face the two men reentered the house they found beyond a door which opened off the kitchen a stairway leading to the cellar region a loud thumping noise drew them to the right the basement was filled with smoke the fumes were blinding irritating to the lungs sounds of the fire came to their ears an increasing roar mingling with this was a shrill whine an electric generator then they sighted monk the ungainly chemist was pitching himself against a door a panel which did not bulge in the slightest under his weight there was a small square opening in the door apparently for ventilation purposes through this came the mournful squeal of habeas corpus too the generator whine emanated from here i dont seem to be able to do a thing toward bustin this down monk groaned doc dabbed his flash beam through the hole in the door inside habeas pranced about it was a large bare concrete chamber it held a huge motorgenerator set obviously employed to charge the overhead net of copper cables with electricity doc gave the head of the flash a twist this caused the beam to widen and illuminate the entire room more effectively im a sonofagun monk exploded a man lay on his back in the middle of the floor glassy eyes fixed on the ceiling he reposed near the big motorgenerator the man was short very fat his fat looked soft his hands lay on the floor in lumps like a semimelted formation of butter he was reposing face up and his jowls hung down in buttery bags against his ears his business suit while expensive was wrinkled his shirt was soiled he wore no necktie the man did not move or even shut his wideopen eyes doc thrust a hand in the door opening and explored on the other side its sheeted with steel he explained the bronze man now examined the lock it was of the key type with the lock mechanism on the other side picking it would be slow work two small bottles appeared in docs fingers using a match stick he poked a pinch of powder from one of the bottles into the keyhole he followed this with a bit of compound from the second bottle back he said sharply they retreated there was a brilliant flash and a whooping roar splinters and torn steel geysered from around the door lock chemical reaction of the two compounds which doc had used had caused the explosion doc shoved the door open squealing delightedly habeas corpus bounded for monk the man on the floor was stirring he groaned his eyes closed then opened again he acted like one who had been asleep and was awakened by the explosion doc grasped the fat mans arm it was very soft as if he had clutched a partially deflated inner tube picking the fat man up bodily doc carried him out of the room better get out of here he called over his shoulder that fire is spreading fast monk scooped up habeas corpus and said i wonder how the pig got in there without replying doc savage carried the fat man up the stairway and outdoors monk and ham following him they ran toward the gate which still gaped open with his sword cane ham pointed at the net of electrified cables above then he indicated the high forbidding walls if you ask me this whole place is nothing but a gigantic cage he declared what i was thinking too monk rumbled i wish i could get my hands on this griswold rock who owns the place id find out what its all about the man doc was carrying squirmed feebly i am griswold rock he said chapter the prisoner the bronze man and his two aids digested this surprising information as they ran through the gate doc lowered the fat man then he left the spot running he vouchsafed no information as to where he was bound i wonder what docs up to now monk muttered he put some special kind of bullets in my gun and shot at the departing truck ham offered i dont know what the idea was but he may be working on that angle doc savage topped the hill descended into the valley beyond and reached the roadster he had run a quarter of a mile at a speed a champion sprinter would have considered remarkable yet his breathing was hardly hurried built into the roadster was a radiophone transmitter and receiver doc switched this on renny he called out of the radio loudspeaker came a roaring voice which might have been owned by a disturbed lion on deck doc where are you renny in your office just drifted in long tom and johnny there sure right beside me the men named were the other three members of docs group the bronze man issued rapid orders to the men i want to locate a large vanbodied truck he said its painted red theres only about a thousand red vans in new york said the lionvoiced renny use the planes doc directed fly over hill road and over the hudson turnpike look for red vans large ones when you find them size them up with ultraviolet light and fluoroscopic spectacles i get you said renny doc switched off the apparatus and returned to the spot where he had left monk and ham great clouds of smoke were climbing above the high concrete wall doc found the pleasantly ugly chemist and the swordcanecarrying lawyer eying plump griswold rock the fat man was holding his head from time to time his fingers explored in his hair has he talked doc asked indicating griswold rock ham shook his head they made me drink something griswold rock muttered that was right after they saw you fellows on the wall i no more than drank the stuff then i passed out where were you when that happened upstairs monk nodded as if a point had been clarified they carried you down to the basement and habeas corpus followed that explains how habeas got locked up with you i dont remember what happened griswold rock mumbled monk waved a hand at the concretewalled enclosure from which smoke poured as from a titanic chimney is that your place he asked the fat man nodded gloomily yep but it isnt like it used to be they made me build the wall made you ham asked exactly said griswold rock ive been held a prisoner for almost a year to preserve my life i had to do what i was told who were your captors pere teston was the head of the gang pere teston hes a former employee of my railroad explained the fat man he worked in a michigan division point he was discharged because he failed to show much interest in his work griswold rock poked a soft arm angrily at concrete wall and the gate of metal bars they made me transact all my business by letter or telegraph and sometimes by telephone one of stood at my side with a gun he grated you dont know the purpose of the wall and the electrified net of copper cables doc asked no they made me buy motorgenerators to electrify the net i dont know why ever see any kind of a monster around monster muttered griswold rock he shuddered maybe that explains the sounds i occasionally heard what sort of noises its hard to describe them pere teston kept me in a windowless room in the basement but sometimes i could hear things walking about huge things ever hear anything about advertisements in newspapers griswold rock nodded vehemently yes i did they were inserting ads in every paper in the country i dont know what kind or why was pere teston a slender man with freckles and a mustache doc asked the plump railroad magnate shook his head violently no pere teston is a shriveled runt the skin on his face is white deadlooking once you see him youll never forget his skin the fire had progressed rapidly a house wall collapsed slapping a great cloud of sparks above the concrete enclosure in the distance a fire engine moaned some one had evidently telephoned an alarm to the nearest suburban station doc savage went to the gate from the recesses of his clothing came an unbreakable tube the powder this contained he sprinkled upon the gate bars finger prints became visible doc savage made no effort to photograph them he merely studied them fixing the whorls indelibly in his mind months could elapse before the bronze man glimpsed like prints yet he would still recall their configuration to such retentiveness had he attuned his memory upon one particular set of prints doc bestowed a great deal of attention then he joined the others griswold rock was saying i am not a brave man they kept me terrified didnt you make an effort to escape monk queried the fat man nodded oh yes several times but i do not seem to be very ingenious my attempts always failed only yesterday i managed to get as far as the gate id have gotten away too i believe but the mechanical fastener defied me i could not discover how it operated although i fumbled all over the gate doc savage reached out abruptly and grasped griswold rocks fat wrist he turned the hands palm up so as to inspect the finger tips his experienced eye appraised the whorls and rings you left your finger prints on the gate he said dryly griswold rock raised his eyebrows in surprise i just found the prints doc explained wed better clear out of here now hear that fire apparatus griswold rock was eying doc he emitted a loud ejaculation i know who you are he exclaimed youre doc savage the fellow who has become so famous as a troublebuster doc waved the party in the direction of the car doc entered his roadster monk ham and griswold rock and the pig got in the other car with its siren moaning the fire engine approached on hilt road docs party took the opposite direction they got away without being seen thereby avoiding the necessity of answering the questions of curious firemen nor was the presence of doc savage ever connected with the mysterious walled mansion which the fire fighters found aflame never afterward in public did doc mention the place he told no one outside of his five aids and the others immediately concerned of what had occurred at the fantastic spot he did not tell that he had discovered the enclosure to be a prison for the retention of some species of fantastic monster the monster angle however was unearthed by an aggressive newspaper reporter who turned up on the scene this news hawk possessed an imagination he was employed by a tabloid which was not averse to coloring its news with a little invention this journalist of wit after studying the high concrete enclosure with its overflung net of copper cables played havoc with the speed laws in getting to the nearest telephone the next edition of his paper appeared with tremendous black headlines lair of monsters found mystery manse goes up in flames the story below was vague as to detail but it made interesting reading it stated that the property was owned by a railroad man named griswold rock and added further that griswold rock had not been in evidence at his new york club during recent months it suggested that the police conduct a search for griswold rock and climaxing the yarn was a suggestion that the mysterious monster advertisements which had been appearing in newspapers throughout the united states were connected with the unusual establishment which had been found in flames it happened that this tabloid newspaper was noted for the scatterbrained quality of the reports it published and as a consequence its deductions were not taken seriously some of the more sedate metropolitan journals dispatched reporters to the fire and these later turned in stories which were carried on inside pages in small type to the very fact that the tabloid newspaper first connected the mystery mansion with the monster advertisements could be attributed the small amount of real notice which the affair received nobody took the tabloid seriously since the newspapers never connected the walled estate of griswold rock with the hideous menace of the monsters which was soon to cast its grisly spell over the cities of the united states they remained blissfully unaware that in turning up their noses at the flamboyant tabloid they had passed up what might easily have been the frontpage story of all time furthermore the tabloid itself failed to profit as much as it might have for its reporter lacked the detective ability to follow up the possibilities which his imagination had suggested or maybe the reporter did not believe what he wrote he might merely have come uncannily near the truth in conjuring an interesting yarn out of his fertile brain at any rate no one connected doc savage with the fire least of all the fire fighters who arrived too late to witness the bronzes man departure while they were playing the first streams from their chemical extinguishers on the blaze doc savage rolled along the deserted road perhaps two miles distant chapter the ultraviolet trail doc savage switched on the radio telephone there came immediately from the loudspeaker the sound of static and intermingling with these cracklings a manythroated drone the droning sent from other transmitters was the sound of plane motors you fellows sighted anything doc asked out of the loudspeaker came a wellmodulated cultured voice this belonged to johnny who was known to his learned associates as william harper littlejohn he had once been the head of the natural science research department of a famous university no said johnny not a sign of them yet doc lifted his gaze flying low and to the southward he could see a plane roll your bus johnny he suggested the distant ship spun over slowly in the sky k doc said ive got you spotted the bronze man halted his roadster monk was driving the other machine the pig habeas corpus was perched on his lap he drew to a stop alongside docs car the three men and the pig piled out for the benefit of griswold rock and for his men who had not heard the entire story doc savage gave a brief synopsis of all that had occurred while doing this he spoke close to the microphone which fed the radio telephone transmitter so that his men in the distant plane would get the story clearly monk showed particular interest in the newspaper clipping concerning the death of the halfbreed woodsman bruno hen tornado nothing he snorted ill bet it was the monsters whatever they are that wrecked the cabin griswold rock shuddered violently the more i think of my last months the more terrible they become he moaned my captors forced me to sign so much stuff that they wouldnt let me read doc savage studied griswold rock the plump fellow certainly had not taken much exercise recently he was carrying some of the flabbiest fat the bronze man had ever seen the timberland is the name of your railroad isnt it doc asked griswold rocks fat jowls went through a convulsion which was evidently a nod that is right and you direct the destinies of the railroad absolutely yes i am not only president but i also own much of the stock that is providing i didnt sign it away with some of those papers they made me put my john henry on without reading is the town of trapper lake on the timberland line we have a station there not a very profitable one the sound of the plane became audible in the sky to the east a moment later the ship appeared the craft was of a type as yet rarely seen in the air lanes its shape bore faint resemblance to the popular autogyro actually it was a true gyro another product of doc fabulous inventive skill in making a takeoff the ship was capable of rising vertically the ship became stationary less than fifty feet above their heads the door of the closed cockpit opened a hand appeared it was an enormous hand fully a quart of bone and gristle encased in a skin which resembled rhinoceros hide the owner of the big hand thrust his head out he had a long horselike face which bore an expression of utter gloom with his other hand he threw a lever which turned the motor exhaust into a muffler the engine assumed a surprising quietness we aint having any luck yet he called his voice resembled the roaring of a disturbed lion this was renny colonel john renwick the engineering profession used his name in terms of highest respect his engineering feats had given him a worldwide reputation and earned him a fortune renny permitted himself only one form of amusement when the opportunity offered he liked to demonstrate his ability to knock the panel out of the strongest wooden door with one blow of his enormous fists long tom is further west renny advised guess you saw johnnys bus he swung the gyro in the direction of the strange walled enclosure with its grille of copper cables from this great quantities of smoke still poured renny circled the fire for a time then he returned and hovered is craft in the air over docs head the bigfisted engineer had an ejaculation which he used at every opportunity he employed it now holy cow he boomed thats the dangedestlookin place then he climbed his plane and followed hill road into the distance griswold rock had been an interested observer he now addressed doc i believe the tales ive heard of you were to the effect that you have five associates was that fellow with the enormous hands one of them doc nodded hes one of the greatest of engineers when he chooses to work at it from the loudspeaker in docs roadster came the words which he had been awaiting heres the van doc said a shrill voice griswold rock started violenty evidently the ramifications of docs communication system were beyond his comprehension who was that he gulped instead of replying doc started the roadster engine the giant bronze man had a habit somewhat disconcerting to those who did not know him well of seeming not to hear questions which he did not wish to answer had he chosen he could have taken time to explain that the voice belonged to major thomas j roberts an electrical wizard whose contributions to that science were among the greatest ever made the public knew little of long tom roberts work for the reason that his discoveries were largely beyond the understanding of the average layman within fifty or sixty years textbooks would no doubt state that major thomas j roberts had done important pioneering and discovery work along many lines where is the van long tom doc asked its going north on hudson turnpike well see if we can overhaul it doc said grimly griswold rock grimaced and became quite pale cant you cant you let me out somewhere doc and the others eyed griswold rock curiously most men when frightened put up a front of exaggerated bravado to hide their fears not so this fat man he was terrified and not backward about asserting the fact im an awful coward he wailed im especially scared of these devils do you want them punished monk demanded of course i do but i dont care about going after them myself ham eyed his sword cane thoughtfully apparently he was wondering how a man with such a marked lack of physical courage had managed to become manager and major owner of a railroad big business men with whom ham had come in contact had always been gogetters with plenty of courage you go with us doc told griswold rock well keep you out of danger often in the past monk and ham had seen the remarkable voice of the bronze man work miracles never had it secured a more profound effect than now griswold rock seemed to draw courage from the powerful tones i feel as safe with you as anywhere he said and got into the roadster the car hurtled forward in a fashion which caused griswold rock to utter a terrified choking sound and grasp the door however as he observed the expertness with which doc guided the machine his trepidation subsided within a mile he was resting easily on the cushions although seventies were dancing on the speedometer still got the man in sight doc asked into the radio mike im cruising above it came long toms radioed reply sure its the right machine positive the fluoroscopic glasses show the presence of the chemical mixture you always use doc griswold rock wrinkled his plump brow at these words you put something on that van to identify it shot bullets laden with a chemical concoction at it doc replied they splashed the chemicals on the sides and roof of the van the fat man waved his pursy hands for the life of me i cannot comprehend how that could help you to the naked eye the chemical mixture presents nothing extraordinary in fact its hardly noticeable but the stuff has the property of fluorescing or glowing when exposed to ultraviolet light ordinary vaseline for instance has a similar property this stuff glows with a different color a hue peculiar to itself but you speak of fluoroscopic eyeglasses the glowing marks are very small since it is now daylight special eyepieces are needed to make the glow visible there came an interruption a sound like metal knocking rapidly on wood it emanated from the radio loudspeaker doc long toms voice rapped excitedly from the instrument theyve got a machine gun the rapping grew louder drowning out the electrical wizards tones then with an ominous abruptness the racket ceased completely that clatter sounded like a machine gun griswold rock wailed doc savage said nothing he put weight on the gas accelerator larger and larger speedometer figures crawled past the dial marker for a time griswold rock failed to note the new pace at which they were traveling then chancing to look at the speedometer he turned very white chapter the tunnel long tom roberts had studied the red van intently through binoculars before dropping down close to it he had searched particularly for possible loopholes but had seen none too late he learned they had been covered by clever covers caps disguised as the heads of rivets that held the van body together a procession of lead slugs gnashing angrily at his left wing was his first warning of disaster the leaden stream made a quick march for the cockpit it was the hammer of these slugs which doc savage had heard over the radio long tom was not flying a gyro but another of doc savages ships a rather nondescriptlooking biplane doc used this type of craft when not wishing to attract attention by being seen in his distinctivelydesigned speed ship or the gyro the crate heaved over on a wing tip as long tom trod the rudder and cornered the stick it got away from the hungry lead he jerked a lever in the cockpit on the cowl hatches rolled back a disappearing machine gun jumped into view this was synchronized to fire through the prop out of the van top more bullets climbed every third or fourth slug seemed to be a tracer the metallic threads waved like a deadly windblown gray procession of raindrops long toms gun fired from bowden controls on the stick he ringed the van in his sight his hand clamped the bowden trip the gun on the cowl shook its iron back and smoked like cobweb spun by an invisible spider long toms tracers ran down through the late afternoon sunlight to the van against the steel van body however they only made splotches of chemical fire or spattered into shapeless blobs long tom felt his ship jar under him the stick waggled in his hand as bullets lashed at the control services he jockeyed the stick madly to evade the fire his plane had never been intended for combat it handled sluggishly a procession of slugs beat against the engine their sound was like rapid hammer blows the engine stopped long tom booted the ship into a flat glide then looked overside what he saw made him grind his teeth the only field suitable for a landing was one near the road to plant the plane anywhere else would mean an almost certain crackup for all around were trees rocks and abrupt hills long tom slowed the plane by fishtailing he threepointed perfectly on the clearing while the ship was still rolling he dived out and ran for the nearest bush he had hardly taken a dozen leaps when a machine gun stuttered behind him he saw hazy tracer lines near his head dust gushed on a hillside in front of him a dozen feet to the left he saw a shallow ditch long tom dived into it the machine gun stilled its noisy chatter take the guy alive if you can shouted a man take him alive they did the ditch was not deep enough to permit long tom to crawl away it chanced that he was at the moment unarmed four men ran up they were unsavory fellows men who had followed the path of crime so long that it was reflected in their voices and actions lamp the guy snorted one of the quartet he looks like a case for the hospital this statement about long tom was caused by the electrical wizards unhealthy appearance long tom was slender and only fairly set up he was very pale as if no sunlight had reached him for a long time his appearance however was deceptive few men were healthier than he the four men pointed machine guns at long tom these weapons were an airplane type firing fullsized cartridges recoil was taken care of by an elaborate bracing device which each man wore harnessed about his middle long tom arose from the ditch he was searched who are you asked one of the gang the electrical wizard ignored the query a man lunged forward and gave him a painful kick maybe thatll give you a voice the fellow growled the last word was still rattling his vocal cords when long toms fist collided with the point of his jaw the blow had the sound of a loud handclap the mans eyes rolled showing the whites he sagged to hands and knees and began shaking his head fish i ought to snuff your wick one of the other men snarled and jutted his rapidfirer at long tom keep your shirt on growled a rednecked thug well drag him along the boss may want to juice him for information the punk had some reason for taggin us with the sky lizzie im in favor of giving him a lead pasting hack grumbled the bloodthirsty one dummy up said hack the big shot may not want him rubbed they placed stout handcuffs on long toms wrists and his ankles then hurried him over to the big red van a man stood beside the machine dancing about in his impatience he was tall and waspish and had freckles and dark hair and a mustache docs story coming to long tom over the radio had included a description of this man the fellow was the murderer of carl macbride the electrical wizard realized why didnt you smear him he yelled indicating long tom we thought the big greezer might want to put the screws on him caldwell said the floridnecked hack caldwell he had evidently not troubled to give carl macbride a fake name on the plane considered this no good too risky croak im the men lifted submachine guns for an instant long tom stared death in the face wait caldwell rapped well plant im in the truck thats better the van cab was commodious it accommodated long tom and the four men who had seized him caldwell clambered into the rear the engine started the van swung into motion it traveled swiftly taking tremendous runs at the hills the electrical wizard listened the monster whatever it was which had broken through the floor of griswold rocks house must be in the rear of the van he hoped to ascertain from some sound what the thing might be he heard nothing in the nature of a clew hunched down in the seat long tom surveyed the heavens twice he saw planes they were too distant for him to tell whether they were docs ships the setting of the sun came about abruptly due to the rising of a bank of clouds in the west simultaneous with the descent of the blazing orb i dont think were doin the brainy thing said one of the men in the cab nobody asked you growled hack maybe not but i dont get the idea of finishin off the thing in the truck after all the trouble weve gone to shhh hissed hack it might hear you this one aint workin so good you know that so the boss has decided to get rid of it well bring up others for the big push on new york damn it well have to get another headquarters i hope that explosion got the bronze guy growled another dummy up said hack scowling at long tom this guys got his ears unpinned k k the other muttered what are we gonna do after we get rid of our load light out for the trapper lake country replied rednecked hack night clamped down blackly long tom kept accurate check on their progress and their whereabouts they followed the state highway for a time then turned off he could see the highway markers long tom made no attempt at a break his captors kept eyes upon him all the time they were on the ferry hands remained in gunbulged pockets his slightest move would have meant sudden death the van rolled on for hours it seemed the terrain became hilly at almost every brook they stopped and added water to the radiator at last the van halted there was a stirring in the rear long tom peered through the window caldwell appeared from the after regions of the van ahead of him he propelled the steelhaired girl jean morris her wrists were handcuffed at her sides adhesive tape crisscrossed her lips she could only glare rage with her metallic eyes and make angry noises through her nostrils the pair were illuminated faintly by the backglow of the vans headlights caldwell stared at long tom he spat disgustedly dont let this guy get away he warned hes probably been listening to you guys talk and knows plenty we aint been talkin lied the rednecked hack long tom kept his pale face expressionless in his listening he had garnered one really important morsel of information this gang seemed to have a headquarters in the vicinity of trapper lake michigan how do we dish it out to him asked hack just tie him in the van cab said caldwell two of you birds come along with me the other two are enough to do the job sure said hack i know the spot i was raised in this country the place is right ahead itll work swell itd better caldwell said grimly the van rolled ahead leaving caidwell the steelhaired girl and the two thugs behind the ponderous vehicle covered perhaps two hundred yards then angled into a disused side road the headlights picked out a tunnellike hole which slanted down into the side of a hill some time in the past an attempt at mining had been made here the tunnel was rather large big enough for the van to be driven in the mumble of the engine became terrific thunder as the van entered the bore for the first time long tom detected the vibration of something of great size moving in the van rear the monster was apparently disturbed by the roar of the engine i hope the thing dont try to get out hack muttered the van will hold it grunted the other long tom tested the handcuff links uneasily he was stronger than nine out of ten runofthestreet men his muscles however were unequal to snapping the stout steel links gettin uneasy eh jeered hack the fellow drew another set of handcuffs from his pocket he grasped long toms leg the electrical wizard kicked and pitched about violently the driver cursed his attention was distracted the van crashed into the tunnel wall and stopped both men seized long tom clubbing him with pistols straining grunting they managed to link his ankle manacles to the steeringpost lets go snapped hack they piled out of the cab long tom heard scraping sounds then saw the reddish flicker of machete he leaned out although his feet were secured he could see the two men they were applying a match to a fuse which led into a large steel tool locker slung under the van body the fuse hissed and spat sparks the two men whirled and ran the van motor had killed itself when the machine collided with the tunnel side and inside the tunnel there was comparative silence except for the noise of the running men somehow to long tom it was as if the receding steps were in actuality the departure of his own lifeghost he wrenched madly fighting the handcuff links the steel circiets scraped skin off his wrists and ankles cut flesh and rasped tendons and they held him back in the van interior the monster stirred uneasily on the faint chance that he might arouse the thing and cause it to break free and in some manner accomplish the saving of himself long tom began to yell bust out he shrilled theyre trying to kill us there was a violent stir a terrific impact inside the van then great blows the thing realized something sinister was under way either it had understood long tom or had sensed the danger long tom peered out of the cab stretching as far as the handcuff links would permit the sparking fire had crawled along the fuse until it was lost to view inside the box the monsters struggles caused the van body to rock slightly on the springs long tom widened his mouth to yell again the shout however never came instead he sealed his lips and listened he had caught a sound a sound so weird as to defy description a fantastic trilling note it might have been the plaintive cry of some exotic feathered thing lost in the umbrageous depths of the ancient mine it was the sound of doc savage doc long tom yelled the giant man of bronze came plunging down the declivitous mine tunnel flashlight in hand he moved the beam occasionally to avoid larger lumps of rock which had fallen from the roof of the abandoned diggings the bronze man wrenched at the underslung tool locker into which the fuse ran it was of steel heavily constructed like the rest of the van opening it was work for a key or for a steelcutting torch inside the van the monster struggled futilely doc savage leaped to the rear a huge padlock secured the doors too strong to break he whipped to the cab and grasped the stout handcuff chain which linked long tom to the steering column long tom had battled that chain futilely his best efforts had not even elongated the links the chain parted under docs fingers as if it were cheap soldered watch linkage long tom was yanked out of the cab and borne toward the tunnel mouth at a dizzy speed doc savages flashlight funneled white and in the incandescence stony outthrusts of the tunnel walls cast weird squirming shadows here and there lay lumps of coal which had disintegrated from long exposure to the air grayish shale floored the tunnel this still bearing depressions left upon the removal of tramway ties through these the van tracks rutted deeply long tom gnawed his lips he was holding his breath unaware of doing so would the explosion come before they got out it did not doc savage dived through the entrance and veered to the right in his haste he made some noise rocks rolled bushes whipped drawn by these sounds from a spot at least a hundred yards distant a powerful handsearchlight protruded a white tongue doc and long tom were embedded in the glare from behind the light angry yells volleyed hell its the bronze guy hack howled two gun muzzles lipping flame became like winking red eyes above the whitehot mouth of the hand searchlight the bullets passed doc and long tom so closely that the ugly sound was not the conventional zing but more like the snap of glass rods from the tunnel mouth came a great whooping roar the big hole spat shale dust and lumps of old coal it might have been the mouth of a gigantic cannon chapter the michigan clew the concussion of the explosive within the tunnel caused the earth to quake until doc all but lost his balance despite his tremendous agility rubble was blown from the mouth of the tunnel with sufficient force to carry many yards the stuff blasted in the direction of hack and his companions as the hail of debris struck the pair stopped shooting either a rock broke their light or they switched it off for its glitter vanished doc savage with long toms manacled frame across his tremendous shoulders pitched through the night the hill into which the tunnel penetrated was steep there was danger of the explosion sliding its top down upon them the cataclysmic force of the detonation seemed to lift the entire hilltop great cracks split and gaped open trees upset rocks and soil spurted upward as explosiongas escaped through the rents the hilltop settled causing great gushes of dust the tunnel mouth closed completely the reverberations of the blast whooped and thumped like unseen giants fighting each other until they weakened away into nothingness the monster within the van whatever might be its nature certainly had perished in that blast buried under hundreds of tons of stone shale and earth a more effective tomb would be hard to conceive doc savage lowered long tom by way of proof that the bronze mans earlier feat of snapping the handcuff blinks was no freak the linkage securing long toms wrists and ankles now parted easily under docs great corded hands howd you get here doc long tom demanded renny picked me up in the gyro doc explained using the ultraviolet light we managed to locate the van we followed the thing and lost sight of it when it went into the tunnel i dropped down by parachute to see what had happened the steelhaired girl was taken off the van a few hundred yards back long tom offered with the ghostly abruptness as of a bronze specter doc savage vanished into the night he made directly for the spot from which the shots had been fired dust rolled in choking waves the cloud banks that had made the sunset so abrupt had gorged the sky with their sooty mass dust and clouds combined made the night very dark far overhead doc could hear faint hissing noises they might have been made by the wind actually they were the sound of the silent motors which propelled rennys gyro and the larger speed plane in which johnny and the others rode johnny had landed and picked up monk ham and fat griswold rock griswold rock had not been enthusiastic about taking to the air having admitted a fear of airplanes doc savage using his fabulously sensitive ears and nostrils ascertained that the gunmen had fled he increased his speed the fleeing pair had taken to the disused road which approached the mine mouth doc catching faint sounds of their flight ran faster his quarry had turned off the road into a very level field doc caught a faint tang of gasoline out of his pocket came a small boxlike device it was a radio transmitterreceiver designed for an ultra degree in portability he clicked the switches renny johnny he called im on rennys thumping tones replied me too added johnnys more scholastic voice toss out flares doc commanded i think these fellows have a plane waiting down here theres a smell of gasoline in the air that this deduction was correct was quickly verified a plane motor whooped into life out on the level field high overhead almost against the black flanks of the clouds a light appeared rivaling the sun in brightness it bathed the earth in glittering white causing every grass blade to stand out it was the flare which doc had ordered it sank slowly lowered by a small parachute its intensity seemed to increase as it eased down in the sky doc caught sight of the plane it was a lowwing cabin job and it looked fast caldwell himself was inside the glass enclosed cockpit handling the controls giving his engine no time to warm up caldwell fed the cylinders gas the lowwinged ship picked up its tail and scudded across the field in the calcium dare doc savage discerned a feminine face jammed to the cabin windows the steelhaired jean morris apparently was still a prisoner the plane vaulted off above rennys gyro and johnnys speed ship came spiraling down to attack doc directing the affair by radio commanded watch it you fellows the girl is in their plane his warning was hardly necessary however caldwells plane climbed with astonishing speed to the west clouds hung very low the craft made for these as it banked doc caught a glimpse of the license numerals in the flare glitter he made note of the number fixing the figures in his retentive memory it dived into the vapor bank and was lost to sight before it could be overhauled holy cow came rennys disgusted ejaculation from the gyro we havent got a chance of trailing them through these clouds rennys gyro and johnnys faster bus swung in great circles searching johnny even climbed the ship above the clouds where there was moonlight no trace did they discern of caldwells aerial conveyance it had made an escape johnny tossed out another flare banked down and leveled off there was some bouncing to his landing but considering the landing speed of his ship it was expert long tom had joined doc he watched johnny get out of the plane johnny sure looks like the advance agent for a famine the electrical wizard remarked this described johnnys appearance accurately he was extremely tail and thinner than it seemed possible for any man to be dangling by a ribbon from his left lapel was a monocle actually a powerful magnifier griswold rock scrambled out of the plane after the gaunt johnny rocks fatty face was white as dough and was dripping perspiration his hands trembled i hate airplanes he wailed they always scare me so that only doc could hear long tom remarked everything seems to scare that guy renny now dropped his gyro lightly upon the field alighting he fanned a huge fist in the general direction of the sky holy cow he rumbled howre we going to trail em i can help out long tom said shortly i overheard them talking theyve got a hangout somewhere near trapper lake michigan they were going to head for that spot griswold rock held up plump soft hands in a gesture of incredulity surely youre not going to follow them he ejaculated dont you see that they are too dangerous to monkey with bigfisted renny answered this cracking down on guys like them is what we do for a living griswold rock shuddered and all of his fat jounced and shook im a coward he wailed dont count on me i wish i could go to south america or some place until this is all over doc savage began outlining his intended course of action renny he addressed the bigfisted engineer your knowledge of engineering includes dope on excavating methods you probably know where machinery and men can be gotten in a hurry renny nodded and looked gloomy the gloomy expression was deceptive the more somber renny looked the more he was probably enjoying himself you will start excavation on the closed mine tunnel doc told him dig in and see what the monster was k renny said doc savage now addressed ham whose specialty was law you go over the records and recent legal papers of mr rocks timberland line railway see if you can unearth anything of value mr rock will want to know what kind of papers he has been forced to sign recently anyway fat griswold rock suddenly shook his fist violently at the sky where the plane of their enemies had lost itself color came into his flabby cheeks you dont need to look for the chief villain he yelled its that chemist pere teston for the briefest moment it seemed that doc savages weird trilling note was audible his five men showed marked interest for the sound indicated that the big bronze man had just heard something which he considered important chemist doc repeated you neglected to state that he was a chemist did i griswold rock clucked regretfully i was excited i suppose i left out that detail its not important anyway he was a halfbaked chemist halfbaked i mean he had crackpot ideas he was a nut on scientific farming he was always going around talking about increasing the efficiency of farm animals he got so goofy about the idea that he was worthless to my railroad as an employee so we fired him along just what lines did he hope to increase the efficiency of farm animals doc asked pointedly i dont know the fat man shrugged i didnt pay much attention to that he was just another employee now though i wish id kept my eye on him doc asked several other questions these merely developed the fact that griswold rock had no more information of importance to divulge i dont want to go to michigan with you said the fat man we have no intention of forcing you into danger doc told him you can remain here in new york if you prefer the rest of us are going to michigan long tom demanded we are doc told him chapter northward the remainder of the night and part of the following day was filled with fast if unexciting movement bigfisted renny calling on engineering acquaintances and contractors assembled steam shovels a fleet of dump trucks and workmen he began operations on the cavedin mine scooping his way in to ascertain the nature of the monster which caldwells gang had buried this job is apt to take some little time he reported ham the legal expert set to work on the papers of the timberland line griswold rocks railroad although the little railway operated in michigan its main offices were in new york i moved the headquarters down here griswold rock explained i never did like northern michigan it gets too cold for me up there in the winter in his first few hours of searching ham unearthed several noteworthy morsels of information first griswold rock had signed numerous checks under duress they were large checks they totaled nearly a quarter of a million dollars furthermore it was evident that pere teston had been the recipient of all of these sums at least his name was on the face of the checks and on the back in endorsement fat griswold rock did not seem greatly concerned over the huge inroad on his finances apparently he could stand monetary loss but any threat of danger to his person drove him frantic i got out of it lucky he said and fingered his own fat bulges lovingly another interesting detail turned up by ham was the fact that the timberland line had recently bought tremendous quantities of food this stuff tanged from some hundreds of sacks of flour to several carloads of dressed beef there were literally carloads of groceries the purchase orders for that junk must have been among the papers i was forced to sign griswold rock declared this is the first time ive seen them but they have my signature all right ham traced down these food supplies he learned the material had been transferred to a barge in lake superior near trapper lake no one seemed to know what had happened after that the barge had simply gone away late in the night and had come back empty oh gracious ejaculated griswold rock theyve bought enough food for an army what can it mean it means that this is something gigantic and carefully planned ham decided all of griswold rocks bulges shook as he shuddered i have an awful feeling he moaned it is that some gigantic awful menace is hanging over us i tell you these devils must contemplate something horrible ive a notion to go to europe until its over suit yourself snapped ham somewhat disgusted by the fat mans manifestations of profound cowardice but before you sail give me legal authorization to go through the records of your railroad up in michigan i want to do some more checking there very well griswold rock agreed he signed an authorization which ham drew up it was well past noon before doc savage took off in his largest speed plane for michigan with him went ham monk johnny and long tom each man carried such mechanical devices and supplies as he believed he might need they left renny behind superintending the excavating of the buried monster im going to europe or somewhere said fat griswold rock as he saw them off the speed plane doc was using for the michigan trip in addition to being his largest was his newest it was a gigantic thing built to the bronze mans personally drawn specifications a ship which had created a small furor in the aeronautical world it was nearly a hundred miles an hour faster than anything approaching it in size the fast craft was volleying over the trapper lake region of northern michigan when sunset approached doc was handling the controls he had not slept the previous night nor that morning moreover the giant bronze man had that morning taken the twohour routine of exercises which he never neglected the exercises consisted of muscular exertions performed so strenuously that they spread a sheen of perspiration over his great frame a series of sound waves above and below those audible to a normal ear he had employed to attune his hearing he tested an assortment of odors this sharpening his olfactory organs he read pages of braille printing the writing of the blind which is a system of upraised dots on paper to make his sense of touch more acute there were scores of other angles to his routine all intended to develop mental and physical perfection all of the exercises were scientific in nature calculated to obtain the most pronounced results despite the exercises intensive activity and lack of sleep doc savage showed no signs of fatigue his companions did not regard this as unusual they had become accustomed to docs phenomenal powers the pig habeas corpus reposed on a coat in the aisle the air was cooler in these northern regions ham carefully attired in tailored outdoor garb felt the chill and glanced about in search of his topcoat he saw habeas his eyes popped his neck became purple owww be shrieked he made a pass at the pig with his cane habeas sought shelter under monks seat ham tried to reach him but was fended off by monks hairy hands ham promptly belted monk over the head with his sword cane you fuzzy baboon he gritted you put that pig up to eating a hole in my coat he never chewed on things before monk looked at the overcoat on which habeas had tried his teeth it was a strawcolored garment the latest in weave and cut monk lifted a scornful lip if youd wear clothes like other men wear it wouldnt have happened he snorted habeas mustve thought that funnylookin thing was a new kind of fodder hams swing with his sword cane missed as the plane heeled over on a wingtip and he had to grab a seat to maintain his balance doc was circling trapper lake trapper lake was considered something of a metropolis in this remote woods region it boasted a population of nearly seven hundred the largest building in town was the hotel the guides house the sign on the guides house stood up as the most prominent object in town the fact that many of the buildings were constructed of logs gave the town an aspect somewhat out of place in this modern age the timberland line railway depot was a squatty red structure no level ground suitable for a plane landing was discernible near town well go on and land on the lake near carl macbrides cabin doc offered well be on the spot then ready to look things over when daylight comes bony johnny looked surprised how we going to find the cabin that shouldnt be hard doc told him the newspaper clipping gave its location in a general way from their altitude the shore of lake superior was visible to the northward red lines slanted across the lake by the setting sun seemed to squirm with the undulations of the waves the few miles to the lake shore they covered in short order renny peering over the side slanted a quart of pointing knuckles there it is he rumbled he had discovered the wreck of bruno hens cabin brush and timber resembled a moss growth around the demolished structure the fragments of the shack itself were not unlike a bunch of crushed and broken matches docs plane was an amphibian capable of alighting on water or land the undercarriage wheels disappeared into wells the bronze man dropped the big ship expertly on the lake then taxied inshore he did not beach the craft instead he pressed a lever and a light grappling anchor was lowered mechanically this caught and held on the bottom collapsible boats came out of a locker and were planted on the water they paddled ashore a latecalling meadowlark made sound a jaybird scolded them angrily along the lake leaping fish made splashes it was a peaceful scene they walked to the ruin of bruno hens cabin ham leaning on his sword cane studied the wreckage in the pale gray light which was all that remained of the day the ruin had been yanked apart by curious individuals these persons had tracked down whatever sign the surroundings might have held in addition there had been a heavy rain since the disaster well wait for daylight to hunt dews doc decided they pitched their tents on a bit of high ground near the wreckage while the others did the actual erecting of the shelters doc paddled out to the plane and made use of a powerful radio set which it held wonder what docs doing long tom pondered battening down a tent stake with a dead branch the question was answered when doc rejoined them caldwells plane actually flew to this vicinity doc announced checking with the airports between here and new york disclosed one which saw the ship during the night the plane circled but the pilot was evidently afraid to land he went on howd they come to notice it gaunt johnny asked curiously there was an alarm out for a ship carrying the license numerals which that one bore the men showed surprise they had not known that doc had spread an alarm for caldwells ship the license number should show who owned the craft johnny exclaimed it was stolen a month ago from a commercial air transport company in southern michigan doc replied a checkup revealed that another crime to be charged against caldwell or pere teston or whoever is behind this johnny said thoughtfully complete darkness arrived this night like the previous one in new york was cloudy kinda feels like a storm monk remarked the homely chemist was engaged in playfully upsetting habeas corpus with a toe the pig seemed to like this while they were cooking supper cottontail rabbits occasionally ventured into the zone of firelight only to flee as some one moved or spoke owls hooted mournfully insects clattered high notes and bullfrogs whooped in bass it was a peaceful scene they settled for the night in pneumatic sleeping bags all were tired they soon dropped off to sleep chapter night terror thunder was chuckling softly in the distance when monk awakened docs hand upon his shoulder there was no lightning monk squirmed peered into the inky void and gulped hey what the quiet doc cautioned i think somethings going to happen monk bounced out of his bag much to the disgust of habeas who had been asleep on the foot the pig grunted a few times in discontent then with strange abruptness it became silent monk fished out a match and thumbed it alight he hid the tiny flame in his cupped palm so that only a spear of light escaped and fell upon the pig habeas was sniffing like a pointer coarse bristles along his back were on end monk listened and could hear nothing but the pig had detected the presence of something habeas has remarkably keen senses doc said softly the nearest of the things must be at least a mile away from us what things just a minute doc said ill let you listen the bronze giant went to the other men and awakened them all moved to one side a few yards clear of the camp a strangelooking bit of apparatus stood here doc had evidently erected this after the others had gone to sleep long tom the electrical wizard recognized it instantly a supersensitive listening device he said the electrical expert did not trouble to explain further that the thing utilized sensitive parabolic pickup microphones and amplifiers of great power similar to those employed in radio sets he presumed that the others knew this doc savage flicked a switch which connected the loudspeaker to the amplifier output the sensitivity of the listening device was at once apparent an owl hooted in the distance and the sound poured out of the loudspeaker in a great bawl habeas corpus grunted that too was magnified a thousand fold suddenly there came from the loudspeaker noises foreign to the other night sounds these were watery notes a great splashing and gurgling then came tremendous hissing noises as of a monster breath expelled doc switched off the listener huh monk gulped that sounds like something wading along the edge of the lake theres another of the things in the opposite direction doc advised as far as i can tell there are only the two of them theyre approaching slowly after a brief interval the bronze man switched on the listening device again this time the splashing sounds were louder and it was evident that they came from both up and down the lake shore do you reckon theyre huntin us monk asked uneasily well wait doc said we wont use this listening device any more either the things may hear the amplified sounds the men waited listening so hard that they could almost hear the gurgle of blood in their own veins no listening device was needed now the noisy wading was becoming louder as the fantastic waders of the night approached i hope they meet each other and fight it out long tom said uneasily they sound as big as elephants this proved a futile hope the gigantic things prowling along the lake shore apparently met one of them emitted sound a roar which terminated in a hacking and sputtering for the love of mike monk breathed first time i ever heard a sound like that there came a loud clank it was like a tin can being kicked only infinitely louder it was followed by another metal crumpled noisily rivets shrieked brace wires parted with loud dongings our plane monk growled theyre tearing it up he started forward wait doc admonished sharply those things may be dangerous a tremendous splashing was accompanying the ruining of the plane this came nearer as if the monsters were pushing the plane to the beach aint we gonna do something about this long tom asked indignantly i planted a camera in the treetops upon first hearing them doc explained the things are almost in position now to have their pictures taken from the ground beside the electrical listening device doc picked a metalliclooking object slightly smaller than a baseball he threw this in the direction of the beach the thing detonated with a flash that stabbed at their eyeballs like hot flame it was powerful flashlight powder which would expose the plate of the camera he had been able to plant the camera with shutter open thanks to the murk of the night at the flash both monsters came crashing through underbrush and timber toward the camp they must have located our place by the camp fire earlier in the night ham breathed grimly scatter doc ordered these things show signs of in telligence theyre dangerous stealthily the men parted doc savage remained where he was except that he moved a few feet to one side stooped and opened a bag this was part of their equiprnent all of which they had fortunately removed from the plane out of the bag doc took two metallic containers each of perhaps a quart capacity balancing one of these in either hand he waited they were great teargas bombs he delayed throwing until convinced one of the monsters was within fifty feet then he hurled both gas bombs they landed bursting with loud whups then doc dodged wildly something came at him something thrown whether by accident or due to the fact that the monsters had heard some slight sound which doc had made the object was thrown accurately it hit doc it was such a blow as he had never before fell he was propelled backward crashed into a tree bounced from it to a smaller sapllng and dropped he lay perfectly still after he fell the thrown thing had not struck doc savage squarely however a shift executed almost as he felt the thrown object had put him partially in the clear he had an opportunity to tense his great muscles to absorb the shock he lay in the soft weeds and dead leaves for only a moment then reared up the monster was charging him doc glided to the side one hand exploring the blackness for saplings and trees to avoid collision with his other hand he felt for his flashlight he found it a shapeless mass of battered metal and squashed glass it had come into contact with a tree and was useless the monster missed doc and ploughed on through the brush travelling blindly its coughing hacking sputtering and other hideous sounds indicated the effects of the tear gas it veered toward the lake its companion following with a great splashing they fled into the night they traveled with amazing speed for their sounds were soon lost to the unaided ear doc started toward the beach desirous of getting to his camera the plate should tell them the nature of the monsters but he encountered the tear gas the night breeze which was very light had not yet pushed the stuff out on the lake rather than trouble to dig a gas mask out of his duffle doc decided to wait until the breeze dispersed the vapor that should not take many minutes his men came back to the camp have any of you got ideas about what the monsters were doc asked them none had it seemed nobody had a flashlight in his possession during the affair this explained why no light had been shown doc dug a flashlight from their luggage and swiveled the beam about he was searching for the thing that had been thrown at him it took only a few minutes to ferret out the object whewww monk breathed did one of them throw that that was a rock as large as a water bucket doc spattered the flash beam about look here yelled the bony johnny tracks the things made the prints were roughly rectangular in shape and outlined plainly in the soft earth theyre bigger than any man could make monk muttered this was no exaggeration the prints measuring much longer than monks feet which were not small the amazing thing however was that the prints were without definite shape doc savage examining them noticed that the earth was pressed perfectly smooth where the weight of the monsters had borne down there was no mark of hair or scales nor were indentations of claws distinguishable the prints dont give us much of an idea doc said fortunately we have the camera they spent several minutes inspecting the undergrowth noting how saplings were crushed down and even small trees bent aside and their limbs torn off those babies were really strong monk muttered the gas had dispersed by now we should have a good flashlight photo of the things doc declared and led the way toward the beach once on the sandy strand he stopped he played his flashlight beam for a moment the fantastic trilling note which was part of this remarkable man of bronze became audible it seemed to have a slightly disgusted quality what is it doc monk asked the monsters smashed into the tree that held the camera doc advised moreover they seem to have been lucky enough to walk on the camera theres hardly enough of it left to stuff a pipe chapter the suicide slaying the storm on the horizon threatened with hollow thunder for the rest of the night but did not materialize morning sun brought silence to the owls they had not resumed their hooting for nearly an hour after the visit of the monsters meadowlarks bobolinks and thrushes greeted the dawn the rays of the sun turned into glistening jewels the dew which dappled the leaves and grass doc and his men inspected the plane it lay in shallow water close inshore one wing was askew almost ripped off the stout metal fuselage was dented crushed propellers were bent they sure wrecked the bus monk exploded doc savage went over the ship seeking dews but if there had been signs of any the lake water had removed them he studied the size of the holes which had been beaten in the fuselage they were nearly large enough to permit a man to crawl inside the thin alloy metal had parted under the impact of great blows as if it had been paper the things have an almost fantastic strength doc commented he gave his attention to the tracks which were imbedded in the beach sand and in the softer woodland loam the prints seem to have been made with a substance as unyielding as steel he declared a fleshandblood foot would show some change in configuration he went over the scene thoroughly deep in the tangled brush beyond the camp whence had charged the monster which had flung the rock doc found a clew it proved that their visitants of the night had not been metal robots of titanic proportions the clew was a crimson fluid the red stuff was spilled over leaves and across the grass for a short distance the monster had apparently snagged itself on a limb doc savage spent half the morning going over the vicinity satisfied at last that he was going to unearth nothing he scrutinized the remains of bruno hens cabin he spent an hour at that job but found nothing of value they visited carl macbrides cabin and doc went through macbrides belongings the inspection revealed that carl macbride had no near relatives thats a relief muttered homely monk who had entertained visions of the unpleasant task of informing some one close to carl macbride that the man was dead such jobs usually fell upon monk doc and his party went back to their campsite packed their equipment in tumpline rigs and set out to walk the five miles to trapper lake they covered half of the five miles and came upon a grassy glade surrounded by a dense growth of conifers the group were crossing this when doc flung himself face downward drop he rapped the others had only time to sag their jaws in astonishment before a short shrill whistle knifed at their eardrums every man flattened they knew that sound it meant the passage of a highpowered rifle bullet the grass was almost kneehigh prone in it the men could not be seen at a distance of more than fifty feet spread out brothers doc directed hes liable to try random shots into the grass howd you locate him doc monk called not getting an answer monk angled over to find doc with the intention of putting the question again but the bronze man was not to be found doc at the moment was scores of yards away he traveled swiftly almost against the ground another bullet made a loud buzzing sound through the grass docs discovery of the rifleman had been no accident for the previous mile of their progress the bronze man had noticed a marked lack of bird life to his trained eye this indicated some one was moving ahead of them and had frightened the feathered creatures away accordingly he kept his eyes open he had sighted the bushwhackers rifle as the fellow aimed the rifleman had a plain white handkerchief tied over his face doc gained the edge of the clearing not until he was well into the conifers did he arise a mighty nemesis of bronze he circled to flank the attacker he was unsuccessful the rifle wielder suspecting his shots had missed had fled he could be heard plunging through the brush doc savage heading across to intercept the man found his path barred by a great thicket of brambles large trees grew out of the thorny maze their branches almost interlocked in spots scarcely slackening his running pace the bronze man hurtled upward in a great leap his hands clamped a low limb and the momentum of his leap carried him over with an acrobatic agility he landed atop the limb maintaining a perfect balance he remained there so briefly however as to seem not to pause at all he swung up and out caught another limb and repeated the process until he stood among the topmost branches he glided out on a bough and sprang into space an onlooker not knowing the tremendous quality of the bronze mans muscles would have felt he was committing suicide docs hands found the branch of another tree he went on through the aerial lanes his progress involved herculean exertion but he was probably traveling as swiftly as the fleeing rifleman beyond the brambles doc dropped to the earth he was on his quarrys trail his path lead through tangled brush through thickets of stunted evergreen they descended a sharp slope a sluggish stream appeared wide and shallow at one point a log had fallen across the water the bushwhackers trail led directly to the log doc savage reached the log and stopped the water beneath the log was only a few inches deep and it overlay pleasantlooking sand this sand was riled disturbed at one point great bubbles were rising and bursting quicksand and the bubbles arising might mean some one had fallen in or it might mean that docs quarry had dropped a rock into the treacherous sand in an effort to pull a trick docs eyes ranged the log it was covered with a green moss this was undisturbed the bushwhacker had not walked across and nowhere was the quicksand stream narrow enough to leap doc gazed around there were no limbs to which the fugitive might have sprung to hide his tracks the opposite bank of the stream was a wall of brush and small trees and beyond lay thick timber to gain refuge the bushwhacker would have had to take wing the fellow was in the quicksand no doubt of it from docs clothing came the silken cord and grappling hook which he so frequently found of use he doubled the cord twice and took a loop around the log monk and the others came up they were scratched their clothing was torn hams immaculate garb hung in tatters they had evidently had a tough time with the brier thicket hey doc long tom yelled in horror you aint gonna go into that stuff j hope doc did not reply he knotted the ends of the silk cords around a wrist and tied them securely allowing just enough line to prevent his arm sinking below the surface the giant bronze man dropped into the quicksand as he had expected the stuff was very loose and liquid this accounted for the quick disappearance of the bushwhacker doc churned about he had no trouble sinking in the stuff the difficulties would come when he sought to extricate himself his feet soon found a yielding form he worked at this and got it clamped between his knees then came the laborious job of hoisting himself it was a terrific task even for docs matchless strength very slowly his rising was hardly perceptible to the eye he lifted himself and his prize great tendons which were normally part of the symmetrical mold of his arms stood out in tremendous fashion his arms might have been corded with steel bars perspiration rivulets wriggled down his bronze skin and mixed with water which covered the quicksand the sand made unlovely bubbling noises docs men waited on the bank above monk had to be restrained from wading out into the quicksand with the idea that he might be of some assistance at last doc lifted the bushwhacker free of the quicksand he carried the fellow out and laid him on the bank the mans handkerchief mask was gone now it was caldwell the slayer of carl macbride a knife hilt stood out from his chest in a dazed fashion the gaunt johnny fumbled with his monocle magnifier the knife this fellow was murdered he gasped is he the same man who fired upon us the same doc replied werent there any other tracks around instead of replying doc stood erect and ran across the log which spanned the quicksand he entered the thick bushes on the opposite bank there he found the explanation of the knife in caidwells heart tracks there was the print of a large foot encased in pactype shoes the maker of the print had stood for some time doc followed the pac trail of caldwells killer it was a short procedure a hundred yards to the right the quicksand brook joined a larger stream the murderer had entered a canoe doc worked up the stream then down he studied the fish for the water was clear trying to ascertain in which direction the finny denizens had been frightened to cover by the passage of the canoe it was not this but the absence of turtles from logs that gave him his clew the killer had gone downstream doc set out in that direction a low poppoppop came from ahead an outboard motor ten minutes later doc gave it up he could not hope to overhaul a canoe fitted with an outboard he rejoined his men they had the contents of caldwells pockets spread out on the grass these consisted of a penknife cartridges for a rifle a case of cigarettes and a sheet of yellow paper which had evidently been torn from a grocery wrapper three words were written on the paper the death mill what in blazes do you reckon that means monk demanded they left the body of caldwell where it lay as a death shroud monk and ham contributed what the brier thicket had left of their coats it did not take them long to reach trapper lake not such a hotlookin town monk decided changing the subject impolitely ham pondered aloud but why was caldwell murdered probably because we knew his identity doc replied but he was masked when he shot at us we saw his face when he killed carl macbride in new york doc reminded that made him a liability to his gang he was a definite individual for whom we could hunt wonder if pere teston killed hi pale long tom muttered thoughtfully doc did not reply they worked their way through the business section of trapper lake this was spread along a single street doc entered a general store in slightly over a minute he was outside again you fellows wait here he directed ham waved his sword cane but what he withheld the rest doc savage had already vaulted a wooden fence and set out across lots in the general store doc had asked about a spot called the death mill this place it seemed was an old grist mill on the outskirts of town the ominous place had been deserted for years it seemed ever since the former owner had been caught in the grinding stone and crushed to death hence the name the death mill doc sighted the dilapidated structure mischievous boys had knocked planks off the walls the roof had shed shingles as if it had the mange doc took to roadside brush as he drew near he circled the mill warily for he could hear sounds from within nervous pacing a man came to the ramshackle door and stood looking out it was fat griswold rock who had vowed he was on his way to europe when doc had last seen him chapter rennys mystery mission doc savage bobbed into view for a fat man griswold rock moved suddenly he jumped at least a foot in the air he leaped backward and his head due to his own clumsiness banged the ancient door jamb he sank to his knees half stunned he began to tremble the trembling was an interesting phenomenon for it made all of his fatty bulges seem to be tilled with kicking frogs it was almost a minute before he controlled himself im so ggglad youve come he stuttered docs bronze features exhibited no change of expression your tttelegram ssaid youd be here abbout this ttime continued griswold rock still stuttering telegram the one you sent me in new york i got it just as i was ready to leave for europe i sent you no telegram griswold rock had gotten to his feet at the words his knees buckled as if the tendons had been cut in his distress his fingers seemed to wriggle separately like fat living strings the ttelegram ttold me to come here and wwait he wailed it was ssigned with your name do you think it was a ttrap to rnmurder me instead of answering doc savage roved his gaze over the surroundings the weeds were very tall the brush rank vines entwined to make a labyrinth somewhat scrawnylooking walnut trees thrust above the whole it was a macabre place suggesting rattling chains and ghostly cries there are no tenanted dwellings near by doc reminded griswold rock tied his hands into a fatty lump they decoyed me here maybe they planned to seize me again worse still they might have intended to kill me doc savage entered the abandoned mill and moved through its moldy rooms he even examined the cracked longdisused grinding stones in which the former operator had met his death dust was thick that made it simple for the bronze mans trained eyes to ascertain that no one but griswold rock had visited the place recently where is the telegram which you received doc asked i took a room in the guides hotel explained griswold rock i left the wire there lets go have a look at it the backwoods nature of trapper lake was evident as they made their way through the streets wooden planks were evidently cheaper than concrete and most of the sidewalks were composed of this material the residents were robust friendly souls although doc savage and griswold rock were strangers they received pleasant greetings the guides hotel in addition to being the largest building in town was the newest it was entirely of frame construction the two men went directly to a room on the second floor griswold rock opened his suitcase oh my he wailed its gone somebodys taken the telegram doc savage left the room and descended the stairs he found the hotel proprietor have you noticed any one prowling around within the last few hours he asked within the last two hours amended griswold rock who had followed doc i just arrived here two hours ago i came most of the distance from new york by plane the guides hotel proprietor was a grizzled man with humor in his eyes sides you two he declared only one stranger has been in this here building today what did that one look like doc asked he was kinda tall middlin thin and had one of them there movie mustaches just looking at it made me kinda want to reach out and jerk it off did the fellow have freckles yes siree come to think of it he did caldwell said doc its his description griswold rock agreed pere teston is a wizened fellow and no one would ever forget his weird deadlooking face so it wasnt pere teston doc made no comment on this they were afraid the telegram would be evidence against them griswold rock continued after a brief interval caldwell came and got it i tell you im worried theyre after me and theyre clever caldwell will not bother you doc advised griswold rock looked surprised but he is one of the gang he is also dead with a few terse words doc described the demise of caldwell caldwell was stuck with a thrown knife as he reached the log doc finished he toppled to the quicksand the murderer escaped there was no clew to his identity what about the killers tracks they were made by extremely large pacs the size indicated the killer was wearing them over his shoes that sounds like pere teston griswold rock ejaculated he shuddered that shriveled fiend has small feet docs four men arrived at the hotel it was decided to make the hostelry their trapper lake headquarters doc savage inquired for a long distance telephone connection with new york city and learned there were no phone wires out of town doc set up his radio apparatus working through a station on long island which transposed his words from the ether to landline he got in contact with renny hows the excavating going forward he asked better than expected renny reported doubled the working crew this morning i located a hydraulicking outfit such as they use for gold mining in the west and were using powerful streams of water to wash the hill away did you check up on the finger prints found on the gate of griswold rocks estate monk and ham exchanged glances which for once were surprised instead of mutually insulting looks here was an angle upon which they had not known doc was working i checked the prints renny reported the classifications were broadcast to leading police departments renny paused at the other end to give an order to some one probably an associate in the excavating work heres a strange thing about the finger prints doc he continued they were all of men who have escaped from prisons within the last few months all from one particular prison doc asked no several different states one bunch got out of the jefferson city pen in missouri another broke out of the oklahoma hoosegow at mcalester all got outside aid in escaping this may be significant doc remarked heres something else that may be too renny reported the police have a record on caldwell his picture is in the rogues gallery he has served two prison terms for what crimes hes a crook who makes a specialty of getting other criminals out of jail he was caught doing this a couple of times thats how he happened to go to the hoosegow anything else doc asked nope the radio and landline consultation ended with that doc savage turned to his friends they eyed him expectantly it was docs custom to assign his associates work which fell in their respective lines monk doc said youll fix up chemical bombs make them strong enough to knock out an elephant use a gas which produces unconsciousness rather than fatality monk nodded the job was up his alley doc assigned work to ham the lawyer was to delve further into the records of the timberland line railroad m an effort to see what he could find if you wish you can assist ham in this matter doc told griswold rock the plump man trembled violently but nodded very well he groaned it seems i had best help you fellows greatly as i am frightened i will never feel at ease until this devil pere teston is brought to justice johnny the bony geologist whose learning naturally included an understanding of earthquakes and the seismographic method used to study them was to plant sensitive listening devices in the earth long tom the electrical wizard was to assist in this the idea is to trace the direction which the footsteps of these prowling monsters take doc explained the remainder of the afternoon was spent in following doc savages suggestions the homely monk possessed a remarkably compact portable chemical laboratory which he always took upon expeditions of this sort long tom the electrical wizard likewise carried an assortment of devices the two experts utilized their equipment to carry out docs suggestions doc savage spent some time working with devices which he himself had brought during this interval he secluded himself in a room of the guides hotel when the bronze man appeared some time later he was placing in a pocket objects which resembled ordinary gauge shotgun shells ham and griswold rock returned to the hotel near nightfall i talked to conductors on some of the timberland line passenger trains ham reported they gave me some interesting dope it seems that they have noted some very toughlooking passengers on their trains during recent months these fellows are obviously criminals all of them got off at trapper lake ham paused he could not resist an urge for dramatics these toughlooking fellows were always in the company of a certain man dont beat around the bush growled monk who was listening who was the guy caldwell griswold rock wrung his fat hands in fright i cannot understand this caldwell has been extricating criminals from prisons and bringing them to this vicinity why that was the mystery it was deepened somewhat by information which doc savage secured by radio later in the day a fresh crop of beware the monsters advertisements had appeared in newspapers all over the country these had been mailed from trapper lake doc consulted the trapper lake postmaster the latter was reluctant to speak at first but doc produced credentials signed by the highest of government officials the postmaster turned into a fountain of information yes he had noted a man mailing many letters to newspapers all over the united states yes he could describe the man he described caldwell monk having completed his chemical bombs did some prowling about town the homely chemist was an excellent mixer when he returned to the guides hotel he had some information caldwell seems to have pulled one of his jail deliveries right here in trapper lake he declared the local calaboose was broken into about a year ago a fellow called nubby bronson was taken out the man suspected of engineering the jail delivery answers the description of caldwell who was nubby bronson doc asked a local bad man monk explained the fellow had served several short prison terms for petty crimes was he in for a serious offense when the jail delivery took place thats the strange part he was serving thirty days for stealing traps the jailer said he seemed satisfied with his lot they were surprised when the break took place doc savage considered this for a time the inference is that nubby bronson did not want to get out of jail bad enough to hire his own delivery he queried at last thats the idea monk agreed griswold rock gestured astonishment with his fat hands but why should caldwell break into jail to free a man who did not particularly want to escape if doc knew the answer to that question he gave no indication of the fact he maintained silence the guides hotel they discovered set an excellent table strangely enough it was the thinnest man in the party skeletonlike johnny who was the heaviest consumer of food i wonder where the stuff he eats goes to pondered homely monk when johnny having eaten prodigiously arose from the table looking if anything thinner than before ham scowled at the pleasantly ugly chemist one doesnt have to wonder where your grub goes to its converted into hair later doc employed his radio transmitter to obtain a connection with new york city he sought to locate renny mr renwick left new york by plane about an hour ago reported one of the bigfisted engineers associates left the city that is correct why the excavators uncovered some object late this afternoon the man in new york explained what was it no one but mr renwick knows it was he who found the thing he ordered all work to cease and finished the digging personally he wrapped his discovery in canvas and carried it away i believe he took it with him in his plane in which direction did he head there was something said about northern michigan i believe doc savage broke the connection renny found something important he informed the others he is rushing it up here by plane then we should hear from him before morning monk declared chapter the terror that swam although there were no long distance telephone lines trapper lake itself boasted a local phone service rooms in the guides hotel were fitted with instruments it was slightly past midnight when the bell in docs room snarled the bronze man scooped up the receiver theyve attacked renny yelled a shrill voice who is this doc countered the voice was one he had never heard before the words sounded as if sawed out by a highpitched violin string renny is fighting a mob in a patch of woods about a mile north of town continued the shrill voice who are you renny says he must have been unlucky he landed right among the gang im calling from the edge of town are you going to identify yourself or not doc demanded grimly i live in a cabin close to where rennys having his fight said the informant excitedly he gave me fifty dollars to come and call you doc savage started to ask questions a click denoted the receiver had been deposited on the hook at the other end ham watch griswold rock doc ordered the fat railroad man had retired to his room but he now appeared in the door that is very kind of you he said earnestly i would be terrified if one of you gentlemen was not near by for protection long tom johnny doc asked have you got your seismograph devices all set sure homely monk had been listening a slow grin overspread his features as he saw that he was to accompany doc get your chemical bombs doc directed better leave the pig down the street doc and monk found trapper lake asleep street lamps they were electric bulbs which dangled from wires spanning the thoroughfares had been extinguished long ago a light burned in the depot of the timberland line railroad the town had only one cab finding it at this hour was out of the question doc and monk headed north running monk considering his short bowed legs was capable of surprising speed they were nearing the edge of town when sounds of shot came rapping to their ears rifles monk ejaculated the fight a bullfiddle of a moan suddenly drowned the other gun noises its renny monk howled that noise was made by one of our machine pistols a moment later monk found himself running alone the homely chemist had thought he was running fast but doc had left him behind so suddenly that it seemed to monk that he had turned around and traveled backward until this moment doc had been skeptical of the phone call it was the sort of thing by which a trap would be sprung but hearing the moan of the supermachine gun had alarmed him more than a little the weapons were not public property doc manufactured them himself the only ones in existence were those in possession of his men for some distance doc followed the rutty roadway this sloped downward and became more rugged the wilderness on either side more impenetrable more rifle shots sounded and the superfirer blared hoarsely the sounds came from the left doc veered over he was forced to go slowly for the darkness was intense he could hear monk come thumping up the homely chemist was trying for speed rather than quietness his approach was anything but silent from far down the road from a point which monk had passed a whistle shrilled it was a blaring whistle of the sort used by policemen doc savage jerked to a halt and listened monk he yelled duck under cover somewhere stay quiet the bronze mans great voice reached the homely chemist and halted him most convenient shelter was the ditch beside the road monk flopped into it he listened there was only the fluttering of leaves as they were moved by the night breeze monk jammed an ear to the ground borne by the earth came thudding noises which might have been gigantic footsteps the thumpings approached then there was loud breathing tremendous breathing such as they had heard the night before on the lake shore docs powerful voice crashed the gas bombs monk monk clawed at a pocket and brought out a gas mask of very compact construction merely a nose clip and a mouthpiece from the latter a tube led to a breathpurifier which was not as large as monks hand doc monk knew would be donning a similar mask the gorillalike chemist stood erect preparatory to hurling his gas bomb but he never threw it a rasping metallic voice thundered out in volume it was gigantic theyve got gas it said dont take chances beat it get griswold rock the metallic nature of the huge voice indicated it was issuing from a loudspeaker and it was the voice of the rednecked thug hack obeying the order the monster wheeled and charged off in the direction of town it was followed by another then a third and a fourth monks hair all but stood on end as he listened to the thunder of gargantuan footsteps but he was not too unnerved to whip out his flashlight and spray it after the monsters the things were beyond thick brush he saw nothing to give a clew to their nature over where doc savage was positioned there sounded a sharp report and powder flame spurted doc was shooting running monk joined doc he found the bronze man with an ordinary lgauge shotgunlike pistol as monk arrived doc again fired at the sound of the fleeing monsters the big bronze man was charging the weapon with the special cartridges which he had manufactured during the afternoon doc savage fired his oversize pistol twice more from where he stood then he ran to the road and sent more of his special bullets down it it was a trick to decoy us out of town he said grimly theyve gotten one of our machine guns somehow dyou reckon they got the weapon off renny monk asked uneasily doc did not answer this for it was not the bronze mans i habit to hazard guesses he headed in the direction of town running swiftly monk lumbering along behind they had covered scarcely a hundred yards when sudden scalding white light washed over them the beam came from some distance down the road doc slammed against monk together they spun into the ditch machinegun lead moaned and ripped along the road the volleying metal scooped clods and kicked dust into the ditch the mingled buzz of ricocheting slugs was like the droning of oversized bees this must be the guy who gave the command with the loudspeaker monk hazarded the homely chemist was tugging to get his superfiring machine pistol from its holster i was afraid this leadsprayer wouidnt stop the big babies he growled im sure gonna use it on this cookie though he reared up on his knees his gun howled and the light promptly went out got him monk exclaimed his usually small voice boisterous and gleeful he ran toward the machine gunner but he had not gotten the fellow that slight error would have cost him his life had doc not seized his leg and yanked him down as monk sprawled prone a fresh storm of machinegun slugs swept the road didnt you notice how steady the light was doc inquired the fellow laid it on something while the machinegun slugs were gnashing at the opposite side of the road doc savage lifted for a quick look he could not detect the muzzle flame of the weapon the gun must have a flamedigester on the muzzle he said otherwise we could spot it the bronze man quitted the roadside ditch working to the right he reached a mass of vegetation he worked through this with a quietness little short of uncanny in developing his ability to move silently doc savage had studied the ways of the masters of stealththe hunting carnivora of the jungles he listened hoping tolocate his foe but it was another sound which caught his attention shrieks excited cries shots the crashing of timber and the squall of a fire siren the uproar came from the direction of trapper lake the monsters had fallen upon the town chapter the monsters raid the machine gunner menacing doc savage could be heard running he was making in the direction of trapper lake doc plunged in pursuit the fleeing gunner turned off the road there came a squeak of automobile springs the metallic clank of a slamming door an engine moaned and headlights came on the car dived into the road and scooted away doc savage sprinted given a break he might have overhauled the machine before it gathered too much speed but the driver suddenly sprayed machinegun bullets over his back trail on the random chance that he might score a hit in addition monk started shooting from down the road to avoid being caught in the cross fire doc savage was forced to retreat the cars headlights were lost in the windings of the road monk came lumbering up blast it he growled if there had been some kind of a target to shoot at id have bagged him falling silent the homely chemist listened to the uproar from trapper lake women were screaming now pistols whacked shotguns made cannonlike bangings men howled and cursed wood splintered and large things upset with jangling noises doc and monk headed toward town after a time they were conscious that from the sky beginning in the infinite distance and growing louder had come a drone a plane monk ejaculated thatll be rennyk doc savage drew his flashlight and pointed it at the plane sound his thumb tapped the button and the lens spouted long and short bursts of light the telegraphic code a flashlight eye blinked answer from the plane its renny monk grunted he seems to be flying the gyro with his light doc directed renny to land on the road well tackle this mess in trapper lake from the air he advised monk the windmill ship spun down and hovered overhead hood lamps under the wings spread a glare which illuminated the road then it landed renny thrust his somber features into view he cut the exhaust into the muffler cans and the motor became silent enough to permit conversation got any flares doc cabled to him nope renny rumbled i unloaded all extra equipment to lighten this crate so itd fly faster doc and monk piled into the gyro cabin the ship while not large would lift doc and his five men doc took the controls you just got in he demanded as he guided the gyro into the air just got here renny agreed was a supermachine gun stolen from you in new york doc asked yeah howd you guess it renny boomed surprise in his great voice i left the thing in the car while i was supervising the excavating some one lifted it they were watching you monk ejaculated whoever stole the gun probably came on by plane what did the digging in new york yield doc asked the dangedest thing renny rumbled ill show it to you now the bigfisted engineer twisted and dropped an enormous hand to a canvasswathed package reposing on the floorboards in the rear of the cabin of the plane he began unwrapping it huh monk muttered the darn thing whatever it is is almost as big as a suitcase get ready to have your hair stand on end renny boomed he flung back the last thickness of canvas monk stared his small eyes all but jumped from their gristlewalled pits his oversize mouth opened as much as was possible wheew he exclaimed up until that moment renny had possessed the biggest hand monk had ever seen rennys paws were tremendous yet compared to this monster hand which had been swathed in canvas rennys was as the hand of a baby alongside that of a man it was natural in shape but unearthly in its hugeness renny himself whistled in awe as he once more looked at it holy cow he boomed the guy who owned that must have weighed a ton the bronze countenance of doc savage exhibited no marked change as he inspected the titanic relic it was as if he had expected something of the sort is this the only part of the monster you uncovered he asked no renny said the rest of the body was there the fragments of it that is the thing was instantly killed in the explosion for the love of mud monks tiny voice was wisplike so this hand belonged to the baby who reared up through the floor of griswold rocks house doc savage dropped the gyro down toward trapper lake their discussion and rennys exhibition of the colossal hand had taken only a moment at two or three points in trapper lake houses were buning these scattered flickering red light over the rest of the town the crimsonswathed scene was starkly fantastic the giants they were monster men had already raided the guides hotel they were now retreating skulking among the houses they were like hideous men in a toy town holy cowl renny boomed any one of em would make two ordinary men the big babies are wearin armor monk breathed monk had hardly spoken when they were witness to a potent demonstration of the effectiveness of the shiny steel plates which banded the giants chests heads and legs even their feet a trapper lake citizen leaped out of his cabin he held a rifle taking deliberate aim he fired the bullet merely tilted a helmet over on the ear of a giant this particular giant was a big black fellow his head judging from the shape of his helmet came to a conelike point instead of being rounded remember the three pinhead savages from the circus monk yelled that must be one of them after adjusting his helmet the pinhead giant charged the woodsman who had fired the rifleman ducked into his cabin ran through it popped out of the front door and scuttled into the concealment of high weed the pinhead thought the rifle wielder was still in the cabin the black monster lowered his head and lumbered inside a few moments later he apparently became tired of moving about the interior a wall burst open and his tremendous shoulders and head appeared he wrenched his arms free he tore thin clapboard siding boards out bodily and threw them away finally he extricated himself from the ruined house theyre tremendously strong even for their size monk breathed dumb too or he wouldnt waste his strength bustin out through a wall like thatt the pinhead followed his fellow giants out of town doc savage tooled the gyro after the monster men he kept fairly high and switched on the brilliant landing lights these illuminated the giants the monsters were running down the road which led to the lake shore doc savage advanced the gyro accelerator the ship did not have a conventional propeller its speed was regulated by the inclination of rudderlike vanes affixed to the tips of the rotating wings advancing the accelerator set these vanes to digging into the air at a greater angle doc had discovered that the giants were following a car the top of the machine bore a cluster of four large loudspeakers thats the guy who tried for us with the machine gun monk declared doc sent the windmill plane toward the fleeing car they were close to it when a man stuck his head out of the rear door it was griswold rock the fat man flailed about with his pudgy fists he drove fierce blows back into the car at a target which could not be seen he made imploring gestures with his arms as if pleading for help then was yanked back out of sight into the car a man swung out clinging to the running board of the automobile he held an aircrafttype machine gun harnessed to a belt about his waist with one hand he elevated the weapon its muzzle flamed red fire the bullet stream a reddish thread of tracer missed the gyro by fully a hundred feet then sought the target in wild sweeps the bouncing car was not a foundation conductive to marksmanship ill fix that cookie monk gritted and leaned out with his superfirer monks gun hooted and the man on the car sagged monk was a remarkable shot when he could see his target mercy bullets from his rapidfirer had stricken the gunner with instant unconsciousness hands inside the car caught the senseless man however and hauled him inside now if i can pot the driver through the top of the machine monk chortled he never had a chance to try this doc suddenly whipped the gyro away from the spot hey monk yelled we may be able to bag doc merely pointed at the fuel gauge i made it here nonstop from new york renny groaned fuel is about gone wed best get far enough away that the giants wont see us when we make a landing doc offered the engine died fuel gone as the bronze man was bringing the ship down some miles to the north he had picked a spot near the lake shore what a break monk groaned chapter the winged peril doc savage had selected an emergency landing spot near the lake shore for a specific purpose he dug binoculars out of the cockpit duffle pocket then quitted the windmill plane he ran for the beach here as along most of this wilderness shore there was timber doc sought a large tree he did not use his flashlight but felt about ill the black night with his hands finding a towering pine he mounted monk and renny puzzled clambered up after him the monsters from the direction they had taken should have reached the lake shore perhaps two miles away to the westward doc focused his binoculars in that direction whats the idea renny asked doc passed the binoculars to him take a look renny did so in the jet night he could not see the giants but he did discern tiny spots which glowed with all un earthly purple luminance say whats them light patches he demanded a chemical compound akin to phosphorus doc explained the stuff begins to glow after it is exposed to the air half an hour or so monk astride a limb below emitted a knowing snow the dope was in the shotgun slugs you plugged at the giants it was doc admitted the bronze man fell to watching the luminous spots which marked the position of the monsters the glowing patches moved out into the lake and became stationary the great loudspeaker voice of hack thundering out carried over the two miles with surprising volume bring the speed boats hack called a moment later in answer to the rednecked mans behest marine engines sputtered into life boats had been waiting out in the take they sped for the shore three of them monk decided after counting the craft the giants went aboard the speed boats and the craft headed out into the lake the glowing spots on the giants seemed to grow larger although the monsters were being carried away theyre trying to rub the shiny stuff off renny thumped their efforts just spread the dope doc savage got careful bearings on the direction taken by the launch distance finally swallowed the glowing smears on the giants doc and his two men moved down the lake shore to the point where the boats had been boarded they found the car with the loudspeaker equipment it was parked near the shore deserted later doc traced the license number of the vehicle the machine had been purchased in detroit a few weeks before by a man giving his name as pere teston but who answered the description of the slain caldwell on its side the car bore the advertising of a political party which was now campaigning it developed that the car had no connection with the political organization however they put the sign on it so the loudspeaker wouldnt attract suspicion decided bigfisted renny the men returned to trapper lake the town was m an uproar women still screamed sobbed and had hysterics men galloped about wildeyed their persons bristling with weapons almost every one was barefooted having been routed out of bed a number of old fashioned male nightgowns were to be seen the house into which the pinhead monster had crawled was a wreck a number of fences had been torn down gardens were trampled the door of the guides hotel had been demolished shapeless tracks of the big armored feet were thick one of the infernal giants just butted the door down and climbed in reported the dapper ham he indicated the hotel door with his sword cane i made a pass at the brute then retreat looked good so i jumped from the handiest window they came after griswold rock declared long tom doc and his men scattered and devoted themselves to attending to the injured the giants had seized four trapper lake men in the course of their raid using only their leviathan hands they had crushed every vestige of life from these victims the bones of the unfortunates had been broken limbs wrenched from their bodies their skulls crushed i saw one of the men get killed wailed a trapper lake citizen a giant just picked him up took his head in both hands and mashed it like you and me would bust an egg having stayed awake the rest of the night trapper lake looked around in the morning and saw something like fifty newspaper men while there were no long distance telephone lines out of town telegraph wires paralleled the timberland line railroad and wires had conveyed news to the outside world of the visit of the giants the press took fire almost half the passengers on the next train were newspaper reporters and the other half newspaper cameramen more correspondents came by plane a blimp flew up from detroit carrying the reporters and cameramen of a tabloid newspaper it dawned on newspapers in every large city in the united states that here was the explanation of the strange beware the monsters advertisements which they had been publishing a trimotored speed plane came in with the sound cameras of a newsreel concern two enterprising journalists brought their own radio stations and operators before noon trapper lake stood on the front pages of every newspaper in the country m twoinch black type or larger pictures were telephoned maps were drawn with x marking the spot where trapper lake stood some enterprising city editors unable to get pictures had their artists draw giants exaggerated stories were flying around so the artists drew their giants tossing houses around the giants grew in size with every repetition of the tale trapper lake had its share of tall story tellers and these fellows outdid themselves the giants became bigger and bigger word got out that doc savage was on the scene a wild rush to interview the bronze man ensued a new york newspaper wired its reporter promising him a years vacation in europe all expenses paid if he could get a firstperson story from doc the reporter hunted like a wild man but failed to earn the year in europe doc savage being possessed of a hearty disapproval of seeing his name in public print had withdrawn to the seclusion of a clearing some miles from town here he and his men discussed and consulted with each other they had done some sleuthing before the newspaper locust swarm had arrived i checked on the finger prints of the giants hand which renny dug up long tom said he mopped perspiration off his pale brow you remember that bird nubby bronson who was taken from the trapper lake jail sure monk grunted the finger prints of that big hand and nubby bronsons prints were the same in design well im a sonofagun cried bony johnny they grabbed nubby bronson out of jail and made him into a giant ham his sword cane tucked under an arm came up he had been working with the portable radio ive broadcast a description of those giants as you directed he told doc they answer the description of the criminals whom caldwell got out of jails all over the country we know now why caldwell was collecting them said monk he was gathering them for pere teston to make into giants with that monk scratched the winglike ears of his pig habeas corpus the dapper ham scowled at the pleasantly ugly chemist and his equally homely pet the pattern must have been mislaid the day you two were made he snorted monk sighed as if he had stood about as many jibes as he could bear the pig habeas corpus was looking intently at ham as if he resented the dapper lawyers words the pig opened his mouth the thing which happened then always drove ham into a screaming rage the pig seemed to speak distinct words im gettin dang tired of the stuff this funnyfaced lawyer calls humor ham purpled very indignantly he gripped his sword cane dramatics sneered the voice from the pig aint he a funnylookin snipe in them rags ham was particularly touchy on the subject of his clothing he still wore the garb which had been ruined in the bramble thicket although it was far from his liking he slashed suddenly with his sword cane monk dodged wildly to get clear monk had learned ventriloquism solely for the purpose of having habeas corpus express scathing opinions of ham the business of the talking pig although ridiculous to watch invariably filled ham with rage the conversation reverted to the giants but for what purpose did pere teston make the big fellows renny pondered the world got the answer to that question that afternoon to the mayors of four great cities the mail brought letters the cities were detroit cleveland new york arid chicago the letters bore trapper lake postmarks they had been mailed during the visit of the giants the four mayors had read the newspapers so they knew what had happened in trapper lake they could not fail to know it the news was in scareheads all over the front pages the four mayors opened the letters with curiosity all four got the shock of their lives the detroit mayor received his missive first it read your honor have you read the monster advertisements in the newspapers recently those were part of my campaign possibly you have read of the episode at trapper lake last night if not i advise you to do so my giants visited trapper lake for a reason other than the seizure of griswold rock although the latter was necessary i wanted the world particularly detroit cleveland new york chicago to realize the power of my giants you will consult with leading bankers of your city advising them to assemble five million dollars the sum is to be in small unmarked bills tomorrow you will receive a letter of instruction about getting the money into my hands that letter has been posted if my terms are not complied with my giants will visit your city they will not be in a pleasant mood they will kill people and wreak incalculable damage one giant will be designated to hunt you out personally you may think machine guns and gas will be effective against my giants do not be fooled they wear bulletproof armor and they have special gas masks i trust you will not make the mistake of thinking this is a cranks letter pere teston after reading that the detroit mayor tilted back in his chair and had a good laugh then he sent out for the late newspapers and reread the trapper lake story when he finished he was not laughing the story had made detailed reference to the crushed condition of the trapper lake victims the mayor called several leading bank presidents and showed them the letter what is the police force for asked the bankers so the mayor called the police chief and the chief in turn had his men oil their machine guns and break out fresh gas bombs radio squad cars were set to prowling roads around the city police boats covered the lake front in cleveland new york and chicago the reaction was about the same except that in new york city naval destroyers quietly took up positions around manhattan island they knew doc savages reputation in new york knew his name had been in the past associated with the combating of perils before which police departments were helpless if doc savage was involved in the matter of the giants the thing was no laughing affair newspapers ate up this newest development sheets that had red ink ran it in their biggest headlines here was the newspaper story of the year pere teston was investigated and the facts unearthed added to the general excitement it was found that pere teston was a man who had dabbled in chemical experiments since childhood but he had not made chemistry his profession it had been a hobby pere teston railroad men who had known him revealed had for years maintained that it was possible to develop compounds to increase the size of living beings the friends had laughed they thought this was just another crazy idea that day several of pere testons former acquaintances collected large sums of money for telling their story to the newspapermen pere teston these men declared had talked much of developing giant cows who would give great quantities of milk he had spoken of huge draft horses which would be a boon to the farmer no one could recall his having spoken of an army of giant men to terrorize the world probably he thought of that later said one man who had known pere teston when did he disappear asked a reporter a year or two ago maybe was the reply the truth was that no one seemed to be just certain when pere teston had dropped from sight before nightfall almost five hundred more planes were enroute for trapper lake bearing correspondents and photographers before nightfall too doc savage and his men took off on a prowl of their own doc entertained an idea everything points to these giants having their headquarters somewhere in the lake he pointed out their food supplies brought in on the timberland line were transferred to barges on the lake but where can their hangout be pondered bigfisted renny we got a line on their retreat last night doc said the gyro fuel tanks were filled to the sloshover point with fuel smuggled out of trapper lake they headed out into the lake half an hours flying put them over an island it was covered with brush and rock and certainly harbored no giants doc continued onward the previous night had been cloudy extremely dark this one promised to be gloriously moonlit they flew high dropping down when they sighted islands an hour passed another the fuel was holding out well the gyro thanks to its hovering ability enabled them to scrutinize closely such islands as they viewed a half dozen specks of rock and soil they sighted without discerning a sign of the giants another and somewhat larger island appeared ham eyed his watch ten oclock and alls well he stated he was wrong up from the isle ahead a plane came boring when it was still some three hundred yards away machinegun muzzles flamed like tiny red eyes from its cowl tracer bullets climbing past docs gyro might have been red sparks the attacking ship was a lowwing bus very fast thats the crate in which caldwell and his gang hopped from new york long tom yelled doc climbed the gyro jockeying to one side then the other avoiding the machinegun slugs as the attacking ship slid past doc heaved the gyro over on its side and flicked the landinglight switch the illumination disclosed a face in the control cockpit of the other plane it was the steelhaired girl the exlion tamer jean morris chapter the swimming giants like a thing frightened by the glare of the landing lights the other plane scudded away it banked and came back again the cowlmounted rapidfirers opened red eyes doc savage hung the gyro motionless in the night sky and watched the thread of tracer bullets warily prepared to maneuver the gyro clear if it came too close the sight of the steelhaired girl in the other plane had kept doc from driving bullets into the engine of the enemy ship while the pilot was blinded by the floodlight the hussy monk complained whod have thought this of her you were making calf eyes at her in new york ham snorted monk grinned sheepishly id probably do it again too shes a looker the tracer bullets drew too near doc dropped the gyro straight down the move was so abrupt that the men grabbed at their chairs tracers ran strings of phosphorus fire through the space they had vacated what are we gonna do about this monk pondered doc sank the gyro rapidly the other ship followed them down in a tight spiral doc flattened some fifty feet above the lake surface advancing the accelerator he streaked along above the lake it looked as if he had generously helped himself to suicide for the other plane swooped down upon their tail its two cowl guns lipping flame the lake surface was fairly calm and the small geysers knocked up by the bullets were visible ahead of docs windmill the tracers as they ricocheted seemed to be sparks bouncing from the water doc waltzed the gyro right then left the other ship attempting to follow these maneuvers with its sight rings merely succeeded in firing wide of the target renny used his enormous hands to mop perspiration off his forehead he knew the danger they were in even docs consummate skill could not avoid the pursuing bullets for long abruptly for no visible reason the plane behind gave up the attack it wobbled off to one side careening in the sky the pilot seemed to control his craft with the greatest difficulty trying to fishtail to reduce speed the ship nearly went into a spin then it sought to land bet the gal dont know what happened to hen monk howled gleefully if the steelhaired girl was mystified she was not the only one the dapper ham was also puzzled what did happen monk slapped his bulging chest with a furry fist give me credit for that i didnt see you do anything ham sneered doc turned the stuff loose of course monk admitted but i mixed it before we took the air its gas the stuff is in a tank in the back of the bus doc simply pulled a valve cord and released some of it in the moonlight our steelhaired lady friend didnt notice it ham glanced at the other ship you can have the credit huh the gas doesnt seem to have worked to their astonishment they saw that the other craft had straightened out and was climbing into the air the glass enclosed cabin of the crate doc said just enough of the gas got in to cause temporary dizzinesst the bronze man hurled the gyro toward the other ship his metallic features were expressionless he reached a corded hand back into the cabin your rapidfirer he requested of long tom the slender unhealthylooking electrical wizard passed over his compact little supermachine pistol every third slug in the ammo drum is a tracer he vouchsafed the other ship instead of turning back to give battle was flying a straight course not far above the water givin her head a chance to clear renny boomed conversation was possible inside the gyro because of the unusual efficiency of the silencer on the engine the rotating wings had also been designed to create a minimum of windwhistle doc savage drove after the other ship it was flying slowly he overhauled it rapidly this is gonna be simple after all monk said optimistically the fight had drifted through the sky until they were now hardly more than a mile from the island which they had intended to investigate the isle seemed to be nothing more than an expanse of rock spotted here and there with stunted windtwisted trees there were many large boulders on it doc savage opened the cabin window air rushed in together with the loud hiss of the silenced motor he aimed with his machine pistol but before he could fire a tiny rip appeared in the fuselage of the other plane this had apparently been made by a knife or an ax the muzzle of a machine gun poked through the opening its snout slavering flame the shooting was more accurate than previously clattering gnashing lead chopped at the underside of the gyro long rips opened in the fuselage monks pig habeas squealed in alarm doc juggled the controls with a dazzling speed to get away from the deadly leaden hail eating at the fuselage he succeeded then the lead storm found them again this time the slugs snapped in the region of the gas tank they chattered with an appalling noise again doc maneuvered clear holy cowl renny thundered that last burst opened the fuel tank an instant later colorless gasoline washed over the floorboards it reeked in the cabin the other pilot had been more fortunate than he knew the fuel tank of the gyro was coated thickly with a fireproofing and extinguishing compound it was practically impossible for it to be fired by incendiary bullets a burst must have struck opening a leak through the spongy protective coating a stark grimness had settled on the faces of docs men the sky brawl had progressed to a point where chivalry had somewhat lost its appeal the gyro flung in alongside the enemy ship they made a discovery which was nothing if not interesting hey monk howled the girl aint flying that bus the steelhaired girl was lashed in one of the bucket seats in the pilots cockpit they could see that now because she was pitching about madly and apparently was on the point of freeing herself i knew she was all right monk chortled the actual pilot of the other plane was a squat fellow in a tan blazer due to the shadows inside the plane they could not tell much about him he ducked out of sight and flew blind whenever he was close to us monk decided his usually small voice a great yell thats why we couldnt see him the other pilot discovered that the girl had loosened her bindings he flung himself toward her using the machine gun he clubbed at the girl the young woman threw herself from under the descending weapon then clutched its fluted barrel with both hands pitching about in the fight that followed one or the other disturbed the controls the plane reeled over on a wing tip motor bawling the squat pilot saw his danger he released the steel haired girl wildly he battled the controls but there was insufficient time the girl took one look at the water then covered her head with her hands to break the force of the crash a wing tip knifed the water first the wing crumpled the plane hit the water and jumped end over end the other wing left the fuselage as if sliced off by an invisible razor the battered hulk wallowed a few yards and came to a stop it began to sink doc savage drove the gyro toward the wreck the windmill plane could land with equal facility on earth or water doc however did not intend to land he hovered over the wrecked and sinking plane the water some ten feet below he turned the controls over to bigfisted renny see what you can do about that gasoline leak he directed then headfirst he pitched overboard doc struck the water cleanly with a minimum of splash his powerful frame curved expertly an instant after the moment of impact and the result was a perfect shallow dive he seemed scarcely to wet his back doc stroked to the wreck a hole gaped in the fuselage he grasped the edge of this hauled himself up and glanced into the cabin the body of the pilot was being tumbled about by the water that poured into the cabin there was a crease nearly three inches deep across the top of his skull where he had smashed against a strut a few feet from the dead flier the steelhaired girl paddled feebly she was dazed but seemed otherwise not seriously damaged doc savage reached into the sinking plane and hauled the girl out he was none too soon for the stricken craft weighted by its engine sank the whirl drew doc and his burden beneath the surface powerful stroking on the bronze mans part brought them up again bubbles the size of water buckets arose from the sinking plane and bursting made plopping noises doc glanced upward then around the gyro was on the lake surface it had settled there during the momentary space when the bronze man was under water youll sink doc shouted warningly those bullets all but tore the bottom out of the fuselage the gas is gone leaked out renny boomed we couldnt plug that hole it was in an inaccessible position the men in the gyro were bringing out collapsible canvas boats they tossed these into the water then flung articles of equipment into the little shells the gyro settled rocking a little docs men voiced no more words the business of transferring their paraphernalia to the boats was too urgent monk moved habeas corpus from the stricken plane they completed the shift with only fragments of seconds to spare and clambered hastily into the folding boats barely escaping from under the great wings of the gyro as it went down doc savage paddled to the nearest folding boat he lifted the steelhaired girl in then careful not to upset the shell clambered aboard himself the steelhaired girl recovered now stared at doc in the moonlight she spoke and her voice was calm for all of the ripping excitement of the last few minutes they tied me in the cockpit she said they wanted you to think i was your attacker we guessed that monk put in anxious to get the favor of the entrancing young woman doc seemed about to ask the steelhaired girl questions but withheld them he leveled an arm our trouble seems to be just starting the pig habeas reared up from his position near monks feet he looked toward the island his tremendous ears shot straight in the air he emitted a procession of staccato excited grunts then he ducked below the gunwales of the boat as if to shut out the sight in the direction of the island three gigantic human heads projected above the lake surface huge black arms appeared and disappeared in measured swimming stroke theyre coming after us the girl shrilled clipped to the light metal frame of the collapsible boats were telescoping oars the men hastily freed these and began to paddle one consolation said bony johnny is that those freaks cant swim as fast as we can row they paddled briskly all six were men of more than average muscular development the steelhaired girl insisting on wielding a paddle exhibited strength somewhat beyond the ordinary the swimming pinhead giants dropped farther back theyre not wearing their armor ham remarked if they come close well see how bullets affect em without interrupting his paddling doc addressed the steel haired girl me gang wanted you to teach them the pinhead ianguage so they could issue commands to those three black fellows didnt they she nodded yes they made me repeat numerous commands until they understood how to issue them i found out why they were so anxious to be able to give them orders it seems that the blacks hated bruno hen he had done them some injury one night they escaped and murdered him they wouldnt have done this had their chief ordered them not to do so why was the giant murdered in the new york mine tunnel doc questioned or did you hear of it i heard said the girl that particular giant had been stubborn about taking orders from pere teston they were afraid of him pere teston doc asked sharply he is the chief the girl explained i did not see him but his name was mentioned numerous times what about griswold rock hes on the island somewhere i didnt see him monk put in what i fail to understand is why they seized griswold rock the second time i dont know why they grabbed him the girl replied do you know any of their plans doc asked only that pere teston intends to send his giants against detroit tomorrow night to their ears came the mutter of a motor boat it was a fast craft it appeared a moment later scudding around the end of the island it veered to one side in order to keep clear of any bullets they might launch and circled to get ahead of them holy cow renny groaned that thing is making sixty an hour at least the motor boat was soon ahead a tripod mounted on its bow cowling supported a machine gun this went into action sending a ribbon of lead across the lake surface docs men tried returning the fire with their small supermachine pistols the range of the other weapon however was too great they were driven to back water their own bullets falling short the swimming pinheads speedily overhauled them chapter the awful isle renny with his huge rocklike hands was the most skilled marksman of the party excepting only doc he lifted his supermachine gun and fired the bullets traced a foamy line across the water a line that sought and found one of the swimming pinheads the giant made a great gobbling sound of anger and dived beneath the surface he came up some yards nearer from the speed boat came a tremendous voice words launched by a loudspeaker of the highpowered type sometimes mounted on the under side of airplanes used ill delivering advertising talks from the sky it was the voice of rednecked hack everybody come out here and help hack called answering the summons more giants appeared on the island they might have been hideous genii conjured by the rubbing of a magic lamp for they sprang up from what had seemed a bleak boulderstrewn hump of rock amid a great splashing they swam to aid the three black gigantic pinhe ads its only a question of time till they nail us renny said glumly the speed boat darted toward their little collapsible shells and its machine gun tossed salvos of sound over the lake surface the bullets were carefully aimed they herded doc and his party toward the swimming monsters long tom on his knees in one of the little shells opened a light metal case in this were racked objects which resembled metal cannisters holding movie film these were ammo drums for the supermachine pistols some of these are explosive bullets the electrical wizard announced the others had known this doc carried all types of cartridges mercy slugs tracers incendiary bullets armor piercers and explosives renny clipped a drum of explosive ammo into his weapon he aimed carefully after latching his gun into singlefire position and fired once there was a flash a loud report and the giant who was rennys target bawled loudly the explosive slug had opened a gaping pit in his shoulder hacks coarse voice came from the loudspeaker on the speed boat dont kill the bronze man or any of those with him it commanded then the floridnecked hack repeated the command in the hooting gobbling dialect of the pinheads docs men swapped glances in the moonlight their features held blank surprise didja hear that monk exclaimed apparently they dont want to kill us it may be a trick to get us to surrender the girl said wildly doc savage selected a container of equipment and opened it he removed several of the compact devices called lungs by divers these consisted of clips to close the nostrils and mouthpieces the latter with attached hoses which led to chemical breath purifiers doc and the others donned these lungs the bronze man himself showed the steelhaired girl how the contrivance functioned the pig habeas corpus watched these preparations with a beadyeyed intentness his nearhuman intelligence was exhibited when he began squealing plaintively blast it monk groaned were gonna have to let im take care of himself can he swim ham asked the dapper lawyer sounded anxious considering the desire he had expressed on innumerable occasions to slaughter habeas his present concern was surprising hes a swell swimmer monk grunted the homely chemist lifted habeas by the scruff of the neck and pointed at the island well meet you there buddy he said optimistically the pig plunged overboard and began swimming for the rocky protuberance doc and the others slid into the water each carried a ease of equipment these serving as weights they sank beneath the surface doc switched on his flashlight when he touched the lake bottom the flash was waterproof the others gathered about the light as soon as they were together they linked hands in a living chain doc switched off the light he did not want the giants swimming above to spot the glow they moved along the lake bottom toward the island doc savage wore upon his right wrist a small highly accurate watch this was made entirely of nonmagnetic metal and slung on a jeweled bearing between the crystal and the hands was a compass needle this was luminous and since the watch case was waterproof it could be used under water the water pressure was not especially disagreeable the depth being scarcely more than twenty feet moonlight made a faint silvery haze overhead waves suffused this with undulating shadows on the bottom where they walked it was very dark that water transmits sound more effectively than the air was demonstrated by the distinctness with which they could hear the slopping noises the swimming giants were making distinct also was the throb of the speed boats motor this latter sound drew closer unexpectedly there came a terrific concussion invisible fingers seemed to ram into the ears of doc and his aids and press against the drums until the agony was intolerable their bodies felt the shock a distinct impact from head to foot doc savage knew what had happened their enemies had explosives in the speed boat they were dropping the stuff into the lake the first explosion terrifying as were its effects had occurred some distance away other detonations occurring nearer would bring crushing death doc savage dropped the case of apparatus which he was using for weight and stroked to the surface his five men and the girl followed tough he said grimly when they were all afloat but to stay down there would have been suicide mouthing tremendous sounds the giants converged upon their quarry the manner of the monsters was ferocious they seemed possessed of a killer lust the huge loudspeaker on the speed boat blasted metallic words do not harm them hack thundered well hold em until we hear from the chief lowvoiced doc addressed his five aids and the girl take it easy we havent a chance they really mean that stuff about not harming us a moment later one of the swimming giants reached doc savage the monster chanced to be one of the pinheads doc savage who towered in stature when beside ordinary mortals was dwarfed by the grotesque proportions of the pinhead a monster hand clamped upon docs arm desirous of ascertaining what strength the giants possessed doc struggled the result was astounding for all of his fabulous muscular ability he might have been a child opposing a mature man not wishing to anger the pinhead monstrosity unnecessarily doc permitted himself to be towed shoreward the girl monk ham and the others were captured in like fashion and dragged toward the island habeas corpus had circled wide of the giants in swimming toward the island a tiny funnel of wake barely distinguishable in the moonlight marked his position he reached shore and disappeared among the rocks much to monks relief the stony isle when they reached it furnished a surprise its height had been deceptive in the moonlight as had its formation viewed from above it had seemed covered with boulders the largest of these huge rocks thrust up from the water near shore closer inspection developed that the protuberances were in many cases camouflaged buildings in landing the prisoners were towed close enough to these to observe details of their construction metal girders composed the framework over these were stretched stoutwoven wires the netting of which formed foundations for a canvas covering cleverly painted and veined to resemble stone the structures were unexpectedly large each held a plane these craft were large trimotored amphibians a light was turned on in one hangar permitting a man to resume work tuning a plane motor this job must have been interrupted by the approach of docs gyro thanks to the light and the fact that the cabin door of one of the planes was open docs party got a glimpse of the ships interior wicker seats usually a fitting of a planes cabin were missing seats taken out monk muttered holy cow renny rumbled these planes are equipped to carry the giants monk surveyed their gigantic captors as if calculating the weight of the fellows he nodded his bullet of a head as if satisfied yep he said smallvoiced theyre too big for the seats so the seats were ripped out of the crates shut up big hairy growled the ruddynecked hack getting out of the speed boat which bore the machine gun and the loudspeakers i been wondering how you was gonna move your big partners around monk told him amiably shut up i said hack gritted long tom surveyed their captors those who were of normal size some of these are the birds who grabbed me near new york he offered you know in that van hack yanked an automatic from an armpit holster he waved it meaningly to enforce his command for silence four men of normal size appeared these fellows were toughlooking customers swaggering and belligerent doc savage studying them said nothing but he glanced at renny the bigfisted engineer nodded the nod informed doc that all of their captors the thugs of normal size as well as the giants were convicts taken from the prisons of the united states by the illstarred caldwell doc and the others were dragged inland there was another captive on the island they discovered this a moment later this prisoner doc and the others did not glimpse fully hack and another thug went ahead and removed this mysterious captive from under what seemed to be a great flattopped rock black shadows lay among the great boulders the pair moving the mystery captive kept in these either by chance or through design which accounted for docs not being able to identify the bound form which they bore its griswold rock guessed bigfisted renny doc the girl and the five men were dragged toward the spot from which the other prisoner had been taken what had seemed to be a huge flat rock proved to be a c amouflaged shed it was of no inconsiderable size this roofed and concealed a deep pit the depression might have been a grave except that it was considerably larger doc and the others were searched to make sure they carried no weapons the steelhaired girls frock being wet from her immersion in the lake clung to her shapely figure in such fashion as to make it obvious that she carried no weapons all of them were forced to slide down a rope into the shedcovered pit the depth was surprising they explored the stone floor and walls of the prison the rock was smooth offering not the slightest fingerhold there was no fitting of any kind in the welllike pit holy cow renny groaned were sunk you said it bigfists growled hacks voice from the top renny glared upward it was very dark in the depths and little lighter above thanks to the shed k k renny grumbled but your big scheme aint gonna work fellah the people in those cities detroit for instance aint gonna kick in with such huge sums of money so you think jeered the man above listen guy them beware the monsters newspaper advertisements had the public stirred up and curious they furnished just the foundation we wanted they showed the public that this giant business aint no twobit scheme if you think theyll lay down and give up their money youre crazy renny shot back at him they may not at first agreed hack ominously but tomorrow night were gonna haul a load of the big boys down to detroit theyll wear armor thats proof against anything less than artillery and theyll wear gas masks what they will do to detroit will be plenty the other towns will kick in after that planes will bomb the giants oh yeah not when the giants carry off the mayor and some others for hostages what do the giants stand to make out of the whole thing renny asked curiously what good will money do them theyre just monstrosities they cant enjoy themselves they cant even talk coherently after this is all over theyll be returned to normal size hack retorted triumphantly can pere teston make them little again you said it bigfists doc savage now entered the conversation inquiring are the giants taking part in this devilish scheme because they are under the impression they can be returned to normal size they dont think they know hack growled hack now gave orders for two giants to station themselves near by and watch the covered pit have any of the giants been returned to normal size doc savage called it can be done all right yelled hack pere teston did it with monkeys and guinea pigs he even did it with a cow but has he returned a man to normal size doc persisted hell not hack snarled there aint been no need of it yet are you sure that the animals once reduced in size enjoyed a normal span of life doc questioned what dyou mean bronze guy i mean that the shrinkage in size probably brought on almost immediate death doc said quietly this seemed to be somewhat of a shock to the man above there was silence he swore softly hell youre just tryin to worry em you know theyre listenin hack now withdrew was that a bluff doc renny asked cant they be returned to normal size doc savage vouchsafed no reply instead he made a silent round of the pit assembling his five men chapter escape and capture docs aids were puzzled at first not realizing his purpose in gathering them together then they comprehended and without doc issuing orders they went into action renny braced his head and arms against the stone side of the pit with an agility befitting his apish build monk bounded upon rennys shoulders and balanced there johnny topped monk soon they had formed a human pyramid reaching almost to the top of the pit up this living ladder doc savage clambered upright on the shoulders of long tom who was the lightest he could reach the rim he peered out in the moonlight beyond the camouflaged shed he distinguished the two guardian giants one was to the north the other stood at the south all around the shed the rocky isle was smooth chances of crossing this without being observed seemed nil over toward the other side of the island there was talk and laughter some of the mirth being expressed in thunderous howling noises this was evidently the only type of laughter permitted to the afflicted giants vocal cords docs dire prediction that they could not be returned to normal size apparently had not been taken seriously making no noise doc savage clambered over the pit rim it was then that he caught a faint stir in the darkness inside the shed he poised listening thinking perhaps that it night be hack but it was not the pig habeas corpus nosed against doc making another faint stir as he did so the homely shote had managed to reach the shed without being seen by the giants doc grasped the pig through the medium of signs and a gentle shove he made the intelligent porker understand that he was to run away from the shed the pig galloped off the giants saw him so unusual was the appearance of the pig that their attention was gripped the running porker held their attention only a moment but that was long enough for doc to move unobserved from the shed to the sheltering maze of boulders a bronze phantom who blended with the tawny hue of the rocks and melted entirely into the shadows doc savage made directly for the edge of the island the huge camouflaged hangars jutted up darkly he waded past them on out into the lake scarcely a splash marked his entrance into the water he filled his capacious lungs with air and submerged doc was capable of swimming a tremendous distance under water he had acquired the ability to do this in the manner that he learned all things by studying the methods of the masters the fine points of underwater work he had picked up from the skilled divers of the south seas coming to the surface at long intervals projecting only his nostrils to replenish his air supply doc stroked into the lake he reached the point where his aids the steelhaired girl and himself had been forced to drop the containers of equipment which they had employed to hold themselves on the lake bottom the bronze man had made careful note of the location of the spot at the time of their capture by the giants he had done this unobtrusively and it had passed without being observed doc savage chanced lifting his eyes above the surface by aligning several of the larger boulders on the island he located the spot where the equipment lay so accurate were his calculations that he found the cases on his third dive his sensitive hands explored a container he was familiar with the boxes having constructed them himself this was not the case he wanted he searched over the black depths of the lake bed until he found others not until he had identified the fourth container by touch did he seem satisfied with the rather heavy box cradled under an arm he stroked for the surface the return to the isle swimming under water for the most part was by no means easy the weight of the case being a tremendous handicap realizing there might be watchmen near the hangars doc left the water at the opposite side of the island he did not waste time resting once ashore the effort of the return swim great as it had been had tapped only slightly his fabulous reservoir of vitality carrying the metal case of equipment which he had retrieved from the lake he crept inland toward the other end of the island there was still noisy talk and coarse laughter doc savage approached the spot to no phantom in the stories of mythology was ever attributed greater stealth the mirth sounds were emanating from a large camouflaged shack which was evidently a bunk house after ascertaining the nature of this structure doc did not approach too closely he did not wish to risk discovery he began a footbyfoot search of the island near the boathouse he found a hidden building of some size this seemed to be a laboratory shelves of rough temporary construction held a surprising array of chemicals doc examined the compounds noting particularly their nature for light in viewing the container labels he employed matches from a box which he found near a bunsen burner he kept the tiny flame carefully cupped in his palms he found books on chemical treatises the flyleaves of these bore the scrawled name of pere teston there were also notebooks in the same handwriting the notebooks contained data on experiments at increasing animal growth the cases described were apparently pere testons earlier efforts there was data on the abnormal growth of a cow pere teston seemed to consider this of great importance he had written it will be noted that the mllkproducing capacity of the bovine kept pace with the expansion in bone and tissue this means that my process of size increase will result in the creation of more efficient farm animals particularly do i hope to be able to center the effects of my compound to certain organs of the animal in further experiments this would achieve for instance cattle with enormous milkproducing capacities there were more notes of this nature one set had to do with the growing of an enormous draft horse in these earlier experiments dating back several years pere teston had apparently entertained no idea of creating giant men to be used in terrorizing cities doc found no data covering work over the last few months doc savage left the laboratory and continued his search of the island he entered several buildings only to leave at once they were store rooms holding immense quantities of food for the giants sustenance near the south end of the island doc savage came upon a small shedlike structure of metal and camouflagedaubed canvas crosslegged before this so huge and ugly as to give the appearance of a grotesque oriental idol sat one of the giants he seemed to be on guard the fellow held a large pipe the giant poured tobacco into the oversized bowl his big clumsy fingers had trouble with matches several broke the night breeze blew others out the giant was fully occupied with his smoking difficulties doc savage circled and drifted waithlike toward the shed in negotiating one narrow stretch of rock he was completely exposed to the gaze of the colossus crossing this doc chose an instant when the giant was carefully striking a match unseen the bronze man reached the shed the metal sides of this were open the canvas cover having been roiled up for ventilation this sheathing could be lowered if necessary making the shed seem from the air or from a distance of a few yards on the island nothing more interesting than an angular rock doc savage eased inside curious to learn what the giant was guarding that mystery was soon clarified a man reposed on the rocky shed floor darkness was complete where he lay so black as to seem solidified doc savage found the fellow only by touch and through use of his sensitive olfactory organs docs bronze fingers explored their skilled touch conveying impressions of almost visual clarity he got the height of the prisoner his probable weight he found stout handcuffs on wrists and ankles the man lay perfectly motionless none of his muscles stirred yet he was definitely alive doc applied pressure on certain nerve centers testing the reaction of muscles to pain docs knowledge of drugs their effects and their symptoms was profound he came to the conclusion that the captors limbs were under the influence of injections of some local anesthetic some substance in the nature of the novocaine which dentists use doc savage examined the mans ankles again the chain of the manacles encircled the steel framework of the camouflaged shed doc tested the links they were very strong the bronze man began removing his shirt it being his intention to wrap the cloth around the manacles to muffle the inevitable snap as he broke them then the giant guard probably with the idea of getting out of the wind to light his big pipe entered the shed doc savage was under no delusions the match flame was certain to reveal his presence he left the strange captive and crept out silently on the opposite side for several minutes he loitered near by but the giant showed no sign of leaving the shed doc savage continued his search he found more huts all were cleverly constructed to escape detection from the air at last he located one of which he seemed to have been seeking this structure was obviously the headquarters it held maps these were marked with red lines to indicate the intended curse of attack upon detroit and other cities there was also a large safe in the place here when he was upon the island the master mind of the giants obviously made his headquarters doc savage still carried the case of equipment which he had rescued from the lake opening it he removed certain small boxes and coils of wire he concealed a tiny disc of a device overhead where it was unlikely to be observed the insulated wires leading from this were so thin as to be unnoticeable to the eye doc carried these down a metal girder to a boxlike container of his apparatus which he buried under the dry sand floor this done doc left the hut at the other end of the island stood the log structure in which the giants were quartered doc approached it cautiously at a concealed point only a few yards from this bunk house he planted more of his apparatus hiding it in such a fashion that it was practically certain to escape detection then he returned to the pit where his companions were imprisoned the pig habeas corpus was not in sight doc studied the giant guards intently then the bronze mans throat muscles tensed in a peculiar fashion from the boulder some distance away came a voice a voice resembling that of the florid hack come over here a minute you two big guys it directed the giants hesitated they glanced at the shed hurry up rapped the voice from the rocks the giants were sure it was hacks voice they lumbered toward the sound they had not taken a dozen steps when the voice came again never mind it said i thought i heard a speed boat out on the lake but it was just a frog croaking the giants returned to their position not overlybright fellows neither realized they had been tricked doc savage was an excellent ventriloquist and a master of voice imitation throwing tones which were very like those of hack he had decoyed the giants getting their attention while the giants had looked away doc had crossed to the roofedover pit here he found habeas inside the shed he tucked the pig under his arm and dropped into the pit docs five men all but held their breaths waiting for their bronze chief to explain what he had been doing no explanation however was forthcoming two or three times the men imagined they heard faint whisperings these they dismissed as being gentle sounds made by grams of sand swept into the pit by the night breeze they failed to realize that doc had drawn the steelhaired girl aside or that he was speaking to her in a wisp of a whisper chapter master of the giants hack the the thug with the neck which seemed perpetually flushed appeared at the top of the pit half an hour later he was excited his electric hand lantern blazed light downward with an angry suddenness whats been goin on here he rapped doc savage did not look upward his manner was tranquil he ignored hacks question you big bronze guy i asked you a question hack grated yeahsaid homely monk dont get funny im talkin to your boss whats been goin on here doc savage seemed to consider as if debating what could possibly be meant by the inquiry weve been talking he replied and were getting a bit hungry too suppose you produce some food ill produce some trouble hack promised harshly the big fellows say they heard my voice around here a while ago i wasnt here what did they hear can the giants talk doc asked from the sounds they have made in the past i presumed their vocal cords were affected by the sizeincreasing process they cant talk but they can write out their words whatve you birds been up to doc glanced at his fellow prisoners and asked what have we search me renny popped his huge fists together and the impact made a rocky sound youre givin me a runaround hack rasped then hack discovered habeas corpus the sight of the pig brought a cry of angry surprise he leaned over to see better with the result that he nearly fell into the pit whered that peewee edition of a hog come from he demanded when he had recovered his balance monk held habeas up he spread the shotes enormous ears and asked dyou see these ears hack only snarled monk homely face serious explained habeas is a very special kind of a pig youd be surprised at what he can do he uses his ears for wings he can fly like a bat he flew down here hack made a choking sound of wrath habeas can talk too monk added listen he held the pig higher words seemed to come from the freakish porkers mouth say hack when do we eat asked the voice hack maintained a dumbfounded silence for a long min ute then the explanation dawned on him a ventriloquist he barked laughing heartily he extinguished his light that explains the voice they heard in a loud tone hack yelled for four additional giants these arrived their heavy footfalls plainly audible to the prisoners in the pit after ordering the newcomers to assist in guarding the captives hack took his departure fat chance weve got of getting away now re nny groaned monk moved close to doc and asked did i do right havin the pig talk to him you could not have done better doc replied the hours which followed seemed interminably long monk prowled around the pit walls like a caged gorilla habeas grunted at his heels the sun mustve forgotten to come up monk complained later the homely chemist was surprised to find doc sleeping in the center of the pit reassured by the calmness with which the bronze man was taking their incarceration monk also tried to slumber failing even to keep his eyes shut however he gave it up he started a whispered consultation with the others by asking i wonder what doc found while he was outside why dont you ask him inquired the steelhaired girl no use why not docs ways are kinda strange to those who dont know him monk explained if he dont want to give information he wont but you havent asked him what he found jean morris retorted the five of us know doc as well as anybody knows him we can tell when hes got things to say and when he hasnt when he kept silent after returning that was the tipoff right now hes not talking humph sniffed jean morris to kill time monk managed to pry several small fragments of rock from the pit bottom he pegged these up at the giants the monsters retaliated by showering down great handfuls of fine sand the choking cloud produced great discomfort let them alone advised doc who had been awakened by the sand they have the upper hand now jean morris decided to try her hand at persuading doc to talk what did you find outside she asked and what did you do that will be cleared up when the time comes doc answered and this was all the information the steelhaired girl received although she put several more questions to the bronze man disgusted she flounced to the other side of the pit and tried to get some sleep dawn came after what seemed an age it gorged the top of the pit with reddish light the depths remained gloomy doc savage approached jean morris where she sat apart from the others and said something which the rest did not catch the young woman was apparently piqued by docs refusal to answer her questions her voice was waspish i remember every word you told me last night she said but you might inform me of what you found outside not so loud doc admonished and left her the bronze mans aids exchanged surprised glances this was their first hint that doc and the steelhaired girl had held a consultation we heard whispers right after doc got back monk said thoughtfully he was talking to her then the five men eyed doc curiosity was consuming them and their expressions showed it listen doc monk said hopefully whats the idea of keepin us in the dark psychology doc replied huh if you fellows were told how our trouble here will work out if it goes according to my expectations your hopes would rise you might get the idea you were almost out of the mess and would that make us mad monk snorted on the contrary it would make you highly elated spill it doc after a night in this hole we need a pickup if the scheme goes wrong youre going to be very disappointed doc remonstrated casually you will feel much worse than you would if you had known nothing of it to save you that letdown is the reason i did not tell you well were all stirred up now monk grinned doc studied them he apparently concluded the purpose of his keeping silent had been defeated all right ill tell you he said but he never did plane noise came through the morning air it started with a faint drone like that of a mosquito and loudened with surprising rapidity it stopped the discussion and gripped their attention sounds like a fast bus renny offered and eyed his huge fists in the dusk of the pit bottom the plane swooped overhead so low that its propeller blast fluttered the canvas shed covering fine sand was blown into the pit it must be a friend of theirs monk grunted i dont hear any sounds of excitement its the boss came hacks excited yell from somewhere on the island once more the plane crashed its exhaust stacks past overhead then with noisy backfiring it landed motor boat engines sputtered and howled they were evidently towing the plane into a camouflaged hangar the giants on guard at the pit made coughing and gobbling sounds at each other delight was distinguishable in the uncouth noises they seem glad to see the big shot said long tom and no wonder ham snapped hes the guy who knows how to return them to normal size if something would happen to him theyd be in a fine pickle the arrival of the plane had completely occupied the attention of docs five men so the bronze man was given no opportunity to explain his plans for their escape amid many glad cries from the giants men approached the pit hacks raucous tones became audible he was explaining things to his chief weve got the whole savage gang be said theyre in the pit we disarmed them theyre helpless then why in hell didnt you rub them out at once the master villain spoke these last words there was no doubt of it utter arrogance crackled in the voice the tones were hollowly froglike pere teston monk breathed it doesnt sound like a natural voice gasped jean morris too hollow monk agreed doc savage spoke the master mind seems to be speaking into a tube to disguise his voice using a gas pipe or perhaps a cardboard mailing tube hacks harsh tone said we kept em alive boss thinkin you might want to talk to em they can tell me nothing of importance snarled the master of the giants they might know how detroit is fixin to receive us hack whined he sounded servile ingratiating this was a a marked change from his usual overbearing manner the master villain laughed harshly into the tube which he was using to disguise his voice it makes no difference what detroit does hack wailed but if they use airplanes and bombs on were not attacking detroit tonight retorted the ruler of the giants instead well give milwaukee a surprise milwaukee instead of detroit hack gulped hack my friend you are very dumb at times said the cavernous voice you do not think that the few giants we have here even with their armor would stand any chance in attacking a city prepared to receive them theyre mighty big size is not of supreme importance these days my friend it is brains which count bombs and modern machine guns would make short work of our giants then what are we gonna do hack groaned do not sound so disappointed chuckled the hollow tones my plan is based on psychology ii you had read the newspapers today you would understand the size of our giants has been exaggerated our earlier newspaper advertisements helped i dont get you the imaginative american public actually thinks we have monster men a hundred feet high we will make our little foray upon milwaukee first bombing the light plant so that the city will be in darkness the giants will smash windows and catch a few people and break their necks in the darkness few will see the big fellows after that rumor will have the giants infinitely larger than they are hack seemed to be digesting his chiefs words you think we can scare them towns into coughing up five million apiece we can certainly try chuckled the hollow voice but if he dont then there are many other crimes our giants can commit my friend as you know the compound which made them large also made them very bard to kill wounds which will overcome an ordinary man will not even faze these fellows youre right at that hack agreed chapter death magnified nothing was said for some moments the giants made hootings and cluckings of a happy nature the big fellows apparently had not relished attacking a city ready to receive them the assault on milwaukee was more appealing in the pit there was stark silence renny perspired and blocked and unblocked his enormous fists monk homely face grim absently scratched habeas corpus behind the ears the steelhaired girl was rigid pale the giant mail of bronze alone was devoid of emotion they all knew that death crouched outside the pit hack asked his chief but howre we gonna get the giants down to milwaukee the planes he was reminded i have marked the position of lighting plants we will bomb them then we will land on the lake front from there the giants can work into the heart of milwaukee in the darkness that will not be difficult swell idea hack agreed dispose of the prisoners snapped the master of the giants how hack asked use a machine gun then have the giants fill the pit with rocks hack loudly directed a human monster to bring him a rapidfirer this was done there were clickings as a fully loaded ammo drum was jacked into the mechanism hack appeared on the pit rim he was going to do the wholesale murdering himself steelhaired jean morris moaned and covered her eyes with her hands monk made an animal snarling noise and crouched as if to leap up at the killer doc savage rested his strange flakegold eyes on hack i left this pit for a time last night he said you cant kid me hack sneered youre lyin the giants heard your voice from the rocks doc reminded him the voice was thrown by ventriloquism as you guessed but its purpose was to cause them to look away so that they would not observe my return this startled hack he blinked the master of the giants had heard the words his voice rattled from the hollow tube he was using for a disguise whats this hack hes kidding us hack growled i was never more serious doc assured them me giants heard a voice all right hack advised his chief then the scarletnecked thug glared down into the pit whatd you do when you was outside bronze guy when you learn that it will be too late to help yourself doc informed him without expression whatya mean disaster will have overtaken you the steelhaired girl suddenly removed her hands from her eyes i know what doc savage did she screamed its something that will destroy all of you take me out of here turn me loose and ill tell you what it is you hussy renny thundered and reached hands for the girl get back you bigfisted hooligan hack gritted from the pit top the command was hardly necessary renny had already dropped his arms it had been his intention to clap a palm over the girls lips and shut off her words but it was now too late the hollow voice of the leader of the giants joined the discussion the master villain however did not show himself take the girl out he commanded well hear what she has to say we cant run any risks youve got to turn me loose in return for what i have to tell you jean morris wailed youve got to promise that its a promise boomed the czar of the giants a rope dangled down into the pit like a bronze snake hack menaced doc and his men with the machine gun keeping them away from the hemp strand the girl knotted the rope under her arms and was hauled up doc savage watched her as she reached the top of the pit when the girl saw the mastersinister of the giants she started violently and her hands made a fluttering gesture oh its she began shut up warned the mans sepulchral voice the girl obediently controlled her surprise then she said what ive got to tell you is in confidence have you a place where we can talk in private there was a pause while the leader of the giants considered ive got a shack i use for headquarters thatll do he said he and the girl moved away and their footsteps were soon lost to the ear there was something bordering on agony in the looks which docs five men exchanged the perfidity of the young woman had been a bitter shock i thought there was more to her than that monk groaned after all weve done for her imagine her givin us the doublecross we havent done so much for her renny retorted gloomily she couldnt be much worse off than she was down here in the pit long tom somewhat more pallid than usual asked doc curiously did you really tell her what preparations you have made i talked to her last night doc replied monk groaned and sat down on the pit floor comparative silence fell over the men the six giants remained on guard at the pit hack was also present his machine gun ready in his hand the minutes seemed much longer than usual when voices suddenly reached them no more than five minutes had elapsed although it seemed infinitely longer the steelhaired girl and the master of the giants were speaking the voices obviously came from a mechanical loudspeaker for they were metallic although not loud the leader of the giants was not disguising his tones now and they had a familiar ring docs men registered astonishment there was something about the voice of the master mind that tickled their memories monk opened his cavernous mouth as if to speak the name the voice brought to mind but the import of the words which they overheard caused him to keep silent apparently the conversation was occurring in the headquarters shack although the loudspeakers were relaying it from the opposite end of the island what did doc savage do last night the master of the giants asked he arranged for the giants to learn something jean morris retorted learn what the truth about a point on which you had deceived them youre not talking sense oh yes i am savage arranged for the giants to learn that they cannot be returned to normal size hell howd he find that out he went through your laboratory he learned the method by which the size of these men had been increased he has a vast knowledge of chemistry and realized instantly that you had been lying to the giants they cannot be returned to normal size and remain alive for any length of time the master of the giants swore violently bitterly its a good thing i talked to you sister he snarled finally ii them big boys found out they cant be reduced theyd turn on me how was it arranged for em to find out the truth from the pit bottom doc savage and his aids were watching hack the thugs features had become slack astounded as he listened to the words relayed by the loudspeaker these words were not loud enough to reach back to the hut where the girl was being questioned the giants on guard had fallen silent theirs was a grim ominous quiet they had heard every word that had been said the widest of grins suddenly overspread monks homely face he turned to doc howd you do it theres a sensitive microphone planted in the headquarters shack doc explained it is connected to my portable radiophone transmitter theres a receiver and a loudspeaker hidden near the bunk house occupied by the giants its that loudspeaker youre listening to now you concealed the apparatus last night monk grunted right in his delight monk bounced up and down ape fashion i see it he howled me girl didnt doublecross us she decoyed the master mind to his headquarters and got im to spill the truth outside the pit things began to happen the giants made hoarse violent sounds of rage it had dawned on them that they were doomed to spend their natural lives as the monstrosities which they now were hack backed from the pit rim with his machine gun he must have decided to take sides with the giants possibly their nearness and their rage influenced this decision the big shot has been lyin to us he yelled whatre we gonna do about it his answer was a thunder of gigantic footsteps as the monsters charged for the headquarters shack wait hack yelled and ran after them my machine gun may come in handy from other sections of the island howls of the giants arose although none of these unearthly sounds were words their portent was clear the giants had turned upon their master make a pyramid doc directed his men whipped into movement renny took up a crouching position against the pit walls and monk sprang atop his shoulders then the others mounted as he had done the night before doc savage clambered up this living pyramid to the pit rim and hauled himself outside the monster men were converging on the headquarters shack some of them had picked up boulders almost as large as washtubs to use as missiles and these seemed as light as pebbles in their hands one huge fellow wrenched the covering off a camouflaged shack and tore out a section of iron framework as if it were of thin lath construction waving this he charged with the others from the headquarters a machine gun clattered the master of the giants was using it and his slugs pommeled one of the oncoming monsters the big fellow shook under the impact but kept coming the vitality of the gargantuan manthing was astounding not until the slugs battered his head almost out of shape did he sink sprawling doc savage glanced about near by lay the rope with which the girl had been hauled from the pit the bronze man scooped this up and tossed the end down to his comp anions they climbed in within some thirty seconds all five stood at his side monk carrying the excited habeas by a leg chapter pere testons end doc savage and his men made no move to join the fray they merely looked on in a fashion this climax was reminiscent of others which they had witnessed their policy was never to take human life directly no matter how great the provocation but their enemies had a surprisingly regular habit of coming to an untimely end as a result of their own machinations and their foes were meeting such a fate now the master of the giants was a sly devil he had evidently taken precautions against the possibility that his big fellows might turn upon him he had plenty of weapons handy another giant collapsed before the withering storm of machinegun lead hack opened up with his rapidfirer in doing so he made a fatal mistake for he neglected to shelter himself suffi ciently hacks late chief returned the fire hack suddenly dropped his machine gun he stood very straight and stiff and turned slowly while a crimson flood began seeping from his body as if it were sieved with many holes his final collapse was abrupt and marked the complete departure of life lets get out of range doc directed over to the end of the island will do they worked across the rocky surface of the isle pausing frequently to watch the progress of the fight they saw that the steelhaired girl had escaped from the headquarters shack and was retreating furtively her course took her toward the same headland for which doc and his men were making the master of the giants he was far from being their master now had not noticed her departure he was too busy dealing with his erstwhile monster followers got your eye on the girl doc demanded of his men sure monk grunted the way shes going shell join us at the end of the island keep her with you doc directed then the bronze man dropped back monk also halted he stared anxiously after doc then called hey what ham grasped the homely chemists arm youre holding up our stroll you missing link come on they sprinted toward the farthermost end of the island doubled low among the rocks at times moving on all fours doc savage made himself as inconspicuous as possible he watched the giants closely in order to avoid coming too near them doc was making for the shack where he had found the strangely immobile prisoner the poor unfortunate who was under the effect of the drug the bronze man could now see the shack among the boulders he circled warily apparently oblivious to the fighting off to his right the monster man guarding the hut had not quitted his post the big fellow was bouncing about in impatience and making rage sounds the giant paced away uncertainly as if to join the fight coming to a pause he lumbered around and glared at the hut he gibbered more wrath it was obvious that the stupid fellow considered the helpless man inside responsible for the unpleasant things which had befallen him emitting a roar the monster charged the shack he crashed in the covering with his fist and began tearing the framework apart doc savage pitched from cover swooping as he ran he scooped up two flinty elongated pebbles each nearly the size of a mans fist he held one of these in either hand they were his only weapons the monster was on the point of forcing entry to the hut doc yelled the manmonstrosity wheeled attention attracted he perceived that doc was going to attack he hurriedly scrambled out of the hole he had opened in the hut wall doc did not pause in his rush it seemed that he intended to come to grips with the huge fellow the monster opened enormous hands spread his arms to receive the bronze man giant among ordinary men though doc was he seemed diminutive alongside his huge foe what occurred next surprised the monster doc folded down almost against the ground the monsters hands clutched empty air there came two loud cracking noises the manthing squawled in agony with the stones gripped in his fists doc had struck each of the fellows kneecaps a hard blow the bronze man sprang clear he dropped his rocks and shoveled up handfuls of the fine sand underfoot the mangiant had grasped his kneecaps and was walling like a small boy who had fallen down doc rushed him again the monster straightened bellowing to meet him doc flung his fine sand into the big ones eyes the gritty particles blinded the monster it weaved in aimless circles howling swinging random blows that encountered nothing doc savage darted into the hut he scopped up the drugged man who lay there and bore him out carrying the unfortunate doc ran to join his companions the fight between the giants and their late chief was rapidly approaching its gory end the master of the giants keeping under cover had not shown himself to doc and the others they had not as yet identified the fellow by sight the chief villain now began hurling small metal cannisters out of his retreat these burst with slightly more noise than bad eggs and spewed a lemoncolored vapor this fog spread rapidly it swathed the giants in a citrous mantle the monsters began to scream and stagger in agony renny and the others nearing the opposite side of the island could see the affair poison gas renny rumbled there was a breeze across the isle this swept such of the gas as fell short directly toward the monster men two of them turned to flee but were too late the lemonhued cloud descended upon them wheew breathed renny me breeze is a lucky break for us not until much later did renny realize that it was foresight against just such a contingency which had moved doc to direct them toward the side of the island where the wind would sweep the gas away before it could reach his companions it became apparent that all of the attacking party giants and normal men alike were certain to be smitten by the poison vapor the men of ordinary size dropped almost instantly after encountering the fumes the giants with their infinitely greater vitality survived some moments after the stuff swept over them a strange vengeance befell the master of the giants the fellow had no doubt seized the three black pinhead savages against their will and by feeding them his sinister concoction by force had turned them into giants it was this seizure of the pinheads indirectly which had put doc savage on the fantastic trail for the pinheads had escaped from the island to wreak vengeance upon the man who had mistreated them bruno hen the beating bruno hen had administered to the little black fellows when they came pleading for food had later been the cause of his own death and it was the three monster black pinheads who now wrought justice upon the czar of the giants they alone did not swerve when the poison gas bit them probably they did not know what the stuff was did not realize they were doomed for all of their great size the three of them fell upon the headquarters shack there was reenacted much the same drama which must have marked the demise of bruno hen the monster pinheads beat at the sides of the shack they flung themselves headlong and crashed in its walls disappearing inside they sought the man who had made them the hideous things they were an awful screeching arose as their enormous hands found their quarry they hauled the lifeless body from the shattered shack and tossed it away as if it were an unclean thing the body fell at some distance and the pinheads started after it as if to wreak further vengeance but the gas was having its effect they began to claw at their chests they pawed at their great mouths they sank to their knees after swaying there for a moment they toppled over one at a time these three black monsters were the last of all the giants to die doc savage joined his five men over one shoulder he carried the figure of the man he had rescued the steelhaired girl had joined the group they all stared at docs burden they noted the wizened extremely pallid countenance of it the homely monk scratched in the reddish bristles which furred the nape of his neck this fellow answers the description of pere teston he muttered no doubt we will find be is pere teston doc replied it was some fifteen minutes before docs surmise was verified there was still danger from the gas cloud which covered the other end of the island while waiting for the wind to sweep it out over the lake doc savage swam to the spot where they had dropped their equipment he dived until he found the box he desired he brought it ashore the container held medical supplies restoratives stimulants using these doc revived pere teston before long the man could speak coherently you are pere teston doc questioned the wizened man nodded they have been holding me here for months a prisoner why my chemical compound pere teston wailed i only intended to develop super farm animals but they used it on men they kept me here made me mix the stuff doc gestured toward the other side of the island how did the master of the giants first find out about your compound pere teston grimaced and shuddered i went to him hoping he would supply money to finance my experiments doc straightened he moistened a finger and held it up to judge the strength of the breeze the gas has been swept away by now he decided we could go over and take a look at the fellow who was behind all this monk and the others ran ahead anxious to be first to view the features of the master villain the steelhaired girl lingered behind she kept her eyes on doc you have guessed who he is doc savage nodded when the giants made their raid on trapper lake it was clear who he was the fellow wanted to get away to supervise personally the raid of his monster men so he had his giants come and get him monk reached the spot where the czar of the giants lay his loud ejaculation as he glimpsed the lifeless features carried distinctly griswold rock he squawked griswold rock was the guy behind all this the group which had gone to the body of griswold rock came back their return was slow for they angled right and left inspecting the gigantic hulks of the menmonsters and the bodies of the thugs of normal size the gang is all done for monk told doc when he had reached the bronze man monks words in a sense marked the end of the menace of the monsters it also signified the beginning of what to the rest of the world became a profound mystery doc and his men never told of the isle or of what had happened there steelhaired jean morris given her chance by a motionpicture company on docs recommendation became within a few months a star of some magnitude she never told of the isle either it was something she wanted to forget nor did pere teston talk he followed a suggestion which doc savage made questioning him doc learned that pere teston was actually a man of great mental ability the bronze man placed a considerable sum of money at pere testons disposal for use in making scientific experiments but pere testons future work had nothing to do with increasing the size of men or animals ill never touch that stuff again pere teston declared pere testons gratitude to doc savage was profound many times he expressed his feelings anything i can do to repay you he said earnestly anything forget it doc advised your payment will be your useful scientific work in the future doc and his men buried the giants there on the island they broke up the camouflaged shacks and disposed of them in the lake the laboratory with its bottles of chemical compounds they also cast into the water one bottle alone did doc savage salvage this held the growth compound which pere teston had developed later doc tested the stuff if the size of domestic animals could be increased to the benefit of farmers he intended to place this elixir in the proper hands he made however a surprising discovery living things after their size was increased lived as a rule less than two years from a practical standpoint pere testons concoction was relatively valueless and in the meantime the world was wondering what had happened to the monsters who had raided trapper lake the end
