 there was always a great deal of confusion more noise and a touch of panic to flavor the arrival of embarking passengers some were already a bit travel weary from their flight into miami others were running on the adrenaline of anticipation the huge white ocean liner the celebration waited in port their ticket to fun relaxation romance when they crossed the gangway they would no longer be accountants assistant managers or teachers but pampered passengers assured of being fed spoiled and entertained for the next ten days the brochures guaranteed it from the rail of the observation deck serena watched the flow of humanity at that distance she could enjoy the color and noise which never lost its appeal for her without being caught in the inevitable tangle of fifteen hundred people trying to get to the same place at the same time the cooks the bartenders the cabin stewards had already begun the orgy of work that would continue virtually uninterrupted for the next ten days but she had time serena relished it these were her idle moments before the ship pulled out of port she could remember her first experience with a cruise liner shed been eight the youngest of the three children of financial wizard daniel macgregor and dr anna whitefield macgregor there had been firstclass cabins where the steward had served her hot buns and juice in bed serena had enjoyed it the same way she enjoyed her tiny cabin in the crews quarters now they were both an adventure serena remembered too the day she had told her parents of her plans to apply for a job with the celebration her father had huffed and puffed about her throwing away her education the more he had huffed the more pronounced his soft scottish burr had become a woman who had graduated from smith at the tender age of twenty who had then gone on to earn degrees in english history and sociology didnt swab decks and even as serena had assured him that wasnt her intention her mother had laughed telling daniel to let the child be because at six foot three and two hundred and twenty pounds daniel macgregor was helpless against what he called his females he did just that so serena had gotten her job and had escaped from what had become endless years of study shed traded her threeroom suite in the family mansion in hyannis port for a oneroom broom closet with a bunk on a floating hotel none of her coworkers cared what her iq was or how many degrees shed earned they didnt know her father could have bought the cruise line lock stock and barrel if hed had the whim or that her mother was an authority on thoracic surgery they didnt know her oldest brother was a senator and the younger a states attorney when they looked at her they saw serena that was all she wanted lifting her head she let the wind take her hair it danced on the breeze a mass of blond the rich shade of gold one found in old paintings she had high slanting cheekbones and a sharp stubborn jaw her skin refused to tan remaining a delicate peach to contrast with the violetblue of her eyes her father called them purple a few romantics had called them violet serena stubbornly termed them blue and left it at that men were drawn to them because of their uniqueness then to her because of the elegant sexuality she exuded without thought but she wasnt very interested intellectually serena thought a man was a fool if he fell for a shade of irises it was a matter of genetics after all and had little to do with her personally shed listened to accolades on her eyes for twentysix years with a kind of detached wonder there was a miniature in her fathers library of his greatgrandmother another serena if anyone had asked she could have explained the process of genetics that resulted in the resemblance down to the bone structure and eye shade and the reputed temper but the men she met were generally not interested in scientific explanation and serena was generally not interested in them below her the crowd flowing up the gangway was thinning shortly the calypso band would be playing on the lido deck to entertain the passengers while the ship prepared to sail serena would enjoy staying outside listening to the tinny rhythmic music and laughter there would be a buffet laden with more food than the well over one thousand people could possibly eat exotic drinks and excitement soon the rails would be packed with people wanting that last glimpse of shore before all there would be was open sea wistfully she watched the last stragglers come on board it was the final cruise of the season when they returned to miami the celebration would go into dry dock for two months when it sailed again serena wouldnt be on it shed already made up her mind that it was time to move on when shed taken the job on the ship she had been looking for one thing freedom from years of study from family expectations from her own restlessness she knew she had accomplished something in the year on her own serena had found the independence she had always struggled for and she had escaped the niche so many of her college friends had been determinedly heading for a good marriage and yet though shed found the freedom and independence she hadnt found the most important ingredient the goal what did serena macgregor want to do with the rest of her life she didnt want the political career both her brothers had chosen she didnt want to teach or lecture she wanted excitement and challenges and no longer wanted to look for them in a classroom they were all negative answers but she knew whatever it was that would fill the rest of her life wouldnt be found by floating endlessly in the bahamas time to get off the boat rena she told herself with a sudden smile the next adventures always just around the corner not knowing what it would be only made the search more intriguing the first long loud blast of the horn was her signal drawing back from the rail serena went to her cabin to change within thirty minutes she entered the ships casino dressed in the modified tux that was her uniform she had pulled her hair back in a loose bun at the nape of her neck so that it wouldnt tend to fall all over her face her hands would soon be too busy to fool with it the chandeliers were lit spilling light onto the red and gold art deco carpet long curved windows allowed a view of the glassedin promenade deck then the bluegreen stretch of sea the remaining walls were lined with slot machines as silent as soldiers waiting for an attack fussing with the bow tie she could never seem to get quite right serena crossed to her supervisor as with any sailor the shifting of the ship under her feet went unnoticed serena macgregor reporting for duty sir she said crisply turning a clipboard in one hand he looked her up and down dale zimmermans lightweight boxers build skimmed just under six feet he had a smooth handsome face he dedicatedly tanned winning crinkles at the corners of his light blue eyes and sunbleached hair that curled riotously he had a reputation which he assiduously promoted of being a marvelous lover after his brief study of serena his grin broke out rena cant you ever get this thing right tucking the clipboard under his arm dale straightened her tie i like to give you something to do you know lover if youre serious about quitting after this run this is going to be your last chance for paradise tugging on her tie he lifted his eyes to grin into hers serena cocked a brow what had begun a year ago as an ardent pursual on dales part had been tempered into a goodhumored joke about serenas refusal to go to bed with him they had become more to his surprise than hers friends im going to hate to miss it serena told him with a sigh did the little redhead from south dakota go home happy she asked with a guileless smile dales eyes narrowed anybody ever tell you that you see too much all the time whats my table youre on two taking out a cigarette dale lit it as she walked away if anyone had told him a year before that a classy number like serena macgregor would not only hold him off but make him feel fraternal hed have recommended a good psychiatrist with a shrug he went back to his clipboard he was going to regret losing her dale reflected and not only because of his personal feelings she was the best damn blackjack dealer he had there were eight blackjack tables scattered throughout the casino serena and the seven other dealers would rotate from position to position through the rest of the afternoon and evening with only a brief staggered dinner break unless the playing was light the casino would stay open until two if it was heavy a few tables might stay open until three the first rule was to give the passengers what they wanted other men and women clad in tuxedos went to their stations beside serena the young italian who had just been promoted to croupier stood at table two serena gave him a smile remembering that dale had asked her to keep an eye on him enjoy yourself tony she suggested eyeing the crowd that already waited outside the glass doors its going to be a long night and all on our feet she added silently as dale gave the signal to open the door passengers poured in not in a trickle they rarely trickled in the first day of a cruise the crowd would be thin during the dinner hours then swell again until past midnight dress was casual shorts jeans bare feet the uniform for afternoon gambling with the opening of the door serena heard the musical sound effects of arcade games already being fed on the promenade deck within minutes the sound was drowned out by the steady clatter of slots serena could separate the gamblers from the players and the players from the lookers there was always some of each group in any batch of passengers there would be a percentage who had never been to a casino before they would simply wander around attracted by the noise and the colorful equipment before they exchanged their bills for change for the slots there were some who came for fun not really caring if they won or lost these were the players they came for the game it usually took little time for the looker to become the player they would shout when they won and moan when they lost in much the same way the arcade addicts reacted but always there were the gamblers they would haunt the casino during the trip turning the game of win and lose into an art or an obsession they had no specific features no particular mode of dress the mystique of the riverboat gambler could be found in the neat little grandmother from peoria just as it could be found in the madison avenue executive as the tables began to fill serena categorized them she smiled at the five people who had chosen her table then broke the seal on four decks of cards welcome aboard she said and began to shuffle it took only an hour for the scent of gambling to rise it permeated the smoke and light sweat that drifted through the casino it was a heady scent tempting serena had always wondered if it was what drew people more man the lights and green baize the scent and the noise of silver clattering in the bowls of the slot machines serena never played them perhaps because she recognized the gambler in herself shed decided long ago not to risk anything unless the odds were on her side during her first shift she changed tables every thirty minutes making her way slowly around the room after her dinner break it began again the casino grew more crowded after the sun set tables were full and the roulette wheel spun continuously dress became more elegant as if to gamble in the evening required glamour because the cards and people always changed serena was never bored she had chosen the job to meet people not the cutoutofthesameaffluentcloth people shed met in college but a variety in that shed accomplished her goal at the moment she had a texan two new yorkers a korean and a georgian at her table all of whom shed identified by their accents this was as much a pan of the game for her as the cards she slid onto the baize one she never tired of serena dealt the second card around peeked at her hole card and was satisfied with an eighteen the first new yorker took a hit counted his cards and gave a disgusted grunt with a shake of the head he indicated that hed stand the korean busted on twentytwo then rose from the table with a mutter the second new yorker a sleek blonde in a narrow black dinner dress held with a nine and a queen ill take one the man from georgia drawled he counted eighteen gave serena a thoughtful look and held the man from texas took his time he had fourteen and didnt like the eight serena had showing considering the possibilities he stroked his chin swilled some bourbon then motioned serena to hit him she did a tad too hard with a nine sweetheart he said as he leaned on the table youre just too pretty to take a mans money that way sorry with a smile she turned over her hole card eighteen she announced before she settled the betting serena saw the hundreddollar bill on the table before she realized someone had taken the koreans vacant stool glancing up she met a pair of green eyes cool depthless direct she stared trapped in that instant of contact into seeing nothing else cool green with amber rimming the iris something like ice skidded down her spine forcing herself to blink serena looked at the man he had the lean face of an aristocrat but this was no prince serena sensed it instantly perhaps it was the long unsmiling mouth or the rough sweep of black brows or perhaps it was simply the inner warning that went off in her brain a ruler yes but not royalty this was the type of man who planned ruthless coups and succeeded his hair flowed over his ears thick and black and down to the collar of a white silk shirt the skin stretched taut over the long bones of his face was as tanned as dales but serena didnt think he worked on the tone like her supervisor this man faced the elements without a thought for fashion he didnt slouch like the texan or lounge indolently like the man from georgia but rather sat like a sleek patient cat always coiled to spring it wasnt until one rough brow rose slightly in question that serena realized shed been staring change a hundred she said briskly annoyed with herself with deft movements she slipped the bill into the slot of the table then counted out chips when the bets were placed she dealt the cards the man from new york glanced at the ten serena had showing and hit on fourteen he broke the new player held on fifteen with a wordless gesture of his hand she broke the other new yorker and the georgian before the texan held on nineteen serena turned over a three to go with her ten dealt herself a deuce then broke with twentythree the man with the dangerous face drew out a thin cigar and continued to play silently serena already knew he was a gambler his name was justin blade his ancestors had ridden swift ponies and hunted with bow and arrow serena had been right about the aristocracy though his bloodline wasnt royal part of his heritage came from simple french immigrants and a dash from welsh miners the rest was comanche he hadnt known a reservation and though he had brushed with poverty in his youth he was well accustomed to the feel of silk against his skin accustomed enough so that like the very wealthy he rarely noticed it his first stake had been won in the backroom of a pool hall when hed been fifteen in the twenty years since hed played more elegant games he was as serena had sensed a gambler and he was already figuring the odds justin had entered the casino with the notion of passing a few hours with a mild game a man could relax with small stakes when he could afford to lose then hed seen her his eyes had passed over other women in sleek dinner dress the gleam of gold and sparkle of jewels and came to rest on the blonde in the mannish tuxedo she had a slender neck which her hairstyle and the ruffled shirtfront accentuated and a carriage that shouted breeding but what was more what he had sensed in the loins was a blatant sexuality that required no movement no words on her part she was a woman a man would beg for justin watched her hands as she dealt they were exquisite narrow longfingered with delicate blue veins just under the surface of creamy skin her nails were oval and perfect with the gleam of clear polish they were hands suited to fragile teacups and french pastries the kind of hands a man burned to have on his skin lifting his eyes from them justin looked directly into hers with the faintest of frowns serena stared back why was it she wondered that this dark silent man brought her both discomfort and curiosity he hadnt spoken a word since hed sat down not to her nor to any of the others at her table though hed been winning with professional consistency he didnt appear to gain any pleasure from it he didnt appear to be paying any attention to the game if it came to that she told herself all he did was stare at her with that same calm watchful expression fifteen serena said coolly indicating the cards in front of him justin nodded for the hit and took a six without the slightest change of expression damn if you dont have the luck son the texan stated jovially glancing at his own meager pile of chips he gave a quick grimace glad somebody does he wheezed as serena dealt him the card that eased him out at twentytwo turning over twenty for the house she collected chips then slid two twentyfive dollar markers to justin his fingertips covered hers over them the touch was light but potent enough to have her eyes flashing up to his watching her steadily he made no move to take his hand from hers there was no pressure no flirtatious squeeze but serena felt the response shoot through her as though their bodies rather than their fingers had pressed together calling on all her control she slowly brought her hand back to her side new dealer she said calmly noting with relief that her shift at that station was finished have a nice evening she moved to the next station swearing to herself she wouldnt look back of course she did and found her eyes pinned to his infuriated she allowed herself a slight toss of her head her expression became challenging for the first time that evening she saw the long mouth curve in a slow smile a smile that barely shifted the angles and planes on his face justin inclined his head as if accepting the challenge serena turned her back on him good evening she said in a clear voice to the new set of players the moon was still high cutting a swath of light across the black water from the rail serena could see the white tips of waves as the ship moved in a fast sea it was after two am and the deck was deserted she liked this time of the morning while the passengers slept before the crew began its early shift she was alone with the sea and the wind and could imagine herself in any era she chose she breathed deeply inhaling the scent of salt spray and night theyd be in nassau just past dawn and while in port the casino would be closed she would have the morning free to do as she chose she preferred the night her mind drifted back to her working hours to the silent gambler whod sat at her table winning and watching she thought he was a man women would be drawn to but wasnt surprised that hed been alone a solitary man serena mused and strangely compelling attractive she admitted as she leaned farther out to let the wind whip at her face attractive in a dangerous sort of way but then it was in her blood to look on danger as a challenge risks could be calculated percentages measured and yet and yet serena didnt think the man would follow the neat path of theory night suits you serenas hands tightened on the rail though shed never heard him speak though she hadnt even heard his approach she knew who stood behind her it took all her effort not to gasp and whirl while her heart hammered she turned to watch him come out of the shadows wanting her voice to be steady she gave herself a moment while he stopped to stand beside her at the rail did your luck hold she asked justin kept his eyes on her face apparently she tried and failed to place his origin through his accent his voice was deep and smooth and without inflection youre very good she stated we dont often get a professional in the casino there seemed to be a quick flash of humor in his eyes before he drew out a slim cigar and lit it smoke stung the air then vanished in the wind serena relaxed her fingers on the rail one at a time are you enjoying your trip more than i anticipated he took a slow thoughtful drag on the cigar are you serena smiled its my job justin leaned back against the rail resting his hand beside hers thats not an answer serena he pointed out since there was a name tag on her lapel she only lifted a brow at his use of her name i enjoy it mr blade he said softly as he ran a fingertip down her jawline justin blade remember it serena refused to back up though the lightning response of her body to his touch surprised her instead she regarded him steadily ive a good memory with a trace of a smile he nodded yes thats why youre a good dealer how long have you been doing it a year though he removed his fingertip her blood didnt cool surprised justin took a last drag on his cigar then crushed it under his foot i would have thought longer from the way you handle the cards taking her hand from the rail he studied the back then turned it over to look at the palm soft he thought and steady an interesting combination what did you do before even as her brain told her retreat would be wise serena allowed her hand to remain in his she sensed strength and skill in the touch though she wasnt certain of the aspect of either i studied what whatever interested me what do you do whatever interests me she laughed a low sultry sound that whispered along his skin somehow i think you mean that quite literally mr blade she started to remove her hand but his fingers closed over it i do he murmured its justin serena his eyes skimmed the deserted deck then the dark endless sea this isnt the place for formality common sense told her to tread carefully instinct drove her to provoke there are rules for the crew when dealing with passengers mr blade she said coolly i need my hand when he smiled the moonlight glittered in his eyes like a cats so do i lifting it he pressed his lips deep in the center of her palm serena felt the aftershock of the kiss in every pore i take what i need he murmured against her flesh her breathing had quickened without her being aware of it on the dark empty deck he was barely more than a shadow with a voice that might have been pressed through honey and dangerous eyes feeling her body yearning toward him serena restrained it with a quick flash of temper not this time im going in its late keeping her hand firmly in his justin reached up to pull the pins from her hair as it tumbled over her shoulders he tossed them into the sea stunned by his audacity serena glared at him late he agreed combing his fingers from the crown to the tips of the thick blond mane but youre a woman for the dark hours i thought so the moment i saw you with a movement that was too quick and too smooth to be measured he had serena trapped between his body and the rail her hair flew toward the sea pulled by the wind her skin pure as marble in the moonlight justin discovered the need was stronger that he had realized do you know what i thought serena demanded struggling to keep her words from jerking i thought you were rude and annoying he laughed a rich quick sound of amusement it seems we were both right should i tell you it very nearly distracted me from my game wondering how you tasted serena became very still the only movement came from the rich strands of gold that danced around her face then her chin rose her eyes darkened with challenge a pity she said quietly as she curled her hand into a fist passenger or no passenger she determined she was going to give him a good swift punch just the way her brothers had taught her its rare for anything or anyone to interfere with my concentration as he spoke he leaned closer serena tensed her muscles you have the eyes of a witch im a superstitious man arrogant serena corrected steadily but i doubt superstitious she saw the smile in his eyes only as his face dominated her vision dont you believe in luck serena yes and a good right jab she added silently she felt his fingers slide beneath her blowing hair to cup the base of her neck his mouth lowered toward hers somehow the warm flutter of his breath caused her lips to part and her concentration to waver one hand still held hers and he circled the palm with a finger as if to remind her of the feel of his lips on her flesh fighting the growing weakness serena drew back aiming for his vulnerable unsuspecting stomach less than an inch away from her target her fist was captured in a hard grip frustrated she struggled only to hear his quiet laugh again your eyes give you away he told her holding her still youll have to work on it if you dont let me go ill the threat trailed off as his lips brushed hers it wasnt a kiss but a temptation her tongue came out to moisten her lips as if in anticipation of something darkly sweet and strictly forbidden what he whispered touching his mouth to hers again with a lightness that had the blood pounding in his head he wanted to crush and devour almost as much as he wanted to savor her lips were damp and she smelled faintly of the sea and summer when she didnt answer justin traced the shape of her mouth with his tongue committing it to memory while he absorbed the flavor and waited serena felt the thick liquefying pleasure seep into her her lids were too heavy and fluttered closed her muscles relaxed the fist still curled in his hand went limp for the first time in her memory her mind went blank a clean slate on which he could have written anything he desired she felt the tiny arousing pain as he nipped into her full bottom lip and her mind filled again but not with thoughts his body was against hers hard and lean his mouth was so soft softer than she thought any mans could be like the brush of fine silk against naked flesh there was the faint scent of tobacco something rich and foreign and the smell of him without the interference of cologne he whispered her name as she had never heard it spoken before the boat listed but he swayed with it as easily as she as he gathered her closer with no more thoughts of resisting serena let her arms curve around his neck her head dropping back in invitation justin felt an almost savage need to plunder as he gripped her hair in his hand open your eyes he demanded while he watched the heavy lids opened to reveal eyes misted with pleasure look at me when i kiss you he murmured then his mouth crushed hers ruthless ravaging he could hear his own heartbeat raging in his chest as he plunged deeper he discovered tastes endless flavors in the recesses he explored as her tongue answered with equal urgency his eyes were only slits while he watched the misty pleasure in hers smolder into passion then become opaque on a moan they closed and his own vision blurred serena felt desire grip her as if it had claws wants needs secrets were exposed in one tumultuous explosion even as she hungered to fulfill them she realized he was a man who could strip her to the soul and she knew nothing of him frightened she struggled to free herself but he held her close his lips clinging until he was done in some sane portion of her brain she realized he would always take without regard for willingness when she was free serena took time to catch her breath justin watched her again with that strange ability he had for absolute stillness and absolute silence there would be no reading his eyes in a habitual defense serena turned her fear into anger if you read your brochure youll see that your passage fee doesnt include your pick of the crew certain things have no price serena something in his tone made her tremble it was as if hed already put his mark on her a mark she wouldnt easily erase she backed into the shadows stay away from me she warned him justin leaned back on the rail keeping his gaze on her silhouette no he said mildly ive already dealt the cards and the odds always favor the house well im not interested she hissed so deal me out turning she clattered down the stairs that led to the next deck slipping his hands into his pockets justin jingled change and smiled not a chance chapter two contents prev next serena slipped into a pair of khaki shorts then crawled under her bunk to find her sandals according to her calculations most of the passengers who would disembark for the day on nassau would have already done so there was little chance of being caught in the crush or of having to weave her way through the waiting cab drivers and tour guides on the docks since it would be her last trip there serena wanted to play tourist herself and pick up a few souvenirs to take home to her family cursing the sandal which had somehow tucked itself into a far corner she squiggled farther under the bunk youd think id learn to be neat after living in a closet for a year she muttered wiggling back out again she lay full length she could touch each side wall of the cabin in the other direction she had about two feet to spare beside the bunk there was a tiny mirrored dresser bolted to the floor and a cubbyhole that passed for closet space shed often thought it was a lucky thing she didnt suffer from claustrophobia still on the floor she pushed the sandals on her feet then began to check the contents of the tote bag she would carry a wallet and sunglasses well she couldnt think of anything else that was necessary serena reflected as she jumped lightly to her feet briefly she considered asking one of the other dealers if they wanted to join her then rejected the idea she wasnt in the best of moods and it wouldnt take anyone whod worked closely with her long to notice it and perhaps ferret out the reason the last thing serena wanted to discuss was justin blade in fact she added smartly as she pulled a khaki tennis cap over her hair the last thing she wanted to even think about was justin blade with his cool green eyes long unsmiling mouth and ruthless good looks when serena realized she was thinking about him she left her cabin in an even poorer mood only nine more days she reminded herself as she ignored the elevator and marched up the steps she could put up with anything for nine days with a smirk serena remembered the salesman from detroit who had haunted her table throughout a cruise the previous spring hed gone so far as to follow her down to the crews quarters and try to talk his way into her cabin shed dispatched him by claiming her lover was the chief engineer a swarthy italian with biceps like cinder blocks serenas smirk faded somehow she didnt think that tactic would work with a man like justin blade as she climbed upward the threadbare carpet of the crews decks was replaced by the bold red and gold pattern that graced the rest of the ship ornate light fixtures lit the landings rather than the plain glass shields of belowdecks coming out on the main level she exchanged a quick word of greeting with other members of the crew still on board two men lounged on either side of the gangway one in the crisp white uniform of the first mate the other in casual cruise wear as usual they were arguing intensely but without heat serena caught the eye of the cruise director first a small englishman with sandy hair and boundless energy she winked at him then planted herself in between the two men what diplomat put the two of you on gangway duty together she asked with a mock sigh i suppose ill have to play referee again what is it this time rob claims that mrs dewalter is a rich widow jack the englishman began in his rounded tones i say shes divorced a widow the first mate started again folding his arms a beautiful rich widow mrs dewalter serena mused tall jack began short sculptured red hair built rob added philistine jack put in mildly then addressed himself to serena a rather gamine face okay serena said slowly getting the picture of a woman shed seen briefly in the casino the night before widowed or divorced she inquired well used to the picky arguments between the two men what about rings exactly rob pounced on the question with a smirk for his associate she wore rings widows wear rings so do bubblebrained first mates jack pointed out with a glance at the signet ring on robs hand the point is serena interrupted before rob could retort what sort of rings a gold band a jeweled circle a chunk of ice as big as a hens egg rob told her giving jack another satisfied sneer rich widow divorced serena disagreed bursting his bubble sorry if we go with the percentages rob thats the most likely answer hens eggs are rarely worn for sentimental value after patting his cheek in consolation she gave him a snappy salute permission to go ashore sir get out of here he gave her a quick nudge go buy a straw mat my plans exactly with a laugh she jogged down the narrow iron steps to the dock the sun was brilliant the air moist and balmy serena bargained with a few boys who loitered on the docks hawking shell necklaces and decided it wouldnt be such a bad day after all she had hours before her to do as she chose in one of the prettiest tourist spots in the bahamas three dollars the leanlimbed black boy told her holding out handfuls of darkshelled necklaces he wore only a pair of shorts and a medallion that was slowly oxidizing his partner held a small portable radio to his ear moving lithely to the scratchy reggae beat you pirate serena said goodnaturedly one dollar the boy grinned sensing a true haggler oh pretty lady he began in his high singsong voice if i could i would give you the necklace for only your smile but then my father would beat me serena lifted a brow yes i can see how abused you are one dollar and a quarter twofifty i gathered the shells myself and strung them by the light of a candle with a laugh serena shook her head the next thing youll tell me is you fought off a school of sharks no sharks near our island my lady he said proudly two american dollars one and a half american dollars because i admire your imagination digging into her tote she drew out her wallet the money was out of her hands and into the pocket of his shorts in the blink of an eye for you pretty lady i will risk a beating serena chose her necklace then found herself giving him another quarter pirate she murmured as he grinned at her slinging her tote over her shoulder she started to walk away it was then that she saw him standing alone on the dock behind her serena wasnt as surprised as she thought she shouldve been but then somehow shed known shed see him he wore a plain beige tshirt that made his skin seem nearly copper and a faded pair of cutoffs that accentuated his lean muscular thighs and rangy build though the sun was glaring fiercely he wore no tinted glasses or other protection he didnt seem to need it just as she was debating whether she should simply walk by him he came toward her he moved lightly with the grace of a hunter a man she thought for no specific reason who was more accustomed to sand or grass than asphalt good morning justin took her hand as though the meeting had been arranged good morning she returned frostily refusing to give him any satisfaction by tugging on her hand didnt you sign up for any of the tours no i dont care to be directed he began to walk toward town with serena in tow biting back words of fury she spoke in a calculatedly pleasant voice several of the tours are very worthwhile theyre really the best way to see the island in the limited amount of time were in port youve been here before he said easily why dont you show me im off duty serena stated crisply and im going shopping fine since youve already begun he said glancing down at the necklace she still held in her hand where do you want to go next she decided to give up diplomacy altogether will you please go away i plan to enjoy myself today so do i alone she said pointedly stopping he turned to her ever hear about americans sticking together on foreign soil he asked as he took the necklace from her fingers and slipped it over her head no she returned wishing she didnt want so badly to smile ill explain it to you while we take a carriage ride im going shopping she reminded him as he led her toward town youll have a better idea where to buy what after a ride justin serena matched his stride because it was better than being hauled do you ever take no for an answer he appeared to think this over before he shook his head not that i remember i didnt think so she muttered then stood eyeing him stonily all right lets try it this way heads we go for a ride tails you go shopping reaching into his pocket he drew out a coin probably has two heads serena frowned suspiciously at the quarter i never cheat justin said solemnly as he held the coin between his forefinger and thumb for her inspection she could refuse and simply walk away serena considered but she found herself nodding the odds were even with a practiced flick of the wrist justin sent the coin spinning in the air nabbed it then flipped it over on the back of his hand heads somehow shed known it would be never bet against the house serena mumbled as she climbed into a carriage as the horse began its meandering clipclop down the street serena thought about maintaining a dignified silence for about thirty seconds knowing herself well she was forced to admit that if she hadnt wanted to get into the carriage she wouldnt have gotten into it not without a fuss so instead of a dignified silence serena dropped her tote bag on the floor of the carriage ignoring the charm of the narrow little street and stared at her companion what are you doing here he tossed an arm over the seat his fingers skimming over her hair enjoying the ride no smart answers justin you wanted my company and youve got it unless i decide to scream assault and jump out of the carriage he eyed her for a moment first in curiosity then in admiration shed do just that he dropped his fingers to the nape of her neck what do you want to know what are you doing on the celebration serena demanded shifting away from the pleasure his fingers brought her you dont strike me as the type of man whod go on a relaxing tropical cruise a friend recommended it i was restless he was persuasive his fingers brushed her neck again what are you doing on the celebration dealing blackjack his brow rose at her answer why i was restless in spite of herself serena smiled the driver started his monologue on the highlights of the island but noted that the couple wasnt interested in anything but each other he clicked his tongue at the horse then remained silent all right where are you from serena asked looking for a starting point i have a habit of placing people in regions and i cant place you justin smiled enigmatically i travel originally she persisted narrowing her eyes at the evasion nevada vegas serena nodded youve spent some time there i imagine its a good town for people with the right skills when he only shrugged serena studied his profile and thats how you make your living gambling justin turned his head until his eyes met hers yes why there were only two gamblers at that table last night serena mused you and the man from georgia though he was a milder sort and the others justin asked curiosity piqued oh the texan just likes the game he doesnt put that much thought into it the blonde from new york thinks shes a gambler because the gentle swaying of the carriage was soothing serena smiled a little and relaxed but she cant keep up with the cards or the odds shell end up dropping a bundle or winning on sheer luck the other man from new york watches the cards but doesnt know how to bet you have the concentration that separates a gambler from a player a very interesting theory justin reflected with a fingertip he slid serenas sunglasses down the bridge of her nose so he could see her eyes without interference do you play serena depends on the game and the odds she told him pushing the glasses back up i dont like to lose from the look in his eyes she realized they hadnt been speaking of cards but a more dangerous game smiling he leaned back again gesturing toward the right with his hand they have beautiful beaches here hmm as if on cue the driver began his spiel again giving a running commentary on the island until he brought them back to their starting point the streets were filled with people now the majority of them tourists with bulging shopping bags and cameras both sides of the road were lined with little shops some with their doors open all with their windows crowded with displays well thanks for the ride serena started to climb down but justin circled her waist with his hands and lifted her lightly he held her an inch above the ground for a moment while she gripped his shoulders for balance her lightness surprised him making him realize that her sexuality and style had blinded him to how small she was his fingers became abruptly gentle as he set her on the ground thanks serena managed after shed cleared her throat enjoy your day i intend to he told her as he took her hand again justin serena took a deep breath the time had come she decided to take a firm stand that brief instant when he had held her had reminded her how foolish she had been to relax even for a moment i took your carriage ride now im going shopping fine ill go with you im looking for souvenirs justin she said discouragingly you know tshirts straw boxes youll be bored im never bored you will be this time she told him as he began to meander down the street his fingers laced with hers i promise how about an ashtray that says welcome to nassau justin suggested blandly valiantly she swallowed a chuckled im going in here serena stated stopping on impulse at the first shop they came to and she determined she would stop at every shop on bay street until she successfully drove him crazy by the time her tote bag contained musical key chains assorted tshirts and shell boxes serena had forgotten she had wanted to be rid of him he made her laugh the gentlest seduction for a man she had instinctively termed a loner justin was easy company before long serena had not only stopped being resentful shed stopped being wary oh look she grabbed a coconut shell that had been fashioned into a grinning head elegant justin stated turning it over in his hands its ridiculous you fool laughing serena fished out her wallet and perfect for my brother caines ridiculous too well not all the time she added scrupulously the aisles of the straw market were crammed with people and merchandise but not so crowded that serena couldnt worm her way through in search of treasures spotting a large woven bag overhead she pointed justin obligingly lifted it down to her its nearly as big as you are he decided as she took it from him its not for me serena murmured studying it minutely my mother does a lot of needlework this should be handy for carting it around with her handmade serena glanced down at the large darkskinned woman in a rocking chair smoking a little brown pipe myself she added patting her generous bosom nothing made in hong kong at my stall you do beautiful work serena told her though the woman already interested her more than the bag lifting a large palm fan the islander nodded majestically and began to stir the sultry air serena was fascinated to see a ring on every thick finger you buy something pretty for your lady today she asked justin with a flash of white teeth no not yet justin said before serena could speak what do you suggest justin here the old woman cut serena off turning to push back some cloth at her right with a few wheezes and grunts she pulled out a creamcolored dashikistyle tunic with a border of bold rainbow stitches special the woman told justin pushing it into his hands lots of purple here like your ladys eyes blue serena began and im not lets see justin held it up in front of her surveying the effect through narrowed eyes yes it suits you he decided you wear it for your man tonight the woman advised already folding it into a bag very sexy an excellent idea justin agreed as he started to count out bills wait a minute serena pointed at him with the hand that still held the straw bag he is not my man not your man the woman went into peals of laughter rocking back and forth in the chair until it screeched in protest honey this is your man for sure you cant trick a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter no indeed you want the bag too well i serena stared down at the straw bag as if she hadnt a clue how it had gotten into her hand the bag too justin peeled off more bills thank you the money disappeared into her huge hand as she continued to rock you enjoy our island now wait but justin was already pulling her along you cant argue with a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter serena you never know what curse shell toss at you nonsense she stated but glanced cautiously over her shoulder to where the big woman sat rocking and you cant buy me clothes justin i dont even know you i already did well you shouldnt have and you paid for my mothers bag my compliments to your mother she sighed squinting as they emerged into daylight youre a very difficult man there you see you do know me taking her sunglasses from the top of her hat he slid them back in front of her eyes hungry yes the comers of her mouth twitched so serena gave up and smiled yes i am with his eyes on hers he slowly circled her palm with a fingertip how about a picnic on the beach it wasnt a simple matter to ignore the tingling that was now racing up her arm but she managed a casual shrug if you had food and if you had transportation and if you had some cold island concoction to drink i might be interested anything else justin asked as he stopped to lean on the hood of a mercedes not that i can think of okay lets go then pulling keys out of his pocket justin walked around to unlock the passenger door of the car with her tote bag dangling from her fingers serena stared do you mean this is your car no this is the car i rented theres a cooler in the trunk do you like cold chicken when he tossed the bags into the backseat serena put her hands on her hips you were awfully damn sure of yourself werent you just playing the odds he claimed then cupped her chin in his hands and brushed her lips with his just playing the odds serena dropped into the passenger seat not certain if she admired or detested his sheer nerve id like to know what cards he has up his sleeve she muttered as he rounded the hood to join her she noticed justin drove as he did everything else with the arrogant ease of control he seemed acclimated to driving on the left side of the road as if he did so daily they passed under the fat leaves of almond trees beside thick green grapes which would be purple in another month branches laden with the bright orange blossoms typical of the island danced in the breeze as they drew nearer to the sea he didnt speak and again she noticed he had that oddly admirable capacity for silence yet it wasnt soothing but exciting it occurred to her as they drove by the graceful colonial homes of the wealthy toward the public beaches that true relaxation was something not often experienced around a man like justin blade then the thought came quickly too quickly that relaxation was something she rarely looked for turning in her seat serena exchanged the tropical beauty of nassau for justins handsome almost hawkish features a gambler she mused a shipboard acquaintance serena had too much experience with the two to trust in any deep lasting relationship still she thought that if she were careful she might enjoy his companionship for a few days what harm could there be in getting to know him a bit better in spending some of her free time with him she wasnt like some of her coworkers in the casino who fell in and out of love with each other or lost their hearts to a passenger only to be miserable and desolated at the end of a cruise when a woman had managed to keep her heart in one piece for twentysix years she wasnt about to lose it in ten days was she justin turned to give her one of his cool unsmiling looks butterflies fluttered in her throat shed be very careful serena decided as if she were walking through a minefield what are you thinking about bombs she answered blandly deadly camouflaged bombs she gave him a quick innocent grin are we going to eat soon im starving with a last brief look justin pulled off to the side of the road hows this serena gazed out over the white sand to the intense blue of the ocean perfect stepping from the car she took a deep breath of blossoms and sea and hot sand i dont do this often when the ships in port i usually catch up on my sleep or my reading or give another shot at getting a tan on deck ive lost count of the number of times ive been docked at this island didnt you take the job on the ship to travel he took a small cooler and a folded blanket from the trunk no it was the people really i wanted to find out just how many kinds of people there were in the world serena slipped off her sandals to feel the warm sand on her feet we have more than five hundred in the crew and only ten americans youd be amazed at the variety of people you meet its like a floating un taking the blanket from under his arm serena snapped it open then let it billow onto the sand ive dealt cards to people from every continent she seated herself indian fashion on the edge of the blanket ill miss that miss it justin dropped down beside her are you quitting tossing her hat aside serena shook back her hair its time i want to catch up with my family for a while before i do anything else anything else in mind ive been thinking about a hotelcasino she pursed her lips in thought it was a project she intended to discuss with her father soon hed know the best way to go about financing property and a building youve had the experience justin mused believing she was considering applying for a job as a dealer the only difference would be youd be on dry land an idea germinated in his mind but he decided to wait before approaching her with it wheres your family hmm oh massachusetts her gaze fell on the cooler feed me when he opened the lid she noticed the napkins and cutlery came from the ship howd you manage that serena demanded the kitchen has a policy against making up picnic lunches i bribed them he said simply and handed her a drumstick oh she took a healthy bite good thinking whatd you get to drink for an answer justin drew out a thermos and two plastic glasses with the ships logo hows the chicken terrific eat she accepted the cup of dark pink liquid he handed her and sipped cautiously it was richly fruity smoothed with island rum ohoh the celebrations specialty she gave the drink a dubious look i usually make it a policy not to get within a yard of one of these youre on shore leave justin reminded her plucking a piece of chicken from the cooler and i want to live to tell about it she murmured for the moment she concentrated on the chicken and the pleasure of having no more to do than enjoy the breeze off the ocean i wouldve thought the beaches would be more crowded justin commented mmm serena nodded as she drank again most of the tourists who arent shopping are on guided tours or scubaing on the other side of the island its off season too she gestured with the drumstick before she dropped it onto a napkin the beaches arent so quiet during the rush but theres really a lot to see and do in nassau besides swimming and sunbathing mmm he watched her brush some sand from her thigh so our carriage driver said im surprised you didnt ferry over to paradise island to the casinos for the day are you leaning over he took her hair in his hand it isnt the only game in town justin touched his lips to hers intending to give her a light teasing kiss but the intention evaporated at the warm ripe taste how could i have forgotten how badly i want you he murmured then drowned her muffled response with hard unyielding pressure his tongue eased between lips he parted expertly as he pressed her back against the blanket feeling the muscled ridges of his body against hers serena started to object but her arms were already around him pulling him closer her mouth was already searching moving avidly under his the sun filtered through the leaves of the palm they lay under flickering light over her closed lids until it was only a red mist dancing in front of her eyes he kissed her as shed never been kissed before with lips and teeth and tongue nibbling then devouring seducing then possessing mouth clung to mouth in a taste more potent than the rum theyd sampled a gull soared toward the sea with a long wailing cry neither of them heard then with a flick of a wing he was gone as if hed never been when justin ran his hands down her arms serena felt his touch over every inch of her body her breasts ached from it her thighs trembled longing for the imaginary to be real she moaned and moved under him in invitation ripping his mouth from hers justin pressed it against her throat as he struggled to cling to the fine edge of reason he wanted her wanted to feel her soft skin grow hot and moist under his hands he wanted to touch every subtle curve and dip feel every pulse hum and taste and taste until they were both raging desire clawed at him with a sharpness hed never experienced before as her hands moved over his back pressing and kneading while he fought to remember they were not alone in a dark quiet room had a woman ever taken him so far with only a kiss he could only think of how much further she would take him when he was free to have all of her nibbling and sucking he ran his mouth up to her ear come back with me now serena he licked the lobe before he caught it between his teeth come back to my cabin with me i want you his words seemed to float into her consciousness almost drifting away before their meaning penetrated her passion no hearing her own weak protest serena fought to strengthen it no she repeated struggling away from him sitting up she hugged her knees until her breathing leveled no she said for a third time you have no right to to to what justin demanded grabbing her face in his hands and jerking it back to him to want you or to show you that you want me his eyes werent cool now but light and angry serena remembered her own first impression of ruthlessness and forced back a shudder before she pushed his hands away dont tell me what i want she tossed back if youre interested in a little shipboard fling go find somebody else you shouldnt have any trouble springing up she strode furiously toward the sea justin caught her arm and spun her around and dont tell me what im interested in he ordered curtly you didnt even know where we were i could have taken you on a public beach in broad daylight really she threw her head back infuriated that he spoke no less than the truth well if youre so sure of that why didnt you normally i like my privacy but keep pushing and ill make an exception and pigs fly she said evenly as she turned toward the surf a second time shed no more than gotten her toes wet when he grabbed her again for a moment serena thought she had miscalculated the rage in his eyes was nothing to tamper with but shed never had much luck controlling her temper once it had gotten beyond a certain point when justin dragged her against him she cursed him he wanted to crush that hot furious mouth again desire was raging through him as quickly as his temper and one fed the other knowing what the outcome would be if he gave in to the first justin gave in to the second serena landed on her bottom in the shallows shock covered her face first then utter fury you you animal scrambling up she launched herself at him intent only on revenge but when he grabbed her arms to ward her off he was grinning would you believe you look beautiful when youre angry the dip in the water hadnt cooled her temper youre going to pay for that one justin blade with her arms hampered she compensated with a kick but only ended up back in the water tangled with him get your hands off me you jerk she shoved submerged and came up sputtering nobody pushes a macgregor around and gets away with it in his attempt to prevent her from drowning both of them his hand connected with her breast the next moment he found that his mouth had covered hers again while his hand caressed through her wet clinging shirt though he felt her moan of response she continued to straggle taking them both under again he tasted salt and her lips he felt the slender thighs pressed against his as he rolled her over with the next wave with a muffled laugh he heard her swear at him again as she gulped in air then the water tossed their bodies together the surf sprayed and ebbed shifting the sand and shells beneath them they lay half covered with water breathing hard macgregor he repeated suddenly shaking his head to clear it drops of water from his hair splattered on her face serena macgregor she pushed her own dripping hair out of her eyes and tried to think her body was throbbing with the potent combination of anger and desire yes and the moment i remember some of those wonderful scottish curses im going to dump them all on you for the first time she saw pure surprise on his face it had the effect of draining her anger and replacing it with bewilderment then his eyes narrowed on an intense study of her features still panting serena stared back only to become more confused when the smile spread slowly over his face dropping his forehead on hers justin chuckled then roared with laughter the sound was appealing but as she started to respond to it serena concentrated on the uncomfortable lump of sand and shell digging into her back whats so funny she demanded im soaking wet and full of gritty sand ive little doubt that my skins been slashed by shells and i never even finished my lunch still laughing he lifted his head then gave her a brotherly kiss on the nose ask me again sometime come on lets rinse off and eat chapter three contents prev next serena macgregor justin shook his head as he reached into the narrow closet for a shirt it was he decided the first time hed been completely confounded in years when a man made his living by his wits he couldnt afford to be taken by surprise often strange that he hadnt noticed the family resemblance but then she had little in common physically with her large broadfeatured redhaired father she was more a modern version of the little painted miniature daniel kept in his library how many times had he been to that fortress in hyannis port over the years justin wondered rena as the family called her had always been away at school for some reason he had developed a picture of a scrawny bespectacled scholar with daniels flaming hair and annas eccentric dignity yes serena macgregor was quite a surprise odd he thought that she would take a job that would do little more than pay her room and board when she was reputed to have an iq that rivaled her fathers weight and enough capital to buy an ocean liner for her personal pleasure yacht then again the macgregors were a strange stubborn lot prone to the unexpected for a moment justin stood naked from the waist his shirt hanging forgotten from his fingertips his torso was dark and lean the skin stretched taut over his rib cage where on the left it was marred by a sixinch scar he was remembering the first time he had met daniel macgregor justin had been twentyfive a run of luck had given him enough money to buy out his partner in their small hotel on the strip in las vegas justin wanted to expand and remodel for that he needed financing banks were usually dubious about lending large sums of money to men who made their living with a deck of cards in any case justin didnt care for bankers with their smooth hands and dry voices and the indian in him had little faith in a promise made on paper then he heard of daniel macgregor in his own fashion justin checked out the stock wizard and financier he gained a picture of a tough eccentric scotsman who made his own rules and won justin contacted him diddled around by phone and letter for over a month then made his first trip to the fortress at hyannis port daniel worked out of his home he didnt care for office buildings where one had to depend on elevators and secretaries hed purchased his plot of land near the sea with the wealth he had earned first with his back and then with his mind daniel had realized early that he could earn more very satisfactorily with his mind then he had built his home and his empire to his own liking it was a huge barn of a house with massive corridors and enormous rooms daniel didnt like to be crowded justins first impression of him as he was led into the tower room that served as his office was of bulk and wit so youre blade daniel drummed his fingers on the surface of a desk that had been carved from a giant california redwood yes and youre macgregor a grin creased the broad face that i am sit down boy daniel noticed no change of expression at his use of the term and folded his hands over his chest as justin sat he liked the way justin moved hed judged men on less so you want a loan im offering an investment mr macgregor justin corrected him coolly the chair was designed to swallow a man justin sat in it with an ease that only accentuated the readiness to spring with my property as collateral of course ummhmm daniel steepled his hands as he continued to study the man across from him not a simple man he concluded observing the aristocratic features cool controlled and potentially violent comanche blood warriors blood but not a brawler daniel came from good warrior stock himself ummhmm he said again what are you worth boy an angry retort sprang to justins mind and was left to smolder reaching down he brought up a briefcase i have the financial papers the appraisals and so forth daniel gave a gusty laugh and waved them away you think youd have gotten this far if i didnt know all the figures you have in there what about you he demanded why should i lend my money to you justin set the briefcase back on the floor i pay my debts wouldnt last long in the business if you didnt and ill make you a great deal of money daniel laughed again until his blue eyes watered ive got money boy only a fool doesnt want more justin said quietly and daniel stopped laughing leaning back in his chair he nodded youre damn right then he grinned slapping his wide palm on the desk youre damn right how much to fix up that little hole in the wall of yours three hundred and fifty thousand justin answered without blinking daniel reached into his desk and drew out a bottle of scotch and a deck of cards stud poker they played for an hour speaking only to bet justin heard the reverberating gong of a grandfathers clock from somewhere deep in the house once someone knocked on the door daniel bellowed at them and they werent disturbed again the scent of justins cigar mixed with the aroma of whiskey and the ripe fragrance of the overblown roses on the windowsill after dropping fifteen hundred dollars daniel leaned back in his chair again youll need stockholders ive just gotten rid of a partner justin crushed out the butt of his cigar i dont want another stockholders boy daniel pushed the cards aside you want to make money youve got to spread it around first a man who plays like you do already knows that with his pale blue eyes on justins he considered a moment ill lend you the money and buy in for ten percent youre smart you keep sixty and spread the rest around after swirling the scotch he drained his glass and grinned youre going to be rich i know daniels gusty laugh shook the windowpane stay for dinner he said heaving himself out of his chair justin stayed for dinner and became rich he renamed his hotel comanche then made it into one of the finest hotelcasinos in vegas he bought a dying property in tahoe and repeated his success within a decade he had five thriving gambling hotels and interests in a variety of enterprises throughout the country and europe in the ten years since their meeting in the tower room justin had been to the macgregor home dozens of times entertained daniel and anna in his own hotels and fished with their sons but hed never met the daughter bright girl daniel would say of her from time to time but wont settle down needs a good man you should meet her and justin had steered clear of the not so subtle matchmaking attempts or so hed thought the old devil he murmured shrugging into the shirt it had been daniel who had pushed him into the cruise get away from the pressure hed insisted nothing like good sea air and halfnaked women to relax a man because hed been restless justin had considered it then had been trapped when daniel had mailed him the tickets with a request for a case of dutyfree scotch so the old pirate was still wheeling and dealing justin thought amused daniel would have known that justin would spend time in the casino on board and left the rest to chance with a quick laugh justin began doing up the buttons of his shirt chance he reflected with a stacked deck what would the old man have to say if he knew his friend and business associate had been wrestling with his daughter that afternoon with the predominant notion of getting her into his bed exasperated justin ran a hand through his hair daniel macgregors daughter good god justin grabbed his jacket from the closet then closed it with a bang it would serve the cagey devil right if he had seduced his daughter it would serve him right if he avoided her for the rest of the trip and never uttered a word about meeting her in the first place that would drive the scotsman up the wall justin caught his own reflection in the mirror a dark lean man in black and white and if you think you can stay away from her youre out of your mind he muttered when he walked into the casino serena was standing near the small black and white monitor talking to the blond man justin recognized as her supervisor she laughed at something he said then shook her head justins eyes narrowed fractionally as dale ran a finger down her cheek he knew what it would feel like soft and cool to the touch dale grinned then straightened her bow tie as he spoke to her in undertones even recognizing the emotion as petty jealousy justin had trouble controlling it in a matter of days serena had made him feel desire fury and jealousy emotions he normally kept in perfect balance cursing her father he walked over to her serena he caught the quick stiffening of her shoulders before she turned not dealing tonight ive just come on from my break she should have known the twentyfour hour respite wouldnt last i didnt see you in here last night i thought perhaps youd fallen overboard hearing dales sharp indrawn breath serena turned back to him dale this is justin blade when i didnt fall for his charm at the beach in nassau he tossed me into the water i see dale extended his hand ive never tried that one did it work shut up dale serena said sweetly youll have to excuse her dale told justin sea life makes some of us surly are you enjoying your trip mr blade yes justin glanced at serena its been quite an experience so far you will pardon me she said with exaggerated politeness i have to relieve tony turning she stalked over to table five because gritting her teeth hurt her jaw serena forced the muscles to relax she gave the three players at the table a professional smile which iced over as justin took a vacant stool good evening new deck breaking the seals serena shuffled the cards together doing her best to ignore justins calm steady stare he stacked what she estimated to be two hundred dollars worth of chips in the slot in front of him then lit a cigar after giving the cards a final snap she determined to see if she could clean him out cut justin took the thin sheet of plastic she offered as serena slipped the cards into their clear holder he pushed a twentyfivedollar marker forward she checked the table to see if all bets were placed then began at one point serena had him down to three chips and was feeling a grim satisfaction then she dealt him double sevens which he split counting twenty on one hand and twentyone on the other steadily he built the five chips to ten when it came time to rotate her table he infuriated her by moving with her serena renewed her vow to clean him out for the next twenty minutes she hardly noticed the other players she could see only justins unfathomable green eyes or his hand as he stood pat or took a hit though she was determined to beat him his chips gradually multiplied i got blackjack the shout from the college student at the end of the table broke her concentration serena glanced over to see him grinning i won three dollars he told the casino at large holding up the three light blue chips like a trophy he was serena concluded pleasantly drunk now he slapped the three chips back on the table then rubbed his palms together im ready to gamble laughing she reached for the cards again but her eyes met justins she saw humor the first expression shed seen in them for hours and warmed to it for a moment she wanted to reach across the table and touch him run her fingers through the thick soft hair that surrounded his lean face how could the simple light of laughter in his eyes make him seem so important hey the college student lifted his beer in a toast im on a streak yeah of one his girlfriend said dryly the interruption cleared serenas head lifting her chin she reached for the cards one smile wasnt going to make her forget she was here to beat him possible blackjack she said as she flipped over an ace for herself insurance the college students girlfriend plunked down a chip justin didnt move turning up the tip of her hole card serena was satisfied with a three it would give her plenty of room no blackjack she glanced at justins cards pleased to have dealt him a poor count sixteen hit or stand he merely motioned with his forefinger for a card serena had to bit back an oath as she turned over a four twenty he passed a hand over the cards to indicate he was satisfied and so you should be she thought resentfully turning up a jack to break the next player just freak luck she told herself bumping the college student up to eighteen four or fourteen she announced as she turned over her card with her eyes on justins she pulled another six or sixteen she said as if to him alone she bit back another oath as she drew the three of clubs dealer stands on nineteen she stated knowing dale would throw her overboard if she took another hit pays twenty raking in all the chips but justins she then slid another twentyfivedollar marker over the baize she thought she caught another glimpse of laughter in his eyes as he dropped it into his slot but this time it didnt warm her smoke hung in the air too thick to be completely banished by the cooling system serena didnt need to glance at her watch to know shed been standing on her feet for nearly ten consecutive hours gradually the clatter from the slots began to lessen the first indication that the late shift was almost over the couple at the end of the table looking heavyeyed began discussing the stopover in puerto rico the next day between them they cashed in five dollars worth of chips before they left a quick glance around showed serena that all but three of the tables were empty there were only two players left at hers justin and a woman she identified as the mrs dewalter who had captured jacks and robs attention the redhead was paying a great deal more attention to justin than to her cards feeling spiteful serena decided the diamond on her hand was vulgar and nearly grinned when she broke her at twentythree i guess this isnt my game the redhead said with a sulky pout she shifted toward justin so that her considerable cleavage was in full view you seem to be tremendously lucky do you have a system running a finger down his sleeve she smiled serena wondered how she would like her nose pressed into the green baize amused at the obvious tactic justin allowed his eyes to roam up from the deep plunge of her bodice to her face no you must have some secret she murmured id love to hear it over a drink i never drink when i play he blew a stream of smoke past her shoulder one interferes with the other bets serena said just a tad too sharply i believe ive had enough cards this evening letting her thighs brush justins she rose then dropped a hundred dollars worth of chips into her purse serena had the small satisfaction of knowing shed started with four ill be in the lounge she told justin with a last lingering smile before she turned away better luck next time serena said before she could stop herself she turned back to find justin grinning at her cash me in certainly then hell go chasing after that redhead with the size c personality she thought furiously quickly she stacked and counted his chips seven hundred and fifty dollars she calculated and only became more angry dales busy ill take care of this myself watching her stride away justin tried to remember her father it wasnt easy serena came back with a stack of crisp bills and a white slip attached to a clipboard swiftly she counted the money out then passed it across the table you had a profitable evening after slipping the paper into the compartment under the table she reached for the cards justin took her wrist another hand he asked enjoying the quick jump of her pulse beneath his fingers youve already cashed in she pointed out and tried to tug away he tightened his grip a different bet between you and me im sorry its against the rules to have side games with the passengers now if youll excuse me i have to close up the table no money he watched her eyes narrow in fury and smiled a walk on the deck if i win he said smoothly not interested not afraid to go one on one are you serena the hand that attempted to remove his from her wrist paused you still have house advantage he said quietly if i win she began then carefully removed his hand youll keep away from me for the rest of the cruise he considered the question it was after all a much wiser course than the one he was pursuing taking a last puff on his cigar he crushed it out it wouldnt be the first time he left his fate to the cards deal he glanced at the two and five in front of him then at the ten serena had showing nodding for a hit he drew a queen his first thought was to stand but another glance at serena showed him she looked entirely too pleased with herself hed have bet every dollar in his pocket she had an eight or better in the hole keeping his eyes on hers he gestured for another card damn she tossed down the four of diamonds and glared at him i swear justin one day im going to beat you disgusted she turned over the jack she had in the hole no he rose slipping his hands into his pockets because youre trying to beat me not the cards ill wait for you outside dale glanced over to see his best blackjack dealer sticking her tongue out at the back of a passenger leaning back against the wall justin watched serena through the glass doors of the casino he thought he could almost see the combination of annoyance and frustration simmering around her he felt much the same way himself with a shrug he reminded himself that he had left it up to chance the bet could have been as easily lost as won idly he fingered a twentyfivedollar chip still in his pocket some might say hed had an unusual ran of luck then again he mused it might have been luckier to have lost that final bet if he continued to see serena his life wasnt going to be uncomplicated he might have been able to ignore the feeling of having daniel macgregor looking over his shoulder if he could have convinced himself that taking her to bed would get her out of his system but those were very long odds she was the first woman justin had ever known who had threatened to become a permanent part of his thoughts and what would she say he wondered if i told her her father had arranged the entire scenario from his fortress in hyannis port a smile curved the corners of his mouth shed skin the old man and hang him up to dry he concluded watching serena walk toward the doors justin decided to save that little bombshell for another day i suppose you have a right to smile serena said coolly as she let the door close behind her youre on quite a winning streak justin took her hand and in an unexpectedly courtly gesture kissed her fingers i intend for it to go on a lot longer before its broken youre really quite beautiful serena disconcerted she stared at him when im angry she finished struggling not to be charmed he turned her hand over and kissed her palm watching her really quite beautiful dont try to throw me off by being nice unconsciously she laced her fingers with his theres nothing nice about you no he agreed lets go out i imagine you could use some fresh air i agreed to take a walk together they began to climb the stairs thats all i agreed to ummhmm and the moons nearly full howd you do tonight the casino when he opened the door the wind rushed in delightfully warm and clean better than usual weve been operating at a loss since spring too many nickel slots cuts your profit margin he slipped an arm around her waist as serena looked up at him youd make more at the tables if some of your dealers were sharper its hard to stay sharp when you work up to sixty hours a week for peanuts she said ruefully anyway the turnovers constant most of them have six weeks training tops working up from cashier to croupier and a large percentage of them dont stay more than a couple of runs because they find out its not the floating vacation they thought it was without realizing she hooked her arm around his waist as he matched his stride to hers this is my favorite part what late at night when the ships quiet you cant hear anything but the sea if i had a porthole in my cabin id leave it open all night no porthole his hand began to move rhythmically up and down her back only passengers and officers have outside cabins she arched against his hand sighing as it soothed her tired muscles still i wouldnt trade this past year for anything its been like finding a second family your familys important to you he asked thinking of daniel of course because she found it an odd question serena tilted her head back to look at him as he angled his to meet her eyes her lips nearly skimmed his jaw dont do that she murmured what and the word soft and quiet whispered over her parted lips you know very well what dropping her arm she moved away from him toward the rail my family she said more steadily as she turned resting her arms across the wood has always been the most important part of my life the loyalty is sometimes uncomfortably fierce but necessary to all of us what about you she looked totally and unconsciously intriguing her soft curves hidden yet enhanced by the mannish tux her once tidy hairstyle being whipped apart by the wind her face was tilted back so that a splash of moonlight marbleized her skin my family struggling to pick up the thread of the conversation he moved to stand in front of her i have a sister diana shes ten years younger weve never been close your parents they died when i was sixteen diana went to live with an aunt i dont think ive seen her in practically twenty years serenas automatic wave of sympathy was immediately quelled thats disgraceful my aunts never approved of my profession he said dryly though she never questions the money for dianas support he mused moving his hands to the buttons of serenas jacket it was easier for diana if i didnt interfere what right does your aunt have to approve or disapprove serena demanded too inflamed to notice how deftly he was unbuttoning her jacket shes your sister my aunts a firm believer that gambling is the devils work shes a grandeau from the french part of the family serena shook her head at his logic so what are you blade his eyes locked on hers comanche his face was very close closer than she had realized though she felt the wind flutter through the thin fabric of her shirt she didnt yet understand what he had done serena found herself swallowing as his eyes held hers had there been a threat in those two words or had it been her imagination i should have known she managed i suppose i let your eyes throw me off from the drops of french and welsh blood that slipped through my father was almost pure and my mother descended from the line of a comanche brave and a french settler slowly his eyes never leaving hers he pulled loose the tie at her throat serena swallowed again but didnt move the story goes that one of my ancestors saw a woman with golden hair alone near a creek bed she had a basket of laundry and was singing as she washed he was a fierce warrior who had killed many of her people to protect his land when he saw her he wanted her justin released the buttons of her blouse one by one so he took her thats barbaric she managed over a suddenly dry throat he kidnapped her stole her away from her family a few days later she sunk a knife into his shoulder trying to escape justin continued quietly but when she saw his blood on her hands she didnt run she stayed and nursed him and gave him greeneyed sons and daughters perhaps it took more courage to stay than to use the knife justin smiled noting the tremor in her voice and the steadiness of her eyes he gave her a name that translates to prize of gold and never took another woman so its a tradition when one of my people sees a woman with golden hair who he wants he takes his mouth crushed down on hers whirling her quickly into passion with his hands he dove into her hair dislodging pins that danced in the wind before they fell into the waves below serena grabbed his shoulders almost afraid she would follow them plunging down into the dark fast water for surely this was how it felt to spiral down helpless from a high point toward the unknown her heart was racing even before his palm covered it a contact of hard flesh against soft man against woman on a moan she tightened her grip as if he were a life line in the sea that had gone suddenly from calm to tumultuous forgetting her smallness he took her into his hand abandoning both gentleness and reason no man had ever dared touch her that way perhaps that was why she allowed it he dared without request without practiced words of seduction it was a force consuming them both an impulse too old and too basic to be denied her body throbbed to be touched while her thoughts tangled it took over showing them both what she needed the wild ruthless kisses that raced down her throat only made her crave more the warm smoothing breeze from the sea became like small flames to heighten her fever she drew the moist air into her lungs and felt it turn to fire the hand at her breast kneaded tormented while the other slipped up her naked back to find some tiny point near her spine a press of his finger turned her legs to jelly she gasped as she arched against him while waves of unbelievable pleasure ran through her no serenas voice sounded thin and far off no dont but he pressed his lips to hers to devour her trembling protests her mouth was too hungry to heed the warning that had sounded in her brain it clung to his relishing the light flavor of salt spray whatever magic his fingers held it dominated her now she would give anything he asked so long as he never stopped touching her digging her hands into his hair she dragged him closer without noticing the fine mist of dampness that lay on it when her lips were free with his buried at her throat she could do no more than breathe his name the moistness on her face went unfelt all her senses were bound up in what his hands and lips could bring her then he was moving and she swayed as he took her away from the rail weak with desire serena leaned against him while he stroked her hair youre getting drenched justin murmured but couldnt prevent his lips from brushing over the damp crown of her head couldnt prevent himself from breathing in its fragrance lets go in what dazed serena opened her eyes and saw the fine curtain of rain its raining as the cool water revived her she shook her head she felt she had been in a dream to be wakened by a brisk slap in the face i pushing away from him she ran a hand through her hair i have to get some sleep he finished he had come too close justin discovered to taking her like a maniac where they had stood yes feeling raindrops on her bare flesh serena clutched her jacket together yes its late her eyes were still clouded and confused as she glanced around the deck its raining she repeated there was something about her abrupt vulnerability that made justin want her more than he had moments before and made it impossible to take her sticking his hands into his pockets he balled them briefly into fists damn daniel macgregor he thought fiercely the scotsman set a fine trap with prime bait if he took her now it would almost certainly destroy his relationship with a man hed come close to loving if he didnt he would only go on wanting her if he waited well that was a gamble good night serena she stood irresolute a moment wanting to race inside to sanity wanting to fall into his arms and madness taking a deep breath she clutched her jacket tighter good night serena went quickly knowing it took only a moment to change a mind chapter four contents prev next because she thought it would be deserted serena chose the veranda deck aft anyone still on board would more likely opt for the larger pool area with its proximity to the lido bar and grill for sunning most of the passengers would be seeing the sights in san juan walking the brick streets in the historical section exploring forts snapping pictures of the surrounding mountains anyone who dribbled back during the day wasnt likely to disturb her on the quiet rear deck shed nearly overslept forgetting she was slated to help dale figure last nights take because it had been dawn before serena had finally drifted off shed managed only four hours sleep before the alarm had shocked her awake with her work finished for the morning shed come to lie in the midday sun and bake the tiredness from her body serena didnt want to think as she had during those long quiet hours between three am and dawn she knew she was too weary to dwell on what had happened the previous evening but even as she stretched out on a deck chair everything came back to play in her head what was it that happened to her every time justins lips touched hers whatever it was serena had sworn she wouldnt let it happen again then had been helpless to prevent it what was it about him that kept pulling her along dragging her closer to the edge of something fatal each time it became more difficult to remember to back away serena released the halter strings to the top of her bikini and settled back it might be smarter all in all she decided to give the whole business some serious thought rather than to dance around it if there was one common thread running through the macgregor clan it was that they were realists face a problem headon and mow it down that serena thought with a quick grin should have been their clan motto so for the problem of justin blade he was dangerously attractive dangerous serena concluded because the attraction had hit her in the first instant and hadnt abated in the least and it wasnt merely his looks she mused adjusting her sunglasses looks could easily be discounted it was that strength and the sex and the quietly domineering style all three challenged her to match him point for point it was very simply an irresistible combination to a woman who rarely chose the easy path did she like him serena gave an automatic snort then became thoughtful well she asked herself again did she the answer came with the memories of an easy afternoon in nassau that quick shared joke in the casino the natural way her hand fit with his perhaps she did like him serena admitted uncomfortably a little but she pushed her sunglasses more firmly on her nose and shut her eyes that wasnt the point the point was what was she going to do about him for the next five days she couldnt hide even if it had been physically possible while they were both on the same ship serenas pride would never have allowed it no she would have to deal with him and with herself the idea that she could spend some time with him learn to know him a bit better could no longer be classified as harmless if she were honest serena would have to admit that she had known from the outset that there was nothing harmless about justin blade that took her full circle back to the basic attraction and this she decided as she rolled over onto her stomach wasnt solving anything she had only a few more days aboard the celebration before she headed home for an extended visit unemployed wrinkling her nose she shifted until she was comfortable with the thick plastic strips of the lounge with the rest of her life to decide upon what to do about an encounter with an itinerant gambler should hardly take precedence in her thoughts it was only serena concluded because she was allowing it to now that she had admitted that she found justin both attractive and interesting that should be the end of it her course was really quite simple treat him as she would treat any other passenger polite and friendly well she amended dropping her sunglasses on the deck not too friendly and no more side bets serena added firmly before she shut her eyes the mans luck was phenomenal and the sun was much too warm the deck much too quiet to think about complications sighing she pillowed her head on her hands and slept warm and soothing these sensations drifted through her causing serena to sigh again hazy thoughts of floating naked on a raft while the sun stroked her skin brought a small sound of pleasure to her lips she could have floated endlessly without destination she felt a freedom no an abandonment she was alone in a blue sea or perhaps in a dense green jungle a secret solitary place where there were no restrictions there the sun caressed her body like lovers hands she could feel its stroking bringing hot sleepy pleasure languid fingers of sunlight lazily arousing delicately seducing the brush of a butterfly against her ear made her smile serena lay still not wanting to disturb it soft as dew it fluttered to her cheek resting a moment as though it had found a pungent blossom with a final sweep of wings it whispered her name at the corner of her mouth how strange she thought with a tiny moan of pleasure for a butterfly to know her name shifting her shoulders toward the gentle caress on her back serena commanded her eyes to open wanting to see the colors of those soft wings she saw only the cool depthless green of justins eyes for a moment serena stared into them too content to be confused i thought you were a butterfly she murmured as she closed her eyes again did you smiling justin touched his lips to the corner of hers a second time mmmhmm it came out as a long lazy sigh how did you get here where enjoying her gentle stretching beneath his palm he continued to stroke her back wherever we are serena murmured did you float on a raft no he knew from the rhythm of her breathing by that brief look into her dark misty eyes that she was already aroused disoriented enough to be completely pliant her absolute vulnerability touched off twin urges to take and to protect as each one fought for supremacy justin brushed a kiss over her bare shoulder youve been dreaming oh serena didnt see why it mattered as long as those wonderful warm caresses continued it feels good yes justin traced a fingertip down her spine it does the touch brought a quick shudder a more concentrated arousal serenas eyes flew open justin yes abruptly awake and throbbing serena lifted herself up on her elbows what are you doing here briefly his eyes passed over the small swatch of material that tenuously clung to her breasts you already asked me that with your skin you shouldnt lie in the sun unprotected he slid his hand down her back spreading the cream hed applied when his fingers pressed near the base of her spine she caught her breath stop it she demanded furious that her voice was shaky youre very sensitive he murmured the desire in her eyes had flared quickly darkening and widening even as she struggled against it it seems a pity were never at the appropriate spot at the appropriate time justin serena shifted away from his hand barely remembering to hold the top of her bikini in place i really wish youd let me get some rest as she sat up she meticulously tied her halter strings behind her neck i had to get up early this morning and the casino opens as soon as we leave port tonight stretching out again she dismissed him i want a nap i want to talk to you he shifted lightly on the balls of his feet where he had crouched beside her then rose well i dont she broke off as her gaze traveled up long muscular legs to narrow hips encased in brief black trunks to a hard lean torso it was a body that hinted at strength and sinew and speed quickly serena averted her gaze reaching behind her to adjust the back of the deck chair i dont want to talk to you she finished popping her sunglasses back on her nose why dont you go visit san juan like everyone else i have a proposition i bet you do without waiting for an invitation justin nudged her legs over and sat on the end of the chair business serena slid her legs farther away so that her skin wouldnt rub against his and distract her im not interested in your business go get your own chair isnt there a rule about crew being rude to passengers report me she invited him its my last week on the job thats what i want to talk to you about justin ran a lotionslick palm along her thigh justin good he smiled at her furious face i have your attention youre going to have a fractured nose if you dont leave me alone she told him exasperated do you always have such a difficult time concentrating on a business discussion justin asked mildly not a legitimate one then we shouldnt have any problem flopping back on the chair serena eyed him from behind the tinted glasses she spotted the jagged white scar along his ribs that looks as if it was nasty she said with a cool smile a present from a jealous husband a bigot with a knife his answer was as cool as her question devoid of emotion a pain shot into her sharp and unexpected it caught with a gasp in her throat as she could almost see the blade slicing into flesh that was a stupid thing to say im sorry she glanced at the scar again nearly sick from her own careless words it mustve been serious justin thought of the drugged two weeks in the hospital ward then shrugged it was a long time ago what happened she couldnt prevent herself from asking perhaps because some intimate part of her shared the pain without knowing the cause justin studied her for a moment he didnt think about the incident anymore perhaps he hadnt given it more than a cursory thought in fifteen years still it was like the scar a part of him it might be better if she knew taking a towel from the deck he wiped his hands i was in a bar in eastern nevada one of the regulars didnt care to breathe the same air as an indian i had a beer to finish so i suggested he breathe somewhere else a very cold mirthless smile touched his mouth i was young enough to find some enjoyment in the prospect of a brawl at eighteen a fistfight relieves a lot of frustrations but you didnt get that scar from a fistfight she murmured justin lifted a brow in acknowledgement most things tend to get out of hand when liquors involved he was drunk and feeling mean almost absently he ran a finger down the line of the scar in a habitual gesture he thought hed conquered years before it started predictably enough words shoves fists then he had a knife he was probably too drunk to realize what he was doing but he had it into me oh god automatically serena reached out to take his hand thats horrible why didnt someone call the police it flashed through his mind that despite the wealth the extensive education and traveling shed lived a sheltered life perhaps because of it things arent always done that way he said simply but he stabbed you she said with a mixture of logic and revulsion he must have been arrested no justins gaze remained as calm and steady as his voice i killed him at the fiat statement serenas hand went limp in his justin could see her eyes grow wide and shocked behind the tinted glasses he felt her instant automatic withdrawal then just as quickly her fingers tightened on his again selfdefense she said with only a trace of a tremor in her voice he said nothing all those years ago he had needed that kind of simple unquestioning faith during the pain of his hospital days the cold solitary fear in his cell awaiting trial thered been no one then to believe in him no one to give him back any portion of the hope and trust he had lost during those endless empty days as she cupped his hand between both of hers something moved inside him and crept out of a longclosed lock i grabbed for the knife justin said at length we fell the next thing i knew i was waking up in the hospital charged with seconddegree murder but it was his knife there was quick outrage in her voice and no question he attacked you it took a while for that to come out justin could remember every hour every minute of the waiting the smell of the cell the faces in the courtroom the fear and fury when it did i was acquitted with how many other scars serena wondered no one wanted to testify for you she said instinctively the others in the bar that night i wasnt one of them he said flatly but they stuck to the truth when they were under oath it must have been a frightening experience for a boy to go through when justin only lifted a brow serena tried to find a smile my father would say that a mans not a man until hes thirty or maybe its forty he isnt always consistent how well he knew justin thought he was tempted to tell her then and there about his relationship with daniel but made himself stick with his original plan justin blade was consistent i told you about this because if you accept my offer youd probably hear snatches of it anyway and id rather you had it from me all at once he saw that he had her curiosity now which was better than her attention what kind of offer she asked warily a job a job serena repeated then laughed what do you want to do set up a floating blackjack game with me as dealer i had something a bit more stationary in mind justin murmured as his eyes drifted down just how secure are those skinny little strings secure enough she barely resisted the urge to tug at them why dont you tell me exactly what you have in mind justin straight all right abruptly the humor left his eyes they were cool again and level on hers ive watched you work youre very good not just with the cards but with people youre a quick judge of the players and your table is nearly always full while some of the others thin out regularly in addition to that you know how to handle a player when hes annoyed with the cards or had a bit too much to drink all in all he added in the same impersonal tone youve got a lot of style not certain what he was leading up to and not wanting to be too pleased by his words serena moved her shoulders carelessly so so ive a use for someone with your talents his expression didnt change when her eyes narrowed justin merely folded his legs under him and watched her looking serena thought a bit too much like his infamous kidnapping ancestor must have looked pushing her glasses on top of her head serena stared straight back at him what sort of use she asked coolly managing my casino in atlantic city he had the satisfaction of seeing incredulity cover her face you own a casino in atlantic city without seeming to move at all justin rested his hands lightly on his knees yes serena frowned at him through narrowed eyes he thought amused that her trust didnt come as easily this time then slowly she let out a breath comanche serena murmured theres one in vegas too and in tahoe i think leaning back she closed her eyes so the itinerant gambler turned out to be a very wealthy very successful businessman i should have known even more amused by her reaction justin relaxed hed first thought of offering her a job during the morning in nassau then it had been part whim part business studying her strong elegant face he knew it was already more than that more than it should be that was something he would deal with after hed arranged things i fired my manager just before i left justin went on not waiting for serena to open her eyes again a bit of trouble with the take she opened them now her brows arching he cheated you tried justin corrected her mildly no one cheats me no serena agreed im sure they dont she drew her knees up so that they would no longer be touching then wrapped her arms around them why do you want me to work for you justin had the uncomfortable feeling she knew it was more than hed said even though he himself wasnt certain of all the reasons he was only sure that he wanted her in his world where he could see and touch her ive told you he said simply too cautious to stroke her skin again if you have three successful hotels five he corrected her five she gave him a slight nod then i cant imagine you as a man who runs his business on impulse or anything else on impulse she added silently you must know that managing a casino like yours is a long way from dealing cards on a cruise liner you probably have twice the tables we do and a take that would make our little profit look like bubblegum money justin allowed himself a smile it was true enough of course if you dont think you can handle it i didnt say i couldnt handle it she retorted then scowled at him youre very clever arent you think about it he suggested hooking his finger around one of hers you said yourself you have no definite plans after this cruise no definite plans she mused just a vague notion about opening her own place she still wanted her own place but wouldnt it be logical to manage someone elses until she learned a bit more ill think about it serena said slowly hardly noticing that justins thumb was moving lightly up and down the length of her finger good with his free hand he reached up idly plucking a pin from her hair we can have dinner in san juan and discuss the practicalities letting the first pin drop justin drew out another will you stop that annoyed serena grabbed his wrist every time i see you youre tossing my pins away i wont have one left by the end of the cruise i like it down he ran his fingers through the loosely secured bun and scattered the rest of the pins i like to see it fall down shoving his hand away serena scrambled up when he used that tone a smart woman kept her distance im not having dinner with you in san juan or anywhere else she snatched up the dashiki shed worn over her suit and i believe ive thought long enough about your proposition afraid unfolding his legs justin rose in a smooth catlike movement no she met his eyes calmly so that he would understand she spoke the truth good pleased with the strong stubborn look he cupped his hands around the base of her neck fear was too ordinary and too easily defeated but take a few days to think this over the business offer is exactly that it has nothing to do with you and me being lovers the firm kneading of his fingers at the back of her neck had nearly seduced her into relaxing his words had her eyes flashing were not lovers we will be he said holding her still with one hand as he stepped closer soon were both people who take what we want serena we want each other why dont you put your ego down for a while justin it must be getting heavy when his hand went to her lotioned back to press her closer she remained stiff unwilling to struggle unwilling to lose gamblers believe in fate though her back was straight and unyielding he felt the soft give of breasts against his chest only a narrow band of material separated flesh from flesh youre as much a gambler as i am serena macgregor lowering his head he nibbled along her jawline weve both got to play with the hand we were dealt how long could she resist that honeyed tone and clever mouth already serena could feel the hammer of her heart against her ribs and the heavy fluid weakness in her limbs if she resisted she would lose perhaps her brain began to cloud and frantically she forced the silken mists away perhaps this time she would play the game his way and earn a draw fighting her own need to surrender she took a dangerous gamble slowly softly she ran her hands up his naked back letting her fingernails lightly rake his skin when his mouth pressed against her throat her knees nearly buckled but she bit down hard on the inside of her lip pain would help her keep control she rubbed against him sinuously while her fingers crept up to trace patterns on the base of his neck his heartbeat began to thud racing with hers his mouth grew hungry but she turned so that his lips fell anywhere but on hers if he kissed her locked her in one of those deep mindless feasts of mouth on mouth shed be lost his breath raged unsteadily over her ear wrenching a moan from her serena squeezed her eyes tightly straggling not to feel all the things he could so effortlessly make her feel she pressed her lips to his throat telling herself that it wasnt for the taste of him but only the next step in the game she wouldnt be weakened by the dark male flavor by the feel of muscle taut and strong under her hands this time this time she promised herself shed bring him to his knees she heard him groan felt the light quiver run through him as he crushed her against him too astonished by the newly discovered power to be pleased with it serena merely clung he whispered something low in a primitive tongue she didnt understand before he buried his face in her hair her heart urged her to stay as she was warmed flesh to warmed flesh could it feel so right if she didnt belong there if her body had not been fashioned for this could they fit together so unerringly if her mouth had not been made for his would it heat at even the thought of a kiss no serena caught herself before the weakness could spread too far she wouldnt let herself be ruled by a need or by a man she pushed firmly away knowing she was free only because shed caught him off guard slowly praying her legs would hold her she bent down to retrieve the dashiki which had fallen to the deck without a word serena slipped it over her head it gave her a moment just a moment to brace herself before she looked at him she saw desire a reckless desire that had her heart thudding painfully in his eyes and she saw the wariness it strengthened her to know hed been no more prepared for the attack on the senses than she had been because of it she had the edge if and when i decide i want to make love with you youll know she said it calmly then turned and walked away without a backward glance her knees were shaking justin watched her oh he could drag her back he thought as his hand curled into a fist he could drag her to his cabin and have her within a matter of moments he could say the hell with the game plan and assuage this gnawing hunger that seemed to be eating him from the inside out if once just once he was truly alone with her with care justin unclenched his hand it never paid to let emotions rule your moves that was something hed learned too many years ago to forget now bending he picked up the bottle of lotion serena had left beside her chair shed been intrigued with his offer he mused absently tightening the cap and while she might try to shrug it off the idea had been planted after a year of following orders the notion of giving them would appeal to her having come fresh from a victory she would consider herself well able to handle him on the personal front he counted on there being enough macgregor in her to make a challenge irresistible a slow cool smile touched his mouth justin was just as susceptible to a challenge as serena hed made his bid he decided for the moment hed let it stand serenas room was completely dark when the phone beside her bunk shrilled blindly she groped about fumbling for the button of the alarm when this did nothing to stop the ringing she pushed at it in annoyance then knocked the receiver from the phone it conked her smartly against the temple ouch damn it good morning little girl hazy with sleep and rubbing her head she cradled the receiver against her ear dad hows life on the high seas he asked in a booming cheerful voice that made her wince i um running her tongue over her teeth serena struggled to wake up come on girl speak up dad its she pushed at her alarm again until she could read the luminous dial its barely six am a good sailors up with the dawn he told her uhhuh good night dad your mother wants to know when youll be home even half asleep serena grinned anna macgregor had never been a mother hen but daniel well be in miami saturday afternoon i should be home by sunday are you going to have a brass band hah one highland chief with a bagpipe you were always the sassy one rena he tried to sound stern and ended up sounding proud your mother wants to know if theyre feeding you proper she swallowed a giggle we get a whole loaf of barley bread a week and salt pork on sundays how is mom fine shes already gone to the hospital to cut somebody open alan and caine daniel gave a snort who sees them he demanded it breaks your mothers heart that her childrenve forgotten their parents not one grandchild to bounce on her knee inconsiderate of us serena agreed dryly now if alan had married that pretty judson girl she walked like a duck serena reminded him bluntly alanll pick his own wife when hes ready hah daniel said again got his nose buried down in dc caines still sowing oats he shouldve been done with and you float around on some boat ship your poor mother will never live to hold her first grandchild with a heavy sigh he lit one of the fat cigars anna hadnt managed to confiscate did you wake me up at six am to lecture me about the procreation of the macgregor line thats nothing to curl your lip at little girl the clan im not curling my lip sheassured him wanting to avoid a long passionate diatribe and i plan to stay home awhile so you can start bullying me after sunday now is that any way to talk he demanded offended why ive never so much as raised my hand to you youre the best father ive ever had she said soothingly ill buy you a case of scotch in st thomas well now pleased with the idea he softened then remembered another promised case of scotch and his main purpose for the predawn call met any interesting people on the cruise rena mmm i could write a book im really going to miss the rest of the crew what about passengers he persisted daniel puffed on his cigar and tried his hand at smoke rings get any real gamblers now and again her thoughts drifted to justin just as daniels did i suppose youve had your hands full with the men she gave a noncommittal grunt and shifted to her back one man anyway she mused course theres nothing wrong with a bit of romance now and then he added in a jovial voice providing the mans got good blood and some starch a true gambler has to have a sharp brain would you feel better if i told you i was planning to run off with one which one he demanded narrowing his eyes no one serena returned firmly now im going back to sleep be sure to get rid of all that cigar ash before mom gets home daniel scowled at the phone then at the butt in his hands ill see you and mom sunday and by the way i love you you old pirate eat a decent breakfast he ordered before he hung up thoughtfully daniel leaned back in his massive chair rena had always been a tough egg to crack he mused as for justin well if justin blade hadnt made it his business to spend a tropical evening or two in her company then he wasnt the man daniel thought he was he tapped out his cigar reminding himself to dispose of the evidence before anna came home damned if he was wrong about justin blade daniel macgregor knew the make of a man he gave himself a moments pleasure speculating about a blackhaired violeteyed grandchild a boy first he decided though he wouldnt carry the macgregor name and that was a pity hed carry macgregor blood theyd name him after his grandfather in a fine mood daniel picked up the phone thinking he might as well badger his other children while he was at it chapter five contents prev next as much as she told herself it wasnt any of her business serena couldnt help wondering what justin was up to for two days she hadnt had a glimpse of him during that time he hadnt set foot inside the casino nor had he been on the port side of the promenade deck indulging in one of the private games at least not when she just happened to stroll out there during her break what serena demanded of herself as she prepared for her last free day of the cruise was he doing a gambler was supposed to gamble wasnt he he wasnt the kind to settle for a bingo game in the lounge hes doing it on purpose she decided as she buttoned up her scarlet romper hes trying to get to me she wouldnt have been the least surprised if while she had been working and wondering he had spent his time lazing in the sun somewhere knowing it infuriating hed probably had that cozy little drink with mrs dewaiter too she concluded and grabbed her brush taking it through her hair in hard quick strokes serena scowled at herself in the small mirror so what she said aloud if hes nipping around her ankles hes not nipping around mine the last thing shed wanted on her final days on the ship was a constant battle verbal or otherwise so it was just as well that hed found something else to keep him occupied that saved her the trouble of ignoring him he stirred her up when he was around he stirred her up when he wasnt around too she thought and tossed the brush back on the dresser where was the justice i wont think about it serena decided flopping down on the floor to slip on her sandals im going to do some snorkeling buy some trinkets a case of scotch and she added grimly im going to enjoy myself i wont give him another thought its deliberate she thought slapping a sandal against her palm he dangled that business about managing his casino in front of my nose then disappeared he knew it would drive me crazy she decided with fresh frustration well two can play serena reminded herself as she wiggled her foot into the sandal ill stay out of his way for the next couple of days if i have to claim seasickness and lock myself in my cabin and that she determined would be a lesson to him serena continued to frown when the knock sounded on her door its open she called shortly the last person shed expected to see in her doorway was justin the last thing shed expected to feel was pleasure oh my god she realized ive missed him he saw the quick smile light in her eyes before she successfully turned it into a glare morning passengers arent permitted on this deck she told him in a tone that was both cool and prim oh he stepped inside shutting the door behind him ignoring her hiss of annoyance justin glanced around the tiny cabin it should have been drab and colorless with its plain bunk and white walls but shed given it an odd sort of style with only a few touches a flashy painting of sailboats a bottlegreen freeform bowl filled with crushed shells a boldly striped needlepoint pillow that reminded him of anna the pantry in hyannis port he mused was larger no wasted space he ventured letting his eyes roam back to her its my space serena reminded him and its strictly against the rules for you to be in here would you go away before you get me fired youve already quit easing between her and the bunk justin took a closer look at the painting this is very good the harbor here in st thomas yes serena stayed seated deliberately knowing it was next to impossible for two people to stand in the cabin without touching im sorry i cant entertain you justin but im just on my way out with an absent sound of agreement he sat on the bunk sturdy he commented nudging a reluctant smile from her it was hard as a rock its great for the back they sat eyeing each other for a moment as she fought off the simple pleasure of having him with her i thought i was rid of you did you lifting the flimsy teddy shed slept in justin ran the lace through his fingers without any effort he could picture her in it picture the thin creamy material sliding over her skin as he slipped it off of her put that down she leaned over to snatch it out of his hands going across his body to do so so you have a taste for silk and lace he stated letting the lingerie slip back to the bed before serena could grab it ive always admired women who wear things like this then sleep alone justin looked down at her as serena knelt on the floor frustrated it shows a certain independence of spirit her brows furrowed is that a compliment i thought so with a smile he leaned forward to wrap the ends of her hair around his fingers why did you think you were rid of me i wish you wouldnt be nice justin it throws me off sitting back on her haunches serena sighed you havent been in the casino there are other entertainments on board im sure her voice chilled like explaining your system to mrs dewalter mrs who her feathers ruffled serena got up and began to search for her tote bag the divorced redhead with the hens egg oh amused and baffled justin watched her rummage under the bunk looking for something yes as he watched serena squirmed under the bunk on her stomach would you like some help no damn it she swore as she rapped the back of her head on the bottom of the bunk when she wiggled back out justin was sitting on the floor beside her without speaking he smiled and brushed her mussed hair away from her face justin serena turned away and dumped the contents of the bag on the bunk i really hate to say this accustomed to her sharp tongue he shrugged go ahead say it anyway i missed you looking back serena saw surprise on his face for the second time i told you i hated to say it when she started to rise he took her arm and held her still three words three words that brought on a torrent of conflicting emotions that hed never experienced hed been prepared for her annoyance her coolness her fury but not for those three simple words serena he laid his hand on her cheek in a rare gesture of complete gentleness thats a dangerous thing to tell me when were alone she touched her hand to his briefly then carefully drew it away from her skin i didnt intend to tell you at all i dont think i realized it myself until you walked in here her sigh was both puzzled and wistful i just dont understand it i wonder why it is we both feel we need to he said half to himself abruptly she jumped up and began dropping what she thought shed need into the tote bag im going to the beach for snorkeling and sightseeing serena told him would you like to come with me she didnt hear him move he didnt make a sound but she knew hed risen to stand behind her for the first time in a year serena felt the light panic of claustrophobia justin placed his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him those eyes he thought that impossibly rich color it seemed he had only to look into them for the need to spread to his a truce he asked she saw with relief that he wasnt going to press the advantage shed given him what fun would that be serena retorted you can come with me if you want but no truce those seem like reasonable terms he mused when he slipped his hands around her waist serena stuck the tote bag between them justin glanced at it then at her thats hardly an obstacle the offer was for sightseeing she reminded him take it or leave it well go with that with a hesitation so slight it went unnoticed justin dropped his hands for now accepting this serena turned and opened the door ever been on a glassbottom boat no youre going to love it she promised and reached for his hand her skin was wet and warm and glistening in the sunlight two tiny scraps of material clung to the curves of her breasts and hips as she stretched out her legs on the blanket serena gave a contented sigh i like to think of the pirates she looked out over the magnificent blue water and could almost see the jolly roger fluttering in the breeze high green mountains rose around them as if floating on the sea itself three hundred years ago shaking back her wet hair she smiled over at justin hardly any time at all really when you think of how long these islands have been here a few droplets of water glistened on his dark skin dont you think blackboard might be a bit upset if he saw all this he gestured to indicate the people dotting the white sand beach and splashing in the turquoise water laughter rose with the scent of suntan lotion unlike the rest of us i dont think hed consider these beaches unspoiled she laughed both refreshed and exhilarated from their hour of snorkeling hed find another place pirates have a knack for it you sound as though you admire them its easy to romanticize after a couple of centuries serena leaned back on her elbows enjoying the sensation of drying in the sun and i suppose ive always admired people who lived by their own rules at any price oh youre going to be practical serena tilted her face toward the sun the sky was as blue as the water and cloudless its too beautiful here to be practical theres as much barbarism and cruelty today as there was three hundred years ago and not nearly as much adventure id love a ride in h g wellss time machine intrigued justin picked up the comb she had discarded and began to run it through her hair where would you go arthurs britain platos greece caesars rome she sighed finding the sensation of justin drawing the comb through her hair both sensual and soothing hundreds of other places id have to meet rob roy in scotland or my father would never forgive me id like to have seen the west before the settlers discovered it but then i suppose idve been on the first wagon to oregon laughing she tilted her head back farther so that she had upsidedown view of his face it wouldve been worth the risk of being scalped by your ancestors justin weighed her hair in one hand it would have been quite a prize id just as soon have kept it serena admitted wryly what about you she asked wouldnt you like to go back a couple of centuries and play red dog in a tombstone saloon they didnt welcome comanches reaching back she brushed damp hair from his forehead youre being practical again his eyes held hers a moment i would have been in the war party attacking your wagon train yes she looked out to sea again it was foolish to forget who and what he was even for a moment he was different it only added to the attraction i suppose you would have we would have been forging new frontiers you would have been defending what was already yours the lines get misted and you wonder if either side was wrong in the beginning do you ever feel cheated she wondered aloud your birthright justin drew the comb slowly through her hair as it dried he could see all the subtle shade variations that merged together for the rich gold i prefer making what i own rather than thinking of inheritances she nodded because the words so exactly expressed her own feelings the macgregors were persecuted in scotland forced to give up their name their plaid and their land if id been there i would have fought now its just a fascinating story she gave a low laugh as her mood shifted one my father will tell again and again at the least provocation a toddler racing across the sand to escape her mother landed like a plump ball in serenas lap giggling she tossed her arms around serenas neck and clung as if they were in the conspiracy together well hello with a laugh serena returned the hug then she tilted the childs head back enough to see funfilled brown eyes making a break for it are you the girl grabbed a handful of serenas hair pretty what a bright child she commented looking over her shoulder at justin to her surprise he hoisted the child onto his own lap and touched a finger to her button nose youre pretty too with another peal of giggles she pressed a wet kiss to his cheek before serena had gotten over her surprise at the ease with which he accepted the damp greeting a woman in a trim black maillot rushed to the trio breathlessly rosie the frazzled mother held a plastic pail and shovel while her cheeks grew pink oh im so sorry pretty rosie claimed again giving justin another kiss this time serena burst into giggles rosie exasperated the mother ran a hand through her hair i really am sorry she repeated she heads everywhere at a dead ran no one safe when you run theres more time to play once youre there isnt there rosie serena stroked the warm brown hair as she smiled her reassurance at the mother she must keep you busy exhausted the woman admitted but really i dont apologize gently justin brushed the sand from the childs hand shes beautiful obviously pleased the mother relaxed then held out her hand to her daughter thank you do you have children it took serena a moment to realize they were being addressed as a couple before she could recover justin was already answering not yet i dont suppose this ones for sale hefting rosie on her hip the young woman beamed down at him no though there are times im tempted to rent her out shes a handful thanks again not everyone appreciates being attacked by a twoyearold tornado say goodbye rosie bye rosie waved a chubby hand over her mothers shoulder before she made a valiant effort to scramble down again serena could hear high delighted giggles as the mother and daughter moved across the beach really justin serena brushed away the sand rosie had brought with her why did you tell that woman we didnt have any children yet we dont you know very well what i mean she began now whos being practical before serena could retort he wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed his lips to her shoulder instead of resisting she leaned back against him a moment enjoying the closeness she was sweet most children are he pressed a kiss to her other shoulder theyve no pretensions no prejudices and very little fear soon her mother will teach her not to talk to strangers necessary but rather sad serena drew away so that she could turn around and look at him fully i wouldnt have believed youd give children a moments thought justin started to tell her that the moment with the child that they had shared had awakened urges in him a need for family hed almost forgotten he had a woman beside him a child reaching up for a kiss then he brushed the thought away even as serena brushed away sand it was best to tread lightly on ground you didnt know he thought i started out that way myself he said at length she noticed his hesitation but found her own emotions strangely muddled are you sure smiling she rested her hands on his shoulders reasonably im going to tell you something serena said solemnly leaning a bit closer yes i dont think youre pretty children have a clearer outlook than adults you dont even have a pretty nature she insisted but found the urge to press her lips to his too difficult to resist neither do you running his hands up her back justin deepened the kiss his lids had lowered as hers had but neither closed she felt something creep out of her while her bones were softening something small and vital that was hers one moment and his the next serena yielded to him in a kiss that held more promise than passion i never intend to have one she murmured thank god his hand tightened in her hair suddenly briefly though his mouth remained gentle on hers serena drew away something had changed there was no clear explanation why no idea what but something had changed there was a need to put things back on a solid footing until she had the time to decipher it her body felt soft and weak and alien wed better go she managed i have some things to pick up in town before im due back at the ship time and tide wait for no man he mused thats about it rising she shook loose sand from her romper before she slipped it over her suit you wont always have that excuse justin stood beside her halting the hands that worked the buttons no serena agreed then began to fasten the romper again but i have it now it took some artful driving through the traffic of charlotte amalie then a dash of luck to find an empty parking place the streets were jammed with cabs people and small openair busses with gaily patterned roofs during this time both justin and serena were silent occupied with their separate thoughts what had happened she wondered during that brief almost friendly kiss on the beach why had it left her feeling like jelly inside apprehensive and somehow delighted perhaps it had something to do with how touched shed been to see justin with the little girl it was difficult to imagine a man like him a gambler with those parallel streaks of coolness and ruthlessness being a sucker for a twentypound brunette with sticky salty hands she simply hadnt given him credit for that quality of sweetness it could also be the fact that where shed once thought she might like him serena now knew she did but cautiously she added as if to reassure herself it would never be wise to completely drop caution in dealings with justin and now that she could admit she liked him and enjoyed his company the cruise was almost over during what was left of it serena would be kept so busy by her shifts and duties in the casino that she wouldnt have a leisurely hour to spend with him much less a leisurely day for the rest of the trip they would be at sea with the casino open sixteen hours a day of course there was still the option of accepting his job offer frowning slightly serena glanced out the window to see a table on the sidewalk near gucci covered with hats made from palm leaves for the past two days she had deliberately blocked the proposition out of her head first from temper then from the sensible notion that it would be better to consider it after there was some distance between them atlantic city would be an adventure working with justin would be a risk perhaps one was the same as the other why did the sudden softening of her attitude worry him justin wondered that had after all been one of his goals he wanted her just as he had wanted her the first moment he had seen her yet the days of contact of arguments laughter and passion had added some new aspect to what should have remained a basic need it wasnt as simple as it had once been to attribute his conflicting emotions to the machinations of her father in truth he hadnt thought of her as daniel macgregors daughter in days as he pulled into an empty space justin decided it might be wise to think of her that way again at least for the moment more key chains that play fur elise he asked as he switched off the ignition despite what he had just told himself justin drew her closer to taste her lips again i never repeat myself she retorted but she didnt move away just this once he murmured make an exception on a low laugh she increased the pressure until they both forgot they were in a parked car in the middle of a crowded city tonight she thought as her fingers ran up his cheek on their journey to his hair the time had come to stop pretending and take what she wanted serena it was half sigh half moan as he drew her away i know for a moment she rested her head against his shoulder we seem destined to find ourselves in public places she took a quick audible breath and scooted out of the car since we spent so long at the beach i wont have time for anything but the most disciplined shopping justin walked around to her to take her hand serena smiled then with a quick glance up and down the narrow crowded street she pointed i should be able to pick up a few souvenirs and the liquor i need in there before she could reach her destination the window display at cartiers stopped her her long sigh was part appreciation and part desire why is it an intelligent woman can find herself coveting a bunch of shiny rocks she wondered aloud its natural isnt it justin moved to stand beside her letting his gaze roam over the sparkle of diamonds the gleam of emeralds most women are attracted to diamonds most men too pressurized carbon she mused then sighed again hunks of rock dug out of caves centuries ago we used them as amulets to ward off evil spirits or bring good luck the phoenicians traveled to the baltic countries of europe for amber wars have been fought over them countries exploited and somehow that makes them more attractive dont you ever indulge yourself serena turned away from the window and smiled at him no it gives me something to look forward to ive promised myself that the next time i travel itll be strictly for relaxation then im going on a binge that may put a serious hole in my bank account for now she gestured toward the next shop i need to pick up some more traditional sort of souvenirs for a few cousins and a case of chivas regal justin walked into the store with her where serena immediately became caught up in a flurry of picking choosing and buying she generally disliked shopping but once committed did so with a vengeance when justin wandered off she paid little attention engrossed as she was in a selection of embroidered table linen with the souvenirs purchased and wrapped serena went to the counter where bottles of liquor liqueurs and wines were displayed in profusion a quick glance at her watch showed her she had nearly two hours before she was due on board a case of chivas twelve year two at justins voice serena turned her head oh i thought id lost you did you find what you wanted and more she admitted with a grimace im going to hate myself when it comes time to pack the clerk slid the two boxes of scotch onto the counter id like mine delivered to the celebration drawing out her credit card she waited for the clerk to fill out the form and mine justin added counting out bills serena pondered his case of scotch while he relayed the necessary information strange she mused she hadnt thought him the kind of drinker to buy scotch by the case he never drank when he gambled it had been one of the first things shed noticed throughout the cruise shed seen him with a drink in his hand only once during the picnic at nassau she decided perhaps he bought it in lieu of souvenirs but it seemed odd hed buy so much of one brand after signing her name to the credit slip serena stuffed the receipt into her bag i suppose thats it slipping her hand into his she walked toward the exit odd that we both bought the same brand of scotch not when you consider we bought it for the same person he returned mildly with a puzzled smile serena looked up at him the same person your father doesnt drink any other brand how do you confused she shook her head why would you buy my father a case of scotch he asked me to he guided her by a clutch of teenagers asked you to hampered by another crowd of shoppers serena had to wait until shed plowed her way through what do you mean he asked you to ive never known daniel to do anything without a catch justin took her arm to guide her across the street as she was looking at him and not the cars a case of scotch seemed reasonable at the time daniel serena thought noting the easy use of her fathers name for a moment her mind concentrated on that small point until unanswered and uncomfortable questions began to leak through disregarding the flow of pedestrian traffic she stopped dead in the center of the sidewalk justin youd better tell me exactly what youre talking about im talking about buying your father a case of scotch for his thoughtfulness in booking my passage on the celebration youve got something mixed up my father isnt a travel agent he laughed just as uproariously as he had the day hed learned her last name no daniels many things but hes not a travel agent why dont we go down here and sit i dont want to sit she gave her arm a jerk as he led her to one of the cool courtyards i want to know why the hell my father would have anything to do with arranging your vacation i think he had my life in mind actually finding an empty table justin gave her a nudge into a chair and yours he added as he sat she could smell the freshly made delicacies from the bakery across from them hear the chatter from the little bookstore next door because she suddenly wanted to punch something serena folded her hands on the table what the hell are you talking about i met your father about ten years ago calmly justin drew out a cigar and lit it serena was reacting precisely the way he had expected the predictability eased the tension hed been fighting since that moment on the beach when hed felt something slipping away from him i came to hyannis port with a business proposition justin began we played some poker and have been doing business off and on ever since youve quite an interesting family serena made no comment but her fingers clenched tighter ive grown quite fond of them over the years he continued blandly you always seemed to be in school when i visited but i heard quite a bit about rena alan admires your mind caine your right cross though her eyes smoldered justin couldnt prevent a small smile from curving his lips your father nearly erected a monument when you graduated from smith two years ahead of schedule serena repressed the urge to swear repressed the urge to scream the man had been privy to her life for a decade without her knowledge or consent youve known she began in a low furious voice youve known who i am all this time and youve said nothing playing games when you only had to explain wait a minute as she started to rise he took her arm in a forceful grip i didnt know the blackjack dealer named serena was daniels rena macgregor the paragon ive heard about for the last ten years she flushed both in fury and embarrassment most of her life she had found her fathers bragging as amusing as it was endearing now it served as a cold hard slap in the face i dont know what your game is daniels game justin interrupted again it wasnt until that day on the beach when you were shouting at me about macgregors not being pushed around that i realized who you were and why daniel had been so persuasive about my taking this trip because she could remember the expression of utter shock on his face serena relaxed fractionally he sent you the tickets and didnt mention the fact that i worked on the celebration what do you think justin countered tapping his cigar in a plastic ashtray as he watched her when i found out your full name i realized id been maneuvered by an expert he grinned amused all over again ill admit it gave me a moment or two of discomfort discomfort serena repeated unamused her brief telephone conversation with her father played back in her head hed been pumping her she realized wondering if his little scheme had borne fruit im going to murder him she said quietly her eyes dark with barely controlled fury came back to justins as soon as im done with you she gave herself a moment because the need to scream was building again you couldve told me days ago could have justin agreed but as i figured your reaction would be essentially what it is i chose not to you chose she said between her teeth my father chose oh what marvelous egomaniacs you men are perhaps it didnt occur to you that i was on the chess board too anger flooded her face did you think youd get me into bed to pay him back for those moments of discomfort you know better than that justin spoke so mildly serena had to bite back a new retort for some reason i had a difficult time remembering whose daughter you were every time i put my hands on you ill tell you what i know she said in the same dangerously low voice the two of you deserve each other youre both arrogant pompous overbearing fools what right do you have to intrude on my life this way your father instigated the intrusion justin told her evenly the rest was strictly personal if you want to murder the old devil its your business but dont stick your claws into me i dont need your permission to murder him she tossed back her voice rising enough to cause a few heads to turn i think i just said that she sprang up casting about futilely for something to throw at him since it was physically impossible for her to lift him and heave him bodily through the plate glass window of the bookstore she only smoldered im afraid i lack your sense of humor she managed after a moment i happen to think what my father did was insulting and demeaning with as much dignity as she had left serena reached for her bags id appreciate it if youd stay out of my way during the rest of the trip im afraid id find it extremely difficult to restrain myself from throwing you overboard all right if justin added before she could speak again you promise to let me know in two weeks about the position in atlantic city even as her eyes widened and her mouth flew open to pour out abuse he held up a hand oh no deals off if you give me your answer now two weeks stiffly she nodded youll get the same answer then but i can postpone it goodbye justin serena smoldering she turned back to glare at him give daniel my best before you murder him chapter six contents prev next the first thing serena noticed during the drive from the airport were the trees it had been some time since shed seen oak and maple and pine touched with fall it was barely september but the feel of autumn was in the air with all its strength and color even while she appreciated it she seethed if it hadnt been indoctrinated into her to finish a job once it was started she would have caught the first plane out of st thomas after justins revelation instead shed gone about her duties with an outward smile and inward rage rather than cooling off during the interim serena had grown more angry and frustrated and felt more misused perhaps because justin had kept his part of the bargain and steered clear of her for the remainder of the cruise all of serenas temper was fully focused on one man daniel macgregor oh youre going to be sorry she muttered causing the cabbie to glance quickly in his rearview mirror nicelooking lady he mused mad as a hornet he began the gentle ride along nantucket sound in discreet silence the first view of the house had the effect of distracting serena from plans of revenge the gray stone glistened with minute pieces of mica in the late afternoon sun it had been built to daniels fancy and with its twin towers as nearly resembled a castle as he could manage there were large stone balconies roughly carved and tall mullioned windows a lush bed of flowers flowed in a semicircle around the front in place serena had always thought of the moat he would have preferred from the main structure two lower stone buildings spread out one was a tencar garage which with alan and caine away would be only half full the other held a heated pool daniel might prefer a primitive style of architecture but he appreciated comfort the cab pulled up in front of the granite steps interrupting serenas survey of the home shed grown up in leaving the two suitcases and scotch to the cab driver she gathered together the sundry packages from her shopping sprees and started up the steps following an old habit she looked at the massive oak door where the macgregor crest was carved into a brass knocker under the crowned lions head was the gaelic motto which translated to royal is my race as always when reading it she smiled her father had insisted they learn to say it in gaelic if they learned nothing else just set them there thank you still smiling serena paid off the driver then turned to thud her family crest against the door it would reverberate through the house she thought like the sound of approaching cannon the door was swung open on its welloiled hinges by a tiny scrap of a woman with irongray hair and pointed features her mouth fell open accentuating the sharp chin miss rena lily serena embraced the small bony woman with all the exuberance of youth in addition to her duties as housekeeper lily had been surrogate mother whenever anna had been busy at the hospital she had handled the three unruly children expertly patching wounds and allowing squabbles to run their course did you miss me serena demanded giving lily a final squeeze before she drew the older woman away hardly noticed you were gone lily gave her a welcoming smile wheres your tan in my imagination lily wasnt that the door holding a piece of needlepoint in one hand anna macgregor poked her head out of a doorway down the long hall rena she came forward her arms outstretched serena raced into them anna was soft and strong both qualities flowed through serena along with a hundred memories she took a deep breath inhaling the scent of apple blossoms her mother had worn as long as she could remember welcome home darling we werent expecting you until tomorrow i caught an earlier plane serena pulled back tilting her head so that she could study her mothers face the skin was still creamy with only a few fine lines betraying her age there was a youthful softness about annas face that serena thought she would never lose her eyes were calm reflecting the nature that had refused to change through years of operating rooms and death her hair waved gently a rich brown dashed with gray mom serena pressed her cheek against her mothers again how do you stay so beautiful your father insists on it laughing serena pulled away grasping one of her mothers strong skilled hands its good to be home you look wonderful rena anna studied her with an easy mixture of maternal pride and professionalism nothing better than moist sea air for the complexion lily please tell cook that miss renas home well have our welcomehome dinner a day early i want you to tell me all about your travels she continued turning back to her daughter but if you dont go up to see your father first ill never hear the end of it abruptly serena remembered her mission anna watched her eyes narrow and recognizing the sign lifted her brows oh i intend to go up and see him all right anything youd like to tell me about afterward serena drew a deep breath hes going to require medical attention when im through with him i see knowing better than to question her daughter anna smiled quietly ill be in the parlor then well have a nice long talk when youre finished yelling at your father it wont take long serena muttered and started up the wide curved staircase at the first landing she glanced down the corridor to her left this was where the family slept with serenas childhood room three doors down on the left the wing was a maze of twists and turns and shadowy comers she could remember her brother caine hiding behind a threefoothigh urn then jumping out and scaring her nearly to death serena had chased him for nearly thirty minutes until her temper had been defeated by the sheer joy of the chase hed let her catch him eventually on the east lawn where he had tossed her to the ground to wrestle until she was weak with laughter how old had she been serena wondered eight nine caine would have been eleven or twelve suddenly she missed him with a purely physical ache of kinship and alan she mused continuing her climb hed always protected her in an offhanded way perhaps because he was six years her senior they had never indulged in the handtohand combat she and caine had been prone to as a boy alan had been scrupulously honest where caine had used the truth to suit himself never lying serena remembered with a faint smile just evading masterfully yet in his own way alan had always worked circumstances to his own favor she decided it was a basic macgregor trait glancing at the narrow stairway that led to the tower room serena vowed that there was one macgregor whod be sorry for it daniel leaned back in his chair and listened to the precise boring voice on the phone bankers he thought maliciously it was a curse to deal with them even owning controlling interest in the bank didnt protect him from them give them a thirtyday extension on the loan he ordered finally yes im aware of the figures you just gave me the figures dunderhead he added to himself impatiently he drummed his fingers on his desk why was it bankers couldnt see beyond two plus two thirty days he repeated with the standard penalty rate of interest he heard the loud thump at his door and was about to bellow at the intruder when it swung open annoyance was immediately flooded by pleasure do it he barked into the phone before he slammed it down rena before he could heave himself from his chair she had advanced on him planting herself in front of the desk she slapped her palms down on it and leaned over you old goat settling his bulk back in the chair daniel cleared his throat the fat he concluded was in the fire you look well too how dare you she spaced the words slowly and evenly the next danger signal how dare you dangle me in front of justin blade like a piece of prime beef beef daniel gave her an incredulous look pretty girl he thought proudly a true macgregor i dont know what youre talking about he went on so you met justin blade fine boy she made a sound deep in her throat you set me up hatching your little plot right here in this room like some mad king with a surplus daughter on his hands why didnt you just draw up a contract serena demanded as her voice rose its no less than i expect from you daniel duncan macgregor hereby trades his only daughter to justin blade for a case of twelveyearold scotch she smacked her hand on the redwood you could even have put in provisions about the number of progeny you expected me to provide to carry on the family name im surprised you didnt offer him a dowry now listen here little girl dont you littlegirl me she stalked around his desk and swung his chair around to face her it was despicable ive never been so humiliated in all my life i dont know what youre talking about i persuaded a friend to take a relaxing cruise dont you try to weasel out of it she poked a slim finger into his massive chest you sent him on my ship hoping wed trip over each other enough times so your investment would pay off you might never have met him at all he thundered its a big boat ship she thundered back its a big ship and a small casino you knew damn well the odds were in your favor well whats the harm in that he wanted to know at the top of his lungs you met a young friend of mine youve met hundreds of friends of mine the sound came from her throat again this time serena whirled away there was a huge bookshelf along the east wall stomping to it serena pulled out a volume entitled constitutional convention she flipped it open revealing the hollow where six cigars were secreted watching her father she scooped them out and then broke them in half rena he said in quiet horror its the next best thing to poisoning you she told him dusting off her fingers holding a hand to his heart daniel rose his broadfeatured face was wreathed in gloom its a dark day when a daughter betrays her own father betrays she shouted advancing on him again you have the nerve the utter gall to talk to me of betrayal sticking her hands on her hips she glared up at him i dont know how justin feels about it but i can tell you im insulted by your little scheme he bristled but noted her use of justins first name perhaps things were not as bad as they seemed thats the thanks i get for caring for my daughters happiness theres nothing sharper than the tongue of an ungrateful child the butcher knife i was considering is you said poison he reminded her im flexible then she smiled slowly well just so you wont think your money went for nothing i suppose i should tell you what ive decided about justin well then daniel went back to his desk thinking she would be more reasonable now that shed shouted and raged a bit a pity about the cigars though hes a fine boy good brains integrity pride he folded his hands over his stomach prepared to be magnanimous and forgiving oh yes i quite agree she said in dulcet tones hes also very very attractive daniel smiled pleased i knew you were a sensible girl rena ive had a strong feeling about you and justin for some time then youll be happy to know ive decided to become his mistress i cant daniel broke off confused then stunned then outraged the hell you are the day my daughter takes herself off to be to be kept is the day i take a strap to her for the first time in her life aye a strap serena macgregor grown woman or no ah so im a grown woman now am i while he blustered she gave him a long hard look remember this a grown woman decides whom shell marry when shell marry and if shell marry a grown woman doesnt need her father arranging outrageously complicated blind dates just think about how this whole business could have blown up in your face before you stick your nose in next time frowning he studied her face youre not thinking of becoming his mistress then serena gave him a haughty look if i choose a lover ill choose one but i wont be any mans mistress he felt a flash of pride along with a twinge of discomfort it only took an instant for him to concentrate on the pride daniel pushed at a gold pen and pencil set on his desk did you remember my scotch she tried to glare again but the twinkle in his eyes undermined her what scotch aw rena walking to him serena curled her arms around his neck im not forgiving you she murmured im only pretending to forgive you and i want you to know i never missed you at all she pressed her lips to his cheek always were a disrespectful brat he stated hugging her fiercely when serena went down to the parlor she found her mother sitting in her favorite rosepatterned armchair working on her latest needlepoint project on the rosewood tea tray beside her sat a dainty porcelain tea service dotted with tiny violets glancing at the scene serena marveled again that a woman who could be so happily domesticated on one level could be such a dedicated and brilliant surgeon the hands that created the fragile pattern with needle and yarn would wield a scalpel on monday oh good anna glanced up as serena entered i thought i had it timed well when i ordered the tea toss another log on the fire dear then come tell me about it as serena moved to obey anna set her needlework on the piecrust table beside her the fire was already crackling in the stone fireplace but roared at the addition of fresh wood serena watched the oak catch then breathed deeply until that moment she hadnt realized how much she had missed the scent of burning wood and a tub bath she said aloud smiling she turned to her mother isnt it strange that just now i realize what an utter luxury it would be to soak in a bath for as long as i wanted after twelve months of standing in a bucket that passed for a shower stall and you loved every minute of it laughing serena sat on the hassock at annas feet you know me so well it was hard work and great fun but im glad to be home she accepted the cup and saucer anna passed to her mom i know id never have met so many people so many different kinds of people in my life if i hadnt done it your letters were always full of them you should read them over yourself one day to bring it all back anna curled her legs under her and chuckled youll never know how hard it was to talk your father out of taking an ocean cruise when will he stop worrying serena demanded never its part of the way he shows his love i know with a sigh serena sipped her tea if hed just relax and let me take care of my life my own way why dont you tell me what you thought of justin when serena glanced up sharply anna only smiled no i hadnt the faintest idea what your father was up to he knew better than to tell me your ah discussion with him was quite penetrating can you believe it incensed all over again serena rose with the cup in her hand he actually duped justin into that trip hoping that id come home with stars in my eyes and orange blossoms in my brain ive never been so furious so embarrassed how did justin take it serena gave her mother a disdainful look i think he found the whole thing very amusing after his initial shock he had no idea who i was until we were arguing on the beach one day and i said my full name arguing on the beach anna mused to conceal a smile she sipped her tea i see your father thinks very highly of him rena so do i i suppose daniel just couldnt resist the temptation hes infuriating who justin both of them she amended setting down her cup with a snap he didnt tell me until the cruise was nearly over and then in the most careless of ways why i was actually beginning to trailing off she turned away to stare at the fire beginning to anna prompted gently hes very attractive serena muttered i suppose it has something to do with his unapologetic ruthlessness and that damned charm that sneaks up on you wisely anna remained silent speculating even when he made me furious he stirred things up inside me that would have been more comfortable left alone ive never felt that kind of passion before im not certain i ever wanted to turning back she found her mother watching her calmly we spent the last day together in st thomas i would have gone to bed with him that night until he told me about dads little scheme how do you feel now serena looked down at her hands then let out a long breath i still want him i dont know if its any more than that how could it be when we knew each other less than two weeks rena do you really trust your instincts so little her brow creased serena looked back up at her mother why should emotions require a certain time pattern theyre as individual as the people they belong to when i met your father i thought he was a conceited loudmouthed ox at serenas appreciative chuckle anna grinned girlishly of course he was i fell for him anyway two months later we were living together and within a year we were married she made a wry smile at the obvious shock on her daughters face passion and premarital sex arent the exclusive property of your generation my love daniel wanted to get married i was determined to finish medical school first the only thing we both agreed on was that we couldnt and wouldnt live without each other serena considered her mothers words while the fire snapped violently behind her how did you know it was love and not just desire of all my children youve always asked the most difficult questions leaning forward anna took her daughters hands im not certain you can separate the two when it concerns a man and a woman you can feel one without the other but not when its real love not when its real desire passion that comes quickly and then fades with time is only an echo no substance simply a result do you think youve fallen in love with justin or are you afraid you have serena opened her mouth closed it then tried again both anna gave serenas hands a squeeze dont tell your father hed be entirely too pleased with himself this drew another reluctant laugh from serena before anna sat back again what do you intend to do about it i havent thought about it rather ive refused to think about it she brought up her knees to rest her chin on them i suppose ive known all along that id have to see him again he offered me a job oh serena moved her shoulders restlessly as ideas began to shift and sort in her mind managing a casino in atlantic city its a coincidence because id decided to consult dad about the possibility of opening my own gambling hotel if justin offered you a position like that he must have a great deal of faith in your skill i developed a knack for handling people serena mused as a thought focused you developed it when you were two her mother informed her ive got a feel for the business she went on with a hint of a smile on her lips i learned more than dealing cards this past year in essence the celebration is one of the best run hotels ive ever seen and though the casinos smallscale all the basics are there there wasnt any part of it i didnt learn from the inside out she grew silent again as her smile widened anna recognized the look what are you hatching rena im thinking of raising the bet she answered win lose or draw after tipping the bellboy justin stripped and headed for the shower the maid could deal with the unpacking in the morning and the casino could run another night without his attention for now he would have dinner in his suite while he made all the necessary phone calls to his other properties with luck there would be no problems that couldnt be handled long distance he had other things on his mind he adjusted the shower dial so that the water came out in pulsing jets serena would be home by this time he reflected and if he knew her daniel would already be paying the price justins grin came quickly naturally hed have given a lot to have been within earshot during the reunion it would almost make up for those last two long boring frustrating days aboard the celebration keeping his end of the bargain had been more difficult than justin had imagined to know she was within reach dealing cards in the sophisticated tux sleeping in that narrow bunk wearing only a flimsy handful of silk had nearly driven him mad but hed stayed away because a deal was a deal and because he had recognized that beneath her anger was a keen embarrassment that only time would lessen the two weeks hed given her should make her easier to negotiate with even if she refused his offer as he expected her to do initially justin didnt plan to leave it at that he calculated he could taunt her to atlantic city if necessary and after she was there hed have house advantage flipping off the shower he reached for a towel he needed a sharp manager downstairs he needed a woman on the top floor serena was the only one who could fill both requirements with the towel hooked around his waist justin walked into the bedroom like the rest of the owners suite the room was spacious and sophisticated the carpet beneath his bare feet was a thick soft pewter long vertical blinds covered the glass doors to the balcony and the touch of a button would swing them open revealing a view of the atlantic he glanced at the wide bed covered in deep blue silk how many women had slept in it justin neither knew nor cared a nights mutual pleasure theyd meant nothing more nothing less from the closet he drew out a robe letting the towel fall as he slipped into it there had been years when he had lived in places smaller than this one single bedroom hed still had women if he wanted one tonight he had only to choose a number from his book and dial the phone his body ached for one yet he knew that for the first time in his life just any woman wouldnt do prostrated and restless he roamed through the suite hed had good reason to base himself in the east the atlantic city operation was his newest and the newest always required the most attention it had never mattered to justin where he lived over the years hed grown used to the convenience of a hotel where his slightest wish would be seen to by the push of the right button now he found himself thinking about a home something permanent with grass to be tended and air that wasnt being shared with hundreds of other people running a hand through his hair justin wondered why he should feel this vague dissatisfaction when he had everything hed ever wanted but his plans had never included wanting one woman was it because of her that hed felt the lack of warmth when hed entered his rooms again if she were here the echoing emptiness wouldnt be she would fill it with temper and laughter with passion why had he given her two weeks justin asked himself angrily stuffing his hands into the pockets of his robe why hadnt he badgered her into coming back with him dragged her back so that he wouldnt be alone now aching for her he needed some contact with her her voice over the phone no justin thought more calmly not her voice that would only make matters more complicated going to the phone he dialed daniel macgregors private number macgregor you old bastard justin said mildly ah justin daniel cast his eyes up at the ceiling knowing he was in for his second tonguelashing of the day how was your trip educational i take it serenas already spoken to you thrilled to be home daniel stated glancing wistfully at the broken cigars on his desk speaks very highly of you ill bet she does with a grim smile justin sat on the plump sofa wouldnt it have been simpler to have told me serena worked on the ship would you have taken the trip no there then daniel stated reasonably and im sure it did you a world of good youve been tense boy restless he contemplated trying to light one of the mutilated cigars and dont worry ill talk to rena for you calm her down a bit no you wont im holding a case of scotch hostage daniel until im certain youll stay out of it now now theres no need to do that its just parental concern for both of you these two certainly knew where to stick the needle he mused glumly why dont you extend your vacation a few more days justin pay us a visit here serenas going to come to me he answered flatly come to you the wide forehead creased what do you mean by that what i said all right boy his chest expanded youd better tell me what your intentions are no some of the tension eased from justins muscles enjoying himself he leaned back what do you mean no daniel roared im her father youre not mine you dealt me this hand daniel im playing it out now listen here no justin said again just as calmly im telling you to fold daniel serena and i are going double or nothing you hurt that girl and ill skin you alive justin laughed if ever there was a woman who could take care of herself its serena macgregor aye pride swelled his heart and distracted him the girls a pistol of course if you think shes going to make a fool out of herself no child of mine makes a fool of herself daniel snapped making justin grin fine then youll keep out of it daniel ground his teeth and scowled at the receiver your word daniel all right all right i wash my hands of it but the minute i hear that youve goodbye daniel justin hung up satisfied that he had paid back his benefactor in spades chapter seven contents prev next justin kept his office suite on the ground floor of the comanche connected by a private elevator to his penthouse rooms he found the arrangement convenient his working hours were sporadic and there were times when he had no desire to pass through the public rooms of the hotel the elevator was a practicality as were the small television monitors in the far corners and the twoway glass concealed behind the mahogany paneling on the side wall because he demanded complete privacy in his own offices justin worked in a large room without windows and with only one entrance his experience in a cell had given him a longstanding aversion to closedin places so to compensate hed decorated his working area carefully the furniture was lightcolored maize oatmeal biscuit to give the appearance of airiness the paintings were large and full of color a desert scene caught in the last dying streaks of sun the stark unforgiving peaks of the rockies a comanche brave in full gallop on a war pony the color and the lack of it gave justin an illusion of freedom that counteracted the restlessness he sometimes felt when he found himself trapped behind a desk at the moment he was reviewing a stockholders report that would please anyone holding shares in blade enterprises twice justin caught himself reading and retaining nothing and forced himself to begin again serenas two weeks were up and so he discovered was his patience if she didnt phone within the next twentyfour hours hed be on his way to hyannis port to hold her to her end of the bargain damn he didnt want to go chasing after her justin thought as he tossed the report back onto the desk hed never chased after a woman in his life and hed already come uncomfortably close to doing so with serena since the beginning he played his best game when his opponent made the offensive moves opponent justin mused hed rather think of her that way it was safer but no matter how he thought of her he went on thinking of her no matter what he struggled to concentrate on she was always there just at the back of his mind waiting to slip through the guards every time he thought of having a woman serena was on his mind almost close enough to touch to smell desire for her completely obliterated desire for anyone else frustrated hungry justin had told himself to wait it out now he decided hed waited long enough before the night was over he would have her as justin reached for the phone to arrange for transportation north a knock sounded at his door yes warned by the tone in the one syllable his secretary poked only her head through the doorway sorry justin with an effort he directed his temper away from her what is it kate telegram she entered a sleek willowy brunette with a lowtoned voice and sculptured features and mr streeves been hanging around outside he wants you to extend his credit justin took the telegram with a grunt whats he in for five she said meaning five thousand as he tore open the envelope justin swore softly jackass doesnt know when to quit whos on the floor nero tell nero streeves good for one more then hes cut off with luck hell recoup a couple of thousand and be content with it with his luck hell be trying to trade his shares of at t for chips kate retorted nothing worse than the spoiled rich whore temporarily short of fluid cash were not here to moralize justin reminded her tell nero to keep an eye on him okay with a shrug kate shut the door behind her absently justin reached for the button that would slide the paneling clear of the twoway mirror it would be wise if he kept his eye on streeve as well before he could press it again justins gaze fixed on the message line of the telegram have considered your offer will arrive thursday afternoon to discuss terms please arrange for suitable accommodations s macgregor justin read the brief message twice before a smile tugged at his mouth how like her he thought short to the point and beautifully vague and well timed he added leaning back it was already past noon on thursday so she was coming to discuss terms he considered some small knot of tension unwound at the base of his neck drawing out a cigar justin lit it thoughtfully terms he reflected yes theyd discuss terms keeping that area coolly businesslike hed meant everything he had said to her when hed offered her the position in his opinion serena was well qualified to handle his staff and customers he needed someone on the floor who could make independent decisions leaving him free to travel to his other operations when it became necessary with the rest of the hotels to oversee he couldnt afford to spend all of his time supervising the casino blowing out a thin stream of smoke justin decided to make the job worth serenas while and once that was settled once that was settled he thought again shed have to deal with him on a personal level his eyes became opaque his long thin mouth set this time thered be no daniel macgregor playing the benevolent third party with an ace up his sleeve tonight he and serena would begin a very private twohanded game justins eyes cleared with a quick laugh winning was his business picking up the phone he punched the button for the front desk front desk steve speaking may i help you this is blade the clerk automatically came to attention yes sir a miss macgregor will be checking in this afternoon serena macgregor see that her bags are taken to the guest suite on my floor shes to be brought directly to me yes sir have the florist send some violets to her room yes sir a card no ill take care of it personally good satisfied justin hung up now all he had to do was wait picking up the stockholders report again he gave it his complete attention serena handed the doorman her car keys and took her first long look at the comanche justin hadnt gone for flashy or opulent but had managed an excellent happy medium the hotel was an open vshaped tower done in a drab adobe shade that brought a touch of the west to the east coast serena approved the architecture noting that nearly all the rooms had a view of the ocean the drive circled around a twolevel grottolike pool with its own miniature waterfall coins glistened in the bottom obviously there were plenty who were willing to risk some loose change for good luck beside the main door was a lifesize comanche chieftain in full headdress no dimestore indian serena mused but an exquisite sculpture in blackveined white marble giving in to the urge to touch it she ran a fingertip down the smooth stone chest how like justin not to choose the ordinary she thought as she let her eyes drift up to the marble face was it her imagination or was there some resemblance there if the eyes were green shaking her head serena turned away while her bags were being unloaded she used the time to take a look at the boardwalk famous names in huge letters on white billboards bold neon signs quiet in the late afternoon light huge hotel after huge hotel fountains traffic noise but it wasnt the same as vegas she decided and it was more than just the absence of mountains and the sound of the sea in her ears there seemed to be more of a carnival flavor here this was still a resort she concluded with a beach at the back door one could smell the gambling but it carried the moist salt spray of the atlantic with it and the laughter of children building sand castles adjusting the strap of her shoulder bag serena followed her luggage inside there was no red carpet or glistening chandeliers but rather subtle mosaic tile and indirect lighting both surprised and pleased serena noticed huge leafy plants in pottery jugs and wall hangings that clearly depicted the life and culture of the plains indian justins heritage was more a part of him than he realized she thought as she wandered toward the registration desk she could hear the familiar sound of slot machines muted by distance and the click of her own heels on the tile floor passing a bill to the doorman she turned to the desk clerk serena macgregor yes miss macgregor he gave her a quick welcoming smile mr blade is expecting you take miss macgregors bags to the guest suite in the penthouse he told the bellhop who was already hovering at her side mr blade would like you to come right to his office miss macgregor ill show you the way thank you nerves began to jump in her stomach but serena ignored them she knew what she was going to do and how she was going to do it shed had two weeks to work out her strategy during the long drive from massachusetts to new jersey she had gone over everything again and again once or twice shed nearly given in to the urge to turn the car around and drive back north she was taking an enormous risk with her future and with her heart sooner or later she was going to be hurt that was inevitable but there was something she wanted in atlantic city and his name was justin blade she pressed her hand to her stomach once quickly as if to push the nerves away as the desk clerk opened one of a pair of thick wooden doors marked private the brunette at an ebony desk glanced up in inquiry before her eyes rested on serena miss macgregor the clerk announced yes of course kate rose with a nod thank you steve mr blades expecting you miss macgregor just let me tell him youre here so this was why the boss had been on a short fuse kate concluded giving serena a cool appraising look as she lifted the interoffice phone she took in the long golden hair swept back at the temples with two ivory combs the strong elegant features accented by large violet eyes the slim figure in a raw silk suit a few shades darker than irises very classy kate decided and as serena met her stare without flinching added and no pushover miss macgregors here justin of course she cradled the receiver giving serena a smile that stopped just short of friendly right this way miss macgregor leading the way kate opened another door serena paused beside her thank you miss wallace kate responded automatically thank you miss wallace serena took the door handle herself and gently closed it behind her kate stared at the knob a moment realizing she had been expertly dismissed more intrigued than annoyed she went back to her desk serena justin leaned back in his chair why had he expected something to change he wondered quickly somehow he had thought hed be prepared for the onslaught of feeling simply seeing her brought to him every hour of the past two weeks vanished in one instant hello justin she prayed he wouldnt offer his hand as her own palms were damp you have quite a place here sit down he gestured to the chair in front of his desk would you like something coffee no with a polite smile she crossed the room to sit in a chair of buttery buckskin leather i appreciate your taking the time to see me right away he only lifted a brow at this theyd circled each other for a while he mused like a pair of boxers studying defenses in the early rounds how was your flight i drove she answered it was something i missed doing this past year the weather was lovely she added determined to keep the trite conversation going until her nerves settled and your family my parents are fine i wasnt able to see alan or caine serena gave her first hint of a genuine smile my father sends his best hes still among the living then i found more subtle ways of revenge with grim pleasure serena thought of the broken cigars youre adjusting to land life unable to resist the urge justin dropped his gaze to her mouth for a moment it was untouched by lipstick and faintly moist yes but not to unemployment she could feel the brush of heat across her lips and the answering warmth that kindled in the pit of her stomach she found herself wanting to go to him to take whatever he would give on whatever terms he offered just to be held again to have those lean clever hands touch her carefully she folded her own in her lap thats what i want to talk to you about the position of casino managers still open he said easily though he took his time bringing his eyes back to hers the hours are long though i dont think youll find them as allconsuming as on the ship generally theres no need for you to be on the floor before five though naturally you can adjust that from time to time if you need an evening off theres a certain amount of paperwork of course but for the most part youd be directing the staff and handling the customers youd have your own office on the other side of the reception area when youre not needed on the floor you can supervise from there there are monitors he continued gesturing and a more direct view justin pressed a button releasing the paneling serena glanced through the glass to watch the crowd in the casino gambling talking wandering in silent movie effect youll have an assistant justin went on hes competent but not authorized to make independent decisions a suite of rooms is included in your salary when im away from the hotel youll have complete authority over the casino within my framework of rules that seems clear enough unclenching her hands serena made herself relax she gave justin a mild friendly smile id consider taking over the managerial duties of the casino justin as your partner she saw a flicker but only a flicker of surprise in his eyes before he leaned back with anyone else it would have been a gesture of relaxation with justin it seemed a preparation for action my partner in the atlantic city comanche she returned calmly i need a manager for the casino serena i dont need a partner and i dont need a job or a salary for that matter she countered im fortunate enough to have financial independence but im not of a nature to stay idle i took the job on the celebration as an experiment i dont need to take another job for the same reasons im looking for something i have a bit more of a stake in you said once you were considering looking for work in a casino when you left the ship no she smiled again and shook her head you misunderstood me i was thinking of opening my own place your own place with a quick laugh he relaxed again do you have any idea just what that involves her chin came up i think i do ive just spent a year of my life working and living on what was essentially a floating gambling resort i know how a kitchens run to accommodate over fifteen hundred people how housekeeping keeps ahead of the linen supply and how to stock a wine cellar i know when a dealers feeling under par and needs to be relieved and how to convince a customer to find another game before he gets nasty there was little more for me to do on that ship than learn and i learn very quickly justin considered the coldly furious tone of her voice the hard determined light in her eyes she could probably do it successfully enough he decided after a moment she had the guts the drive and the bankroll taking all of that into consideration he began slowly why should i take you on as a partner rising serena walked over to the glass do you see the dealer on table five she asked tapping a finger against the window curious justin rose and joined her yes why she has excellent hands fast steady it looks to me as though shes worked out a very comfortable rhythm without appearing to rush the players along she doesnt belong working midweek afternoons you need dealers like that during the heavy traffic the croupier at the crap table looks bored to death he needs to be fired or given a raise clarify that one for me because there was a touch of humor in his voice serena grinned up at him given a raise if he takes the hint to be a bit more personable fired if he doesnt your casino staff should reflect the same attitude as the rest of the hotel staff a good point he admitted and a good reason for wanting you as my casino manager it doesnt cover your partnership serena turned her back on the silent world behind the glass a few more reasons then when youre needed out west or in europe youll know youre leaving someone in charge who has a vested interest not only in the casino but in the whole operation i did a bit of research she added if blade enterprises continues to grow at its current rate youll have to have someone help shoulder some of the responsibility unless of course you chose to work twentyfour hours a day making money without any time to enjoy your success the money im willing to invest would give you enough fluid cash to sweeten your bid on that casino in malta justins brow rose you have done your research he commented dryly we scots never do business blindfolded she gave him a satisfied smile the point is i have no intention of working for you or anyone else for half interest ill run the casino and pick up the slack in other areas when necessary half he murmured narrowing his eyes equal partners justin she met his eyes on level thats the only way youll get me silence came quickly and completely and serena forced herself to control her breathing to a slow even rate she wouldnt let him know how nervous she was or let herself think how easy it would be to forget pride and run into his arms what had begun the last time they had been together had been quietly accomplished during their separation shed fallen in love with him when he hadnt even been around to tempt her but he wouldnt know she wouldnt allow him to know until she was ready suppose you take some time to think it over she said at length my plans are flexible serena went on as she walked to retrieve her purse from the chair id intended to look into some property here while im in town when justins fingers curled around her arm serena made herself turn slowly he was going to call her bluff she was certain of it and when he did shed have the choice of folding or riding it out anytime during the first year that i decide it isnt working i can buy you out she struggled against a shout of laughter agreed she told him quietly ill have my lawyer draw up a draft of an agreement in the meantime you can get your feet wet in there he jerked his head toward the casino you should have a week or so to change your mind i have no intention of changing my mind justin when i make a decision i stick to it their eyes met again in a long cautious stare serena held out her hand a deal then justin glanced at her hand then slowly closed his over it he held it as though making a pact then brought it to his lips a deal serena he said though we might both be sorry for it ill go up and change she drew her hand away from his ill work the casino tonight tomorrows soon enough justin moved ahead of her to the door closing his fingers over hers on the knob id rather not waste time she said simply if you could introduce me to my assistant and a few of the croupiers i should manage from there whatever you want give me an hour to change and unpack then wanting to break contact serena twisted the knob we have other things to talk about serena the words seemed to flutter along her skin aching with need she turned back to him yes she said quietly but id rather we cleared up the business preliminaries first so its clear one thing has nothing to do with the other watching her justin caught the collar of her suit between his thumb and forefinger im not sure that one hasnt very much to do with the other he murmured and that both of us arent fools for pretending otherwise the pulse at the base of her throat began to hammer visibly but even as he noted it her voice became strong and clear well both find out soon enough wont we with a slow smile justin dropped his hand yes we will ill see you in an hour it was going to be hard work serena discovered quickly every bit as hard as her work on the celebration but this time she mused as she glanced around the crowded noisy casino she had her own stake she signed her name to a cash receipt one of the croupiers brought her and felt a small glow of pleasure part of the life pulsing around her at that moment belonged to her adjustments would take time she reminded herself as she noted a few speculative glances aimed her way when justin had introduced her as his partner serena had almost heard the wheels turning inside each brain she would simply have to prove herself qualified for the position no matter what happened between her and justin personally rule number one was confidence rule number two was tenacity when applied together serena considered them an unbeatable combination not unlike the formula she used to handle her father her assistant nero was a big quiet black man who had taken the news of serenas interest in the hotel with a silent shrug she learned that he had worked in justins first casino as a bouncer and in one capacity or another had worked in all of justins properties with as few words as possible he took serena through the casino gave her the basic routine then left her alone he was one man she concluded who wouldnt be won over easily catching a signal from one of the dealers serena crossed the room before she was halfway to the table she heard the angry raised voice it took only a glance to determine the man in question was very unlucky and more than a little unhappy about it excuse me giving the players at the table a general smile serena moved to stand beside the croupier is there a problem you bet there is sweetheart the man on the end leaned over and took her wrist who are you serena allowed her eyes to lower to his hand then brought them slowly back to his face im the owner he gave a quick laugh before he drained his glass ive seen the owner lady he doesnt look anything like you my partner serena informed him with an icy smile out of the corner of her eye she caught neros movement toward her and imperceptibly shook her head is there something i can help you with ive dropped a bundle at this table tonight he told her my friends herell vouch for that the other players ran the gamut between looking bored or annoyed all of them ignored him would you care to cash in the rest of your chips she asked politely i want a chance to make some back he countered setting down his empty glass this joker wont raise the limit serena glanced at the pokerfaced croupier and saw the dregs of fury in his eyes our dealers arent authorized to raise the table limit mr carson mick carson and id like to know what kind of operation this is where a man cant have a chance of getting even as i said serena returned calmly the dealers arent authorized to up the limit but i am how much did you have in mind mr carson thats more like it he said and signaled for another drink serena gave a small shake of her head to the roaming cocktail waitress five thousand on the hand he sent serena a hard grin that should balance things out ill sign for it all right bring mr carson his tab nero she ordered sensing he stood within earshot you can play the single hand for five thousand mr carson serena shot him a level look and if you lose you call it a night all right honey he took her wrist again letting his eyes travel down the length of the sleek ruby dress and if i win why dont you and i go and have a quiet drink somewhere dont press your luck mr carson serena warned him with a smile on her face chuckling he took the clipboard nero brought to him then scrawled his name never any harm in trying honey oh no he added when serena stepped aside you deal without a word serena took the croupiers place it was then she caught sight of justin standing to the side watching her damn she met his eyes briefly wondering if she had let her annoyance get in the way of judgment with another glance at carson she told herself it would be worth the five thousand to get rid of him peacefully bets she asked letting her eyes skim the other players as she counted out carsons chips by unanimous consent the others at the table abstained just you and me carson said sliding his chips forward deal silently serena dealt him a seven and a two a glance at her hole card revealed twelve with nine showing hit carson ordered reaching absently for his empty glass she turned up a queen stand he said and sent her a wide mirthless smile stand on nineteen serena turned up her hole card twelvefifteen she continued as she turned up a three without pausing she drew out a five twenty carson let out his breath in an oath come back again mr carson she said coolly and waited for him to stand he eyed her a moment as she calmly raked in his chips then rising walked out of the casino without a word i apologize for the inconvenience serena smiled at the other players before she nodded to the dealer you did that real smooth miss macgregor nero mumbled as she walked past him stopping serena turned back thank you nero and its rena she had the pleasure of seeing him flash her a smile before she walked to justin were you ready to have me committed she asked him quietly justin looked down at her then idly twirled the end of a lock of hair around his finger you know i wanted you here for a variety of reasons that was one of them pleased she laughed what if id lost justin shrugged then youdve lost youd still have handled a potentially uncomfortable situation with the minimal of fuss and with style he murmured scanning her face i do admire your style serena macgregor strange she could feel the change inside her even as it happened the softening the heating the wanting ive always admired yours youre tired justin ran a thumb lightly under her eyes where the faintest of shadows was forming a little she admitted what time is it around four no wonder the trouble with these places is that you lose track of day and night youve already put in more than your share he told her as he began to lead her through the casino what you need is some breakfast mmm i take it that means youre hungry i hadnt noticed but since you mention it i think im starving serena looked back over her shoulder as he nudged her through the doors of his outer office but isnt the restaurant the other way well have breakfast up in my suite oh wait a minute with another laugh she pulled up short i think the restaurantll be a lot smarter justin studied her a moment then reached into his pocket oh justin heads my suite tails the restaurant with lowered brows she held out her hand let me see that coin taking it from him serena examined both sides all right im too hungry to argue flip it with a deft movement of his thumb he did serena waited until it lay on the back of his hand then let out a sigh well take the elevator up justin said blandly chapter eight contents prev next im still going to beat you one of these days serena said with a yawn as justin pressed the button for the penthouse and when i do its going to be worth more than breakfast she glanced around at the smoky mirrored walls you know i hardly noticed the elevator when i was in your office its an escape route he said then gave her a small smile when she looked at him we all need one occasionally i dont suppose i thought you would she remembered the twoway glass in his office and sighed do they crowd you at times justin all those people only a thin wall away more lately than they used to he admitted i suppose you felt the same way on the boat occasionally isnt that why you went out on deck when everyone else was asleep she answered by lifting her shoulders well ill have to get used to it if im going to be living here in any case ive always seemed to live in a crowd when the doors slid open serena stepped through justin this is really lovely he used bolder colors in his personal rooms slashes of indigo in the cushions of a low spreading sofa the flash of chartreuse in the shade of a glass lamp for balance there were sketches in pastel chalks and a beveled mirror in a gilt frame you can relax here serena decided picking up a carved figure of a hawk in middive it hardly seems like a hotel at all with your personal things around oddly when he saw her with her hands on what was his justin felt his first intimacy with the room to him it had always been a living arrangement nothing more nothing less a place to go when he wasnt working he had similar rooms in other hotels they were comfortable private and he realized suddenly empty until now of course my suite is very nice serena went on roaming at will to touch or examine whatever came to hand but ill feel more settled in once i spread some of my own things around i think ill have my mother ship me my writing desk and a few other pieces turning she found him watching her in the still silent manner he could so easily slip into suddenly nervous serena set down a small glass bowl of cobalt blue what sort of view do you have serena moved toward the window and had taken the first step up onto the small raised platform in front of it before she noticed that the glass table was already set lifting the cover from one of the plates serena saw a hearty mexican omelet a rasher of bacon and a com muffin with a tilt of the lid on a silver serving pot the aroma of fresh coffee filled the room beside the table was an ice bucket of champagne well imagine that serena murmured as she slipped the single rosebud from its crystal vase look what the good fairy left justin amazing and they say miracles are a thing of the past you want to hear a miracle serena asked him passing the bud under her nose its a miracle i dont dump this coffee over your head i prefer to take it internally he murmured as he crossed the room to join her do you like your rose this is the second time youve made my eating arrangements before consulting me she began you were hungry last time too he reminded her thats not the point what is serena took a deep frustrated breath and was assaulted by the aroma of hot food i knew what it was a minute ago she muttered how did you manage to have it here all hot and ready i called room service before i came out to the casino to see if you needed rescuing draping a cloth over the bottle he deftly removed the champagne cork very clever surrendering to hunger serena sat propping her elbows on the table she set her chin on her folded hands champagne for breakfast its the best time for it justin filled two glasses before he joined her if i decide to overlook your arrogance serena considered as she cut into the omelet this is really very nice of you in an underhanded fashion youre welcome he murmured lifting his glass after the first bite serena closed her eyes in silent appreciation and its easy to overlook arrogance on an empty stomach either im starving justin or this is the best omelet every made ill give the chef your approval mmm ill have to take a look at the kitchen tomorrow and the nightclub she added over another mouthful i noticed you have chuck rosen for a week run there shouldnt be an empty seat i have him signed for an exclusive twoyear contract justin broke a muffin in half hes a guaranteed sellout in all the hotels that was a wise investment serena mused you know lifting her wine she studied him over the rim youre exactly what i thought you were when you sat down at my table the first time and yet youre nothing like i thought you were sipping justin returned her gaze what did you think i was a professional gambler which of course was accurate but serena trailed off and drank again justin was right she mused champagne had never tasted better i didnt see you as a man who could build up and run a chain of places like this no amused he toyed with his meal as he watched her what then i think i saw you as sort of a nomad which again is partially accurate because of your heritage but i didnt consider you as a man whod want the sort of responsibility hotels like these require youre an interesting mix justin of the ruthless and the responsible the hard and she picked up the rosebud again the sweet no ones ever accused me of being that before justin murmured as he filled her glass again of what of being sweet well its not one of your dominating virtues she mumbled into her wine i suppose thats why it throws me off when it comes through it gives me great pleasure to throw you off his finger trailed down the back of her hand to her wrist ive found a certain weakness for vulnerability determinedly she took another swallow of wine im not vulnerable as a rule no he agreed perhaps thats why its all the more rewarding that i can cause you to be your pulse jumps when i touch you here he whispered grazing a finger over the inside of her wrist a bit unsteadily serena set down her glass i should go but he rose with her and now his fingers were laced with hers his eyes when hers met them were very calm and very confident i made myself a promise this afternoon serena he told her quietly that id make love with you before the night was over taking a step closer justin captured her other hand we still have an hour before sunrise it was what she wanted every pore of her body seemed to be crying out with need yet if his hands hadnt held hers so firmly she would have backed away justin i wont deny that i want you but i think it would be best if we gave it some more time reasonable he agreed as he drew her into his arms times up he stopped her protesting laugh with his lips there was no food to stop this hunger his mouth was hard devouring before serena could respond or struggle away yet she knew as he crashed her body to his that this time he would permit no struggle she tasted his lips and tasted urgency she felt the firm long lines of his body and felt need when his tongue sought hers there was no easy teasing no gentle testing but a desperate demand for intimacy now he seemed to say to her theres no turning back what had begun weeks before with a long cool meeting of eyes would reach its culmination it would happen serena thought dizzily because neither of them wanted any other answer through those first urgent stirrings of passion she felt a quiet joy she loved and love she realized was the ultimate adventure placing her hands on either side of his face she carefully drew her lips away from his then looked into his eyes warmer now with need for her she wanted a moment only a moment to clear her head to say what she wanted to say without the heat of passion racing through her gently she traced her fingers over the long strong bones of his face his heart thudded against her breast as hers began to calm a smile touched the lips that were warm and aching from his this she told him quietly is what i want what i choose justin said nothing as he stared down at her the simple words were more seducing than her soft summer scent than the hot pulsing taste they weakened him exposing vulnerabilities hed never considered suddenly there was more than passion raging through him bringing his hand to hers he slid it to his mouth pressing his lips against the palm ive thought of nothing but you for weeks he said wanted no one but you he ran a hand down the length of her hair before his fingers closed over it in a fist need good god when had he ever felt such need come to bed serena i cant do without you any longer her eyes were calm as she offered him her hand without words they walked to the bedroom the room was in shadows accented by the faint light that signals the end of night and it was silent so silent that serena could hear her own breath as it began to quicken when she felt justin move away from her she stood resolute suddenly tingling with nerves he wouldnt be gentle she thought as she remembered the feel of his mouth and hands on her as a lover he would be equally thrilling and terrifying she heard a sharp scrape then saw the flare of a match as he held it to the wick of a candle the shadows danced her eyes were drawn to him in the flickering yellow light his face held a dangerous beauty he seemed to belong more to his indian ancestors now than to the world she understood and she knew at that instant why the captive woman had fought against then remained willingly with her captor i want to see you justin murmured reaching out to bring her into the candlelight with surprise he felt the quiver run through her only moments before she had seemed so strong so sure youre trembling i know she took a deep breath and exhaled quickly its silly no he felt a streak of power sharp and clean serena macgregor wasnt a woman to tremble for any man but for him even as the fire lit in her eyes her body shuddered taking her hair in his hand justin drew her head back in the shifting light his eyes glistened with fierce almost savage desire no he said again then crushed her mouth to his she seemed to melt into him justin thought he could feel her bones soften liquefy until she was totally pliant in his arms for the moment he would accept surrender but soon he would have more much more with his mouth still avid on hers he began to undress her forgetting the fragile material he tugged pausing only to mold inch by inch the flesh he uncovered she was shuddering now pulling at the buttons of his shirt as her dress slid down to pool at her feet hed known she would wear something soft and filmy with a fingertip justin nudged the thin straps of her camisole off her shoulders but he didnt remove it not yet he wanted the pleasure of feeling silk between them he tormented her running hot nibbling kisses over her face as she struggled to undress him her fingers touching his flesh wrenched a groan from him that he muffled against her throat then she was beneath him on the bed with only a fragile wisp of material separating them he felt a madness a driving need to take her swiftly that he had to fight back her breasts were small and firm in his hand straining against the silk as he rained kiss after savage kiss on her lips consumed by her justin drove her mercilessly to the first peak with only his hands and mouth swallowing her gasps he pressed his body down on hers so that her frantic movements blended into him then ruthlessly he slid down to capture her silkclad breast in his mouth straggling for air serena arched against him her body shuddered from a hundred unexpected sensations she was trapped in a world of silk and fire at her every movement the bedspread caressed her naked back and legs whispering of dark promises her flesh was seared wherever he had touched as though hed carried the tiny gold flame of the candle in his fingers as he wet the silk above her straining nipple with his tongue she felt the fire leap into her like a voice from a distance she heard him murmuring her name and more she couldnt understand as if hed lost patience with any barrier justin drew the chemise down to her waist so that he could feast on her naked skin serena pressed him closer her hands now as demanding as his though her mouth ached for the taste of him her body thrilled to the desperate race of his lips over her skin she knew only pleasure now the steamy pleasure of unrelenting passion gone were restrictions and rules here was the abandonment she had glimpsed briefly in a dream it was only now that she realized there was so much she didnt know so much shed never felt second by second there were new discoveries as his mouth tarried just above the line of silk she felt a hunger deeper than any shed ever experienced her imagination ran wild thoughts of him inside her filling her dreams of a pleasure so acute they brought a tug of pain between her thighs delirious she clutched at his shoulders take me she demanded on a ragged breath justin take me now but he continued driving her higher as if he hadnt heard her plea he drew the silk down caressing the newly exposed flesh with his lips over the flat quivering stomach over the smooth curve of hip to the taut arching muscles of her inner thigh she arched crying out thrown swiftly into the river of passion he was relentless as terrifying a lover as she had feared as thrilling as shed dreamed she was all that he wanted soft and moist and out of control desperate demanding she clutched at him scraping his flesh with those sleek elegant nails he could hear her moans her incoherent words rasping out of her throat as he drove her further and further toward madness her skin was damp beaded with passion while her hips thrust her need toward him again and again now she was his mindlessly his and he knew somehow that no one had ever taken her more completely fighting to hold the power a moment longer he ranged himself above her serena gripped his hips urging him on in the first touch of daylight her face was like porcelain her eyes were closed her lips parted as each breath trembled through them half crazed with need he vowed no man would ever see her as he saw her at that moment look at me justin demanded in a voice harsh with passion look at me serena she opened her eyes and they were glazed with pleasure dark with need youre my woman he slipped inside her and nearly lost control therell be no going back for you now or for you her eyes lost focus as the two of them began to move together justin straggled to comprehend what she had said but she was moving faster burying his face in her hair he swirled toward the madness dawn streamed through the wide window in a flood of rosegold light with justins head still nestled at her throat serena watched it play over the length of his back it looked like what she felt like she discovered bright and rich and new was there a better way to watch the sunrise than with your lovers body warm on yours sleep she felt no need for it she knew she could lie like this for hours with the sun growing brighter and the sound of his breathing gentle in her ear with a sigh sweetened by contentment she ran her hands up his back at her touch justin lifted his head with their faces close he looked at her letting his eyes roam feature by feature until there was nothing in his mind but her face flushed and soft from loving without a word he lowered his mouth to hers in the butterfly touch he used so rarely gently almost reverently he brushed kisses over her eyelids her temples her cheeks until serena felt unexpected tears rise in her throat beneath his her body felt fluid and free i thought i knew what it would be like he whispered touching his lips to hers again i should have realized with you nothings as i expect it raising his head again he traced a fingertip under her eye you should sleep she smiled and brushed at the hair on his forehead i dont think ill ever sleep again i know i never want to miss another sunrise he kissed her lightly then rolling from her brought her close to his side i want you with me serena content she snuggled closer i am with you i want you to live with me he corrected her tilting her chin up so that he could see her eyes here its not enough to know youre in a room down the hall then he paused running his thumb over her lips therell be talk downstairs speculation resting her head on his shoulder again serena began to trace a finger across his chest talk wont stop downstairs once your names linked with daniel macgregors daughter she told him no she heard the change in tone and knew that if she looked his eyes would be unfathomable the press would find the relationship interesting considering my background and reputation as opposed to yours justin she trailed a finger down the center of his torso then back up again are you asking me to live with you or warning me not to for a long moment he was silent while serena continued to trace lazy patterns over his chest both he answered at length i see well she turned her head so that she was free to nibble on his neck i suppose i should think about it she felt a quiver of response as her hand ran low over his stomach weigh the pros and cons she continued working kisses up his jawline shifting she lay across him her face just above his i dont suppose you could run through the pros and cons for me with a smile she pressed her lips to his just to refresh my memory in the interest of helping you make an intelligent decision he began sliding a hand down to her hip mmmhmm but even as he sought to deepen the kiss she moved finding the vulnerable spot below his ear did you know i was captain of the debate team my senior year at smith no his eyes shut as the heady sensation of being seduced took over give me a subject she said sliding her fingertips down his ribs and the time for research she added as she nipped gently at his throat and i can argue either side of the issue now as i see it she gave a sigh of pleasure as she pressed her lips to the fast jerky pulse at the base of his throat living with you entails a great many inconveniences his hand roamed over her hip slipping between her thighs serena slid farther down his body frustrating him serena no i have the floor she reminded him then flicked her tongue over his chest id lose my privacy and a great deal of sleep she said reveling in the quickening of his breath as she boldly explored his body id risk the inevitable gossip and speculation of my new employees as well as the press as muscles bunched and flowed under her hands beneath her seeking lips she lost her train of thought like the marble sculpture of the chieftain she thought hazily as her blood began to pound youd be impossible to live with she concluded lost somewhere between her own initiative and the savage beauty of his naked body demanding infuriating and because i find you so incredibly attractive id never have a moments peace of mind she moved back up him letting her body please itself by rubbing sinuously against his on the journey her smile was slow and seductive as she saw his eyes were fixed on her face give me one good reason why i should after considering all that live with you his breathing wasnt steady but he couldnt control it the hand that grabbed her hair wasnt gentle but he couldnt stop it either i want you serena lowered her lips until they were an inch from his show me she demanded even as her mouth came down to his justin was rolling her over roughly beyond reason he thrust into her quickly wrenching a cry from her that turned to gasping moans as he drove her harder and faster with mindless grasping greed he took and took but the hunger only seemed to feed upon itself growing and swelling as her legs and arms tangled around him he was drenched with sweat trapped in those soft white limbs unable to breathe unable to break free and it was her name that shouted over and over in his mind his body seemed to shake with the sound threatening to explode with the desperate repetition of her name then the word shattered into tiny fragments he knew he would never be rid of them then he knew nothing but the shuddering relief of fulfillment dazed he slept with his body and mind tangled with her the phone woke him barely four hours later beside him serena stirred sighed and mumbled an oath keeping one arm around her justin stretched out the other and plucked up the receiver yes glancing down he saw that serena had opened heavy eyes to stare at him he brushed the top of her head with his lips when seeing him tense she pushed up on her elbow have they evacuated no ill handle it ill be down in a few minutes what is it justin was already out of bed and heading for the closet bomb threat in vegas he grabbed the first thing that came to hand jeans and a cashmere sweater oh god serena was scrambling up searching for her lingerie when the phone call said it would detonate at three thirtyfive vegas time unless we deliver a quarter of a million in cash that doesnt give us a hell of a lot of time he muttered snapping his jeans theyre still evacuating youre not going to pay fury in her eyes serena pulled the chemise over her head justin watched her in silence for a moment then smiled as cold and sharp as a knife im not going to pay as he strode into the next room serena dashed after him ill be down as soon as i change theres nothing for you to do the elevator doors were already opening as she grabbed his arm ill be with you for an instant his features softened hurry then he told her giving her a quick hard kiss before he stepped into the car in less than ten minutes serena was rushing through the reception area into justins office he glanced up as she entered but gave her no more than a nod as he continued talking in quiet tones into the phone kate stood beside the desk her hands clenched her usually composed face strained miss macgregor she said curtly without taking her eyes from justin could you fill me in please some nut claims he has a bomb rigged somewhere in the vegas hotel hes supposed to have a remote device that will set it off in she glanced at her watch an hour and fifteen minutes theyre evacuating and the bomb squads sweeping the place but but serena prompted do you have any idea how big that hotel is kate demanded in a shaking voice how small and deadly a bomb can be saying nothing serena walked to the bar at the far end of the room and poured a snifter of brandy she brought it back to kate pushing it into her hands drink this she ordered with a shudder kate tilted the snifter back until it was empty thank you she pressed her lips together a moment then looked back at serena im sorry my husband lost an arm in vietnam a booby trap this she let out a long breath this brings it all back come on sit down serena said more gently as she urged her onto the sofa theres nothing to do now but wait justins not going to pay kate murmured no serena shot her a surprised look do you think he should kate dragged a hand through her hair im not objective about things like this but she brought her eyes to serenas again he has so much to lose hed lose more than money if he paid turning serena ranged herself behind justin she touched him only once briefly a hand on his shoulder as kate looked on he reached up and caught serenas fingers in his the gesture told her more than a thousand words why he loves her kate thought stunned it had never occurred to her that justin blade would be vulnerable to any woman even as kate studied his face she wondered if he knew he was he set off a charge in one of the basement storage rooms justin let the phone drop to his shoulder a moment oh god was anyone hurt he looked up at serena with eyes that told nothing of his thoughts no theres damage but its fairly minor he called in to tell the police that one was just a bonus to prove he wasnt bluffing he wants the money dropped off at threefifteen vegas time serena dropped a hand to his arm what are you thinking justin im thinking hes cutting it very fine for someone whos after a quarter of a million im wondering if thats all hes after when he called the hotel he asked for me by name serena felt a new ripple of unease a lot of people know you own the comanche she began or its very likely someone who once worked for you or knew someone that did he shifted the phone again well have to wait and see wont we and there was something in the quiet words serena recognized a threat of violence a promise of revenge how many more people left in there justin demanded into the receiver no i want to know the minute everybodys out ill get some coffee serena said no rising kate shook her head ill do it you stay with him serena looked at the trim gold clock on his desk ten fortyfive moistening her lips she gripped the back of justins chair and waited his eyes drifted to the clock as well less than an hour he thought and he was helpless how could he explain that the hotel was more than concrete and stone to him it had been the first thing he had owned his first home after his parents had died it symbolized his independence his success his heritage now he could only stand by and wait for it to be blown apart was that the reason for the feeling in his gut that the threat was directed at him personally running a hand over the back of his neck justin decided that made more sense and yet his instincts told him differently it might be a bluff serenas voice came calm and strong from behind him justin felt the sharp wave of frustration pass holding out a hand he waited for her to come around the chair and slip hers into it i dont think so she pressed his hand between both of hers it would be wrong to pay youre doing the right thing justin its the only thing i know how to do he gave his attention to the voice over the phone good the guests and staff are out he told serena she sat on the arm of his chair while they both watched the clock kate came back with coffee but it sat untouched on the desk while they waited as the minutes ticked by serena could feel the tension coming off justin in waves he sat silently the phone in one hand she tried to imagine the complexity of a search in a hotel the size of justins vegas comanche how many hundreds of rooms serena wondered how many thousands of closets and corners she wondered helplessly if the sound of the explosion would carry through the receiver and how many other times she thought has justins fate rested on the caprices of luck this time she told herself as she placed her hand back on his shoulder fate would have to beat them both because she was watching them serena saw the sudden rigidity in the fingers that lay on the desk yes to keep herself from asking questions serena bit her lip as justin listened to the voice over the phone i see no not that im aware of yes ill be there as soon as possible thank you hanging up the phone he turned to serena they found it oh thank god she dropped her forehead onto his from what i was just told it would have taken out the casino and half the main floor kate book me on the first flight to vegas justin serena stood from the arm of his chair and found her legs were oddly weak do they have any idea who no for the first time he noticed the coffee mug on his desk lifting it he drank half of it down i have to go out smooth over things in the hotel and talk to the authorities ill be back in a couple of days he rose and took her by the shoulders it looks like my new partners going to have a trial by fire ill be fine rising on her toes she brushed a kiss over his mouth and ill take good care of our hotel im sure you will he said then drew her closer i dont like leaving you just now ill be here when you get back she reached up to frame his face with her hands dont worry just come back soon he lowered his mouth to hers and lingered go get some sleep he suggested oh no this is my first full day on the job his face was calm but she could feel the tension in him instead of the endless questions she wanted to ask serena made herself smile and pull away i have quite a few things to do tour the hotel inspect the kitchen go through the files in my office arrange to have my things moved to our suite the our hit him forcibly leaving him a little stunned do that first he demanded taking her hands again i want to know youre in my bed serena i youre on a plane in fortyfive minutes justin kate interrupted poking her head in the doorway youll have to hurry if you want to make it all right have a car brought around justin with a half laugh serena tugged on her hands youre breaking my fingers there was something in the look he gave her part wary part stormy that had her smile fading what is it had he been going to tell her he loved her he thought with a quick flutter of panic had he been going to say the words before they had fully registered in his mind itll keep he said at length all right and because she wanted to erase the tension from his face she smiled again then throwing her arms around his neck serena pressed her mouth to his be miserable without me please ill do my best kate has the number if you need me justin your cars here yes all right he gave serena a last bruising kiss think of me he ordered before he strode away taking a deep breath she sat in the chair still warm from him do i have any choice she wondered aloud chapter nine contents prev next over the next week serena immersed herself in the routine of the comanche it was she decided her first major investment that hadnt been carefully chosen by her father and one she was determined to understand intimately she didnt mind a few speculative looks the occasional murmured word behind a hand as she inspected the public rooms or pored over the books and files and records she expected them she spent her days learning the hotel from top to bottom her evenings in the casino or her office in the capacity as manager the nights she spent alone in justins suite over the week she discovered two things the comanche was a slickly run organization that catered to people who had money to spend it gave its clientele the best for a price and second justins absence was a blessing in disguise she had little time to miss him with her hours packed with things to do only late at night when she found herself alone did serena fully realize how much shed grown to depend on him for a word a touch his presence but alone she had the opportunity to prove to herself and to her staff that she was born competent and serious about running the hotel serena made the most of it her background served her well over the years shed become accustomed to patronizing fine hotels and knew what a client looked for from checkin to checkout her year on the celebration had given her another perspective she understood the problems that plagued the staff from fatigue to boredom to shortage in the linen count the first day she had won over nero and kate by the second serena had swayed the chef the night manager and the housekeeper she considered each one a major victory behind the trim pecan desk in her office serena went over the current weeks schedule of her croupiers directly in front of her the panel was open giving her a broad view of the casino she found she enjoyed the twin feelings of isolation and companionship since the day had barely started by casino standards she planned to give her paperwork another two hours knowing if she were needed the buzzer on her desk would sound lighting up the location of the trouble then shed work the floor if she kept busy until weariness took over she wouldnt be tempted to pick up the phone and dial justins number in vegas he was a man who needed room who didnt make promises or expect them if she were to win in the end serena knew she couldnt forget that if she were patient there might come a time when hed be comfortable loving her with a quick laugh she shook her head shed never be comfortable loving him nor did she choose to be rubbing the back of her neck serena frowned down at the schedule it could be made less complicated she mused if they hired one more croupier as a floater that would make the hours a bit more flexible and yes come in without glancing up serena continued to look over the list with a floater to pick up the slack she mused she could juggle the shifts then suddenly a spray of violets landed on the paper in front of her i thought that might get your attention feeling her heartbeat speed serena looked up justin she was out of her chair and racing into his arms before either of them expected it as his mouth came down to hers he realized it was the first time hed seen that spontaneous unrestricted joy on her face and it was for him the fatigue of a long flight the tension of a week melted from him what is it about a woman he asked her that makes it so good to hold one smiling she tilted her head back the closer study of his face brought concern you look tired her fingers rose to smooth away the lines of strain around his mouth ive never seen you look tired before was it very bad ive spent more pleasant weeks he drew her back to him wanting to fill himself with the feel of her the scent later he thought hed tell her of the neatly printed note hed received another threat without detail or reasons just a promise that it wasnt over i did what you asked he added running a hand over the smooth flesh the low back of her dress exposed mmm what i was miserable without you she didnt laugh as he had expected but tightened her arms around his neck fighting back tears she pressed her lips to his throat you didnt call i waited for you to call she whispered appalled by her words serena pushed out of his arms swallowing tears and shaking her head no i didnt mean that the way it sounded i know you were busy she lifted her hands then helplessly let them fall and and so was i there were a million things she turned to shuffle papers on her desk were both adults and independent the last thing we need is to start putting chains on each other you ramble when youre nervous justin commented whirling serena glared at him with hot furious eyes dont make fun of me odd that i would have missed that killing look he said as he came to her taking her face in his hands he held it gently his eyes on hers serena felt her anger drain to leave her weak and pulsing serena he said on a sigh as his mouth closed over hers the tender kiss grew hungry quickly she felt the need pour out of him to match her own as their lips clung parting only to seek new angles deeper pleasures longings of a week intensified so that there were two pairs of hot avid lips searching two pairs of urgent hands roaming on a jerky breath justin crushed her against him no woman he thought dimly had ever made him suffer like this oh god i want you serena i want you so that i cant think of anything but having you she pressed her cheek against his but the movements behind the glass caught her eye this is silly she admitted but i feel exposed on a shaky laugh she drew back but the look in his eyes had her heart thudding again why dont you close the panel she whispered and make love to me the knock on the door brought a groan from her on a long breath justin drew her away until he held her lightly by the shoulders i forgot i brought you a present tell them to go away serena suggested and give it to me later she brought her hands to his much later the knock came again come on justin youve had your ten minutes caine justin watched surprise and pleasure race across serenas face caine kissing her nose he let his hands drop away from her why dont you go let them in dashing to the door serena wrenched it open caine alan with a whoop of laughter she launched herself at both of them what are you doing here she demanded kissing them both wont the state and federal governments collapse even public servants need a few days off now and then caine retorted then held serena at arms length hed changed so little she thought though both her brothers had inherited their fathers height caine was lean and rangy nearly thin serena mused now with sisterly objectivity yet he had a fascinating face all planes and angles with a powerful grin he used to his advantage and eyes nearly as dark as her own his hair waved carelessly around his face blond with hints of red looking at him she could easily see why it was reputed his skill with women equaled his skill as a lawyer hmm she hasnt turned out too badly has she alan with an arched brow serena turned to her oldest brother no he answered giving her the slow serious smile that suited his dark brooding looks he looks more like heathcliff she thought than a us senator though shes still a bit scrawny he took her chin in his fingers turning her face right and left pretty girl he stated in a perfect imitation of their fathers burr maybe you should have married arlene judson after all she said sweetly then relenting she wrapped an arm around each of her brothers oh im so glad to see you justin sat on the corner of serenas desk and watched them she looked very small between the two tall men but for the first time he noted the resemblance between her and caine the shape of the mouth the nose the eyes alan was a larger rougher version of anna yet all three of them carried daniels stamp it seemed so clear now justin wondered that he hadnt recognized it the first moment hed seen her perhaps it was seeing them as a family picturing serena as a sister he thought of diana and felt a twinge of regret hed done all he could there justin reminded himself still hed never known what it was like to have that basic lifetime kinship any more than hed ever have the place in serenas heart that belonged to family how long are you staying serena demanded as she pulled them both inside the office just over the weekend alan told her as caine took a quick thorough study of her office so youve taken yourself a partner after all he said to justin we were all a bit surprised after youd turned dad down so often i was more persuasive serena said simply caine shot justin a look that didnt ask questions only because he already knew the answers there was warning in it subtle but perfectly clear you still havent told me what youre doing here like this she walked over to stand beside justin as caine folded himself into a chair and alan moved to glance through the glass we heard about the bomb threat in vegas alan told her i gave justin a call he suggested you might enjoy a visit and he turned with one of his rare grins caine and i thought our coming might keep dad from putting in an appearance for a while last time i talked to him caine said he was hinting he might enjoy a few weeks at the beach serena made a sound that was somewhere between a groan and a laugh i suppose you heard about his last little plot it seems to have worked out well enough alan stated as he watched justins hand come up to rest on the back of her neck i was tempted to break more than a few cigars she muttered then glanced down at the buzzer on her desk as it sounded table six no she said touching justins shoulder as he started to rise ill take care of it why dont the three of you go upstairs and relax ill be up as soon as im sure everything is settled down here is it unethical for me to gamble here now that youre half owner caine wondered aloud not as long as you play as poorly as usual serena answered as she swept out of the door with a quick oath caine stretched out his long legs just because i used to let her beat me at poker let her win hell alan said mildly she used to massacre you you didnt say much on the phone justin he continued as he turned away from the twoway mirror can you discuss what happened in vegas with a shrug justin drew a cigar out of his pocket it was a homemade bomb very compact it was under one of the keno tables the fbis running down the list of former employees regulars whove dropped large amounts of money any known extortionists with a similar mo i dont have too much faith in that there were some threatening calls but they couldnt trace them and i didnt recognize the voice they dont have much to go on as he lit the cigar his gaze wandered past alans shoulder to where serena stood talking to a customer its impossible to trace everyone whos lost money in one of my casinos even if that is the motive behind the bombing you dont think it was caine asked and followed justins gaze out to his sister just a hunch he muttered then rose restlessly there was a threat delivered a couple of days ago nothing specific just enough to let me know hed try something else no wheres whens or hows caine put in no justin gave him a grim smile of course i could close down all of my hotels and wait him out he took a quick savage drag on the cigar im damned if i will with an effort he controlled the impotent fury he was being stalked he knew it just as surely as if hed seen the shadow behind him i want serena to go home until this is resolved he said briefly between the two of you you should be able to convince her caines answer was a short laugh alan gave justin a quiet look shed go he said if you went with her damn it alan im not going to go find a convenient hole and hide while someone plays with my life and serena would he countered she has a half interest in one out of five of my hotels justin said tightly if anything happens to this one the insurance covers her losses his eyes were drawn to the glass again ive more than an investment at stake youre a fool if you think thats all rena has alan murmured justin whirled on him giving way to all the pentup anger hed harnessed for a week i tell you i have a bad feeling about this someones after me and shes too close i want her away safe where nothing can happen to her id think youd understand that for gods sake shes your sister and what is she to you caine asked softly furious justin turned on him a hundred curses trembling on his lips he met the dark direct eyes so much like serenas everything he breathed before he turned back to the glass damn it shes everything well thats settled serena said as she swirled back into the office i just she trailed off as the tension rose up like a wall slowly she looked from one man to the other then walked by her brothers to justin what is it nothing forcing himself to be calm he tapped out his cigar and took her hand have you had dinner no but deliberately he looked past her to alan and caine well have something brought upstairs unless youd prefer the dining room actually i think ill try my luck outside caine rose casually alan can keep me from dropping a months pay got any tips rena stick to the quarter slots she said and made her lips curve o ye of little faith he muttered and tugged on her ear well see you tomorrow late tomorrow alan put in as he opened the door ill never get him away from the tables before three serena waited until the door shut behind them justin whats going on im tired he said taking her arm lets go upstairs justin im not a fool he led her quickly through to his office and into the elevator it felt like something was about to explode when i walked in there are you angry with alan and caine no its nothing that concerns you the cold flat answer had her stiffening in defense justin im not trying to pry into your personal business but as it appeared to involve my brothers i feel entitled to an explanation he recognized the hurt and the anger he wanted to drive them both away drag her into his arms and stop her questions in a way that would erase his own temper and tension but as the elevator doors slid open justin forced himself to think coolly he could use the anger and hurt for his own ends its nothing that concerns you he repeated carelessly why dont you order something from roomservice i want a shower without waiting for her answer he strode off too stunned by his tone to react serena only stared after him what had changed since that desperate tempestuous greeting they had shared why was he treating her like a stranger or worse she realized like a comfortable mistress a man could take or brush aside at his whim standing in the center of the room serena tried to summon up fury but found only anguish shed known the risk she was taking it seemed shed lost the gamble no bunching her hands into fists she shook her head no she wasnt so easily dismissed let him have his shower and his meal she decided then she would explain to him exactly what she expected calmly she added to herself as she walked to the phone shed be very calm with a vicious stab of her finger she punched the button for room service this is ms macgregor id like a steak and salad of course ms macgregor how would you like your steak burnt she muttered pardon with an effort she got herself under control its for i mr blade she explained im sure you know what he likes of course ms macgregor ill have his dinner sent up right away thank you everyone jumps for justin blade she thought grimly as she replaced the receiver walking to the bar she fixed herself a tall stiff drink when justin came out of the bedroom serena was sitting on the sofa while the room service waiter arranged justins meal on the table across the room justin wore only a robe which parted at the throat when he dipped his hands into his pockets arent you eating he asked with a nod toward the single place setting no she sipped her drink you go right ahead opening her purse she drew out a bill then held it out to the waiter thank you thank you ms macgregor enjoy your meal mr blade when the door shut behind him justin took his seat i thought you hadnt had dinner im not hungry she said simply with a shrug justin applied himself to the salad and tasted nothing apparently there were no major problems while i was gone nothing i couldnt handle though i do have a few personal suggestions i feel the hotel and the casino run very smoothly you made a good investment he sliced through the meat you could look at it that way serena draped an arm over the back of the couch her beaded jacket shimmered in the quiet light looking at her justin wanted nothing more than to drag it off her and the thin black silk she wore beneath to lose himself in her again the soft white skin the masses of gold hair he stabbed a piece of steak with his fork the hotel seems to have gotten over the hump in this last year he said easily it seems unnecessary for both of us to give it twentyfour hours a day unable to swallow any more he poured coffee you might want to think about going back home she held the glass halfway to her lips home she repeated dully youre not needed here at the moment he went on it occurred to me that it would be more practical for you to go home or wherever you like then come back and take over when i have to be away i see blindly she set the glass on the table in front of her and rose ive no intention of falling into the category of silent partner justin her voice was strong and clear but from across the room he could see her eyes swim nor do i have the intention of falling into the category of excess baggage its a very simple matter to go back to our original agreement and forget a onenight mistake because she could feel her hand begin to tremble she reached for her drink again and drained it ill pack my things and move back into my own suite damn it serena i want you to go home watching her fight back tears he felt something twist inside his stomach in defense justin pushed away from the table and strode down to her i dont want you here he heard her quick indrawn breath but the mist in her eyes cleared with it he found the dryeyed wounded look a hundred times worse theres no need to be cruel justin she murmured youve made yourself clear ill get out of your rooms but i own half this hotel and im staying i havent signed the agreement yet he reminded her she stared at him for a long silent moment youre that desperate to get rid of me she murmured my mistake serena stared down at the empty glass in her hands if id been smarter i wouldnt have slept with you until it was finalized enraged he grabbed the glass from her hand and hurled it across the room where it shattered against the wall no dragging her against him he buried his face in her hair and swore again i cant do it this way i wont let you think that rigid with hurt serena didnt struggle please let me go serena listen to me listen to me he repeated as he drew her away with his hands tight on her shoulders there was a letter delivered before i left vegas it was addressed to me personally whoever planted that bomb wanted me to know he wasnt finished hes going to hit me again sometime somewhere theres more than money involved i can feel it its personal do you understand youre not safe with me she stared at him as the words cut through the pain you said those things to me because you think i might be in some kind of danger if i stay i want you to be away from this reaching up serena pushed his hands from her shoulders youre no better than my father she said furiously arranging my life with your little plots and schemes do you know what you did to me tears threatened again and she forced them back do you know how you hurt me did you ever consider just telling me the truth ive told you he retorted struggling against waves of guilt and need now will you go no serena for gods sake you expect me to pack my bags and run she interrupted shoving at him in frustration to hide because someone might plant a bomb in the hotel sometime why dont you just ask me to find a nice little glass ball somewhere and take up residence damn it justin i have as much at stake in this as you do the hotels fully covered by insurance if anything happened you wouldnt lose your investment she closed her eyes on a sigh you idiot serena be reasonable when her eyes opened the fury was back in them youre being reasonable i suppose i dont give a damn if im being reasonable or not he tossed back i want you somewhere where i know nothing can touch you you cant know anything i know that i love you he grabbed her again shaking her i know that you mean more to me than anything else in my life and im not going to take any chances then how can you ask me to go away she shouted people in love belong together they stared at each other as each realized what had been said justins grip gentled then his hands dropped away do this for me serena anything else she answered not this turning he paced to the window outside the sun was sinking into the sea flashes of fire streaks of gold just like the woman behind him ive never loved anyone justin murmured my parents my sister perhaps but theyve been out of my life a long time i managed without them i dont think i could manage without you even the thought that something might happen terrifies me justin going to him serena wrapped her arms around him and pressed her cheek to his back you know therere no guarantees only odds ive played the odds all my life not with you i still make my own choices she reminded him you cant change that justin i cant let you tell me again she demanded before he could answer and this time dont shout it at me im as susceptible to romance as the next person when he turned back to her justin traced the curve of her lips with his fingertip i always thought i love you sounded so ordinary until now he replaced his fingertip with his lips with the same gentle touch i love you serena she sighed as she felt him slip the jacket from her shoulders justin she murmured when he lifted her into his arms hmm lets not tell my father i hate it when he gloats laughing he lowered her to the bed he was going to love her gently it seemed right somehow when he remembered the hurt in her eyes she was precious to him vital to his life a permanent part of his thoughts soft and already warm she drew him to her he was going to love her gently but she drove him mad her hands were already pushing his robe aside moving over his skin her lips were already racing over his face nipping at his teasing tormenting demanding justin swore as he pulled the dress down her body and the sound of her low husky laughter pushed him over the edge perhaps he hurt her he couldnt control his hands they were wild to touch to possess but she only arched beneath him wanton with abandon until her blood roared like thunder in his ears he murmured mindlessly in the tongue of his ancestors threats promises phrases of love and war he could no longer separate serena heard the harsh quiet words words both primitive and erotic when whispered against her skin there was nothing of the smooth sophisticated gambler in him now but something fierce and untamed and he was hers she thought wildly as his hands bruised over her she smelled his rich male scent a scent undiluted by colognes and buried her face against his shoulder wanting to absorb it but his hunger would allow her no leisure hot and open his mouth crushed down on hers demanding not surrender but aggression desire me he seemed to say need me she answered with a torrent of passion that left them both gasping she thought hed shown her everything there was to know everything there was to have in their first night of loving how could there be so much more with still a promise of secrets as yet undiscovered he seemed to have a depthless well of energy and need as he had from the very beginning he challenged her to match it he touched her and a hundred small violent explosions erupted inside her as her body shuddered from them all her girlhood imaginings of lovemaking the tender words the soft touches paled into insignificance this is what shed been meant for the tempest and the fury with mouths desperately clinging they joined into one wild insatiable form with her eyes still closed serena stretched luxuriously oh god i feel wonderful even to her own ears her voice sounded like the purr of a contented cat ive often thought so justin agreed and ran a hand down the length of her with a laugh she sat up stretching her arms high over her head in the half light he watched her hair tumble over her naked back as it arched no i really do if it werent for the fact that im starving you said you werent hungry he reminded her reaching up he hooked an arm around her waist and brought her falling back onto the bed i wasnt she rolled on top of him now i am after nibbling kisses over his face she nipped at his lip famished you can have the rest of my steak its cold she complained with a sultry laugh she pressed her mouth to his throat cant you think of something else i admire your spirit he said bringing her lips back to his after running a hand down her hair he cradled her head on his shoulder want me to call room service she let out a long contented breath in a little while i love you justin as he closed his eyes his arms tightened around her i wondered if youd get around to telling me that didnt i mention it smiling serena propped herself on his chest hows this i love you she began punctuating her words with kisses i adore you im fascinated by you i lust for you it might do for a start taking her hand to his lips he kissed her fingers slowly serena no quickly she pressed her hand over his mouth dont ask me again im not going anywhere and i dont want to fight with you justin not now not tonight she touched her cheek to his it seems like ive waited all my life to feel like this everything up to this moment seems like a prelude it sounds crazy but i think i knew the first minute i looked up and saw you that everything was going to change she laughed again and drew away and i thought i was much too intellectually sound to believe in love at first sight your intellect he told her slowed things down considerably on the contrary she said with a haughty smile it moved them along beautifully i came here with the idea of becoming your partner so that we could deal on equal terms while i convinced you you couldnt live without me did you she grinned down at him it worked you might be a bit too cocky serena giving her hair a tug he rose from the bed where are you going to let a little air out of your balloon opening a drawer justin drew out a small box i picked this up for you in st thomas a present scrambling up on her knees she held out her hand i live for presents greedy little witch he said as he dropped the box into her outstretched hand her chuckle faded into silence as she opened it twin pinwheels of amethysts and diamonds gleamed up at her catching fire even in the dim light of dusk she remembered how they had looked in the sunlit window where she had first seen them hesitantly she touched one with her finger as if the heat were real and not just an illusion in the stones justin theyre gorgeous she whispered as she raised her eyes to his but why because they suited you and you wouldnt indulge yourself and he dropped a hand to her cheek i already decided i wasnt going to let you walk out of my life if you hadnt come here id have brought you willing or not she asked with the beginnings of a smile i warned you its an old tradition in my family he tucked her hair behind her ears put them on ive wondered how theyd look on you serena took them out of the box and clipped them to her ears still kneeling on the bed she caught her hair back in her hand i want to see justin stopped her with no more than a look her skin was pale and flawless her hair when her hand slowly dropped tumbled wildly wearing no more than a glitter of jewels at her ears she looked like an exotic fantasy the flare of desire in his eyes touched off one in her own as her lips parted she held out her arms to him chapter ten contents prev next serena stretched luxuriously and contemplated getting up if justin hadnt already gone downstairs the idea of lazing away the morning in bed would have been more appealing she lay in the center of the tangle of sheets the spot they had shared wrapped close throughout the night he was still worried she mused even though hed whispered nothing more than a few foolish endearments into her ear before he had left her serena had sensed the controlled tension in him as long as justin was convinced the bomb planted in vegas had been a direct threat against him personally and a prelude of more there was nothing serena could do to soothe him she could only stay close trying to convince him she was in no danger that she could look after herself men serena thought with a small smile no matter how liberal they simply couldnt accept the fact that women could take care of themselves the last thing she was going to do was sit in massachusetts while the man she loved sat in new jersey it wasnt logical serena told herself as she pulled herself out of bed she believed exactly what she had shouted at justin the night before people in love belonged together justin wasnt likely to relax fully until the police caught whoever had planted the bomb and that could take months if indeed he were ever caught he might have given up completely when his plans were ruined or he could wait days weeks months before striking again taking a robe out of the closet she considered that possibility then shrugged off the unease whether they caught him or not serena didnt share justins certainty that the man would try again the note had probably been sent out of frustration after the extortionists plans had fallen apart that made more sense than someone with a personal vendetta against justin he wasnt being objective serena decided as she belted the robe the hotels were so much a part of him he couldnt see them as an outsider would buildings worth a great deal of money the man had played his hand and lost he had to know the authorities would be investigating and that justin would tighten his own security cowards plant bombs she told herself a coward isnt going to risk getting caught in time justin would see the logic when she heard the knock on the door serena automatically checked the bedside clock too early for the maid she reflected as she walked into the living room now who would be her hand paused on the knob as all of justins words of the night before ran through her head someones after me youre not safe suddenly uneasy serena peered through the peephole there you see she told herself as her nerves drained away its just foolishness opening the door she grinned at her brother you must have lost quickly last night if youre up this early she commented caine stared at her a moment before he stepped into the room its not that early he countered glancing around i came up to see justin youve just missed him serena closed the door and tossed back her sleeptumbled hair he went down to his office about fifteen minutes ago wheres alan caines affection for justin was warring with the fact that serena was his sister his baby sister damn it he thought and she was standing in justins private suite wearing nothing but the short silk robe hed given her last christmas hes just having breakfast caine told her as he prowled around the room well you were always the one to be up and about in the morning serena remembered i always thought it was a disgusting habit want some coffee its one of the few essentials stocked in the kitchen yeah sure still dealing with the shock of realizing he had harbored the illusion that his sister was exclusively his sister caine followed her the kitchen was roomy and striking the floor and walls were white the cabinets glossy black serena plugged in the percolator as she gestured toward the breakfast bar with her free hand sit down you seem to know your way around caine heard himself saying she sent him an infuriatingly amused look i live here annoyed caine slid onto a stool at the bar justin certainly works fast thats quite a chauvinistic remark for the liberal states attorney serena commented as she measured out coffee from another point of view it could be said i work fast you met him only a month ago caine turning around serena cocked her head do you remember luke dennison who he was the local stud when i was fifteen she reminded him you cornered him in the parking lot of the movie theater and told him if he ever put his hands on me youd break all the small vital bones in his body she watched caines grin flash as he remembered he never did did he no then she walked over to him and grabbed both his ears im not fifteen anymore caine and justin isnt luke dennison leaning over he grabbed her ears in turn applying enough pressure to bring her closer i love you be told her and kissed her quick and hard then be happy for me justins everything i want releasing her caine sat back he said the same thing about you he saw the pleasure darken her eyes when yesterday when he asked alan and me to talk you into going home for a while caine lifted a hand as the pleasure turned to temper dont go for the jugular rena we both declined serena let out her breath in a quick huff justins convinced whoever planted that bomb had more than extortion money as a motive because of that he has it fixed in his head that im not safe with him frustrated she gestured widely with both hands he just wont be logical or practical about the whole business he loves you the storm around her stilled instantly i know all the more reason for me to stay with him tell me she leaned back against the counter to watch him what would you do if i were justin id do my damnedest to make you leave if i were you he continued smoothly before she could start to yell i wouldnt budge nothing worse than the analytical legal mind serena murmured as the coffee perked well why dont you tell me what youve been doing with yourself any fascinating new ladies or is your work cramping your style i manage to eke out a little time for recreation he commented and earned a snort as serena took down two mugs ive decided to go back to private practice you have surprised she turned back isnt that rather sudden not really he accepted the mug of black coffee ive been thinking about it for some time alans the politician hes got the patience for it shrugging caine sipped at his coffee i miss the courtroom bureaucracy doesnt give me enough time for it i always loved to watch you argue a case serena remembered taking her seat on the opposite side of the bar there was something deadly about your style like a wolf circling a fire and losing patience caine laughed theres that flighty macgregor imagination surfacing again casting aspersions on the family name alan asked from the kitchen doorway serena turned to him with a quick warm smile the look altered subtly as she shifted her eyes to the man beside her brother alan complained that hed been deserted justin commented any more of that coffee i just made it she held out her hand to him as he entered taking it justin brushed a kiss over her fingers before he moved to the coffeepot alan he was looking at his sister yes thanks caine hasnt told me how much he lost last night serena began as alan leaned on the counter oh his luck wasnt all that bad he sent his brother a shrewd look which caine returned blandly serena arched a brow you better not have been trying your luck with any of my dealers she warned caine the little blonde alan supplied with a flashing grin with the big brown eyes caine serena sent him a look of astonished amusement shes barely twentyone i dont know what hes talking about calmly caine sipped his coffee alan was busy trying to impress some redhead in half a dress with his views on foreign policy well serena turned to justin as he brought over fresh coffee it seems to me that neither the staff nor the customers are safe if we let these two loose you can keep an eye on them tonight at the dinner show justin handed alan a mug before he opened the refrigerator for cream i should have warned you serena told her brothers as she linked her hand with justins he has a habit of making arrangements without consulting anyone but i for one she added smiling at him would love to go to the dinner show lena maxwells opening tonight she mused looking down at her nails i suppose justin could be persuaded to introduce her if you two would like to come what times dinner alan and caine asked together laughing serena rose pitiful dangle a sexy brunette in front of their noses and theyll follow you anywhere ive got to shower and change she stood on her toes and brushed justins mouth with hers ill be downstairs in a half hour as she walked from the room she heard caines question just where is lena maxwell rehearsing this afternoon justin while she showered serena found herself laughing if caine got it into his head to track down lena maxwell he wouldnt need justins introduction to charm his way into a personal conversation with her caine macgregor had more than his fair share of charm she thought again of his reaction when he found her in justins suite it was rather endearing really she decided and she hadnt missed the long quiet look alan had given her when he had walked into the kitchen with justin as soon as her brothers were alone she concluded they would discuss her relationship with justin probably argue a bit about it then give her their unqualified support it had always been that way among the three of them for a moment with the water streaming hot over her body serena felt a wave of regret for justin he had never really known the security the bond the frustration of family ties perhaps with time he would let her show him perhaps one day they would have children deliberately serena stuck her head under the spray she was getting ahead of herself far ahead he loved her but that didnt mean he was looking for marriage and children hed been solitary for so long and their love was so new children would mean a home and hed never chosen to make one hed chosen a lifestyle without permanence and the nomad in him had been and was part of his attraction for her it was foolish to start dreaming about changes when theyd barely lived fortyeight hours under the same roof yet hed spoken of his sister twice and both times serena had sensed a hint of regret justin hadnt turned his back on his family but had been forced by circumstances to do without if one day he wanted one serena promised herself shed be there for him stepping from the shower serena flicked on the overhead heat lamp then wrapped her hair in a towel she began to hum as she rubbed scented lotion over her skin briefly she ran over the scheduling shed outlined for herself that day and decided she could accomplish everything before she needed to change for the dinner show but not if she stood loitering in the bathroom all day she reminded herself as she slipped into her robe unwinding the towel from her hair she walked back into the bedroom as the door from the living room swung open she gasped in surprise justin dragging a hand through her hair serena let out her bream you gave me a start i thought youd gone dipping his hands into his pockets he looked at her slowly from her toes to the crown of her head no why was it she wondered that hes seen and touched every part of my body but he can look at me like that and turn me to jelly alan and caine gone down to compete for lena i believe lord i hate to miss that she thought aloud as she walked to the closet what are you doing well im getting dressed she returned with a laugh what does it look like im doing seems like a waste of time since im just going to take whatever you put on off you again she sent him an arched look over her shoulder somehow i think kate might find it odd if i walked into the office wearing my robe he gave her a slow cool smile youre not getting out of this room justin dont be ridiculous with another laugh serena began to poke through the clothes in the closet i have a dozen things to do before dinner and the rest of the words caught in her throat then came out as a whoosh of air as he tossed her onto the mattress standing above her he nodded i like the way you look in a rumpled bed oh really serena pushed herself up to her knees well id like to know where you got the idea you could throw me around as she stuck her hands on her hips her loosened robe fell off one shoulder its not the first time she went on remembering her dunking in the ocean but if you think you can make a habit i know nobody pushes a macgregor around he murmured as he hooked a finger in the opening of her robe thats right she pushed his hand away and succeeded in widening the gap down her front so just remember that the next time you get a wild urge to toss me around i will sorry with an apologetic smile he held out his hand though wary serena accepted it as she started to climb back out of the bed in an instant she was on her back pinned under him justin fighting against laughter she pushed at him will you stop i have to get dressed uhuh you have to get undressed let me help you with one long gesture of his hand he parted her robe completely stop amused frustrated and aroused she struggled against him justin i mean it the maid could walk in here any minute she wont be coming until this evening he found a spot low on her ribs and felt a thrill of pleasure as she moaned i called housekeeping you with a new spurt of energy she tried to wrest free you did it again she nearly managed to get her arms free before he pinned them didnt it occur to you that i might have had plans that perhaps i dont want to spend the afternoon in bed with you i figured the odds were good that i could persuade you he countered easily oh she kicked out tangling her legs with his as she wiggled under him okay well wrestle first best three out of five this isnt funny she said swallowing a giggle i mean it deadly serious he rolled her over until she was on top of him thats one apiece before she could catch her breath she was back under him and two for me oh sure serena blew the wet hair out of her eyes a real even match when im half naked and youre fully dressed youre right he covered her face with quick teasing kisses why dont you do something about that my hands are busy she moaned involuntarily as they ran down her body foul she said breathlessly justin stop he asked halfheartedly his eyes intent on her face as he let his fingertips do the persuading no tangling her fingers in his hair she brought his mouth down to hers it was always the same always unique every time his lips met hers she felt that enervating shock of heat her bones would soften with exquisite slowness until she thought her body was one warm fluid mass yet the thrill was always fresh as though it were happening for the first time forgetting his request that she undress him serena went lax with the first flood of pleasure justin felt her surrender a surrender he knew was only a prelude to her breathless excitement and frantic demands he enjoyed the brief heady power of total control she was his now a strong vital woman who for a few precious moments would be like putty in his hands the knowledge made him gentle so that he caressed with more tenderness than he had believed himself capable of did love make so much difference he wondered as he ran long lean fingers over her skin his lips touched hers muffling her soft sound of enjoyment her eyes not quite closed met his when he traced the shape of her mouth with his tongue her lids fluttered he rubbed his lips over hers savoring the taste then found that his hands had stilled his whole being seemed focused on the meeting of mouth to mouth the power he had felt became a vulnerability no less of a surrender than serena had given him he felt weak with it and fearless i love you he murmured against her mouth i didnt know how much the kiss was deep and slow and more arousing than anything hed ever known then her tongue sought his moving through his lips to draw in all the tastes and flavors as a shudder passed through him he knew her surrender was over serena slipped the soft wool of his sweater up his torso over his shoulders so that their lips were forced to part but only briefly her hands were busy touching rubbing demanding he could see them in his minds eye smooth and white against his darker skin the glossy feminine nails scraping over him in excitement he moved his lips to her shoulder to nip gently and was assaulted by her scent it made him think of sultry summer nights wild loving in high green grass he ran kisses grown more desperate to the inside of her elbow where her rapid pulse only intensified the fragrance as he buried his mouth against the pale blueveined skin her body arched tossed by passion serena rolled to him so that they were side by side then locked her arms around him she didnt feel the tangle of sheets beneath her the cool silk of her robe that had slipped down to her legs all she felt was his hard hot body against hers and the moist tingling path his mouth streaked over her as he slid down she urged him toward all the secret places hed discovered for both of them no one else would ever bring her this torrid wanton hunger it filled her consumed her made her strong with a sudden burst of energy she was on top of him her mouth greedy her hands quick and clever he groaned gripping her wet sleek hair the sound only made her move over him more urgently hes beautiful so beautiful was all she could think as she touched and tasted again a light film of sweat glistened on his dark skin serena could taste the saltiness of it as she roamed over the hard smooth chest the lean line of ribs marred by the jagged scar the narrow longboned hips then his hands gripped her dragging her up until his mouth was fastened on hers she drew in the mingling flavor of their tastes until her head swam with it her body seemed to act without her knowledge sliding down until she took him inside of her the sensation rocketed through her causing her to cry out as she arched back but he rose up with her his hands still gripping her hair his mouth still fused to hers she couldnt breathe but even as she fought for air her body set up its own raging rhythm her arms were locked around him his around her the mutual grip tightened convulsively as they reached the sharp airless summit then as one form they slid back to the bed to lay gasping i cant seem to get enough of you justin managed in a whisper never enough dont serena let her head slip limply to his shoulder dont ever get enough they lay quietly as breathing settled and trembles eased with her palm over his heart she could feel the pounding beat become slow strong and steady theres only you justin said feeling the sudden fierceness of love theres only you in my life serena lifted her head to look down at him love that is not madness is not love smiling she traced the line of his cheekbone i never understood that until now i know i never want to be sane again he brought her finger to his lips so the brainy serena macgregor chooses insanity wrinkling her nose she folded her elbows over his chest no need to bring my brain into it it fascinates me justin told her and its one part of you i havent really explored just how smart are you she lifted a brow that she said primly is an abstract question ah youre going to be evasive grinning he brushed her hair away from her shoulders how many degrees do you have your first question doesnt have anything to do with your second how smart are you smart enough to know when im getting the runaround he said mildly no burning desire to go into law or politics like your brothers no my only burning desire was to learn then i had a burning desire to be doing now she bit his lower lip i have more basic burning desires hmm he allowed himself the pleasure of feasting on her mouth a moment dont you feel that running a gambling hotel is a bit of a waste of your education of course not my educations mine ill always have it whatever i choose to do what good are degrees if youre not enjoying life with a sigh she lay across his chest again i didnt study so that i could pile up little pieces of paper suitable for framing but because i was curious why do you ran hotels because im good at it serena grinned at him and thats the exact reason i nearly became a professional student but it was becoming too repetitious and too easy therere challenges here every day and a constant variety of people and she added smugly im good at it too nero thinks you have class now serenas smile was just as smug as her voice hes very perceptive why didnt you make him manager he wasnt interested justin began to run a hand up and down her spine he likes his position as unofficial troubleshooter ill be sending him to malta next year youve bought the casino then i will have soon enough thoughtful he studied her face i was considering taking on a partner he saw the smile light in her eyes just before her lips curved were you then i suppose i should put in my bid right away he cupped his hand around the back of her neck the sooner the better he murmured as he brought her lips to his when the phone rang he swore ripely serena laughed and nuzzled against his throat as he reached for it blade listening to kates quiet shaking voice he fought to keep the tension out of his body serena would feel it all right kate ill be down after hanging up he kissed the crown of serenas head somethings come up downstairs she gave a resigned sigh thats the trouble with living where you work rolling over she stretched well i really should go down myself you havent had a day off in over a week dressing justin wondered if he was wiser to leave her there or to keep her with him downstairs he decided shed be better off in the penthouse relax for a while ill be back up soon why dont you order some lunch the thought of having him to herself all afternoon was too appealing serena closed her mind to the paperwork on her desk all right an hour yes fine preoccupied he headed for the elevator kate was waiting for him when he stepped off silently she handed justin a plain white envelope steve found it lying on the front desk as soon as i saw it she trailed off then got control of herself its just like the one you got in vegas isnt it yes justin answered flatly as he studied the carefully executed block letters that spelled out his name he had a quick savage urge to simply rip it into pieces but he took a letter opener from his desk and carefully slit one edge sliding the note out he unfolded it its not over yet you have a price to pay call security he told kate as he read the words a second time then he let out his breath on one violent oath and the police chapter eleven contents prev next serena pulled a black angora sweater over her head it would feel good to be lazy for a day she decided to lounge around the suite in comfortable clothes and do absolutely nothing she and justin hadnt spent a full day together since st thomas that made her think of the earrings justin had given her shed wear them tonight serena mused as she opened the top drawer of the dresser to draw out the box theyre exquisite she thought as she looked at them again all the more exquisite because he had bought them for her then before they had been lovers what a strange man he is she reflected so cool in some ways so introspective yet he was capable of such incredibly sweet gestures the violets in her room the first day champagne for breakfast and underneath it all there was that latent controlled streak of violence all those aspects of him excited her how smart are you serena laughed as she remembered justins question smart enough to know im a very lucky woman she answered silently reaching into the drawer again she drew out a twoheaded quarter shed picked up while justin had been in vegas with a grin serena examined it then slipped it into the pocket of her jeans and smart enough to keep an ace up my sleeve she added with a gleam of mischief in her eye as she glanced at her reflection in the mirror serenas grin turned to a look of astonishment her hair had dried in a tangled and unruly mop around her face what a mess she thought as she picked up her brush well shed do something about it before she called room service it would serve justin right if he had to wait for his lunch she added as she tugged painfully at the knots in her hair bending from the waist she let her hair fall forward then gritted her teeth and brushed the underside ouch just a minute she called out at the quick quiet knock on the door either caine or alan had struck out with lena maxwell she thought with a smirk as she headed for the door still brushing her hair dont expect me to fix you up with oh housekeeping a slim boy of about twenty gave her a shy smile justin must have decided to have them clean before lunch she concluded typical he might have called to let her know i can come back later if oh no im sorry i was thinking of something else serena gave him a smile as she opened the door wide enough for him to roll the maids cart inside youre new arent you yes maam this is my first day that explains the nervous swallowing she decided and made her smile warmer just relax and take your time she advised him ill stay out of your way gesturing with her brush she turned away why dont you start in the kitchen while i something clamped over her mouth and nose too stunned to be frightened serena grabbed at the hand as she drew her breath to shout she inhaled something strong and cloyingly sweet that made her head spin recognizing the scent she began to struggle more frantically fighting the mists that were whirling in front of her eyes oh god no her arms dropped heavily to her sides the brush slipped from her limp fingers justin the desk clerk found it on the counter justin told lieutenant renicki apparently no one saw who put it there it was during checkout time and the desk staff was busy yes well hes not a fool the police lieutenant picked up the plain sheet of stationery by the corner and slipped it into a plastic bag ill have to turn this over to the bureau i imagine but for now ill leave a few plainclothesmen in the hotel ive my own security stationed in all the public rooms lieutenant renicki lifted both of his bushy graying brows in acknowledgment doesnt like dealing with me he decided oh hes a cool one he watched justin light a cigar with rocksteady hands not much gets under that ones skin got any enemies mr blade justin shot him a mild look apparently anyone specific you want to tell me about no is this the first threat youve received since you got back from nevada yes lieutenant renicki suppressed a sigh characters like blade made him feel like a dentist yanking at a reluctant tooth hired or fired anyone recently for an answer justin pushed his intercom kate check with personnel see who weve put on or let go in the last two months then get a printout from the rest of the hotels great things computers the lieutenant said when justin hung up i got a teenager practically married to one getting no response he shrugged his rounded shoulders im going to check your security myself if hes going to plant a bomb he has to get in first he can get in justin reminded him by signing a name at the registration desk true enough lieutenant renicki watched the cigar smoke drift you can close down the only change in justins expression was a fractional narrowing of his eyes no didnt think so lieutenant renicki hauled himself out of the chair my men will be discreet mr blade but well make a routine search ill check back with you after ive interviewed the desk clerks thank you lieutenant justin waited until the door closed behind him then crushed out his cigar with a force that snapped it in two if hed felt a stalking sensation before now he felt breathing down his neck he was here now if not in the hotel then somewhere close waiting serena was going back to hyannis port if justin had to tie her up and dump her on a plane he sat very still for a moment until he was calm again he wouldnt get through to serena by shouting or threatening the only way would be to make her see that her presence there made it impossible for him to be completely rational if she were gone he could think clearly enough and perhaps reason out who and why justin lifted the intercom again kate ill be upstairs pass my calls through to me up there rising he went to the elevator maybe on the way up he would think of the best way to tell serena he was kicking her and her brothers out of his hotel as he stepped into the living room justin glanced toward the picture window half expecting to see her sitting there already nibbling at lunch he was only vaguely surprised to see the table empty hed taken a bit more than the hour hed allotted thinking perhaps shed fallen back to sleep justin walked into the bedroom the rumpled bed didnt bring on a twinge of desire this time but a feeling of unease calling her name justin walked toward the bathroom the faintest wisp of her scent clung to the air because the room was empty it only made justins unease sharpen dont be an idiot he told himself she isnt tied to this suite she could have gone out for a hundred reasons but she was expecting me she would have phoned down how did he know as he walked back out into the living room justin reminded himself that they hadnt been together long enough to be sure of the others habits she could have run down to the boutique for a dress bending justin picked up the small enamelhandled brush from the rug for a moment his mind went blank and he could do no more than stare at it he shook himself clear he was being an alarmist shed come walking back in any moment it was like her to leave her things all over the suite to be untidy he mused mercilessly not careless picking up the phone justin punched a number page serena macgregor he held the brush as he waited her beaded jacket hung over the back of the sofa he could remember slipping it from her shoulders the night before sometime during the morning she had picked it up and tossed it there then why would she have left her brush on the floor ms macgregor doesnt answer the page sir justin felt the knot in his stomach tighten he gripped the handle of the brush until it threatened to snap page alan or caine macgregor glancing at his watch justin saw that it was thirty minutes past the time he had told serena to expect him caine macgregor its justin is serena with you no alan and i were have you seen her not since this morning it was the first time in the ten years he had known justin caine realized that hed heard a hint of panic in that controlled voice something like ice rippled down his back why justin found his throat closed and stared down at the brush in his hand shes gone cain felt the receiver grow wet under his palm where are you upstairs well be right there within minutes justin opened the door to admit serenas brothers she mightve gone out for something caine said immediately did you check to see if she took her car out no justin cursed himself and picked up the phone again this is blade has ms macgregor taken her car out he waited angry impatient while caine prowled the room and alan watched him justin listened to the answer from the garage then hung up without speaking her cars still there she might have gone for a walk on the beach alan suggested she was expecting me here a half hour ago justin said flatly she was supposed to order some lunch but ive checked she never called down i found this near the front door alan took the brush from justins hand he remembered giving the antique vanity set to serena for her sixteenth birthday it was one of the few things she owned that she took meticulous care of had you been arguing justin whirled on caine as his control slipped another notch justin caine said quickly rena has a wicked temper if she were angry she could have stormed out without a word to anyone shed stomp around on the beach until shed cooled off no we hadnt been arguing justin said tightly wed been making love he stuck his hands in his pockets because he wanted to ball them into fists i got a call from downstairs an envelope had been left for me at the front desk it was another threat alan set serenas brush down carefully on the table justin he waited until the angry green eyes met his call the police like an exclamation point at the end of his words the phone rang justin grabbed for it serena he began looking for her already the voice was muffled and sexless ive got your squaw blade the connection broke with a soft click justin stood still as stone for a full ten seconds he tasted copper in his mouth and recognized it as fear hes got her he heard someone say then realized the voice was his own on a blind wave of fury he ripped the phone out of the wall and threw it across the room the son of a bitch has her lieutenant renicki glanced around the living room of justins suite and decided it was warmer than he would have expected the man he had met downstairs seemed suited to cold colors and straight lines his eyes rested on the phone that lay drunkenly against the east wall well still waters run deep he supposed the tall blond man staring out of the window was caine macgregor the hotshot young lawyer who was currently serving as states attorney in massachusetts the dark man sitting in the chair staring at the hairbrush in his hands was alan macgregor us senator a bit of a left winger with a glib tongue the lieutenant looked at justin again suppose you run through it once more justins eyes leveled on lieutenant renickis full of fury and icy control i went downstairs to check out the envelope that had been left for me at the front desk i left serena here it was just past noon we made arrangements to have lunch here in the suite an hour later i was late and when i came back she wasnt here i was concerned then when i found her hairbrush lying on the floor by the front door i had her paged when she didnt answer i paged her brothers fifteen minutes ago i received a call yes apparently from a kidnapper renicki put in not certain if he was pleased or annoyed with justins cool recital you havent told me precisely what he said justin gave the lieutenant a long intense look he told me he had my squaw ready to explode caine whirled away from the window damn it this isnt getting us anywhere why arent you looking for her lieutenant renicki watched him with tired patient eyes were doing just that mr macgregor hell call again alan said quietly he looked up from the hairbrush to meet the lieutenants gaze he must know that between justin and our family we can raise any amount of money to get rena back he let his eyes drift to justins and hold if his motive is money well have to work on that premise for now senator lieutenant renicki stated in a nononsense voice well be putting a tap on your phone with your permission mr blade do whatever it takes caine looked at justin then looked at him for the first since the phone call wheres the brandy what you need a drink when justin merely shook his head caine let out a quiet oath well im going to have one before i call mom and dad justin felt a fresh twinge inside his stomach and gestured in that cabinet from opposite ends of the suite the phone rang without waiting for lieutenant renickis yes or no justin went into the kitchen to answer he couldnt bring himself to go into the bedroom blade closing his eyes he fought frustration then held out the receiver its for you he told the lieutenant when he came back into the living room justin found alan and caine standing in the center of the room speaking quietly alans going to call our parents caine told him theyll take it better from him theyll want to be here justin struggled not to let the panic through or the grief of course as lieutenant renicki came into the room he waited until all three pairs of eyes were on him my men found an abandoned maids cart down in the garage the lab will go over it thoroughly but they found a rag soaked with ether inside apparently thats how he got her out without anyone seeing her watching closely lieutenant renicki saw caines knuckles whiten on his glass saw the wave of terrified anger in alans eyes he saw no change in justins expression we have your description of miss macgregor mr blade but a picture would be helpful justin stared as pain sprinted from his stomach to his throat i dont have one i do numb alan reached for his wallet well have the trace on the line right away mr blade lieutenant renicki went on glancing at the picture alan handed him well be recording everything thats said the longer you keep him on the line the better whatever demands he makes insist on speaking to miss macgregor before you agree to anything we have to establish that she is indeed with him and alive he added silently and if he refuses justin demanded then you refuse to deal justin forced himself to sit down if he stood he would pace if he paced he would lose control no he said evenly justin alan interrupted before renicki could speak again the lieutenants right we have to be certain rena is with him and unharmed its rena he thought wildly as he struggled to keep his voice even our rena if you make it clear there wont be a ransom unless you hear her voice hell put her on the phone you have a price to pay the words flashed through justins mind not serena he thought desperately god not serena and after ive spoken to her justin began ill agree to any terms he asks i wont bargain and i wont stall its your money mr blade lieutenant renicki gave him a thin smile id like you to listen to his voice very carefully when he phones back chances are he has it disguised but you might recognize a phrasing an inflection there was a brisk knock on the door which the lieutenant answered himself as he stood talking in undertones to one of his men caine again approached justin with the offer of brandy for the second time justin shook his head theyre going to catch him caine said just needing to hear the words aloud slowly justin lifted his eyes when they do he said calmly im going to kill him feeling groggy and sore serena woke moaning had she overslept she wondered shed miss class if she didnt no no it was her shift in the casino and dale justin no justin was coming up for lunch and she hadnt even called room service she had to get up but her eyes refused to open and there was a light rolling sense of nausea in her stomach sick she thought hazily but she was never sick how the door she remembered someone at the door nausea swelled again and with it fear drawing all her strength together serena opened her eyes the room was small and dun over the one window a shade was drawn there was a cheap maple bureau against one wall with a mirror streaked with dust and a small straightbacked rocking chair there was no lamp only a ceiling fixture overhead because it was off and some light filtered through the shade serena knew it was still day but her sense of time was so distorted she had no idea which day someone had once painted the walls an airy yellow but the color had faded so that they now seemed more like the pages of a very old book serena lay in the middle of a double bed on top of a worn chenille spread when she tried to move her right arm she discovered that it was handcuffed to the center bedpost thats when the fear overcame the grogginess the boy from housekeeping she remembered ether oh god how could she have been so stupid justin had warned her justin she thought again as she clamped down on her bottom lip hed be frantic by now was he searching for her had he called the police perhaps he thought shed just gone out on an errand i have to get out of here serena told herself desperately and scrambled closer to the headboard to tug on the handcuffs the boy must have had something to do with the bombing in vegas it seemed incredible he looked barely old enough to shave old enough to kidnap she reminded herself grimly yanking uselessly at the metal cuffs when she heard his footsteps she sat very still and waited hed planned it perfectly terry thought as he hung up the phone snatching the woman from under blades nose had been risky but oh so worthwhile better than the bomb he decided as he drummed his fingers against the table hed had to give them too much time and theyd found the bomb because he hadnt wanted to hurt anyone just blade but this this was perfect she was beautiful he mused blade would pay to get her back but before he paid hed suffer terry was going to make sure of it to relieve his own tension he reminded himself how clever he had been even while justin had been in vegas terry had been on his way to atlantic city at the time hed been annoyed with himself for not choosing the east coast hotel in the first place but it had all worked out hed noticed serena the first night hed hung around the casino then hed learned she was justins partner it had only taken a few casual questions in the right places to learn she was much more than that to him then terry had outlined his plan at first hed been frightened getting a woman out of a hotel was trickier than getting a small bomb in but hed watched no one looked twice at the people in the plain white housekeeping uniforms after a couple of days of watching serenas movements he concluded there was a private entrance from the offices to the living quarters probably an elevator he had reasoned that was the way the rich did things hed been patient spending most of his time at the slot machines waiting when hed seen justin come back he knew it was time to move stealing the uniform had been easy as easy as planting the letter no one took any notice of a young harmlesslooking man in plain clothes the minute he had seen the desk clerk deliver the envelope to the offices terry had begun to move hed had to force himself to go slowly hed told himself to give justin a full ten minutes to get downstairs on the third floor hed changed his clothes in a storage closet then hed simply walked off with one of the maids carts that sat in the hallway he remembered how his heart had been pounding as he had wheeled into the service elevator there was a chance that she wouldnt be there that shed gone down with justin and hed have to start all over again when she had opened the door and smiled hed almost lost his nerve then hed remembered blade the rest was easy it had taken him less than five minutes to cover her unconscious body with linen and wheel the cart down to the garage where his car was waiting with serena in the backseat covered with a blanket hed simply driven away but shed been unconscious for a long time maybe hed used too much ether or then he heard her moan terry got up to fix her a cup of tea when he opened the door serena was sitting back against the headboard staring at him but she didnt look as frightened as hed imagined she would he wondered if she was in shock he expected shed start screaming any minute if you yell he said quietly ill have to gag you i dont want to do that serena saw that he was holding a cup and that it shook in his hand a nervous kidnapper she thought quickly would be more dangerous than a calm one she swallowed any urge to scream i wont yell i brought you some tea he came a little closer you might be feeling a little sick he was approaching her serena thought as one approached a cornered animal he expects me to be terrified she realized well he wasnt far off it might be more to her advantage to let her control slip outwardly inside shed force herself to be calm the first thing she had to know was where he kept the keys for the handcuffs i do please she let her voice tremble can i use the bathroom okay im not going to hurt you he spoke soothingly as he set the tea aside and came to her taking a key from the pocket of his jeans he fit it into the wrist lock if you try to run away or start yelling ill have to stop you he paused as his hand replaced the metal on her wrist do you understand serena nodded he was stronger she discovered than he looked silently he led her into a small bathroom im going to be right outside the door he warned just be smart and nothingll happen to you nodding serena went inside immediately she looked for means of escape and was frustrated there wasnt even a window a weapon a rapid search turned up nothing more than a towel bar that wouldnt budge she bit down on her lip as fear and helplessness began to take over shed have to find another way she would find another way running cold water in the sink she splashed it on her face she had to stay calm and alert and she couldnt underestimate the man outside the door he was dangerous because he was every bit as frightened as she was so shed be more frightened she decided she would cower and weep so that he wouldnt know she was watching waiting for the opportunity of escape first she had to find out exactly what his plans were opening the door serena let him seize her wrists again please what are you going to do im not going to hurt you terry said again as he pulled her toward the bed hell pay to get you back who she saw the fury in his eyes blade my father has more she began quickly he i dont want your fathers money at his fierce explosion serena didnt have to simulate a shudder its blade hes going to pay im going to bleed him dry were you were you the one who planted the bomb in vegas terry handed her the tea serena considered throwing it into his face then decided against it if it were hot enough to burn him hed probably leap back and the key would be out of her reach yeah she watched him there was angry color in his face now and a look in his eyes that had her stomach rolling why he killed my father terry told her then strode out of the room why doesnt he call justin thought as he drank yet another cup of coffee if hes hurt her he looked down to see that hed snapped the handle cleanly away from the mug setting them both down he drew out a cigar behind him in the dinette two detectives played gin caine paced while alan was already on his way to the airport to pick up daniel and anna the living room extension had been repaired and was now attached to a recording device but still they waited it was growing darker as clouds moved in thered be rain before the night was over for gods sake where was she why did i leave her alone justin wanted to bury his face in his hands he wanted to hit something anything he sat perfectly still and stared at the wall why did i think shed be safe here he demanded of himself i would have made her go away if i hadnt wanted her with me so badly i could have made her go away if anything happens to her he pushed the thought aside if he were going to stay in control he couldnt even allow himself the luxury of guilt the only sounds in the room were the desultory conversation of the detectives and the hiss of caines lighter as he lit another cigarette if the phone didnt ring justin was certain hed go mad when it did justin lunged for it keep him on the line as long as you can one of the detectives ordered curtly and tell him you have to talk to her before you deal justin didnt even acknowledge the instructions as he picked up the receiver the recorder was running silently blade want your squaw back blade it was a young voice justin realized and frightened the same voice he had heard on the police recordings in las vegas how much two million cash small bills ill let you know when and where serena let me talk to serena forget it how do i know you have her justin demanded how do i know shes he had to force the words out still alive ill think about it and the line went dead serena huddled under the blanket she was cold scared she corrected herself brutally the chill she was feeling had nothing to do with her thin sweater or bare feet he killed my father the flat statement ran over and over in her head could this be the son of the man who had attacked justin all those years ago hed have been little more than a baby at the time if hed been harboring hate all those years serena shivered again and drew the blanket over her shoulders she shouldnt have doubted justins instincts hed known somehow that someone was after him personally how far would the boy go for revenge she asked herself be objective she ordered this is real shed seen his face could he take the chance of letting her go when she could identify him yet he didnt seem like a coldblooded killer hed planted a bomb in a crowded hotel she reminded herself oh god she had to get away closing her eyes serena put all her concentration into listening it was quiet no sounds of traffic she thought but couldnt be sure that she heard the ocean it mightve been the wind how far out of town were they she wondered if she threw the teacup through the window and screamed would anyone hear even as she weighed the odds terry came back into the bedroom i brought you a sandwich he seemed more agitated this time or perhaps she reconsidered excited make him talk she told herself please dont leave me alone she grabbed his arm with her free hand and let her eyes plead with his youll feel better after you eat he mumbled and shoved the sandwich under her nose you dont have to be scared i told you i wouldnt hurt you if you didnt try anything ive seen you she said taking the chance how can you let me go ive got plans restless he began to pace the little room he wasnt big she thought if i could just get my hand free id have a chance by the time i let them know where you are ill already be gone he thought of switzerland with grim pleasure they wont find me ill have two million dollars to help me hide in comfort two million she whispered how do you know justin will pay terry laughed turning to look at her her face was pale her eyes huge her hair tumbled wildly around her shoulders hell pay hell beg me to let him pay before im finished you said he killed your father murdered him but he was acquitted justin told me the words slid back down her throat as terry whirled he murdered my father and they let him go he shouted let him go because they felt sorry for him it was all politics my mother told me they let him go because he was a poor indian kid my mother said that his lawyer paid off the witnesses his mother serena thought had been warping his mind for years it would take more than a few words from her to change it now had his mother told him about the scar along justins side had she told him his father had been drunk or that the knife that had killed him had been his own serena studied terrys set frightened face and hating eyes im sorry she said weakly im so sorry hes paying now terry told her and tossed a hank of errant hair out of his eyes i wish i could take the chance of holding you for more than a couple of days he gave a soft wondering laugh whod have thought id make blade crawl for a woman please whats your name terry he said briefly serena struggled to sit up straighter terry you must know justins called the police theyll be looking for me they wont find you he returned simply i didnt start planning yesterday i put a deposit down on this place six months ago when blade opened the hotel i was thinking about squeezing him a second time after hed paid off from vegas he shrugged as if the business in vegas meant little the old couple i rented this from are in florida by now theyve never even seen me just the check i sent them terry look nothings going to happen to you just eat and get some rest ten hours after blade makes the drop ill call and let them know where to find you he stormed out of the room slamming the door before she could say any more what are they doing to get her back daniel demanded as he strode around the living room of justins suite look at these two he tossed out a hand toward the two detectives playing cards while some maniac has my little girl theyre doing everything they can alan told him quietly the phones tapped he didnt stay on the line long enough last time to trace it theyre checking out all the fingerprints on the maids cart hah letting his panic take the form of anger he rounded on his son and what kind of a place is it where a man can dump my daughter in a basket and go off with her daniel from her place on the sofa beside justin anna spoke softly she said only his name but the pain in her eyes had him cursing again and striding to the window she turned to justin putting her hand over his justin but he shook his head rising for the first time in the six hours of fear he knew he was going to fall apart without a word he walked into the bedroom and shut the door behind him her robe was tossed over a chair where she had left it he had only to pick it up to smell her he balled his hands into fists and turned away from it the jewelers box with the earrings hed given her sat open on the dresser he could remember the way they had looked on her the night before gleaming catching fire in the dim light as she had knelt naked on his bed and held her arms out to him fear and anger rolled around inside him until his skin was wet and clammy the silence of the room weighed down on him there was only the sound of rain falling cold and steady outside the windows only a few hours before serena had filled the room with life laughter and passion then hed left her he hadnt told her he loved her or kissed her goodbye hed walked out with his mind occupied with his own business left her alone he thought again oh god running his hands over his face he pressed his fingers hard against his eyes at the soft knock on the door justin dropped his hands and struggled against the sensation of despair daniel came in without waiting for his answer justin he closed the door behind him and stood looking huge and for the first time in justins memory helpless im sorry for that justin met his eyes as he balled his hands in his pockets again you were right if i hadnt been careless no coming to him daniel gripped both his arms theres no blame here rena he wanted rena hed have found a way im scared the big voice quavered as his grip tightened ive only been scared once before in my life when caine took it into his head to explore the roof and we found him hanging on a ledge two stories up i dont know where she is his voice shook as he turned away i cant get a ladder to her daniel i love her on a deep breath daniel turned back aye i can see that whatever he asks whatever he wants me to do ill do nodding daniel held out his hand come the family should wait together chapter twelve contents prev next she must have dozed because it was dark when serena felt herself being shaken awake youre going to make a phone call terry told her then walked over to flip on the overhead light serena tossed her arm over her eyes to shield them who she began he should have sweated enough by now terry mumbled as he hooked the phone in the bedroom jack its after one listen he jerked her arm down so that she could look at him youre going to tell him youre all right and thats all dont try anything he began to dial when he answers just tell him youre not hurt and youll stay that way as long as he pays understand nodding serena took the receiver justin was on the phone in the first ring a half cup of cold coffee tipped over on the table and dripped on the rug blade serena squeezed her eyes shut at the sound of his voice it was raining she thought dimly it was raining and she was so cold and frightened justin serena are you all right has he hurt you taking a deep breath she looked directly into terrys eyes im all right justin no scars where are you he began but terry clamped his hand over her mouth and grabbed the phone if you want her back get the money together two million small bills unmarked ill let you know where to make the drop and youll make it alone blade if you dont want her hurt he hung up the phone then let serena go the sound of justins voice did what the hours of fear hadnt been able to on a trembling sob she buried her face in the pillow and wept shes all right justin replaced the phone with studied care shes all right thank god anna grabbed both of his hands what next i get the cash together take it wherever he tells me well take photographs of the bills lieutenant renicki stated as he stirred himself from his chair one of my men will tail you when you make the drop no listen mr blade he began patiently theres no guarantee hell let miss macgregor go after hes been paid off hes more likely to no justin repeated we play it my way lieutenant no tails the lieutenant took a deep breath all right we can plant a bug in the case that way when he picks up the money he might lead us right to her and if he spots it justin countered no he said again im not taking any chances youre taking a hell of a chance by handing him two million dollars cold lieutenant renicki tossed back mrs macgregor he turned to anna thinking a woman a mother would be more reasonable we want your daughter back healthy the same as you let us help you she gave him a long steady look while the hand in justins trembled lightly i appreciate your concern lieutenant but im afraid i feel as justin does photograph the money caine put in and go after him when renas safe by god id like to prosecute him myself he added in a savage mutter then youd better hope hell be prosecuted for only kidnapping and extortion not murder lieutenant renicki added cruelly hell keep her alive until hes got the money after that its anyones guess listen blade he continued as his patience snapped you dont like dealing with cops maybe because you had some trouble years back but its a hell of a lot smarter to deal with us than to deal with him he tossed his hand toward the phone in an unconscious gesture justin ran his hand over his ribs no he thought he didnt trust the police the memory of those endless questions while his wound was healing into a scar were ingrained in his memory maybe he was making a mistake maybe he should his fingers froze abruptly scars no scars oh god he murmured as his eyes dropped to his hand oh my god what is it anna was standing beside him her ringers digging into his arm slowly he brought his eyes to hers a ghost he whispered then shook away dread as he faced lieutenant renicki on the phone serena was trying to tell me something she said no scars the man i killed in nevada put a knife in me serena knows the story the lieutenant was already heading for the phone do you remember his name justin gave a mirthless laugh did you ever forget the name of a man when you were tried for his murder charles terrance ford he answered he had a wife and a son she brought the boy to the courtroom every day he had blue eyes justin remembered pale confused blue eyes a wave of sickness rose up threatening to swallow him this time drink it caine ordered as he thrust a snifter of brandy into justins hands looking down at it justin shook his head coffee he mumbled and walked into the kitchen but he couldnt think pressing his palms down on the counter he tried to clear his head helpless he realized he felt the same raging helplessness hed experienced so long ago in that narrow little cell seventeen years he thought dear god hes had seventeen years to hate me what will he do to her because of me if its all you drink then drink it caine said roughly as he pushed a cup of coffee across the counter he was remembering serena standing there only that morning her eyes laughing at him while he dealt with the fact that shed grown up while he wasnt looking i knew justin said quietly as he stared into the black coffee i knew someone was after me i knew she wasnt safe but i didnt make her go caine sat down heavily on a stool ive known rena all her life loved her all her life no one absolutely no one makes her do anything i could have justin picked up the coffee and drank without tasting all i had to do was go with her and hed have followed you justin slammed the cup back down yes the anger cleared his head and dispelled the lingering sickness in his throat im going to get her back caine he said with deadly calm nothing in hells going to stop me from getting her back his names terry ford lieutenant renicki stated as he walked into the room and headed for the coffeepot booked a flight out of vegas five days ago destination atlantic city well have a description soon were checking all the hotels motels condos beach rentals but theres no telling whether hes kept her in town i wouldnt bank on him renting a room in his own name he added as he helped himself to the sugar bowl his mother remarried about three years ago were tracking her down it felt good to have something solid to work with names faces with a satisfied grunt lieutenant renicki sat across from caine well get him he promised you both should try to get some rest he advised odds are he wont be calling again until morning when neither of them answered the lieutenant sighed this family knows how to close ranks he reflected all right mr blade why dont you tell me what arrangements youve made for getting the ransom together the money will be in my office by eight oclock lieutenant renickis bushy brows rose and fell no problem getting that amount of cash together no okay tell him nine then well have time to photograph it in your office that way if he slips by us well be able to grab him once he starts to pass it id like you to reconsider letting us put a tracer in one of the cases i can show you how successfully it can be concealed remember he added before justin could speak our primary concern is the same as yours to get miss macgregor back safe for the first time justin noticed the fatigue in the lieutenants eyes it occurred to him that the policeman hadnt eaten or slept any more than he had himself under most circumstances he would have trusted those eyes ill consider it he said at length the lieutenant only nodded and drained the rest of his coffee at six am the phone rang again anna and daniel woke from a half doze on the sofa alan came to attention in the chair where he had spent the night awake and restless caine stopped in the doorway of the kitchen where he was returning with yet another cup of coffee justins hand snaked out to the receiver hed been staring at the phone for more than an hour blade got the money itll be here by nine theres a gas station two blocks down from the hotel on the right be in the phone booth there by ninefifteen ill call you terry hung up the phone so tied up with nerves he nearly knocked the small table over he hadnt been able to sleep even after serenas weeping had quieted she shouldnt have been able to make him feel sorry for her he thought as he rubbed the heels of his hands over his eyes after all what kind of a woman was she to be living with a murderer his mother would have said she was a tramp but hed sensed something about her classy terry mused as he stretched his stiff and aching muscles shed even looked classy in that sweater and jeans when shed opened the door for him and last night he sighed glancing at the door to the bedroom last night shed looked so small and helpless when shed curled up on the bed and cried well he was sorry he had to scare her that way but she was the best weapon he could use on blade she shouldnt have gotten mixed up with scum like him in the first place terry reminded himself id kill him if i could terry thought but knew he didnt have it in him planting a bomb in a building and drawing a knife or gun on a man were two different things a bomb was remote and he was forced to admit that hed probably never have gotten up the nerve to detonate it but the threat oh the satisfaction of being able to keep the man who had killed his father shaking in his shoes then hed have the money and every dollar he spent would be revenge on justin blade he heard serena stir and rose to check on her she was disgusted with herself what good had crying done but to give her a throbbing head and swollen eyes she needed to be planning a way out not wallowing in selfpity the arm that was attached to the bedpost ached and tingled from the lack of circulation shifting on the bed she tried to rub the blood back into it think she demanded of herself theres always a way out when the bedroom door opened her head spun around serena caught the quick regret in terrys eyes as he looked at her god i must be a pitiful sight she thought wearily then use it rena a small voice ordered impatiently start using your head she allowed the fear to surface again while she clung to her inner strength desperately please my arm hurts i think i wrenched it during the night im sorry he stood irresolutely in the center of the room ill fix you some breakfast please she said quickly before he could go if i if i could just sit in a chair i ache all over from lying like this where can i go she asked on a half sob as he hesitated youre stronger than i am look ill take you into the kitchen if you try anything ill bring you back in here and put a gag on you all right just please let me get up for a while terry pulled the key from his pocket and unlocked the handcuffs serena pushed down the urge to run knowing shed get no farther than the door clamping his fingers over her arm he led her quickly through the house the shades were drawn i could be in alaska for all i know she thought in frustration if i could run what direction would i go does he have a car he must have a car how else did he get me here if i could get the keys sit down he ordered and nudged her into a rickety chair at the kitchen table quickly he knelt and slipped the cuffs around her ankle and a table leg pushing his hair out of his eyes he rose ill get you some coffee thank you her eyes swept the room swiftly in search of a weapon within reach youll be out of here by tonight terry told her as he poured coffee without taking his eyes from her hes already getting the money together i probably could have asked for twice as much you wont be happy with it hell be unhappy terry countered thats what counts terry youre wasting your life this way he looked so young she thought too young to have so much hate packed inside him it took brains to plan everything out the way you have brains and skill you could be putting your mind to so much better use if you let me go now i might be able to help you my brother i dont want your help he said between his teeth i want blade i want him to crawl justin wont crawl she said wearily lady i heard him on the phone hed crawl to hell and back for you terry shut up he shouted at her as his nerves threatened to snap ive spent all of my life working out how i was going to make blade pay i had to watch my mother scrimp and save and work in a sleazy diner while he got richer and richer instead of rotting in a cell im entitled to the money and im going to have it resigned serena dropped her gaze to the table look im going to fix something to eat are you hungry she started to tell him no then realized hed just lock her back in the bedroom instead she merely nodded keeping her face averted while she tried to think hearing him rummaging in the cupboard she gave her leg a testing jerk she was going to have to take a chance when he took the cuff off this time shed fight with luck she could surprise him enough to at least get outside get someones attention if there were anyone close enough to hear her shouting when she looked back up terry had a large cast iron skillet in his hand without giving herself a chance to think serena moaned and began to slip slowly toward the floor hey alarmed he rushed over dropping the skillet beside her as he tried to lift her by the shoulders what is it he demanded are you sick i feel faint she said weakly as her fingers closed over the handle of the skillet she made herself go limp until his face bent over hers using all of her strength she crashed the skillet against the side of his head he went down like a stone at first serena lay still trying to catch the breath hed knocked out of her when hed landed across her body then she had a moments terror that shed killed him struggling she wiggled out from under him and felt for his pulse thank god she murmured as she felt the beat quickly she shifted until she could reach into his pocket for the key his mother was the one who deserved that blow she thought as she released herself poor kid never had a chance rising she considered her options she could run like hell but the chances were that hed come to and take off no she had to make sure he stayed put first serena stuck the handcuffs into the back pocket of her jeans then began to drag him toward the bedroom he wasnt a big man but as she started across the living room bent over and tugging him by the shoulders she discovered her strength wasnt at its maximum by the time she got him through the doorway she was breathing hard and dripping with sweat resting against the doorjamb she decided shed never be able to drag him onto the bed instead she left him stretched out on the floor attached to the footboard with the handcuffs she stumbled on the way to the phone with a faintness that wasnt contrived it occurred to her that shed barely eaten in two days it would wait she told herself shaking her head to clear it she wasnt about to pass out now quickly she lifted the phone and dialed after a quick shower and change of clothes justin came back into the living room anna was urging daniel to eat though she wasnt touching anything on her own plate she looked up as justin entered well have a family dinner tonight she told him with a valiant smile rena loves the fuss he saw the tears swim into her eyes to be hastily blinked away for the first time since he had known her justin went to her and put his arms around her why dont you go down and speak to the chef hell fix whatever you want he felt her shudder as her fingers dug into his back yes ill do that be careful she whispered be careful justin when the phone rang she jerked then drew away her face was a mask of control he wasnt supposed to call again he probably wants to make sure nothings gone wrong his head pounding justin picked up the phone blade justin serena he heard annas quick gasp behind him are you all right yes yes im fine justin are you sure he hasnt hurt you i didnt think hed let you call again she controlled her impatience and spoke lightly he didnt have any choice she told him hes unconscious and cuffed to the bedpost what caine grabbed at his arm but justin shook him off what did you say i said i knocked him out and cuffed him to the bedpost something rushed through him that he didnt recognize it was relief it came out in a burst of laughter god knows why i was worried about you he said as he sunk onto the couch looking up he saw four pairs of anxious eyes she knocked him out and cuffed him to the bedpost thats a macgregor for you daniel exploded and swung anna into his arms what did she hit him with is that my father serena wanted to know yes he asked what you hit him with a cast iron skillet she realized her legs were shaking and sat on the floor a skillet justin relayed thats my little girl daniel kissed anna lustily then laid his head on her shoulder and wept justin could you come and get me serena demanded ive had a really dreadful night where are you i dont know as reaction set in she buried her face on her knees dont fall apart she ordered herself dont fall apart now she could hear justin calling her name through the receiver and swallowed the tears wait a minute let me pull up the shades and see if i can get my bearings talk to me she demanded as she rose just keep talking to me your familys all here he said hearing the edge of hysteria in her voice your mother wants to have a dinner tonight what would you like a cheeseburger she said as she flipped up the first shade oh god id love to have a cheeseburger and a gallon of champagne i think im east of town near the beach therere a few frame houses farther down the road ive never been in this section she bit down hard on her lip to keep her voice from breaking i just dont know where i am give me the phone number serena well trace it justin scribbled it down quickly as she read it off ill be there just hang on i will im fine really somehow letting the light into the room helped just hurry tell everyone im all right not to worry serena i love you tears welled up again come and show me she said before she hung up justin handed the piece of paper to lieutenant renicki find out where she is with a nod the lieutenant began to dial the phone knocked him out with a skillet eh he gave a quick appreciative laugh must be quite a woman shes a macgregor daniel told him then heartily blew his nose a little waterfront house east of town lieutenant renicki said a few minutes later and headed for the door coming he asked justin justin sent him a mild look were all coming serena stood in the open doorway though she shivered in the brisk morning air it had been less than twentyfour hours she realized she felt as though it had been days since shed seen the sunlight the grass was still wet from the nights rain how was it shed never noticed how many colors there were in a drop of water on a blade of grass then she saw the cars like a procession she thought and wanted badly to weep again no she wouldnt greet justin with tears running down her face straightening her shoulders she went out on the stoop to wait he pulled up in front of two police cars even as the car stopped he was out of the door and rushing toward her serena his arms were around her lifting her off her feet as he crushed her against him with her face buried against his throat she heard him say her name again and again are you all right he demanded but before she could answer his lips were fastened on hers why hes trembling she realized and clutched him tighter as reassurance she put all of the love and warmth she had into the kiss youre freezing he murmured feeling the chill of her skin under his hands here take my jacket as he started to remove it serena caught his face in her hands oh justin she whispered and stroked the lines of strain on his face what did he put you through here now let me take a look at her daniel took her by the shoulders then ran his wide hands over her face so you took him out with a frying pan did you little girl seeing the redrimmed eyes she kissed him fiercely it was handy she told him dont tell me you were worried about me she demanded as if insulted course not he sniffed loudly any daughter of mine can take care of herself your mother she was worried lieutenant renicki watched as serena was passed from one family member to another he intended to keep an eye on justin when terry ford was brought out well need a statement from you miss macgregor he said moving over casually to stand beside justin not now he acknowledged justins words with a simple nod if you could come down to the station later today after youve rested he felt justin tense and bracing himself looked over as terry was brought out by two uniformed officers easy mr blade he murmured your ladys been through enough for one day terry jerked up his head justin remembered those eyes the pale anxious eyes hed seen every day in a courtroom hed been no more than three justin thought a baby he felt serenas hand link with his as the anger drained out of him as they led him to the car terry continued to watch justin over his shoulder im sorry for him serena murmured so sorry for him justin gathered her into his arms so am i some of my men will be going through the house lieutenant renicki said briskly if youd come downtown at your convenience miss macgregor come on lets get the girl back daniel stated and took a step toward her justin will bring her anna took his arm and steered him toward the second police car the rest of us will go back and plan that dinner she doesnt even have any shoes on her feet daniel blustered as he was pushed into the car shell be all right alan commented as he dropped into the front seat he realized he was starving sure shell be fine caine agreed then leaned over to his fathers ear ill buy you a cigar if you go quietly daniel shifted his eyes toward his wife and settled back shell be fine he decided come on justin buttoned his jacket up to serenas throat ill take you back lets walk on the beach she hooked her arm around his waist i really need to walk youre barefoot he pointed out its the best way to walk on the beach you havent slept she commented as they crossed to the sand no but it appears i could have rested easy he wanted to crush her against him be certain she was real trying to keep his arm light around her shoulders he brushed his lips over the top of her head i hated to hurt him she mused but i couldnt be sure how hed react once he had you face to face so much hate locked up inside that boy justin its so sad i took something vital from his life he took something vital from mine he stopped holding her close to his side as he looked out to sea im surprised he asked for such a small amount of money small she cocked a brow at him in most circles two million is a hefty sum for something priceless he took her face in his hands then lowered his mouth to hers then with a shudder he dragged her close and savaged her lips serena his mouth raced over her face coming to rest again on hers i wasnt sure id ever hold you again all i could think about was what he might have done to you what id do to him when i found him he wouldnt have hurt me the violence was bubbling in him again so she soothed it with her hands and lips the reason it was so easy to get away was because he didnt wish me any harm no it was me justin enough she drew him away and her eyes were suddenly touched with anger you didnt cause this im not going to listen to you try to take the blame what happened today was started long ago with drink and bigotry now its over let it rest i wonder why i missed you shouting at me he murmured then drew her close again masochist you know she cuddled against him a moment ive had some time to think about our relationship oh yes i think we need to redefine the ground rules puzzled he drew her away i didnt know we had any ive been thinking she walked toward the surf then discovering the water was freezing stepped back again and wary he took her shoulders and turned her to face him and i dont think the current situation is very practical in what way i think we should get married she said very coolly married thoughtful justin stared at her she was standing barefoot in cold sand in a jacket several sizes too big for her with her hair tangled and tossed calmly telling him they should get married an hour before she knocked out a wouldbe kidnapper with an iron skillet it wasnt he discovered exactly as hed pictured it hed imagined asking her himself when they were in some dimly lit room warm and fresh from loving married he repeated yes i hear people still do it now im willing to be reasonable you are he nodded wondering just what she was up to since its my suggestion well settle it your way digging in her pocket she pulled out a coin justin laughed and reached out to take it from her serena really oh no my coin my flip heads we get married tails we dont before he could say another word she spun the coin in the air then snatched it she slapped it onto the back of her hand then held it out for him to see heads he glanced at it dipping his hands into his pockets justin raised his eyes to hers looks like i lose certainly does serena slipped the twoheaded coin back into her pocket how about the best two out of three a flare of temper lit her eyes forget it she told him and started across the sand she let out a quick screech when justin swooped her up into his arms if you think youre going to welsh she began then gave a sigh of pleasure as he silenced her i never welsh he promised nipping at her lip as he started to carry her back to the car let me take a look at that coin as she twined her arms around his neck her eyes laughed into his over my dead body tempting fate chapter one contents prev next she wasnt sure why she was doing it diana studied the cloud formations spreading beneath her and tried to reason out if the trip she was making had been impulse on her part or calculated though she was scheduled to land in less than thirty minutes she still wasnt certain it had been nearly twenty years since shed last seen her brother when diana thought of him she thought of him as a remote exciting casually affectionate teenager diana had loved him with all the singleminded intensity that a sixyearold girl can have for a sixteenyearold boy her image of him was frozen in the past a dark rangy youth with sharp good looks and cool green eyes she remembered an arrogant sort of pride and selfsufficiency hed been a loner even at six diana had understood that justin blade had gone his own way with a mild humorless smile she leaned back in the soft comfort of her firstclass seat justin had certainly gone his own way twenty years before when their parents had died he had comforted her diana supposed but shed been too bewildered to understand she had thought her parents had left because shed made a fuss about going to school if she behaved and was quiet and attentive in class her parents would come back then aunt adelaide had come and justin had gone for months she had thought hed gone to heaven too tired of her tears and questions her aunt had taken her east to a different world a different life not once in the span of two decades had justin contacted her so now hes married diana mused perhaps because she still saw him as an intense rather brooding teenager she couldnt picture justin as a husband serena macgregor diana ran the name over in her mind odd that she should find herself with a sisterinlaw when she barely felt that she had a brother oh she knew of the hyannis port macgregors aunt adelaide wouldnt have considered dianas education complete if she hadnt been made aware of the background of one of the countrys leading families particularly when they lived close enough to boston to be considered neighbors after all monied dynasties were the only royalty america claimed daniel macgregor was the patriarch a fullblooded scot and financial wizard anna macgregor his wife was a highly respected surgeon alan the oldest son was a united states senator earmarked for bigger things caine macgregor here diana stopped her mental list though he was barely thirty shed heard his name bandied about the hallowed halls of harvard law school both she and caine had chosen law and shed slaved over the books studied under the same professors and walked the same corridors at length shed passed the same bar hed graduated the year before shed entered and had already begun what looked to be a brilliant career once when diana had been a freshman shed overheard two female upperclassmen talking about caine macgregor and she remembered with a smirk they hadnt been discussing his mind obviously the inestimable macgregor hadnt spent all his time sweating over his books then there was serena from all accounts she was brilliant it seemed to be in the macgregor genes shed graduated from smith with honors diana recalled then had spent the next few years collecting degrees she seemed an odd match for the justin blade diana remembered for a moment diana considered whether she would have attended their wedding if shed been in the country yes she decided she would have been too curious not to after all it was primarily curiosity that had her traveling to atlantic city now then again she thought ruefully it would have been difficult to refuse the invitation serena had sent her without being childishly rude if there were two things aunt adelaide had taught her they were never to be childish or rude at least not to those considered your peers diana pushed her aunts quaint double standards to the back of her mind and unfolded serenas letter dear diana i was terribly disappointed that you were in paris last fall and unable to attend the wedding id often requested a sister but my parents wouldnt oblige me now that i have one its frustrating not to be able to enjoy her justin speaks of you but its not the same as meeting you face to face especially since his memories are of a little girl after all these years i can think of nothing hed like better than to meet the woman youve become taking a page out of his book im sending you an airline ticket please use it and be our guest at the comanche for as long as you like you and justin have a lifetime to catch up on and i have a sister to meet rena diana arched a brow as she refolded the letter warm open friendly she mused not the sort of woman she would have paired up with justin with a quiet laugh diana leaned back she didnt even know a man named justin blade if there was a part of her that longed to know him shed buried it long ago shed had to in order to survive in her aunts world even now if her aunt were to discover she was planning on spending time with justin at a gambling hotel the woman would be horrified and diana added the lecture on where and with whom a lady is seen would begin she gave her attention to the clouds again it hardly mattered she mused she would meet her brother and his wife satisfy her curiosity then leave the little girl who had idolized unquestioningly didnt exist any longer she had her own life her own career theyd both been stagnant for too long it was a new year diana reminded herself the perfect time for beginnings she probably wont show caine thought as he walked toward the terminal since diana blade hadnt responded to serenas letter he didnt understand why his sister was so certain shed be on the plane he was less certain why he had allowed himself to be drafted as chauffeur rena would have come if things hadnt gotten so busy at the hotel he reminded himself and since the hell theyd been through only a few months before caine found himself willing to indulge his sisters whims otherwise he mused hed be spending his week off skiing in colorado instead of walking a northern beach in january a gust of wind blew down the collar of his coat as he reached for the door at the terminal entrance a blonde wrapped in red fox passed through pausing long enough to run her gaze up caines body and over his face before her eyes met his caine took the brief speculative look with a halfamused smile and waited for her to move by he had a lean somewhat pale face with sharp strong bones offset by eyes that edged toward violet at a casual glance he might be deemed a scholar a longer one might reveal the recklessness that was far removed from academia because he was hatless the wind tossed his burnished gold hair around his face the smile added charm to what were intense almost wolfish features he was a man aware of his looks and comfortable with them caine moved through the terminal in a quick rangy stride looking neither right nor left hed spent enough time in airports to ignore the sounds and crowds with a brief glance at the monitor he checked the gate for the incoming flight from boston then settled down to wait for a woman he didnt expect when the arrival was announced caine sat back in the black plastic chair and lit a cigarette hed wait until the last passenger had deplaned then go back to the hotel serena would be satisfied and hed have an afternoon workout in the gym since completing his term as states attorney and resuming his private practice caine hadnt had time for an hours relaxation much less a weeks when he relaxed he believed in doing it as thoroughly as he worked the next seven days he told himself were going to be dedicated to doing nothing he wouldnt think of the chaos of his office the cases he was going to have to turn down because there simply werent enough hours in the day or the reams of paperwork caine knew her the minute he saw her the high slashing cheekbones were so much like justins as was the smooth almost copper complexion the indian heritage they shared was perhaps even more apparent in the sister her eyes werent the light unexpected green of her brother but a rich dark brown camel eyes caine thought as he rose luxuriously lashed and heavy lidded so that they appeared sleepy the nose was straight and aristocratic the mouth passionate or stubborn he mused it wasnt a face a man could easily categorize beautiful appealing sexy but it wasnt one hed easily forget caine knew hed already memorized it feature by feature as she shifted her flight bag to her other arm dianas thick raven hair swung not quite brushing her shoulders she wore it loose and nearly straight so that the tips just curved under with a fringe of bangs over her forehead the style suited her easy but cleverly and meticulously cut as was the deceptively simple burgundy suit unnoticed caine let his eyes trail up taking in the slender welldisciplined body narrowhipped slim waist strong swimmers shoulders she walked like a dancer confident smoothly rhythmic so that when he stepped in front of her diana paused in midstride without any show of awkwardness unlike the woman in the red fox she scanned his face briefly and with no show of interest excuse me the words were perfectly polite and left the unmistakable impression that he was in her way interesting caine mused and didnt bother to smile diana blade dianas left brow disappeared under the fringe of bangs yes im caine macgregor renas brother keeping his eyes on her face caine held out a hand so this is the deadly macgregor diana mused accepting the hand he offered how do you do shed expected a smooth palm and was surprised to find her hand clasped against hard callused skin a faint prickling of pleasure crept up her arm diana acknowledged it broke contact then forgot it rena would have come herself caine went on still studying her face minutely but there were a few minor emergencies at the hotel because he was a man who could be diplomatic or blunt depending on his mood caine spoke as he started to take the flight bag from her shoulder i didnt expect you to come no diana kept her hand on the strap of the bag refusing to relinquish possession and your sister caine considered engaging in a brief tugofwar over the bag something about those large sleepy eyes made him want to annoy her with a shrug he dropped his hand she was certain youd come rena believes everyone has strong family feelings because she does the fleeting smile softened his features before he took her arm lets go get your bags diana allowed him to lead her down the wide crowded corridor while behind the deceptively lazy eyes her mind was active and sharply alert you dont like me do you mr macgregor caines brows lifted and fell but he didnt even glance at her i dont know you but since were in the position of being family so to speak why dont we bypass the formalities during the short speech she had another clue why he was so successful in his field his voice was gold rich mellow gold with a hint of steel beneath all right she agreed tell me caine if you werent expecting me how did you know who i was your bone structure and coloring are very much like justins are they she murmured as they stopped in front of the conveyor belt caine studied her again with the same thorough unapologetic intensity as before her scent was something he couldnt quite identify wild rather man floral and very french he wondered if it suited her as well as the smartly cut wool suit the family resemblance is there he commented but i think it would be less apparent if you stood side by side thats something ive had little opportunity to do diana returned dryly and indicated her bags with a gesture of her hand used to servants caine concluded as he hefted the two leather cases but selfreliant he added remembering their silent battle over the flight bag im sure justin will be pleased to see you after so many years possibly you seem very fond of him ive known him for ten years he was my friend before he became my brotherinlaw she wanted to ask what justin was like but swallowed the question diana had her own opinion if she were to change it it wouldnt be through caines influence or anyone elses youre staying at the comanche for a week as they stepped out into the frigid january air diana automatically stuck her ungloved hands in her coat pockets the sky was a cold hard blue the street slick and grimy with melted snow isnt it an odd time of year to be vacationing at the beach for some the wind whipped his hair into his eyes but he didnt seem to notice then again a great many people come for the gambling weather doesnt matter when youre inside a casino because the top of her head was level with his shoulder diana tilted her face back to see his is that what you come for not particularly he looked down and discovered the sun brought out the faintest hint of gold in her eyes i enjoy an occasional game but renas the gambler in the family then she and justin must be well suited caine set down her bags and slowly drew the keys out of his pocket ill let you decide that for yourself without speaking he loaded her cases in the trunk then unlocked the car diana caine put his hand on her arm before she could slide in shed never known her name could sound like that soft and smooth and vaguely exotic when she turned large puzzled eyes to his he brushed at her bangs in a gesture that was completely natural to him because his touch surprised her as much as it disconcerted diana said nothing things arent always as they seem caine said quietly i dont understand you for a moment they merely stood in the windy parking lot with the thunder of planes and smell of fumes diana thought she could almost feel the texture of his hard palm through the thickness of her coat his eyes she thought were oddly gentle in such a strongly featured face briefly she forgot his reputation as a demon in the courtroom and the bedroom she found herself wanting to reach out to him for help advice comfort before she was fully aware she needed any you have a beautiful face caine murmured do you have any compassion diana drew her brows together id like to think so then give him a chance the puzzled vulnerable look dropped away to be replaced by something cool and guarded it was a look though she didnt know it that her brother could adopt at a moments notice some might consider my coming a sign of good faith some might caine agreed then walked around to slide into the drivers seat but you dont diana let the door shut with a peevish snap if i had to guess id say you came primarily out of curiosity it must be gratifying to be right so often he flashed her a grin powerful and quickly gone she almost wondered if shed imagined it yeah the jaguar roared to life when he twisted the key for the sake of our kin why dont we try to be friends how was paris idle conversation she decided turn off the brain and give all the standard meaningless answers diana leaned back shed enjoy the ride one of her secret weaknesses was for fast wellconstructed cars it was chilly she began theres a little cafe off the rue du four caine remembered as he maneuvered the jag through airport traffic the best soufflés on either side of the atlantic henris he sent her a curious look yes you know it yes with a hint of a smile diana turned her attention back to the window henris was a noisy little hole in the wall aunt adelaide would have starved before she stepped over the threshold diana loved it and always made a point of slipping away for an hour or two when she was in paris to enjoy a meal and the company strange that it would also be a favorite of caine macgregors do you get to paris often no not anymore my aunt will be living there now ive been helping her settle into her apartment youre living in boston what part ive just moved into a house on charles street the inevitable small world caine murmured it seems were neighbors what do you do in boston flicking back the hair that fell across her cheek diana turned to study him the same thing you do caine lifted a brow as he twisted his head to look back at her you remember professor whiteman im sure she continued he speaks very highly of you caines grin was quick and off center do the students still call him bones behind his back of course with a laugh caine shook his head so harvard law it appears we have more in common than we bargained for family alma mater career are you practicing im with barclay stevens and fitz mmm very prestigious he shot her a look and staid for the first time dianas features relaxed into a smile it was both wry and stunning i get all the fascinating cases just last week i represented a councilmans son who has a habit of ignoring the posted speed limit you can work your way up in fifteen or twenty years ive other plans diana murmured by the time she was thirty she calculated shed be ready for the break after four years with a respected conservative firm shed have the experience and the backing necessary to start her own practice a small elegant office a competent secretary and then which are she brought herself back to the present she wasnt a woman to lay all her cards on the table i want to specialize in criminal law she said simply why a thirst for justice human rights laughing she swung her face back to his and i love a good fight caine acknowledged this with a thoughtful nod perhaps she wasnt as polished and proper as the trim suit indicated he should have gotten a hint of who she was from her choice of scent are you any good a secondyear law student could handle what im doing at the moment her chin angled as she rested her elbow on the back of the seat im much better than that and i intend to be the best an admirable ambition caine commented as he swung off the strip toward the comanche ive already earmarked that spot for myself diana gave him a long cool look well have to see who gets there first wont we for an answer caine only smiled diana thought she could see something of the demon in him now a hint of that volatile dangerous energy that had already propelled him far up the ladder without speaking she stepped out of her side of the car she wasnt intimidated by wolfish grins or challenging eyes if there was one area where diana was completely confident it was law caine macgregor would be hearing her name over the years she was certain hed remember what shed said ms blades bags are in the trunk caine told the doorman as he handed over a folded bill and his keys im sure renad like to see you right away he went on as he took dianas arm again unless youd rather go to your own rooms first no rena not justin she noticed she felt the quick jumpiness in her stomach again and struggled to ignore it good then well go right up so diana glanced around taking in the understated elegance of the lobby this is justins he only owns half of this comanche caine corrected as they stepped into the elevator rena bought in as a full partner late last summer i see is that how they met no when he laughed she turned her head to eye him curiously its a complicated family joke im sure rena will tell you about it though perhaps youd have to meet my father to completely understand he gave her a long look then twisted the ends of her hair around his fingers on second thought id better see that you dont meet him or im likely to find myself in a similar situation he kept his eyes on hers stirred by the wildly seductive scent she wore was that mouth as passionate as it looked he wondered you really are very beautiful diana he murmured it was the way he said her name diana told herself that caused that odd almost uncomfortable prickling along her skin he was an expert at making women uncomfortable she remembered and making them enjoy it she gave him a steady look from halfclosed eyes you left quite a reputation behind you at harvard caine she said mildly not all of it in the lecture halls is that so apparently amused he gave her hair a quick tug before he released it youll have to tell me about it sometime some things are best left unsaid when the doors opened diana stepped out then glanced over her shoulder though ive often wondered if the incident in the law library was based on fact hmm rubbing a hand over his chin he joined her suppose i plead the fifth on that counselor coward oh yeah he started to stick the key serena had given him into the lock of the penthouse door then stopped are they still talking about that diana struggled with a smile as she studied his face he wasnt particularly embarrassed she mused more curious its become the stuff legends are made of she told him champagne and passion between massachusetts criminal law and divorce proceedings caine gave a shrug as he turned the lock it was beer actually these things get blown out of proportion with time he gave her a very charming smile you dont believe everything you hear do you diana paused long enough to return the smile yes with this she pushed open the unlocked door and stepped inside diana didnt know what shed been expecting whatever it had been it had little to do with the warm elegance of her brothers suite muted tones accented with bold slashes of color large expanses of glass with a panoramic view of the atlantic small exquisite carvings pastel sketches low inviting furniture snuggled into plush carpeting was this her brothers taste she wondered suddenly feeling more remote from him than ever or was it serenas who was this man who shared parents and a heritage with her why was she here looking opening herself to emotions shed locked out most of her life they needed to stay locked out she told herself frantically that was survival in a moments panic diana turned toward the door but found herself face to face with caine whom are you going to run from he asked as he lifted his hands to her arms justin or yourself diana stiffened this isnt any of your concern no he agreed but his eyes dropped of their own accord to her mouth she was tense muscles tight what would it be like he wondered to loosen her to get beyond that finely drawn wall of control and elegance hed always preferred more flamboyant women women who knew how to laugh and to love without undercurrents but this after all would just be a test it wasnt as if there were a chance of involvement there was a moments temptation to satisfy his curiosity bring her those few inches closer and taste the fact that her response could fall anywhere between fury and passion only made it the more difficult to resist diana felt the need come unexpectedly and uninvited to be held driven possessed somehow she knew he could bring her to that thered be no unanswered questions no uncertainties only floods of pleasure and passion mindless no thought no reason no justifications she could find that heady forbidden world if only she reached for it and for him for a moment she swayed between temptation and rationality that thin razors edge understood by all lovers it would be so easy a faint mechanical rumble snapped her back diana turned her head toward the doors of an elevator she hadnt even noticed without speaking caine slid his hands up to her shoulders and slipped her coat off as they opened diana watched a woman walk through small and blond and striking in a simple violet sheath that matched her eyes diana serena walked to her enveloping her in a hard unselfconscious hug im so glad you came serena slid her hands down until they gripped her sisterinlaws oh youre lovely she said with a wide welcoming smile and so like justin isnt she caine mmm standing back he watched the meeting as he lit a cigarette a bit overawed by the greeting diana retreated a step serena i want to thank you for the invitation its the last formal one youll get serena told her were family now caine how about a drink diana what would you like diana glanced from brother to sister and lifted her shoulders a little vermouth nervous and unwilling to settle she wandered to the window the hotels beautiful serena caine tells me you and justin are partners in this one and the one were rebuilding in malta i havent wormed my way into the others as yet i will accepting the glass caine handed her serena took a seat on the sofa it turns out diana and i are neighbors caine crossed the room with another glass and offered it to diana really that strange moment had passed diana told herself and it had been nerves not needs she thought as she took the drink from caine then their eyes met their fingers brushed she wasnt as certain as she wanted to be yes deliberately she turned away from caine to face his sister its quite a coincidence cain smiled slowly as he let his gaze sweep up dianas back even more of a coincidence he drawled as he walked back to the bar we have the same profession youre a lawyer serena watched dianas eyes follow caine it appears my brother doesnt waste any time she mused then sipped thoughtfully at her drink yes i was at harvard a few years behind caine diana switched her drink to her other hand and wished she hadnt asked for it but his presence was still felt she added serena threw back her head and laughed oh i dont doubt it in most cases you should take stories with a grain of salt in caines she trailed off sending him a provocative smile i always wonder just how much was left out your faith in me is touching caine murmured theyre close diana mused theyve shared years and know dozens of foolish things about each other she stared down into her drink what am i doing here serena she began i want you to know i appreciate the invitation but i wonder diana stopped and fortified herself with a sip of vermouth i wonder if justins any more comfortable about this than i am he doesnt know youre coming when dianas eyes shot up serena went on quickly i wasnt certain you would diana i didnt want him to be hurt if you refused would he be diana murmured then lifted her glass again you dont know him serena returned i do the cool quiet look diana sent her was so like justins that serenas heart twisted diana i think i have some idea how you must feel setting her drink on the table she rose please dont shut him out hes at the sound of the elevator serena broke off damn it i need a few more minutes she glanced at diana to see her sisterinlaw standing stiff and silent serena cast one helpless look at caine and got a shrug for an answer diana watched the doors slide open there you are justin strode directly to his wife you disappeared justin serena found her words muffled against his mouth hes so tall diana thought numbly confident successful her mind went on as she could do nothing more than stare at him how much was left of the moody intense boy shed known was this her brother hed lifted her on his shoulders once so that she could see over the crowd when a circus had come to town dear god why should she remember that now justin serena began breathlessly when her mouth was free we have company he spared caine a brief glance then gathered serena closer go away caine i want to make love to your sister justin with a half laugh serena pressed her hands against his chest when she glanced toward the window justin followed her eyes oh smiling he ran his hand down his wifes hair but didnt release her i didnt realize caine had brought a friend he doesnt even know me diana thought as her hands tightened on the glass were strangers wed pass each other on the street at a loss she stared back at him struggling for words that wouldnt come slowly justins eyes narrowed serena felt his hand tighten on her hair then release gradually until he was no longer holding her diana in her name was recognition and incredulity dryeyed she stood perfectly still her knuckles were white against the glass justin he crossed to her searching her face the clock was spinning backward and forward so quickly it left him shaken and disoriented he wanted to reach out touch her but didnt know how shed been so small when hed left her and pudgy with baby fat now she was a tall slender woman with his fathers eyes his face was as expressionless as hers as they studied each other you cut your pigtails he murmured and felt foolish several years ago diana called on every lesson in deportment aunt adelaide had ever drummed into her you look well justin she said with a polite smile whatever overture he might have made was smothered by that one impersonal sentence and you he said with a nod hows your aunt aunt adelaides fine shes living in paris now your hotels very impressive thank you he gave her a wry smile as he slipped his hands into his pockets i hope youll stay with us for a while for a week the ache in her hand told her to loosen her grip on the glass diana concentrated on doing so while his eyes stayed steady on hers i havent congratulated you on your marriage justin i hope youre happy yes i am finding the stilted conversation unbearable serena stepped forward please sit down diana if you dont mind id like to unpack settle in a bit of course justin spoke before serena could protest youll join us for dinner tonight id be glad to ill show you to your rooms caine drained the rest of his drink then set it down thank you diana crossed toward the door pausing long enough to give serena a brief smile ill see you tonight then there was faint but unmistakable disapproval in the violet eyes yes please let us know if theres anything you need does eight oclock suit you ill be ready without looking back diana walked through the door caine already held open neither spoke as they moved down the hallway in a few minutes diana thought frantically she could untense her muscles unstrap her emotions silently caine drew the door key out of his pocket and slipped it into the lock diana walked through then turned intending to give him a brief thankyou he closed the door behind him sit down if you dont mind id really like to why dont you finish that drink glancing down diana saw that she still held the glass with a shrug she turned away as if studying the room very nice she said without having the vaguest idea what she was looking at i appreciate you showing me to my room caine now i really have to unpack sit down diana im not leaving while youre churned up this way im not churned up her voice was too sharp in defense she took another swallow of vermouth i am tired though so if you dont mind i was watching you firmly caine took her by the shoulders and pushed her into a chair if youd stood in there another five minutes youd have keeled over thats ridiculous diana set the glass on the table beside her with a click is it he took her hand between both of his rubbing absently as he watched her face your hands are like ice you can lie with your eyes diana not with your hands couldnt you have given him something no the word wavered and she sucked in her breath to steady it i dont have anything to give him snatching her hand away she rose please leave me alone they were close now so close she could see the fractional lift of his brow stubborn caine murmured and absently traced the shape of her mouth with his thumb i thought as much when i saw you get off the plane diana with a sigh caine brushed the hair away from her cheeks she felt everything slip out of focus youre hurting yourself by binding your feelings up this way you dont know anything about my feelings her voice was low and unsteady as she fought to keep tears from misting her vision she wasnt going to cry not in front of him or anyone there was nothing absolutely nothing to cry about this is none of your business my feelings are none of your business she choked on a sob and pressed her hand to her mouth leave me alone she demanded but found herself cradled against his chest when youve finished he murmured and held her the wordless unquestioning comfort was more than she could resist clinging diana let her emotions break loose in a storm of weeping chapter two contents prev next the water was slate gray with jagged crests of whitecaps it was angry noisy and fascinating diana could smell the sea and the promise of snow as she walked across it the sand was brittle with cold crunching quietly underfoot she had her coat buttoned high against the wind but lifted her face to it enjoying its slapping fingers and the solitude she reveled in the solitude that could be found on a winters beach just past dawn so much of her life had been crowded with people shed never been alone in her aunts house on beacon hill diana tossed back her hair and smiled ruefully shed never been allowed to be alone beneath adelaides fussing and lectures on deportment had been the fear that blade blood comanche blood would prove too strong and too wild to be controlled diana had controlled it because there was nowhere else for her to go at first diana had done everything she was told allowed herself to be molded into the quiet little lady her aunt had wanted everyone else had left her and diana had lived with the daily fear that she would be left again shed learned to control the fear but shed never been able to alleviate it it was the ability to control her emotions that had become her most successful defense against adelaides criticisms and her own insecurity even as a child diana had understood that her aunt had taken her in because of a sense of duty there was no love between them despite the fact that the young girl had thirsted desperately for love diana had been the offspring of adelaides half sister a darkhaired goldenskinned girl born of their fathers second marriage to a woman of mixed blood comanche blood and the half sister whom adelaide had accepted out of duty had compounded their fathers lack of judgment by marrying a blade blood had called to blood adelaide had often said when she spoke of what she considered her half sisters betrayal of their name and heritage with diana shed been ruthlessly determined to correct her familys previous errors the comanche strain was to be ignored more it was to be erased adelaide demanded perfection she was a grandeau diana was to be a mirror of her own values opinions and wishes the child learned to be cautious to be obedient and to question only in her head the wrong question voiced aloud could be met with tightlipped impatience or worse another lecture on deportment diana had accepted then had excelled in her studies in music in poise theyd been an escape that had fulfilled her quest to learn and her need to belong her calmly determined will to succeed had begun as a way of surviving over the years the cool elegant demeanor shed adopted had become second nature if there were moments when shed longed for something more something exciting unfathomable shed suppressed the needs shed come to believe that if she played by the rules if she followed the steps carefully shed win in the end so her rebellions had been very discreet and her dreams meticulously subdued still adelaide would have been appalled to know that her niece enjoyed restaurants that didnt have a fourstar rating and movies that didnt have strict cultural significance and sports cars diana mused with a quiet laugh steamed crabs and beer stopping she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked out to sea and wild winter beaches she reflected is that why justin seems to have settled here diana wondered as she turned to face the back of the hotel does he find himself drawn to the cold passion of a winter sea was the heritage they shared stronger than the years of separation the years when he had gone his own way to gamble and win and she had submitted and quietly rebelled shaking her head diana continued to walk she knew nothing of the man whod sat across from her at dinner the night before he was smooth and sophisticated with something like thunder just beneath the surface theyd had little to say to each other even when serenas eyes had pleaded with her diana could find nothing more than meaningless cocktail talk what did a woman like serena macgregor know of her feelings diana thought with quick resentment shed grown up surrounded by family love shed had a place and a lineage she didnt have to ignore just watching how easy she was with caine caine diana thought with a sigh it was impossible to pin down what she thought about him what she felt about him she hadnt been prepared for the sensitivity hed shown her when shed fallen apart or more his insight in knowing how close shed been to the edge yet he like justin had a certain polish that seemed like a thin glaze over something very dangerous when her weeping had run its course she hadnt felt safe in his arms though hed done no more than stroke her hair as if shed been a child he threatened to ignite some spark in her like the reluctant flame that comes from rubbing two sticks together with steady endless patience a forest fire can be started that way diana reminded herself she wasnt about to have her life interrupted by one youre up early diana whirled to find caine behind her he was dressed more casually now in a leather bomber jacket jeans and sneakers it occurred to her that he should be freezing but he seemed perfectly comfortable as he scanned her face i wanted to watch the sun rise over the water she began then glanced up at the thick lead clouds i didnt have much luck this morning lets walk his hand closed over hers before she could answer do you like the beach diana relaxed he wasnt going to badger her about justin or the strained dinner they had shared the night before ive never been much of a summer beach person she began but i never knew how appealing it could be this time of year do you come often no not really luckily both alan and i were here a few months ago when rena was kidnapped but what diana stopped her fingers tightening on his caines eyes came to hers dark and curious didnt you know no i i suppose i was in europe what happened long story caine began to walk again and was quiet so long diana thought hed refuse to tell her thered been a bomb threat in justins vegas hotel when he went out to handle things there was another threat handwritten addressed to him he didnt like the feel of it when he came back he tried to convince rena to leave but with a quick grin he glanced out to sea shes another stubborn woman justin was downstairs talking to the police about a second threat when the guy got to her the grin was gone as though it had never been and a look of barely controlled fury took its place he held her for almost twentyfour hours handcuffed to the bed he wanted justin to pay two million in ransom good god diana thought about the small violeteyed woman and shuddered its the only time in all the years ive known justin that ive seen him so close to losing it caine remembered the look of cold fury was still in his eyes but his voice was calm he didnt eat sleep he just sat by the phone and waited it wasnt until the boy let him talk to rena that we finally had a clue to who he was in some ways that was worse why this time caine stopped and looked down at her she wouldnt know he thought perhaps it was time she did when justin was eighteen he was in a fight in a bar the man who started it didnt care to be drinking in the same place as an indian the rich dark eyes frosted over i see he pulled a knife during the struggle justin was ripped open about six inches along the ribs caine saw her pale but he continued in the same tone the man was killed with his own knife and justin was charged with murder diana felt a sudden wave of nausea and fought it off justin was on trial he was acquitted once the witnesses from the bar were subpoenaed and under oath but he spent a few grim months in a cell my aunt never told me diana turned away to face the sea she never said a word you would have been around eight i dont imagine youd have been a great deal of help to him she could have been diana said silently thinking of her aunts comfortable income her influential connections and i should have been told god he was only a boy squeezing her eyes shut she struggled to clear her mind and listen go on it turned out that the boy who had rena was the son of the man justin had killed his mother had drummed it into his head that justin had murdered his father and had been freed because the courts had felt sorry for him he had no intention of hurting rena only justin the sea seemed louder somehow more violent so justin paid the ransom he was prepared to but it wasnt necessary rena phoned just as he was leaving to make the final arrangements shed knocked the kid out with a skillet and cuffed him to the bed stunned and amused despite herself diana turned back she did caine acknowledged her smile with one of his own shes tougher than she looks shaking her head diana began to walk again and what about the boy his trial comes up later this month renas paying his legal fees her eyes whipped up to his in them was a mixture of anger and admiration does justin know that of course she digested this in silence walking again im not sure i could be so forgiving justins more resigned than agreeable caine commented and when we had rena back safe it was hard to refuse her anything my first reaction was to get the kid locked up for the next fifty years diana tilted her head to study his face i doubt hed have much of a chance if you could prosecute ive read some of your trial transcripts you go for the jugular counselor its cleaner he said simply why didnt you run for states attorney again politics has too many walls he sent her an offcenter grin i imagine youve run into a few with barclay stevens and fitz barclay is the epitome of the dry sterneyed attorney dickens would have loved him my dear miss blade she began in a whispery thin voice please try to remember your position a member of our firm never raises her voice or challenges a judge in the courtroom only on the golf course diana added in a mutter still grinning caine swung an arm around her shoulders and do you challenge judges miss blade frequently if aunt adelaide wasnt bosom buddies with barclays wife id have been out on my ear by now as it is im a glorified law clerk so why are you still there i have a deep supply of patience his arm felt warm and friendly over her shoulder without thinking diana moved closer aunt adelaide wasnt thrilled about my choosing law in the first place but she was instrumental in my securing a position at barclays that rankled diana swallowed the light trace of bitterness her voice was low and even when she continued in her way she was pleased that i was working for an old friend and a prestigious firm if i hang in long enough they might just give me something other than traffic afraid of her instead of being insulted diana laughed the fear had been gone for years even the memory was vague aunt adelaide i hope ive got more spine than that no she tossed her face up to the wind i owe her do you caine murmured half to himself my father has a saying he mused aloud theres no fee for family he doesnt know aunt adelaide diana remarked dryly oh look at the gulls she pointed skyward as a pair of them swooped overhead and out to sea one flew close enough to touch when i stood out on my balcony this morning i wonder why they make such a lonely sound when they seem perfectly content when she shivered caine tightened his arm around her cold yes but she smiled up at him i like it his breath was cool against her face showing itself in a thin white mist that was quickly snatched by the wind diana was so entranced by his eyes that she hardly noticed that the arm around her shoulders had shifted drawing her closer then they were face to face and her arms had slipped up his back over the cold smooth leather her heartbeat was a dull thud that might have belonged to someone else she heard the wind echo off the water and surround them as if they were on some lonely northern island with one hand he cupped the back of her neck with cool strong fingers diana felt the cold wet drops land on her face before she saw the flakes its snowing yeah caine lowered his lips to within a whisper of hers then hesitated he heard her quiet shudder of breath before she banished the distance softly slowly his mouth roamed over hers it was a cool lazy seduction at odds with the biting wind and racing snow he drew her closer gradually until her body fit tightly against his she could feel those hard seeking fingers run up and down the nape of her neck teasing her mind with images of what they could do to her body while she was distracted by them his mouth became more greedy pulling response from her before she was aware of the demand her hands hooked around his shoulders and locked tight her passion seemed to rise like the wind but it was hot sultry as he took his lips on a long mesmerizing journey over her face she heard the thick echo of crashing waves then nothing but the whisper of her own name as he traced her ear with his tongue diana pressed herself against him searching and finding his roaming mouth with her own there was no teasing this time no subtle greed now it was all flash all fire neither of them was aware of the cold any longer as they demanded everything the other possessed diana felt all of her small inner secrets slipping away from her exposed even as she felt herself being filled again with needs that were as much caines as her own and the needs were deeper and more complex than anything shed ever known not just a hunger for the taste of a mouth not just a desire for the hard strong feel of a mans arms it was a longing for a match a mate in her stirred the oldest most primitive need to be completed physically and the oldest most basic need to be fulfilled emotionally as if she felt herself drowning she clutched at him but was suddenly unsure if he were anchor or lifeline the will to survive smothered the yearning for pleasure and she palled away breathing jerkily diana stared at him while the wind whipped her hair and snow into her eyes well caines breath puffed out in a long stream that was unexpected when he reached up to touch her cheek she backed out of range his brows lifted and fell as he stuck his hands in his pockets a bit late to throw up walls now diana the foundations already crumbled not walls caine she said calmer now just basic common sense im not your passioninthebookstacks type something flashed in his eyes but she couldnt be certain if it was annoyance or amusement the statute of limitations on that misdemeanor must have run out by now i have my doubts that youre rehabilitated diana returned mildly god forbid before she could avoid him caine reached out to gather her tossing hair in one hand diana with a laugh he brushed snowflakes from her cheek you belong in the desert or someplace steamy with a white sun wearing exotic clothes that would suit that face of yours she held herself very still to combat the desire to feel his skin against hers again im very well suited to a new england courtroom she retorted yes the smile remained in his eyes i think you are or part of you is perhaps thats why youre beginning to fascinate me im not interested in fascinating you caine she met his eyes levelly and with the quick wish that she could knock the gleam out of them i am interested in going back in before i freeze ill walk you back he said with such apparently boundless amiability that diana wanted to deck him that isnt necessary she began as her hand was clasped by his i suppose i could walk ten paces behind or ten paces in front as she let out a frustrated breath caine grinned down at her youre not angry because we exchanged a friendly kiss after all were family there was nothing friendly or familial about it diana muttered no he lifted her hand to his lips then lightly nipped at her knuckle maybe we should try again no diana said firmly and tried to ignore the thrill racing up her arm all right he said a bit too agreeably for her taste lets have some breakfast im not hungry a good thing youre not under oath he murmured you must have eaten all of three bites last night well he continued before she could think of a comment have some coffee while i eat im starving well talk shop he held up a hand anticipating her protest if it makes you feel any better ill even put it on my expense account with a reluctant laugh she climbed the beach steps with him it sounds to me as though you didnt get out of politics soon enough you havent the eyes of a cynic he commented no he was climbing the steps quickly now so she had to jog to keep up theyre more like a camels careful its getting slick a camel not certain whether to be amused or insulted diana stopped near the top of the steps now thats a terribly romantic statement you want romance before she knew what he was doing caine had swept her up in his arms to carry her toward the back entrance laughing diana pushed snowcoated hair out of her eyes put me down you idiot it worked for clark gable vivien leigh didnt call him an idiot they were inside at the time diana pointed out if you slip on this snow and drop me im going to sue some romantic you are caine complained as he pushed the door open with his back whatever happened to women who liked to be swept off their feet they got dropped diana said flatly caine will you put me down she tried wriggling but he only tightened his grip and kept walking youre not carrying me into the dining room no for him it was a direct challenge and he accepted it with a grin she was light and carried the scent of snow her eyes held an indignant laughter that appealed to him caine decided then and there to put that expression on her face more often she had a mouth that was meant to smile and he had an urge to show her just how little effort fun could be caine diana lowered her voice as she caught a few interested glances stop this nonsense people are staring its all right im used to it twisting his head he kissed her briefly your mouths very tempting in a pout as she made a frustrated sound in her throat caine stopped to give the dining room hostess a smile table for two of course mr macgregor her eyes swept up to diana for only a moment right this way diana clicked her teeth shut as he carried her around tables scattered with breakfast customers she watched a middleaged woman tug on her husbands sleeve and point your waitress will be right with you the hostess told caine as she stopped by a comer table enjoy your breakfast thanks with a great deal of style he deposited diana in a chair then sat opposite her you diana began in a low voice are going to pay for that it was worth it caine unzipped his coat and shrugged out of it hed already decided she needed to be hit with the unexpected from time to time in his opinion shed been pampered sheltered and restricted as a macgregor he thought they were all one and the same absently he combed his fingers through his hair scattering already melting snow are you sure you wont have something more than coffee love quite sure watching him she began unbuttoning her coat do you always get away with the outrageous mostly are you always so beautiful in the morning dont waste your charm diana slipped out of her coat to reveal a pumpkincolored angora sweater its all right i have more while diana gave a disgusted sigh he smiled at their waitress who returned his smile and offered them menus ill have the pancakes he told her immediately with a side order of bacon crisp and eggs over easy the lady only wants coffee is that a normal breakfast for you diana asked when the waitress bustled off caine leaned back observing shed already forgotten to pretend she was angry i enjoy eating when i get the chance there are days when im lucky to get more than a few gallons of coffee and a driedout sandwich is your private caseload as heavy as it was when you were states attorney heavy enough and i dont have a staff of assistants he watched as she added a miserly drop of cream to her coffee thats one of the things i wanted to break away from no law clerk she had hands made for rings he thought but wore none caine had to force his attention back to her question not at the moment my secretary is disorganized untidy and addicted to soap operas diana gave him a mild smile as she lifted her cup she must have other virtues caine laid his elbows on the table and leaned toward her shes fiftyseven sturdy as a rock and a hell of a typist i stand chastised diana murmured still id think with your reputation and background youd have one of the slickest firms in boston i leave that for barclay stevens and fitz dont you like to get your hands dirty occasionally diana yes with a sigh she set down her cup again yes damn it id work for nothing if i could dig my teeth into something that wasnt cut straight out of a textbook traffic violations and property settlements she muttered im not going to get anything else if i dont stick with the establishment for a while longer the world of law wouldnt give me a standing ovation if i opened an office tomorrow is that what you want standing ovations i like to win the sleepy eyes became suddenly intense i intend to make a career out of it why do you do it i have a talent for arguing for a moment he frowned down at his coffee the law has a lot of shades doesnt it caine lifted his eyes and locked them on hers not all of them equal justice its a very thin rope we walk and balance is crucial i like to win too and when i do i like to know i was right havent you ever defended someone you knew was guilty everyones entitled to legal counsel and representation thats the law this time caine lifted his coffee drinking it black strong and hot youre obliged to give them your best and hope that justice is the winner in the final analysis it isnt always the systems lousy and only works part of the time shrugging he drank again its better than not at all interested diana studied him with more care youre not what i expected you to be and what was that more hardline maybe a young more fiery version of barclay quoting precedents a little latin for effect claiming that the law is carved in granite ah an idiot diana burst into quick spontaneous laughter he found it warm and wild like her scent you dont do that enough diana let yourself enjoy without thinking it through he explained my training even as she said it it surprised her just what doors was he opening she thought with a frown before she had a chance to check the locks are you going to clarify that no she shook her head quickly then glanced up heres your breakfast im fascinated to see if you can really eat it all secrets caine thought as the waitress arranged the plates perhaps it was her underlying mystique that had her crowding his mind there seemed to be so many layers to her and he couldnt resist the temptation to peel each one off to see what was underneath then there was the vulnerability it wasnt often you found a strong woman with that soft vulnerable edge the combination with those unmistakable hints of passion was very appealing her manner her speech her style shouted lady with a capital l but there were those bedroom eyes and that wicked promising scent he remembered her hot unrestrained mouth on his and found he wanted her taste again and to feel the skin she kept hidden beneath the discreetly sophisticated clothes hed always found women enjoyable puzzles to be solved in this case he could pick up the challenge play the game and do her the favor of showing her that life wasnt as full of boundaries and rules as she thought yes he mused diana blade was likely to keep him occupied and entertained for quite a while want a bite he said quietly and offered a forkful of fluffy pancakes afraid youve overdone it he only smiled and moved the fork closer to her mouth with a shrug diana allowed him to feed her oh she closed her eyes a moment its good more caine took a bite himself before offering her another food like other solutions to hunger can be habitforming with her eyes on his she accepted the second bite then leaned back im watching my intake at the moment oh here you are serena swept up to the table pressing a kiss to her brothers cheek then dianas isnt that disgusting she demanded gesturing to caines plate and he never gains an ounce did you sleep well yes diana found herself at a loss in the presence of such easy kinship and offered a cautious smile my rooms are lovely want some breakfast caine asked his sister going to share yours no well i havent got time anyway serena made a face at him as he continued to eat i was hoping you could stop by the office a little later diana have you made plans for the day no not yet you might want to take advantage of the health club or the casino id love to show you around thank you give me an hour serena shot caine a look only believe half of what he tells you she advised then was off again your sister diana trailed off then with a quick wondering laugh accepted the slice of bacon caine offered shes not what i expected either do you always have a picture in your head before you meet someone yes i suppose doesnt everyone caine merely moved his shoulders and continued to eat what did you expect rena to be like sturdier for one thing diana chewed the bacon absently as she considered she seems so fragile until you really look and see the strength in her face and i guess i was looking for someone more obviously intellectual glossier shes not the sort of woman i would have pictured justin married to though i had difficulty picturing him married at all it could be caine said quietly that hes not what you think either her eyes lifted at that instantly cool and remote no i dont know him do i it was difficult not to be annoyed at how easily she could slip into her armor caine sliced through his eggs and continued mildly its never easy to know anyone unless you want to it isnt wise to lecture on a subject you know nothing about she retorted you had a tidy little childhood didnt you caine the futility began to rise in her and with it anger mother father sister brother you knew exactly who you were and where you belonged youve no right to analyze or disapprove of my feelings when you have no way of comprehending them caine leaned back and lit a cigarette is that what i was doing do you think its easy to erase twenty years of neglect of disinterest she tossed back i needed him once i dont need him now then why did you come to exorcise those last lingering ghosts she shoved the coffee cup aside i wanted to see him as a man so id stop remembering him as a boy when i leave i wont think of him at all caine eyed her through a thin mist of smoke you cant pretend youre ice and steel with me diana i was with you yesterday after you saw justin thats over you arent pleased i caught you being human are you when she started to rise he gripped her wrist making no effort to keep his strong fingers gentle if you want to be a winner diana you have to stop running away im not running her pulse was beginning to pound the polish had vanished and she had her first clear view of the man beneath strong threatening exciting youve been running since you stepped off that plane he corrected and likely long before that youre hurt and confused and too damn stubborn to admit it even to yourself what i am she said between her teeth is none of your business the macgregors take their family very seriously his eyes had narrowed their color only more dramatic when seen through slits when my sister married your brother you became my business i dont want your brotherly advice he smiled and his grip gentled abruptly i dont feel brotherly toward you diana his thumb brushed across her knuckles in a long slow sweep i think we both know better than that he could switch his mood with more speed than she rising diana gave him a coldly furious look id rather you felt nothing toward me caine took a lazy drag on his cigarette too late he murmured then smiled at her again the scots are a pragmatic race but im beginning to believe in fate diana picked up her coat and meticulously folded it over her arm in the language of the ute comanche means enemies she lifted large angry eyes to his and for the first time he saw the full power of her heritage in her face were not easily subdued turning she walked away in her controlled dancers step with a smile caine crushed out his cigarette he was beginning to think it would be a very interesting battle chapter three contents prev next the comanche diana discovered over the next few days was as slickly run a hotel as any her aunt would have patronized the food the service the ambience all catered to the wealthy and the successful it became obvious that though justin might have started his career as a penniless teenager he had made the most of the time in between she told herself she could respect him for that even cautiously admire him without involving herself she wasnt willing to take the risk of looking closely diana had never considered herself a gambler justin was invariably polite when they met but if she had been more openminded she might have seen he was as cautious as she despite herself diana learned more about him the ingrained integrity she would never have associated with a gambler the shrewd sharp brain he had honed on the streets the flashes of vulnerability only serena could bring out in him her brother was a man she discovered who would have held her interest and affection if it hadnt been for the years she couldnt erase of caine she saw little deliberately he had in a very short space of time been witness to too many of her private emotions she could almost accept that hed been there to comfort her when she had wept because he was sensitive and kind but those few moments on the windy beach played in her head too often that kind of passion the depth and suddenness of it held its own special danger she could remember it too easily feel it again too effortlessly if he could stir her by a look or the mere speaking of her name when they were in a room full of people diana was well aware of what would happen if they were alone she made certain it wasnt an issue then there was the anger how easily he strained her temper diana had always been pleased with her ability to control or channel her more violent emotions shed had years of practice concealing fury and frustration from her aunt in order to avoid the inevitable lecture somehow caine could bring her to the boiling point with a casual sentence it wouldnt pay to dwell on it diana told herself as she finished dressing they might run into each other in boston occasionally but that was her turf his too she reminded herself with a shrug she ran a hand over the hip of her gray flannel slacks in any case boston would be professional ground she knew exactly who she was and where she was going shed never been a woman ruled by mood she reminded herself she was much too disciplined for that once she was back in boston back to work she wouldnt be so susceptible to these wide emotional swings she didnt want them she told herself almost violently she didnt know how to deal with them what she wanted what she intended to have again was the calm order shed maintained for herself as long as she was here she felt like something was tearing at her ripping at her threatening her justin and all those memories all those emotions he brought back to her she didnt want to remember or to feel what shed once felt caine was widening an opening she hadnt been aware existed he was playing on vulnerabilities she shouldnt have on passions she didnt want when she was near him she needed needed what she couldnt afford to need on a long breath she fought back the rage and the confusion she could still control it she told herself she would control it and when she was back in boston she would go on with her life just as she had before absently she adjusted the cowl collar of her dark rose sweater she was glad she had come now that she had seen justin face to face she would stop wondering about him and that part of her life would be at rest shed also grown to love serena quickly it wasnt characteristic of her diana admitted she had learned to be very careful about sharing her affections they had always been too easily tapped and she felt too easily rejected for the first time in her life diana knew the pleasure of having someone who could be both family and friend swinging her purse over her shoulder she left the suite shed stop by her sisterinlaws office before she went for a walk on the beach caine invariably went out early and diana had timed her own outings around his there was no point she concluded in tempting fate as she made her way through the casino diana was again impressed by the smart informal decor no glitter or chunky chandeliers from what serena had told her the casino like the rest of the hotel reflected justins taste it was a far cry from the tiny house with a rickety porch they had shared in nevada but then theyd both come a long way from there diana mused she thought of her aunts house on beacon hill with its strict undisturbed elegance polished antiques and gleaming georgian silver softvoiced servants she gave a last glance around the casino silver slot machines and green baize tables croupiers in crisply cut tuxedos the faint wisp of expensive whiskey and tobacco yes theyd both come a long way from a little box house with a parched yellow lawn yet perhaps shed been happier there than at any other time in her life immersed in her own thoughts diana entered the reception area and nearly walked headlong into her brother diana justin took her arm to steady her then dropped his hand to his side she was so lovely he thought and the fleeting polite smile she gave him tied his stomach into knots he wouldnt reach her hed known it in the first instant but seeing her made it more difficult to accept the loss hed lived with all of his adult life good morning justin i thought id stop in to see rena if shes not busy how cool his eyes are she thought and how odd that that one mark of their white heritage should make him seem so wholly indian shes just going over the scheduling when she continued to stare he lifted a brow is something wrong diana i just remembered that story about the settler one of mothers ancestors captured her brow creased as she tried to recall a story told to a child so many years before she ended up staying with him freely isnt it strange that because of her green eyes come out at least once in every generation you have our fathers eyes justin murmured dark secret eyes because she felt herself softening diana straightened her spine i dont remember him she said flatly she thought she heard him sigh but there was no change in his expression tell serena ill be back in a couple of hours i have a meeting aching with guilt afraid of rejection diana held herself very still justin he turned back but she noticed his hand remained on the doorknob i didnt know about the trial about your being in prison im sorry it was a long time ago he said simply you were only a child i stopped being a child when you left me without waiting for his response she turned and went into serenas office diana smiling serena set aside the stack of papers in front of her please tell me youre dying to be entertained so i can get out from under this mountain of paperwork i was afraid id interrupt you there are days i pray for interruptions serena countered then her brows drew together whats wrong diana nothing turning diana faced the twoway glass and looked into the casino id never be able to work with this here id always feel i was in the middle of a party its just a matter of concentrating on two levels justin asked me to tell you hed be out for a couple of hours so thats it serena thought and rose crossing the room she placed her hands on dianas shoulders diana talk to me just because i love justin doesnt mean i wont understand how you feel i shouldnt have come on a long breath diana shook her head i keep finding myself going back remembering things id forgotten for years rena i didnt know id still love him it hurts loving someone has its disadvantages serena gave dianas shoulders a squeeze but if you love justin and give yourself some time i resent him every bit as much diana countered as she turned around maybe more i resent him for every day of all those years i did without him diana dont you see he did without you as well his choice i never had one the emotions began to push at her so that she swung away to pace the room he turned me over to my aunt and went his own way you were six he was sixteen frustrated serena tried to balance her loyalties what did you expect him to do he never wrote never phoned or visited not once as the words shed held inside for years tumbled out diana whirled back i was so sure that if i did everything i was told hed come for me those first few years i was the picture of the model child i minded my manners and studied my lessons and waited but he never came while i was waiting for him he never gave me a thought thats not true serena said heatedly you dont understand no you dont understand diana fired back you dont know what its like to lose everything that belonged to you and have to live on someone elses charity to know every mouthful of food you ate every stitch of clothing on your back had a price who do you think you owe for the food and the clothes diana serena asked evenly oh i know whom i owe diana retorted she never let me forget it in her own discreet way aunt adelaide doesnt believe in generosity without strings generosity serena crossed the room as her temper snapped she doesnt know any more about generosity than you do perhaps not diana agreed with a faint nod but she gave me everything ive ever had justin paid for it all the words came out on a crest of temper she couldnt control he sent her a check every month from the time she took you in until you graduated from harvard the checks might have been small in the beginning serena continued coldly he was living on little more than his wits then and dodging social workers but they got larger hes always been very good at what he does she took his money and you on his word that hed stay out of your life he paid diana with a great deal more than money she seemed to be frozen diana was afraid to move for fear that she would crack and scatter into a dozen irretrievable pieces he paid her her voice was very quiet very disciplined justin sent aunt adelaide money for me he had nothing else to give you damn it diana youre a lawyer what would have happened to you if he hadnt arranged for your aunt to take you in foster homes she thought dully an orphanage on the reservation she could have taken him in too serena gave her a long steady look would she diana pressed her fingers to her eyes she didnt know when the headache had begun but it was pounding mercilessly no with a sigh she dropped them again no later when i was older he could have contacted me he thought you were happy and certainly better off in boston than you would have been trailing around the country with him justin chose his own life its true but he did what he thought was best for you the only way he knew how why didnt he tell me what do you think he wants your gratitude serena demanded impatiently cant you see what kind of a man he is she dragged a hand through her hair he wont thank me for telling you i wouldnt have she added in a calmer tone if you hadnt said you still loved him as her temper cooled serena noted the wide distressed eyes the pale cheeks me frozen expression without question she reached out diana no diana held up a hand to hold her off her voice was frigid her body stiff youve told me the truth serena met her eyes levelly ive no reason to lie a brittle laugh escaped but perhaps she wouldnt have bothered to suppress it how odd when it seems everyone else has all of my life let me take you upstairs fix you a drink no gathering what remained of her selfcontrol diana walked to the door i appreciate you telling me rena she said coolly as she turned the knob it was something i needed to know as the door shut quietly serena dropped into the chair behind her desk oh god she thought rubbing her hand across her forehead how could i have done that with so little compassion remembering the stricken look on dianas face she started to rise then stopped herself no diana needed some time and serena didnt think it would be she diana would want to see in any case catching her bottom lip between her teeth she lifted the phone page caine macgregor please even after an hour had passed diana hadnt found her control her mind ran in circles chased by her emotions everything she had believed was false everything she had was owed to someone shed paid back with cold resentment the only thing that was clear to her now was that she would have to face justin once more and she would have to leave it was easier to prepare for the latter taking out her suitcases diana began to pack slowly very meticulously making the simple chore occupy her mind if she chose she could make it last for the better part of the afternoon perhaps by then the headache would be gone and the sickness deep in her stomach would have eased perhaps by then she wouldnt feel so utterly lost at first she ignored the knocking at her door then when it continued she reluctantly went to answer caine diana stood in the opening showing clearly he wasnt welcome diana he said in the same tone as he scanned her face seeing that her eyes were composed and dry he moved forward until she was forced to give way im busy at the moment dont let me stop you he said agreeably as he wandered to the window ive always liked the view from this room by all means enjoy it then turning on her heel she walked back into the bedroom while she battled annoyance diana continued to pack change your plans caine asked as he leaned against the doorjamb obviously diana folded a sweater and carefully laid it in the suitcase rena must have told you about our talk this morning she said shed upset you diana found it more difficult to keep her hands relaxed as she folded a blouse youve known all along she said dispassionately you knew that justin was responsible for my room and board and education rena talked to me about it after shed written you justin never mentioned it coming into the room caine idly lifted the sleeve of a silk dress shed spread on the bed why are you running diana im not running she tossed the blouse shed been attempting to fold into the suitcase youre packing he pointed out the words are not synonymous diana turned away from him again to give her attention to her packing im sure justinll be more comfortable when im gone why diana threw a tangle of clothes into the first case and slammed the lid back off caine her emotions were fighting to get out he observed and wondered why she felt they had to be suppressed healthier to let them out he thought perhaps it was one more thing he could teach her whom are you angry with im not angry turning to the closet diana dragged clothes off hangers it was all lies incensed she slammed the closet door shut and stood facing him with her hands full of clothes all those years she made me feel as though i depended on her good nature her sense of family obligation she tucked me into pinafores and patentleather shoes when i wanted to be barefoot i wore them because i was terrified of her because i owed her and all the time it was justin her hands gripped at the clothes as frustration overwhelmed her she wouldnt speak of him she insisted i forget the first six years of my life as if theyd never existed i was comanche diana said with sudden fierceness but she allowed me no reminders of it she took my heritage my birthright and still i felt i owed her i learned about my blood in books and museums and had to struggle all my life to remember who i was to remember in secret i paid her and while my brother was alone in prison i was taking ballet classes and eating off sevres caine took a step toward her watching the tears well up and be forced back doesnt it matter that it was what he wanted no diana tossed the clothes aside so that some landed on the bed and others fell to the floor i spent most of my life resenting him and catering to a woman who could never accept me for what i was now i dont even know what that is i thought i paid her for my education by dating the kind of men she approved of by taking the kind of job she could accept balance the scales first then do what you want with a laugh she dragged both hands through her hair but it wasnt her and i dont know who i am anymore is it this she held up a white silk blouse tailored trim elegant i thought i knew where i belonged crumpling the blouse into a ball she hurled it to the floor i know nothing he waited a moment while she stared at it breath heaving why should where the money came from make so much difference it doesnt to someone whos always felt entitled to it caine grabbed her arms and gave her an impatient shake youre being a fool you found out your aunt wasnt completely honest with you and that your brother hadnt forgotten you why does that change who or what you are cant you see i was reared on a lie so now you know the truth he countered what are you going to do with it the fingers that gripped the front of his shirt relaxed abruptly as the anger drained out of her oh god caine ive been so hateful to him so cold the more i wanted to reach out the more i made myself back away he kissed her lightly a quick almost brotherly gesture you wont next time no backing out of his arms she stooped to pick up the clothes that lay on the floor as if it were a symbol she left the crumpled blouse where shed thrown it im going to see him as soon as ive pulled myself together with her back to him diana began to smooth out the skirts and dresses shed wrinkled you seem to be making a habit of being around when i fall apart i dont think i like it im not certain i do either he murmured then found himself turning her to face him vulnerabilitys difficult to resist he ran a thumb down her cheekbone following the movement with his eyes she was soft in the way of a woman but with an underlying toughness he thought she hadnt even begun to tap they were only two of the layers he was determined to explore dont diana whispered the word as his eyes came back to hers in them she saw both desire and decision i make a habit of touching what i mean to have diana he ran both hands up her cheeks combing his fingers through her hair until her face was unframed you stir something in me he told her before his mouth reached hers she could have stopped it as her arms drew him closer diana knew she could have pulled away and ordered him from her room she still had the strength to do it but his lips were so clever so tempting they whispered at hers nibbling kisses promises of endless delight as his hands slid beneath her sweater up the smooth skin of her back he knew how to pleasure a woman perhaps the largest part of his appeal was that caine wanted to give pleasure as much as receive it he knew all the tricks the slow subtle moves of seduction but now with her pliant in his arms her mouth growing hungrier on his he forgot them her scent was clouding his mind until he was crushing her against him with too much need for finesse she was luring him and it was he who was seduced before he knew the rules had changed he heard a moan low with longing and dimly realized the sound had been pulled from him his hands were in her hair again fingers grasping unaware of their strength as he drew in all the hot honeyed tastes of her mouth and she met him fire for fire touch for touch diana knew nothing beyond the tide of sensation the taste and feel of him dominated everything and still wasnt enough her tongue met his again and again deeper intimacy hotter passion but she only hungered for more for the first time she fully understood the power and allure of greed his hands ran down her body lingering at the sides of her breasts before they continued on over her waist and hips he molded her like a sculptor learning the life and feel in his clay and somehow she knew he understood her body as clearly as if she had been naked caine tore his mouth from hers to stare down at her with eyes dark and fiercely intense it seemed this time hed been hit with the unexpected aching desire when hed have chosen careless carefree passion i want you his breath came fast as he smothered her lips again now diana right now it was his anger that excited her and that made her break free i turning away she pushed her hands through her hair im not ready for this not with you damn it diana churning with needs he spun her around no she shoved at him gaining a few inches of distance i dont know whats going on inside of me right now everythings happening too fast but i know i wont be one of caine macgregors women his eyes narrowed but he made no move toward her you dont stop putting people into slots do you im going to put my life back together caine im not going to let you complicate it complicate it he repeated with soft deadly control all right diana you do what you have to do he stepped toward her then but still didnt touch her but boston isnt such a big town and this case is a long way from closed though her throat was dry she spoke evenly is that a threat counselor he smiled then slowly its a promise cupping her chin he gave her a hard brief kiss then turned and left the room diana didnt let out her breath until she heard the door close behind him this was all she needed she thought as she looked at her tangle of halfpacked clothes hed only gotten to her because her emotions were so confused and close to the surface if there was one thing shed learned to do over the years it was to hold her own with men in the courtroom and the bedroom caine macgregor would have been no different if he hadnt been there when shed already been vulnerable she wouldnt think of it now diana closed her eyes and waited for her system to calm if they were to meet again in boston shed be more steady on her feet now she had to face herself and her brother and twenty years of deceit before she could weaken diana hurried out of the suite and down the hall toward the penthouse he might not be back yet she thought as she lifted her hand to knock if hes not she told herself ill go down to his office and wait it has to be now her hand hesitated and nearly dropped i have to do it now straightening her shoulders diana knocked then held her breath justin opened it barechested a shirt slung over his shoulder and his hair still damp from a shower diana were you looking for serena no i her eyes were drawn to the jagged white scar along his ribs painfully she swallowed may i come in of course after closing the door he watched her fingers lace and unlace as she walked to the center of the room would you like some coffee a drink no no nothing she gripped her fingers together again and let them fall in front of her you go ahead sit down diana no i her voice trailed off and she shook her head helplessly no what is it it would be easier if she didnt have to look at him she thought easier if she could be a coward and turn away as she said the words diana kept her eyes on his i want to apologize justin lifted a brow as he started to slip on his shirt what for for everything i havent done or said since i came here he watched her as he buttoned his shirt but his eyes told her nothing he knew how to keep his thoughts to himself she realized that was why he was a gambler and a success at it you have nothing to apologize for diana justin his name came out in a plea as she stepped toward him stopping herself diana turned away a moment im not doing this well strange i make my living stringing the right words together but i just cant find them diana you dont have to do this he wanted to touch her but thinking shed only stiffen he slipped his hands into his pockets i dont expect you to feel anything gathering her courage again she faced him i owe you she said quietly instantly his eyes were remote and unfathomable you owe me nothing everything she corrected justin you should have told me she said with sudden passion i had a right to know to know what he countered coolly stop it she demanded and grabbed his shirtfront with both hands he thought as he looked down at her that there was more of the girl he remembered than hed realized here was the verve and the fire lifting a brow he studied her stubborn furious face you always were a brat he murmured perhaps if you calm down you might tell me whats on your mind stop treating me as though i were still six years old she demanded as her fingers tightened on his shirt it amused him to hear her shout and wiped away the image of the cool sophisticate who had walked back into his life a few days before stop behaving as though you were he advised thereve been things youve wanted to say to me since i walked into this room and found you here say them now diana took a deep breath shed wanted to apologize not to shout and accuse but the control shed practiced so scrupulously for so many years was lost all those years i resented you even tried to hate you for forgetting me i think i understand that he said steadily no shaking her head she dug her fingers into his shirt in frustration tears began to gather and spill but she didnt wipe them away because she didnt feel them how could you when i could never tell you i lost everything so quickly justin lost everyone her voice trembled but she couldnt steady it i thought at first all of you had left because i was too much trouble he made a soft sound and touched her for the first time a hand absently passed through her hair as he had done from time to time so many years before i didnt know how to make you understand you were so small i understand now diana began justin she broke on the word fighting off a sob she had to say it all even if he turned away after she was done everything you did for me was necessary he cut her off and was no longer touching her no more no less justin please she didnt know how to ask for love if she had one lingering fear it was to try and to fail while he watched she struggled for words i want to thank you she managed youve every right to be angry but theres nothing ive done you have to thank me for she bit down on her lip to stop the trembling you felt obligated she murmured no he touched her again just the tips of her hair i loved you her lips parted but there was no sound he was offering her love he wouldnt accept gratitude she wouldnt give him tears instead diana reached for his hand be my friend justin felt something unknot in his stomach slowly he brought her hand to his lips then spreading her fingers he placed her palm to his were blood little sister ive always loved you from today were friends from today she agreed and curled her fingers around his chapter four contents prev next it was bitterly cold in defense diana had the car heater turned up full as she fought her way through sluggish boston traffic oncoming headlights glared off her windshield so that she kept her eyes narrowed and tried not to remember that her ankles were freezing by the time her car warmed up she thought fatalistically shed already be inside the restaurant she considered it a wise move on her part to meet matt fairman for dinner as assistant district attorney he had his ear to the ground in her current professional position she didnt think it prudent to refuse the offer of a casual dinner date even when shed rather be home huddled in a warm robe drinking tea and watching an old movie diana didnt feel she could afford to offend anyone with marts kind of connections or to pass up the opportunity to make a few points on her own behalf in any case she was confident she could handle him on a personal level she always had and he was nice enough she mused shivering inside her coat if you overlooked the fact that his mind worked on two levels the law and women matt was a good lawyer she reminded herself she thought but couldnt be sure that her feet were beginning to thaw pushing this aside she concentrated on matt besides being a good lawyer and a shrewd politician matt had the inside story on every important case being tried or pending in the boston area he was also a gossip if diana wanted it known that she was now out on her own shed do better with a few words in marts ear than a fullpage ad in the boston globe shed resigned from barclay stevens and fitz the week she had returned from atlantic city it had been her way of making a stand against her aunts manipulating diana knew she was taking a chance both financially and professionally and in the two weeks following the break shed had her share of small panic attacks barclay was security not only a steady paycheck but a steady stream well at least a trickle of cases but barclay had been her aunts choice she considered the abrupt termination her first real step toward independence she didnt regret the decision or the twinges of doubt about the future on a bad day she pictured herself sharing office space with another struggling lawyer waiting for the phone to ring hoping to defend someone over a speeding ticket on a good day diana told herself that she was going to fight her way up the ladder rung by rung if diana had a regret it was that shed had so little time with justin once theyd made peace but she had felt it was essential that she get back to boston and sort out her professional life resigning from barclay had to be done while the heat of anger the sting of betrayal was still fresh before diana had thought shed reasoned it out too well it was too easy to be nervous to think of all the consequences instead she convinced herself that she was in a hurry to start carving out a place and a name for herself and she discovered she was in a hurry to start exploring diana blade all the parts of herself she had tucked away for so many years thered been another reason for her leaving atlantic city a few days ahead of schedule caine macgregor diana acknowledged the fact that she had wanted to put some distance between them particularly after that last emotional interlude before she had spoken to justin caine was getting to her a man like caine made an art out of getting to women she mused smooth one minute roughedged and arrogant the next it was a hard combination to resist and she was certain he knew it his reputation with women had been well circulated since his college days circumstances or perhaps fate had dictated that she had heard of his exploits through her years at harvard and then through their mutual associates in boston diana had already known too much of caine macgregor before theyd ever come face to face but itd been then that the problem had jelled if it had been simply a physical attraction diana felt she could have handled it well enough she was used to practicing selfdenial and an affair with caine was out of the question they had too many ties both in business and now in family he was by choice and reputation a womanizer she was by choice and reputation cautious but it was more than desire he kept reaching inside her and stirring emotions she couldnt define she wasnt ready to define them so diana approached the problem logically first by admitting there was one then by removing herself from it now she considered it solved because it was past launching her own practice would take all her time and energy for months to come the prospect unnerved her excited her though shed yet to find suitable office space and her list of clients was still pitifully short shed been alone before she reminded herself alone and without resources this time there wouldnt be an aunt adelaide to trade security for obedience this time shed make her own decisions her own mistakes her own triumphs she knew exactly what she wanted work challenge success all she needed was the chance to find it when diana found a parking space quickly in the crowded lot she considered it an omen things were going to work out according to plan because she refused to allow it to happen any other way the cold bit through her coat as she hurried across the lot a hard icy rain had begun to fall making the asphalt treacherous and oddly beautiful in the glow of streetlamps she ignored her freezing legs by imagining herself already sitting near the fire in the lounge a glass of white wine the soothing notes from the piano the scent of burning wood the rush of warm air as she opened the door brought out a sigh of pure appreciation after checking her coat diana approached the maitre d diana blade has mr fairman arrived yet the maitre d glanced quickly at the list on his podium not as yet ms blade when he does would you tell him im waiting in the lounge diana moved toward the large comfortable room where sofas and armchairs were scattered around a huge stone fireplace the flames were high fed by thick oak logs that burned with a sweet forest smell the lighting was soft just flickering into the shadowy corners while the hum of conversation and laughter lent an atmosphere of a large family party diana spotted an empty chair and though it was farther from the fire than she might have liked she settled down to wait id like to take off my shoes she mused and curl up right here for the next hour just watching the fire one day ill have a house of my own she decided and a room something like this no tidy little parlor like the one on beacon hill with its sedate wellbehaved fire id lie on the floor and listen to it roaring watch the shadows and lights dance on the ceiling with a sigh she snuggled deeper into the chair im getting sentimental she decided with a glance at her watch considering the weather and traffic there was plenty of time for a drink before matt joined her even as diana scanned the room for a waiter one wheeled a small table beside her chair diana glanced at the bottle of champagne as he drew the cork an excellent year she thought with a twinge of regret im sorry youve made a mistake i didnt order that the gentleman would like to buy you a drink ms blade really diana turned her head as the waiter filled a glass when she saw him she felt a flare of excitement she couldnt quite convince herself was annoyance he had after all told her boston wasnt such a big town hello caine diana taking her hand he lifted it to his lips watching her eyes over it may i join you it seems only fair she gestured toward the champagne and two glasses it occurred to her that he looked every bit the smooth sophisticated attorney in the slategray suit then she remembered how natural he had looked in the short leather jacket and jeans it wouldnt be wise to forget the less genteel side of him how are you she asked lifting one of the glasses im fine he sat back studying her over the rim of his glass he remembered her dress as one she had thrown onto the bed in a rage it was thin turquoise silk and glowed against her skin her choice of colors he mused was very much like her choice of scent vibrant and daring diana lifted a brow as he continued to stare at her in silence are you here alone mmhmm sipping she allowed the champagne to linger on her tongue for a moment cold and dry the icy rain outside was already forgotten im meeting matt fairman i suppose you know him yes caine returned with a hint of a smile i know him thinking about working for the da now youve resigned from barclay no i trailing off she narrowed her eyes how did you know i resigned i asked he answered simply what are your plans diana frowned at him a moment then deliberately relaxed i plan to open my own firm when as soon as i take care of a few details have you located an office yet thats one of the details with a frown she ran a finger around the rim of her glass she didnt want to discuss her problems with caine certainly not her doubts diana shrugged as though it were indeed only a detail rather than her entire life teetering in the balance it isnt quite as easy as i anticipated if i want a good location and reasonable rent absently she touched her damp finger to her tongue i have three possibilities to check out tomorrow her unconsciously provocative gesture was arousing caine felt something warm moving through him but checked it thered be other times he promised himself other places i might know of some office space youd be interested in really as she shifted toward him her hair swung to her cheek to be quickly tossed back its on the other side of the river within a couple of t stops from the courthouse he drank noting that the silk clung nicely draping down from snug shoulders hed been wondering for weeks what those strong shoulders would feel like under his hands the trouble was hed also been wondering how she was doing on her own back in boston now that shed learned about her aunt and justin hed wondered particularly after hed heard shed resigned her position the concern he felt worried caine a great deal more man the desire a twostory brownstone he continued its been remodeled to accommodate a reception area conference rooms offices it sounds wonderful i cant think why the agent im going through hasnt mentioned it unless diana thought as she lifted her champagne again it was a matter of the rent being as wonderful as his description she wasnt going to touch the trust fund her aunt had set up for her her aunt she corrected silently or justin in any case she wasnt going to touch a penny she hadnt earned on her own how did you happen to hear of it she asked him i know the landlord caine remarked as he poured more champagne for both of them diana caught something in the tone and studied him thoughtfully you are the landlord very quick he toasted her ignoring the humor in his eyes she sat back crossing her legs if you own such a marvelous building why arent you using it yourself i am that color suits you very well diana she drummed her fingers lightly on the arm of her chair why should i be interested in your office my caseloads packed he told her so briskly businesslike it took her a moment to make the transition im going to have to turn away some clients for the simple reason that i wont be able to give them my best in terms of time and energy she lifted a hand palm up so interested her brows drew together as she took a deep breath in your clients in making them your clients he countered interested she thought shed stand on her head in a snowdrift for the chance at a few choice cases diana resisted the urge to kiss his feet she had to be practical i appreciate it caine but im not interested in forming a partnership at this time neither am i confused she shook her head then what are you i happen to have some space in my building you could rent i have some cases im going to have to refuse or refer i prefer to refer them as yet he hadnt completely worked out why he wanted to refer them to her she was family thats what he told himself he let the stem of the glass twist between his fingers its a simple matter of supply and demand diana was silent for a long moment caine knew that though her eyes had that heavylidded sleepy look she was thinking carefully he almost smiled he rather liked the way she plotted her way from point a to point b by god she was even more beautiful than hed remembered and it had barely been two weeks hed resisted the urge to call her until tonight when hed finally accepted he wasnt going to get her out of his head still hed told himself he was just checking on her one family member to another her answering service had told him where to find her hed come on impulse with the offer hed just made her already forming in his brain if she accepted hed have the advantage and the disadvantage of being around her every day that was business he reminded himself once theyd settled that hed begin on the nights if she was indeed going to begin a discovering of diana blade he wanted to be around for it caine she began bringing her eyes back to his its very tempting but id like to ask you a question sure why settling back he lit a cigarette ive given you the professional one we might add that you and i are inlaws in a manner of speaking your family obligations again she said flatly i prefer the word loyalty he countered her face cleared with a look of surprised consideration before she smiled at him so do i think about it reaching in his jacket pocket he drew out a business card heres the address come by tomorrow and take a look she couldnt afford to turn her nose up at a readymade solution thank you i will diana reached for the card and found her hand caught in his their eyes met his confident hers wary i like the way you look in silk he murmured drinking champagne with just a touch of firelight in your eyes his thumb skimmed over her knuckles and the buzz of conversation around them vanished ive thought about you diana as his voice deepened intimately she felt a thick enervating flow of desire her hand went limp in his ive thought about the way you look he said quietly the way you smell taste the way you feel pressed against me dont the word was a whisper the whisper desire itself dont do this i want to make love to you for hours until your bodys weak and your minds full of me only me dont she said again and pulled her hand free diana sat back quickly her breathing unsteady how could he make her feel as though shed been ravaged with just words her body was throbbing as though his hands already knew it he knew it she reminded herself it was a skill he had one hed honed to perfection this wont work she managed at length no seeing her struggle against need gave him a small thrill of power and of pleasure on the contrary diana its going to work very well diana picked up her champagne again and drank steadier she brought her eyes back to his i need office space and i need clients she took a deep breath wondering if her pulse would ever slow to a normal rate again i also need an atmosphere of professionalism the offer was and is strictly professional counselor he told her with a fresh gleam of humor in his eyes whether you take it or not has nothing to do with other aspects of our relationship nor will it change whats going to happen between us cant you get it through your head i dont want any relationship with you she tossed back i dont intend for anything to happen between us then it shouldnt matter if we work in the same building should it with another smile caine set his card on the table beside her i find it difficult to believe youre afraid of me diana you strike me as a very strongwilled woman her eyes chilled im not afraid of you caine good he said amiably then ill see you tomorrow fairmans just walked in so ill get out of your way rising he brushed her cheek with a friendly kiss enjoy your evening love annoyed diana watched him walk off damn the man for stirring her up snatching his card from the table she ripped it in two the hell with him she told herself he could take his office and his clients and jump in the boston harbor afraid a tiny voice asked her with a sound of frustration diana opened her purse and dropped the pieces of his card inside no she wasnt afraid and she wasnt going to cut off her professional nose because caine macgregor could drain a woman with a few soft words shed go to his office diana vowed and drank the rest of her champagne in one impulsive swallow and if the accommodations suited her shed grab them no one was going to stop her from getting where she was going not even herself in the morning diana checked out two of the addresses given to her by the rental agent the first was a positive no the second a definite maybe instead of going to the third on her list she found herself steering toward the address on caines business card shed treat it exactly as she had treated the other potential offices diana reminded herself she would be objective consider the space and location the rent and the condition of the building she couldnt afford to let the fact that it was caines building influence her one way or the other with any luck caine would be out of the office and his secretary would show her around the decision diana thought would come more easily without him there she loved it the moment she saw it the building was rather narrow old and beautifully preserved it had the quiet elegance found in boston snuggled in the midst of steelandglass skyscrapers there were patches of snow on the lawn but the tiny parking area beside it was scraped clean pale gray smoke puffed out of the chimney as she started up the flagstone walk diana glanced around there was a naked oak standing sentinel in the yard a long trim hedge separating yard from sidewalk the courthouse was less than a mile away so far diana reflected its too good to be true the door was thick and carved beside it was a discreet brass plaque caine macgregor attorney at law it wasnt difficult for her to imagine a similar plaque below it with her name scrolled back up diana she warned herself you havent even seen the inside yet still as she opened the door she remembered caines comment a few weeks before about fate the reception area was done in rose and ivory duncan phyfe tables flanked a carved arm settee diana caught the scent of fresh flowers from the mix of blooms in a thin cutglass vase the floor was hardwood gleaming and bare except for a faded aubusson carpet the mantelpiece was pink grained marble topped by a long oval minor below it a fire crackled eagerly style diana thought instantly caine macgregor had style behind a satinwood desk a roundfaced middleaged woman had a phone tucked between her shoulder and ear as she pounded the keys of a typewriter the surface of the desk was buried under stacks of files scraps of paper and legal pads she gave diana a wide smile then hardly breaking rhythm gestured toward the settee mr macgregors schedule is filled through next wednesday she said into the phone in a surprisingly girlish voice i can give you an appointment thursday afternoon she stopped typing long enough to dig a thick date book out from under the wreckage of her desk onefifteen she continued shuffling more papers until she found the stub of a pencil yes mrs patterson thats his first free slot onefifteen on thursday then yes ill get back to you if he has a cancellation she scribbled in the book pushed it aside then began typing again with a faint lift of brow at the procedure diana slipped out of her coat and laid it on the arm of the settee yes ill be sure to tell him goodbye mrs patterson the secretary paused in her typing long enough to replace the receiver and smile at diana good afternoon may i help you im diana blade oh yes the woman cut into dianas explanation and rose revealing that the rest of her body was as round as her face mr macgregor said you might be dropping by today im lucy robinson how do you do diana found her hand taken for a firm brisk shake you seem to be very busy diana began perhaps it would be better if i made an appointment nonsense lucy gave her a maternal pat on the arm mr macgregors with a client but he gave me orders to show you around ill take you upstairs youll want to see your office first before diana could explain that it wasnt her office yet lucy was moving into the hall toward a staircase shed left her typewriter on diana noticed and wondered if she should mention it mrs robinson now you just call me lucy were not formal here its more like family family diana thought with something like a sigh there seemed to be no getting away from it the staircase rose uncarpeted and without a curve the mahogany rail gleamed like satin thinking of the desk in the reception room diana decided the housekeeping wasnt lucys province the woman glided up the stairs like a ship in full sail a hairpin was dangling from the knot at the back of her neck theres a conference room downstairs and a small kitchen lucy was saying therere plenty of times we dont get out of here for lunch so its handy can you cook ahnot very well too bad lucy paused at the top of the stairs neither caine nor i are anything to rave about in the kitchen she gave diana a long look that was as friendly as it was assessing he didnt tell me you were so pretty youre a connection of his arent you diana took a moment to work out the conversation i suppose you could say so my brother married his sister knew it was something like that lucy said with a nod caines office is through there used to be the master bedroom yours is just down the hall here with a glance at the door they passed diana continued down the hall its a lovely house she commented caine doesnt seem to have made too many changes in the structure to turn it into offices only took a couple of walls out lucy agreed he said hed had enough of working in four dull walls and brown carpeting i say when a body spends most of their day in a place it ought to be comfortable mmmm diana thought about her cubbyhole at barclay stevens and fitz the carpet had been brown there too she remembered have you worked for caine long i worked for him when he was states attorney lucy told her when he asked me if i wanted to work for him in his private practice i packed up my desk and went here you are lucy pushed open a door then stepped back to let diana enter it was too perfect diana thought as she walked into the empty room small but not cramped with two sashed windows that faced east her heels echoed on the wood floor bouncing to the high ceiling as she crossed to a neat white marble hearth the wallpaper was silk faded a bit but still beautiful she could easily see the room furnished with a trim federal desk a few comfortable chairs perhaps a small victorian love seat with a low table she could have a shelf on the north wall for her law books if she wanted to begin her practice with style she would never find anything more appropriate im surprised caine hasnt found a use for this room diana thought aloud oh he had it furnished for a while hed stay here instead of going home when he was working late lucy discovered the pin trailing onto her neck and shoved it back into place then he decided it was getting too easy to spend his life here caines dedicated but hes not obsessed i see the law librarys up here lucy went on thats where he had the walls taken out theres a powder room downstairs and a full bath on this floor it has the original porcelain taps oops theres my phone you just prowl around before diana could say a word she was bustling back down the hall lucy diana decided was nothing like the sharp young secretary she had shared with two other attorneys at barclay there everything had been done with quiet unshakable efficiency and the building had had all the charm of a tomb an aristocratic tomb diana reflected but a crypt was a crypt this she thought as she glanced at the faded wallpaper again was much more to her taste clients could relax here assured of a personal touch what few clients she could claim she added with a rueful smile still the location and the atmosphere would add to her caseload as much as her skill would when you were selling something it paid to sell it with flair mulling over the angles diana went back into the hall and wandered surely the mahogany wainscoting was the original she reflected no one paneled in mahogany any longer opening a door at random she found caines law library barclays was no more extensive she thought with a quick flash of professional interest a long table dominated the center of the room on which a few books were stacked going to one that was left open diana saw it was marked state v sylvan murder one diana mused recalling the case from her studies at harvard it had been a volatile splashy affair in the late seventies national publicity packed courtrooms and a long emotional trial just what she wondered was caine working on that he was digging for precedents here intrigued she bent over the book and began to read when caine came to the doorway ten minutes later she was engrossed he didnt speak for a moment realizing that it was the first time he had seen her completely selfabsorbed there was the faintest line of concentration between her brows and her lips were slightly parted shed rested both palms on the table as shed leaned over so that the jacket of her suit a deep vivid red this time fit snugly over her back her hair was tucked behind her ear revealing round flutededged earrings of etched gold he could picture her in court in that outfit or at an elegant formal tea he knew when he stepped closer that her scent would be there making hundreds of dark promises cautious he dipped his hands into his pockets and remained where he was interesting reading dianas head jerked up at his voice but she straightened slowly state versus sylvan she tapped the open book with a finger a fascinating case the defense pulled everything but a rabbit out of its hat over the threemonth trial olearys a hell of a defense attorney if a bit flashy for some tastes leaning against the jamb he studied her the light coming in the window at her back slanted across the hands that still rested on the table still after two appeals he lost she pointed out his client was guilty the prosecution put together a very carefully structured case diana ran a fingertip down the opened book do you have a similar one or is this just casual reading he smiled for the first time virginia day he said then waited for her reaction the sleepy look in her eyes was replaced by quick interest youre defending her thats right diana knew the story from scraps in the news and speculation from other attorneys a society murder unfaithful husband jealous wife a small deadly revolver you dont pick easy ones do you he only gave her a shrug for an answer lucy tells me she showed you the office yes i saw evidence of her untidiness and disorganization diana began with a faint smile as well as an almost terrifying efficiency the only thing i didnt catch was her addiction to soaps she has a tape machine at home with a timer diana laughed turning toward him fully youre joking no unless youve got the better part of an hour i wouldnt ask her about any plots with a chuckle she crossed toward him your building is very impressive caine im forced to admit its better than anything else ive looked at forced to he countered discovering hed been right about her scent id half hoped that it would be totally unsuitable so that i wouldnt have to make a decision did you buy the furniture yourself yes ive a weakness for auctions and antique shops and then i dont trust anyone elses judgment when it comes to something i have to live with very sensible my aunt had her home redecorated professionally every three years it never reflected anything tell me diana steepled her fingers pressing them against her bottom lip a moment if i dont take the office space will you lease it out anyway not necessarily again he found it almost sinful that such hands should be unadorned im not willing to spend so much time in the same place with someone im not sure is compatible her brow lifted in amusement and you think you and i are compatible i think you and i will deal with each other well enough diana why dont we go into the office and sit down as they started up the hall caine glanced at her i can have lucy bring up some coffee if youd like no im fine and she has more than enough to do his office was large but craftily dominated by an antique oak desk like lucys it was loaded with files and pads but it reflected a scrupulous organization that hers lacked obviously he hadnt been exaggerating about his workload the fire was lit here too burning greedily as though hed just added fresh logs from the woodbox beside it rather than black framed degrees caine had hung a pair of vivid watercolors that picked up the faded tints in the wallpaper diana took one long look around before she chose a sheridan chair very nice she commented as he took the chair next to her i wont keep you caine according to lucy your schedules full through next week i think i can squeeze in a few minutes drawing out a cigarette he allowed his shoulders to relax against the back of the chair hed just spent an hour with a hysterical client who was too close to jumping bail for comfort it had taken caine threequarters of that time to calm him down since you dont find the accommodations unsuitable it seems you have that decision to make after all yes diana felt the warmth from the fire reach out to her and sighed id like to take it caine of course theres the matter of terms blowing out a stream of smoke he named an amount that was within her budget but stiff enough to absolve her feelings of accepting charity lucys agreeable to taking on your work until youre settled then itll be between you and her if you want to continue that way or hire your own secretary diana digested this with a nod then took the next steps all right i think we can come to an agreement as to the matter of your referring clients to me im not sure im comfortable with that why not he countered werent you hoping for a little quick advertisement by having dinner with fairman last night diana glared at him a moment smoldered then settled back i dont particularly like the way you put it but yes thats a bit different from what youre talking about if you dont want them ill send them to someone else he said simply at the moment there are two id like to take but simply cant the day case alone is going to require hundreds of hours she itched to ask for details but made herself wait why would you refer them to me you dont know if im any good or not on the contrary i checked you out you what he smiled briefly at her indignation you wouldnt expect me to recommend clients to an attorney unless i knew they were competent would you you cant have it both ways diana she let out a frustrated breath shed certainly backed herself into that corner no all right what two cases am i considering the first is a rape charge the kids nineteen hothead bad reputation he claims the girl was willing several times in fact then theyd had a blowup the next thing he knew he was being booked the second is a divorce case the wifes the plaintiff when she came in here her left eye was swollen closed and she was going to require extensive dental surgery wifebeating diana said with a surge of disgust apparently according to her its been going on for some time but shes reached her threshold hes countersuing her on desertion charges he has the power because he has the money and as yet shes reluctant to charge him formally with battery its going to be a mess never let it be said youre tossing me anything simple she murmured id like to talk to them both next week good youll draw up the contract for the lease then ill have it ready for you monday ill let you get back to work with a smile she rose it appears ill have to buy myself a desk diana saved the moment of excitement of anticipation for later when she was alone thank you caine she added extending her hand i do appreciate you giving me first shot at this ill take the gratitude now you might not feel so amenable after youve talked to these two people standing he accepted her hand business concluded he stated now lifting a finger caine toyed with the wide bow of her blouse have dinner with me tonight how easily his voice could take on that soft ultimate tone she thought feeling her blood heat in instant response i think it would be much wiser if we concentrated on the business caine at the appropriate time he murmured she had a preference for silk he mused as he ran a fingertip over the knot in the bow soft materials flashy colors my mind begins to move toward other things on cold windy friday nights theres a little place in the back bay where the fish is fresh and the cheese isnt in a corner theres a table the light barely reaches you can smell the candle wax and never see anyone you know he gently traced the line of her earlobe idly fingering the gold she wore there id like to take you drink wine hear you laugh then later id take you home and light the fire slowly his eyes skimmed over her face lingering on each feature yes hed like to do all those things and watch the changes in those features the softening the opening and the yielding he was going to do those things he vowed as something knotted in his stomach he understood women didnt he and what they looked for in a lover id make love to you until the fire was only embers hed stepped closer but she hadnt noticed her unsteady breath feathered over his lips he painted a picture with his words that she could see much too clearly hed be a terrifying lover the kind women longed for even knowing they might not survive the experience and she wanted him more than she had known she could ever want a man wanted him knowing she would just be one more woman on his list it was this that had her backing away no but the denial wasnt as strong as she would have wished that isnt what i want it is he corrected caine pulled her into his arms and kissed her with an anger his quiet words had hidden deeper and deeper he drove her ripping response from her exploiting the panicked excitement that had her clinging even while she told herself to pull away with one hand he gripped her hair drawing her head back so that he could have his fill of her he thought of what separated her skin from his hands thin wool and fragile silk the struggle built rapidly almost painfully to concentrate on her mouth alone and prevent his hands from pulling aside the trim tailored suit to find her the days that he had gone without touching her crowded in on him pushing him far beyond gentleness he knew what it was to want a woman but not to want one with a force that bordered on violence it wasnt his way yet he pulled her closer and ravaged her mouth seemed fused to his ignoring her mental commands to break free part of her a part that seemed to be growing stronger was driving her to submit and more to demand wild passionate thoughts spun in her head threatening to unleash something that might never be completely tamed again it was tempting so tempting to let it free to let it sweep her wherever the current ran then with a sound that was as much from fear as anger diana yanked out of his arms no she said again and her voice rose with the words im telling you this is not what i want caines eyes lit with something closer to fury than desire but his voice was calm enough he wasnt used to having his desire mixed with anger and struggled to find his normal balance it is he repeated but i can wait a bit longer for you to admit it youll have a long wait she snapped thensnatched up her purse with a hand that wasnt steady you have the papers ready monday and ill have a check if you cant handle things that way then well forget it caine said nothing as she stormed out didnt flinch as the sound of the slamming door vibrated through the room a log broke apart and fell with a shower of sparks he needed a moment to get a firm grip on his temper he hadnt meant to lose it indeed he had promised himself he wouldnt hed been in tense courtrooms with the opposing attorney baiting him hed sat in grim conference rooms at the state penitentiary with clients cursing him and hed had perfect control diana could obliterate it with a word a look something unexpected was happening he wasnt precisely certain what it was if he were smart caine mused as his brain started to clear again hed do exactly as she demanded they could be colleagues discuss current cases dissect points of law and complain about judges but he wasnt smart caine decided waiting for the need that clawed in his stomach to ease he was going to have her and it wasnt going to be as long a wait as she thought chapter five contents prev next why would anyone be hammering in the middle of the night diana asked herself as she pulled the covers over her head the sound of thudding continued to come through loud and clear she buried her face under her pillow as she promised herself she was going to lodge a complaint with the management it took less than thirty seconds for her to realize she had to give up or suffocate surfacing diana gave a disgusted sigh and opened her eyes seventhirty she thought groggily as she glanced at the clock not the middle of the night but close enough on a saturday morning and it wasnt hammering she realized but someone knocking on her door muttering curses under her breath she rose and tugged on a robe all right she shouted belting the robe as she went im coming diana pulled open the door so that it hit the security chain with a thud hi caine grinned through the crack did i wake you after one fulminating glare diana slammed the door in his face there was a moments consideration then she unlatched the chain hed just start pounding again what do you want she demanded as she yanked the door open its nice to see you too caine brushed a brief kiss over her lips before he walked by her clamping her teeth together diana shut the door and leaned back against it do you know what time it is sure its seven thirtyfive he announced after checking his watch got any coffee no diana tightened the belt of her robe with a jerk its seven thirtyfive on saturday morning she added meaningfully mmhmm he agreed in an absent murmur as he poked around the room it was far from finished diana was being very particular in furnishing what she considered her first real home the first at least that no one could take away from her there was an oriental rug shed bargained for in a secondhand store an elegant rococo sofa that had taken a huge bite out of her savings and a french provincial coffee table she had refinished herself in the basement of the apartment building her one good painting had been bought only that fall in paris caine slipped his hands into the pockets of his jeans as he studied these and the few other pieces shed chosen they were like her classy individual and carefully placed i like it he said at length youre putting a lot of yourself into this place shall i tell you just what your approval means to me diana asked not bothering to smother a yawn hmm touchy this morning he murmured giving her a brief glance three times on the brief trip from his place to hers hed asked himself what the hell he was doing hed gotten three different answers so hed stopped asking why dont i make that coffee youre not staying diana began as he headed for the kitchen ill be glad to no problem caine be patient she ordered herself dont lose your temper i was sleeping some people like to sleep late on saturdays throws your whole system off he told her as he began to root through cupboards thats why so many people have to drag themselves out of bed on mondays he found a can of coffee and began to measure it out then just as theyre getting the hang of it again around comes saturday and they blow it thats very profound im sure she said as sarcastically as her groggy brain would allow i dont mind dragging myself out of bed on mondays maybe i even like dragging myself out of bed on mondays she ran a frustrated hand through her sleeptumbled hair seventhirty in the morning was a perfect time to lose your temper diana concluded what the hell are you doing here making coffee unless youre hungry caine sent her an easy amiable grin id fix breakfast but about the best i can do is scramble eggs no i dont want any breakfast diana retorted rudely then rubbed her fingers over her eyes i cant believe im standing here having this ridiculous conversation itll make more sense after youve had your coffee after switching the pot on caine turned back to her she was even lovelier now he thought with her hair mussed and the faint flush of sleep still in her cheeks her mouth would be warm and soft i think ive already told you once that youre beautiful in the mornings oh sure she muttered on a frustrated breath really he cupped her chin in his hand as she continued to glare at him it probably has something to do with your skin with his thumb he traced just under her jawline there was sweetness there and strength he couldnt resist trying to draw out both tell me do you use some mystical indian potion i dont know any mystical indian potions she managed as his thumb swept slowly back and forth and your coffees ready is it caine turned and poured a cup are you having any i might as well since its obvious im not getting any more sleep gracelessly she pulled open the refrigerator and found the milk smiling at her back caine took his cup into the living room hed have to remember saturday mornings the next time he wanted to have her at a disadvantage we have nearly the same view he told her my apartments only about a block away isnt that handy fate he countered as he took a seat on the sofa and made himself at home fantastic isnt it one day very soon im going to tell you what you can do with that fate of yours she took the seat beside him resting her elbow on the arm of the sofa and her head on her open palm letting her lashes lower she yawned again not bothering to conceal a grin caine settled back lucy has the draft of the lease agreement she should have it ready early monday afternoon fine i intend to do some shopping today with luck i can have a few things delivered early in the week the coffee was hot and no better than she made herself diana resented knowing shed be fully awake before shed half finished it good idea ill go with you where shopping i appreciate the offer but its not necessary im sure you have other things to do not really then he laughed leaning over to tug on her hair why is it i find it irresistible when you tell me to go to hell so politely she gave him a long cool stare i have absolutely no idea i like spending time with you diana at ease caine sat back again but his eyes never left hers why do you have such a difficult time accepting that i dont that is i do but hes doing it to me again she realized and frowned into her coffee theres three reasons he continued settling back were family were associates caine paused watching her continue to frown in consideration and im attracted to you he said simply not just that rather fascinating face but to all the quirks in your mind i dont have a quirky mind she objected then rose stuffing her hands in her pockets she paced to the window she could accept the associates she was trying to accept the family without completely understanding it but you confuse me with a sudden passion that surprised them both diana whirled back i dont want to be confused i want to know exactly what im doing why im doing it how im doing it when im around you for too long theres all these blank spots in my head she gestured then dropped her hand again damn it caine i cant afford to have you popping up and making me forget things every time i start to work them out intrigued by the abrupt burst of temper he watched her calmly then took a slow sip of coffee have you ever considered letting things work themselves out no she shook her head i let my life drift for too many years not anymore in other words he set down his coffee and rose eyeing her thoughtfully because of a set of circumstances you couldnt avoid youre going to shut yourself off from whatever feelings or desires you have for me because they dont suit your current plans yes all right knowing nothing was coming out as she wanted it to diana pulled a hand through her hair all right she repeated with a nod thats close enough thats a very weak case counselor caine commented as he walked to her i could poke all sorts of interesting holes in it im not interested in your crossexamination she began we could settle out of court caine suggested moving closer then theres your reputation she added deliberately stepping back youve hardly kept a low profile in your pursuit of women youll never get a conviction on circumstantial evidence and hearsay he lifted his hands to her shoulders massaging gently youve got to build your case on something stronger or softly he brushed one cheek then the other with his lips you might try trusting me she felt the weakness creeping into her and forced herself to concentrate i might also try jumping out the window either way i risk a few broken bones wishing he had some defense against vulnerability caine drew away hed meant what hed said he wanted her to trust him even though he wasnt sure he could trust himself you want promises guarantees i cant give them to you diana then again he added you cant give them to me either its easier for you she began but he stopped her with a shake of his head why i dont know she let out a long weary breath it just seems it should be he clamped down on the need to just gather her into his arms until shed forgotten she had doubts forgotten to be logical with an effort he kept his hands gentle he wasnt certain what his own motivations were perhaps hed never had to dissect them before he knew he wanted to introduce her to new things excitement fun passions the knight beating down the walls for the captured princess caine thought ruefully in any case he could work out the reasons tomorrow look get dressed spend the day with me the circumstances when we met werent the best why dont we take a little time and see what else we can come up with im not sure i want to know what else we can come up with she muttered did justin really get all the gambling blood diana his eyes were so appealing when he smiled she felt herself weakening again i dont know i used to think so whats a lawyer but a gambler figuring odds on the law caine countered the tension was easing out of her shoulders so he resisted the need to do any more than keep his hands light and friendly the problem might be im not thinking like a lawyer at the moment then relaxing fully she smiled if i were i could probably cite several precedents that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that i should toss you out the door and go back to bed caine considered this a moment then gave a sober nod we could probably argue that particular point of law for several hours undoubtedly diana ill be perfectly honest still smiling he twisted a lock of her hair around his finger if you dont get dressed soon im going to satisfy my curiosity and find out just what you have on under that robe she lifted a brow is that so of course we could negotiate caine rah the lapel through his thumb and forefinger but i feel obligated to warn you im fully prepared to move on this point in the very near future since you put it that way im going to take a shower fine ill just finish off the coffee caine watched her walk away letting his eyes roam down to where the robe swung across her hips diana just what do you have on under that robe she sent him a bland look over her shoulders its nothing she said nothing at all i thought as much caine murmured as the door shut behind her laughing diana pushed open the door of the shop i cant believe you did that i just cant believe it caine followed her in shutting out the cold it was a simple matter of truth he said mildly i did see that identical lamp downtown twenty dollars cheaper but did you have to tell that woman in front of the shopkeeper caine shrugged hed be wiser to keep his prices competitive he was about to have apoplexy diana remembered with another smothered chuckle id have died of embarrassment if i hadnt been concentrating so hard on not laughing ill never be able to go in there again i wouldnt until he lowers his prices shaking back her hair she narrowed her eyes to study him theres a great deal more scot in you than shows on the surface thanks lets look around diana began to browse through the antique shop toying with a collection of pewter loitering near a display of cut glass its really your fault that weve been shopping for over an hour and ive bought nothing i rather liked that comer chair she mused we can go back if you dont find anything you like better look here hed found a set of dueling pistols in a display case highland pistols caine reflected as he crouched down for a closer look yes he was sure of it noting the brass stock the butt was designed as a rams horn and there was celtic strapwork inlaid with silver eighteenth century he calculated seeing that the locks of both pistols were on the right his father would love them do you collect that sort of thing diana asked intrigued enough to stoop beside him mmm my father theyre exquisite arent they caine twisted his head giving diana as concentrated a look as hed given the pistols not many women would look at a weapon in that way she moved her shoulders theyre part of life arent they and youll remember my people were warriors she met his eyes now as yours were with a half smile she gave her attention to the guns again of course you wouldnt find a comanche with elegant pistols like these do you know what make they are theyre scottish he murmured finding himself more fascinated by her than ever that figures rising diana gave him an arch look and i suppose youll buy them and ill end up going home emptyhanded she noticed a clerk coming their way while youre haggling over the price im going to look around she left him to stroll toward the other end of the shop who would have thought shed enjoy spending her saturday poking through stores who would have thought shed begin to think of caine macgregor as both a pleasant companion and a friend shaking her head diana ran a finger over the surface of a highboy the more she was around him the easier it became to be herself there was no need to be diana blade of beacon hill oh she was tired of that socially correct polite woman yet twenty years of training had left its mark how long would it be before she wasnt surprised to hear herself shouting a lady never raises her voice diana gave a wistful sigh shed worked hard to be a lady her aunts conception of a lady all the strict little rules had been drummed into her head even when she had questioned them diana had obeyed them rebelling sporadically and she admitted discreetly those secret jaunts she had taken had been her safety valve keeping passions and emotions under control you cant change a way of life overnight diana reminded herself but she was making progress perhaps her drive to succeed in her profession was another expression of the same rebellion she couldnt wouldnt be some threepiecesuited attorney who only drew up contracts and wills she wanted more than that in court she could let some of her passion slip through there it was accepted even considered eloquent with words she could fight for what she believed the law had always fascinated her it was broad and narrow succinct and nebulous yet she had always found it solid despite its infinite angles she needed to succeed with it wanted the excitement the pressure and the glory of criminal law her mind came full circle back to caine she wanted him too diana would admit it for a moment while he was a safe distance away he made her feel need whether she wanted to or not that sharp sweet pleasure he could bring tempted her more each time perhaps that was one of the reasons she fought against it it was frightening not to have a choice diana knew that better than most shed known desire before and pleasure but shed always remained clearheaded not with caine and thats why she promised herself shed be careful very careful she glanced back to see him examining one of the pistols strange that the old beautiful weapon would look so right in his hands there was something of the aristocracy about him part scholar part wolf diana gave a quick shake of her head at the thought she was becoming fanciful yet studying him she thought she could see it there was the intelligence in his eyes and the danger there was that lean celtic face with a mouth that promised to be fierce or gentle depending on his whim a century ago he would have fought his duels with the pistols instead of words she realized and he would have won just as consistently there was something not quite civilized under the polish his wealth and upbringing had given him diana recognized it because it was as true for herself as for caine the combination might equal something more savage than either of them bargained for caine held the gun at arms length testing its weight his eyes shifted and locked on hers cool dangerous as the look held diana felt the needs building experienced the violent now familiar tugofwar between intellect and emotion the battle seemed longer this time with the result less certain by the time her intellect took control again she was shaken and weak just as if his mouth had been on hers with her body at last knowing the pleasure of his hands be very careful diana reminded herself and turned away again still idly browsing she examined a small upholstered chair a ladys chair she mused with its pale blue brocade still in excellent shape it had possibilities she thought as she turned over its discreet price tag after noting the amount diana decided it had definite possibilities as she straightened to look for a clerk she saw the desk that was it perfect with a low pleased sigh she began to examine it trim elegant cherry the desk had both the size and the lines shed hoped to find the border of the top was carved with cockleshells frivolous enough to make her smile as she ran a fingertip over them a far cry from the twentiethcentury pine that was barclays standard for his staff on the drawers were ornate brass pulls and inside the scent of cherrywood lingered mine she thought quickly possessively already diana could see it facing the fireplace in her office hopefully laden with files you found it i see beaming diana grabbed caines arm its wonderful isnt it exactly what i pictured her grip tightened as her other hand came to his ive got to have it he found it rather sweet that the practical diana blade would lose her head over a piece of furniture lacing his fingers with hers caine glanced down at the price tag on the comer of the desk then back into her excited eyes try not to look so eager he told her dryly here comes the clerk but i trust me bending his head he gave her a quick kiss sure its pretty love he began in a different tone but you have to be practical cain may i be of some assistance caine turned a friendly smile on the clerk who had shown him the pistols the lady likes the desk he gave a fractional shake of his head but an exquisite piece the clerk began turning to diana he hadnt been selling for over ten years without knowing whom to play to just look at this carving no one does work like this anymore its exactly what ive been looking for she beamed at him all goodwill he could already see her writing out the check diana caine slipped his arm around her shoulder squeezing a bit harder than necessary before she could protest he brushed a kiss over her temple were going to need several other pieces remember the desk is very nice but so was the other one we looked at she opened her mouth to tell him impatiently that they hadnt looked at any other then caught the gleam in his eyes well yes but i do like this one diana trailed off struck with inspiration and that chair there she went on pointing at the little blue brocade another excellent choice madam the clerk began to think it would be a wonderful morning after all so right for a lady as the desk is diana sighed letting her finger run lovingly over the desk surface he better know what hes doing she thought grimly and shot a look at caine with a smile he patted her shoulder but youll need a chair for the desk as well and the right lamp youd almost be able to buy both of these with the difference in price between this desk and the other youre right it took effort but diana gave the clerk an apologetic smile im furnishing my office you see and there are so many things i need i understand perfectly he began to wonder if he would lose the sale of the pistols as well the pistols the desk two chairs and a lamp we like to place the right furniture with the right people he told her rather pompously why dont you let me speak to the manager im sure we could come to an agreement in terms well caine pinched her arm to prevent her from agreeing too quickly diana barely restrained herself from jabbing him with her elbow it wont hurt to listen darling she said in sweet tones that werent reflected in her eyes i suppose youre right caine gave her a smile as he met the killing look well just look at those lamps over there while youre talking to your supervisor he told the clerk if you lose that desk for me diana said under her breath as the clerk hurried toward the rear of the store ill murder you im going to save you ten percent he said easily and youre going to buy me lunch cain stopped in front of a slim brass lamp with a fluted frosted shade theyll be more inclined to negotiate if they think they have to sell both of us what do you think of this he asked running a hand down the base of the lamp it goes nicely with the desk yes its lovely she toyed with the delicate shade then looked up at him you enjoy haggling dont you its in the blood my father makes his living at it and very well too diana murmured i warn you she added im going to have that desk whether he bargains or not did you want the chair too or were you making it up yes i want it diana laughed despite herself im not as devious as you stick around youll learn well the clerk came up behind them glowing with triumph i think we can come to very amicable terms fifteen minutes later diana was outside flushed with cold and pleasure how did you know hed take off ten percent experience caine claimed simply as he took her hand i can see im going to shop with an entirely different outlook from now on she tossed her hair back and grinned at him thank you for the lamp it was sweet of you to buy it for me and i suppose the pistols will go to your father mmm he has a birthday coming up you havent bought a thing for yourself she pointed out isnt there anything you want yes turning he gathered her into his arms pressing his mouth to hers the sidewalk was busy with shoppers who made their way around them with raised brows or muffled laughter diana noticed nothing the air was sharp with winter stinging her cheeks and ruffling her hair she never felt it two women stopped to stare a moment one of them sighed and said isnt that lovely diana didnt hear her hands had gone to his face and through the thin leather of her gloves she could feel the line of bone the shape of jaw a wolf she thought again you never know when theyll spring priceless caine murmured drawing her away on a long audible breath diana glanced around you enjoy having people stare dont you laughing he clasped her hands again and began to walk it really wasnt an issue how about lunch she searched for annoyance but couldnt find it i suppose i owe you that you certainly do theres a place around the corner charleys diana exclaimed surprised as caine pulled her toward the door great chili yes i know i didnt discover it until i was in college they shared too many tastes diana thought uncomfortably as they went inside to join the warmth and the noise seeing her frown caine ran a hand through her windblown hair dont you like it here yes ive always liked it here she shook her head quickly pushing away the discomfort i was thinking of something else with the mood dispelled she gave him a smile how do you like your chili hot laughing diana shrugged out of her coat so do i so it stops just short of cauterizing my vocal chords the atmosphere was pure victoriana with its giltedged portraits and long brassrailed bar shed stopped in from time to time during her college years knowing she wouldnt run into her aunt or any of adelaides closer friends they preferred the subdued elegance of the ritz cafe as she took her seat across from caine a group at the bar began to sing lustily how about some wine reaching across the table he took her hands itll warm you up mmm something red and heavy she allowed her hands to stay in his as he ordered shed enjoy his company the closeness for the afternoon monday morning was soon enough to get back to business tell me about your family she asked abruptly the macgregors have an almost mythical reputation in boston caine chuckled as he traced a finger over the back of her hand i suppose youll have to meet the rest of them yourself to be certain how much was fact and how much was fiction my fathers a huge redheaded scot whod probably still fight a campbell to the death he can drink a fifth of whiskey without blinking an eye but he hides his cigars from my mother he calls each one of us regularly to nag for our mothers sake he claims about our not increasing the macgregor line your mother longs to bounce a grandchild on her knee caine quoted with a perfect scottish burr diana laughed as the wine was brought to the table and what does your mother think about it my mother is a very relaxed kind of person almost a negative of my father he blusters she comments and in their own ways theyre both amazingly efficient unconsciously he began to toy with the thin gold bracelet she wore on her wrist diana acknowledged then tried to ignore as she had once before the pleasure of having his hard fingers brush against her skin ive only seen her lose that inherent serenity of hers a couple of times caine continued half to himself once i happened to be in the hospital when she lost a patient id always thought she was strictly professional almost cold about her work after that i realized she simply never brought it home with her then when rena was kidnapped seeing the change in his eyes diana tightened her fingers on his that must have been hell for all of you those hours of waiting not knowing if she was all right yeah caine shook off the lingering anger and lifted his glass then theres alan hes more like my mother very calm patient even after growing up with him im always surprised when he loses his temper you forget he has one until it rips out and knocks you down diana let the wine run warm through her system as she watched him did you fight with him often enough he said with a nod more with rena i suppose were closer in temperament and he murmured reminiscently she has a hell of a right cross diana caught the hint of pride in his voice and stared you didnt box with her did you caine grinned at the astonishment in her tone as he poured more wine there were times i wanted to do more than just defend myself and by god there were times she deserved to be knocked cold his grin widened as diana continued to stare at him with a mixture of horror and fascination no i never slugged her but that was mostly because she was nearly four years younger and quite a bit smaller i really didnt consider rena as a girl until she was about fourteen and that he murmured was quite a surprise he loves them all diana mused and it seems so easy for him you had a happy childhood she commented then looked down at her wine i was jealous about that before you know it was strange when i went to talk to justin the angrier i got the less distance there seemed to be between us with a wondering laugh she shook her head then when i wasnt angry any longer the distance was gone i was furious with you too she added looking up again for interfering and for being right i really detested you for being right its a bad habit of mine he said as their chili was served i cant seem to break it she gave an unladylike snort and lifted her fork im beginning to think id like to come up against you in court odd ive had that thought myself it would be he decided after his first bite an interesting match he sent her a slow wolfish smile hows your chili excellent diana kept her eyes level with his as she ate tell me counselor are you so sure youd win i rarely lose ah the perry mason syndrome when he laughed diana found herself more pleased with the sound than she should have been it was too easy to forget her own rules when she was around him thoughtfully she lifted her wine and studied its warm red hue perhaps its too bad i didnt go for a position with the da after all she continued if i were working for the state wed be bound to cross swords sooner or later we will anyway he murmured though perhaps not in court perhaps she agreed as she felt the little tingles of excitement begin she fought them down honest enough to admit them too wary to allow them freedom but i wouldnt be too sure about winning it could be caine said slowly that when the verdict comes in well both have won a hung jury he smiled again then brought her hand to his lips the kiss was light and confident justice chapter six contents prev next after spending an evening going over the police report and all the background notes caine had given her on chad rutledge diana was no longer sure caine was doing her a favor with the referral it was a messy case with several strikes against her potential client hed been anything but a model of cooperation when hed been picked up in fact diana remembered as she glanced through the file again hed taken a swing at one of the arresting officers chad had denied the rape charges then had claimed hed been intimate with beth howard the alleged victim repeatedly over a sixmonth period she denied anything but the most passing acquaintance even before the medical reports had confirmed it he had admitted to having sex with her the night of the alleged rape when beths mother had brought her to the hospital for the examination the girl had been bruised and hysterical chads knuckles had been raw yet caine seemed to believe his story with a sigh diana closed the file then rubbed the bridge of her nose shed form her own opinion theyd be bringing chad to the conference room any minute glancing around at the dingy green walls diana thought that the frivolous saturday morning shed had with caine only a few days before was lightyears away this part of her job had little to do with choosing the right desk the heavy door with its tiny thick window opened diana had her first look at chad rutledge ill be right outside miss blade the guard told her as chad dropped down in a chair at the side of the table thank you she dismissed him without a look giving her attention to her client he looked younger than in his mug shots but he had the same toughly handsome face and thick black hair she glanced at his eyes they stared straight ahead sulky disinterested then she looked at his hands they clenched and unclenched slowly as though he were working out a pain you can lie with your eyes but not with your hands remembering caines words diana sat back the boy was scared to death im diana blade she said briskly her own nerves she discovered werent as steady as she might have liked ill be taking over your case if thats agreeable with you chad shrugged and said nothing mr macgregor spoke with you and with your mother before but his workload doesnt permit him to give your case the proper time and attention it requires to insure you of the best possible defense what kind of jobs a woman going to do defending a guy for rape chad asked the wall he faced youll get the best defense i can give you regardless of your sex or mine diana returned evenly you told mr macgregor your story now id like you to tell me chad hooked an elbow carefully over the back of the wooden chair got a cigarette babe no he swore halfheartedly and pulled one bent unfiltered cigarette out of his shirt pocket at least he passed me to a looker for the first time chad turned and faced her fully there was challenge in his eyes as he skimmed them over her lingering deliberately on the swell of her breast diana waited until his gaze came back to hers why dont we cut the crap and get down to business the leer turned into a look of surprise then annoyance look youve got the police report in that file there what else do you want with a quick nervous jerk he lit a match then drew greedily on his cigarette tell me what happened on january tenth diana drew a pad and pen out of her briefcase then waited youre wasting my time chad she said at length and your mothers money he shot her a furious look then blew out a stream of smoke on january tenth i got up had a shower got dressed had breakfast and went to work ignoring his belligerence diana began to take notes youre a mechanic at maynes garage thats right he sent her a lewd grin want a tuneup she could read the expression on his face by his tone and didnt bother to look up were you at the garage all day yeah he gave another shrug at her lack of reaction we had a mercedes in for an overhaul i do the foreign jobs i see what time did you get off six chad shifted in his chair as he pulled in more smoke whered you go i went home and had some dinner then then i went out cruising you know he smiled at her again showing a slightly crooked front tooth checking out the ladies how long did you cruise couple hours chad drew hard on the cigarette so that the tip glowed red then i raped beth howard diana continued to write without breaking rhythm though she felt the jolt down to the soles of her feet youve decided to change your plea he slumped back in the chair but his left hand was balled into a fist i figure im not going to get by with the bull i was passing before all right tell me about it she glanced up when he remained silent tell me about the rape chad you get off hearing about things like that did you pick her up in your car yeah the cigarette was no more than a fingertip in width when he finally snuffed it out she was walking home from the movies and i offered her a lift wed gone to high school together she recognized me so she got in we talked for a while just a lot of bull about what wed been doing since graduation drove around i liked the way she looked you know so i gave her some story about needing to pick something up at the garage she went with you to the garage without protest his tongue flicked out quickly to moisten his lips there was already a sheen of sweat above them i told her i had to pick up some tools you know when we got there i jumped on her and she resisted yeah i had to knock her around a little he put his hand to his pocket and found another mashed cigarette diana saw that his fingers were trembling and then then i ripped off her clothes and raped her he exploded what the hell do you want all the graphic details what was she wearing he dragged a hand through his hair a pink sweater he muttered gray cords youre quite sure of that yeah yeah im sure of it a pink sweater with this little white collar and gray cords and you ripped them off of her diana persisted still writing tore them yeah i said i did setting down her pen diana met his eyes directly her clothes werent torn chad i said i tore them i oughta know what the hell i did he wiped at the dampness on his lips with the back of his hand then moistened them again i was there lady you werent beth howards clothes werent damaged when she arrived at the hospital his hand was shaking visibly now she changed them thats all no she didnt diana said quietly because you never ripped them just as you never raped her why are you trying to convince me that you did chad put his elbows on the table pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes god i cant do anything right diana studied the top of his head and listened to the sound of his labored breathing as it filled the tiny room you didnt put the bruises on her face either did you slowly without uncovering his eyes he shook his head i wouldnt hurt beth youre in love with her yeah aint it a hell of a mess start again diana ordered this time try the truth with a sigh chad lowered his hands and began he and beth had gone through high school together each hardly aware of the others existence theyd run in different crowds hed been busy promoting his tough guy image shed been head cheerleader then one day six months before she had brought her car into maynes for repairs and everything had happened at once theyd started dating her father had disapproved and ordered her to break it off theyd continued to see each other secretly it was like a game you know chad laughed shakily as he tugged his hand through his hair again even my friends didnt know hers either shed say she was going to the library or the movies or shopping and wed snatch some time together if she could get away for a couple hours at night wed go to the garage seal up inside and talk make love i was saving up so that we could get married what happened the night you were arrested we had a fight beth said she didnt want to go on that way anymore she didnt care if we didnt have enough money or anywhere to live she wanted to get married right away she wouldnt listen she started crying and i started yelling slammed my fist into the damn wall he looked down at it as if he still expected to see the bruise then she got in her car and drove off i went out and had a few beers before i went home then the cops came god i was so scared at first everything came pouring out why do you think shes accusing you of rape i know why his eyes werent challenging now but helpless she smuggled a note to me through my mother when beth got home that night she was still upset her father got on her and while they were arguing she told him everything he went nuts slapped her around called her names scared the hell out of her she says he threatened to kill both of us unless she did exactly as he said beths scared enough to believe he means it chad let out a long breath as his hands began to work again anyway by the time her mother got home beth was hysterical her old man told the story and called the cops while her mother took her to the hospital wheres the letter i got rid of it chad shook his head at dianas expression my mom doesnt know what was in it either cause it was sealed i dont think shed have done it if she hadnt thought maybe somethingd been going on between me and beth for a while if she writes you again i want you to keep the letter look i dont want her hurt anymore when they first picked me up i was scared you know but i was mad too i thought shed done it to punish me he shook his head again straightening his shoulders ill take my chances on a few years in prison you like your cell chad diana demanded pushing aside her notes to lean forward this is a picnic compared to the state penitentiary his mouth trembled as he swallowed ill make out all right theyve got real rapists in there she said coldly murderers men whod snap you in two without giving it a second thought and how do you think beths going to feel knowing youre locked up in there and why shell be okay a new trickle of sweat ran down the side of his face it wont be for that long you want to risk twenty years of your life you want her father to get away with setting you up grow up she ordered impatiently this isnt a game anymore youre going to go on trial for rape the maximum sentence is life chad blanched and said nothing but diana could see the jerky workings of his throat youre going to have to sit in that witness chair and so is beth and youre going to have to tell the court exactly what happened that night if you lie the two of you face perjury charges if i plead guilty diana swooped the pad into her briefcase if you want to play hero because your girlfriends afraid of her father get yourself another lawyer i dont defend idiots she started to rise but chads hand shot out to take her arm i just dont want to hurt her shes awful scared shes been hurt diana said flatly and shell keep right on being scared until she tells the truth or maybe you dont believe she really loves you his fingers tightened on her arm but diana didnt flinch after a moment they relaxed tell me what i have to do a portion of the tension in her shoulders eased all right when diana walked into the office an hour later she was drained lucy glanced up took one long look then stopped typing you look like you could use some coffee diana gave her a weary smile it shows yep why dont i put some on and before she could finish the sentence the phone rang thats all right lucy take care of the phone ill go fix some as she walked back toward the kitchen diana slipped out of her coat she could still see chads pale frightened face see his hand reach to his pocket for a cigarette after he had no more left and what was beth howard feeling diana wondered tossing her coat aside as she turned to the stove if i could get to her she began then let out a frustrated breath that was the last thing the da or her father would permit chad was going to have to wait for his day in court rubbing at the ache at the back of her neck diana stared out the window over the sink the coffee forgotten with any luck she could get the truth out of beth howard during the preliminaries but if the girl was that frightened of her father if she wasnt in love with chad but merely playing games with a sigh diana watched a bird peck at the lawn in search of food so many its when a boys life was at stake rough morning caine asked from the doorway diana turned yeah god she was glad to see him she realized glad to know here was someone she could talk to who would understand some of what she was feeling busy caine thought of the brief upstairs on his desk but shook his head i could use some coffee he slipped two mugs from their hooks and poured you saw chad rutledge this morning oh caine that poor kid diana dropped into a chair at the small table while he added milk to one of the mugs he walked in doing an imitation of early brando some tough street hood with fingers that trembled she added in a murmur give you a hard time caine set her coffee down as he sat across from her he tried at first with a sigh she dragged her hair back from her face holding it there a moment before she let her hand fall again then he told me hed raped beth howard caines mug paused on its way to his lips what he gave me a full confession she began warming both her hands on the side of the mug very casual like it was something hed decided to do because he was a little bored the more he talked the more his hands trembled sipping slowly caine shook his head it doesnt follow i didnt think so either diana tried to drink but found her stomach was still tied in knots i pressed him for details and thats where he fell apart he tried to convince me hed lured her to the garage where he works then knocked her around and raped her caines frown deepened that jives with the girls story chad said hed ripped her clothes off torn them her clothes werent torn diana gave him a thin smile exactly it was all some smoke screen hed dreamed up so that he could protect her caine leaned back and drew out a cigarette tell me diana began relaying the conversation exactly point by point as she spoke caine said nothing but watched the play of emotion on her face she was fighting not to get personally involved he concluded but it was already too late if everything chad says is true he mused when shed finished the girlll fall apart on the stand i believe him he wanted to plead guilty and keep her out of it caines look sharpened what did you do i bullied him out of it diana allowed her eyes to close for a moment i dont know how the trial will affect him or the girl if it gets that far ive got a list of their close friends chad seems to think he and beth kept their relationship secret but the chances are something slipped to someone over the last six months theyre so young pushing back her hair diana rose to pace to the window again oh god caine i was so hard on him the princess had stepped beyond the castle walls he thought hed wanted her to even pushed her to yet now seeing the raw emotion in her eyes he had conflicting needs to draw her further out and to urge her back to safety when the shell cracked and opened there was always pain he spoke carefully trying to fit back into the role of colleague diana you know we cant always treat clients with kid gloves its no less than his life at stake i know she laid her forehead on the glass a moment it isnt easy to realize all at once that you can be cruel that you can calmly sit there and whip somebody down with words he was pale swearing shaking i didnt give him a dram of sympathy you gave him exactly what he needed caine had risen without her hearing but he didnt approach her this time he wasnt completely sure how now youre tearing yourself apart because you did what you had to do his motherll give him sympathy you have to give him the best defense whatever it takes i know the bird was still there bobbing along the grass determined to find what it was looking for even if it means ripping up that girl on the stand its her father id like to get a hold of she muttered even when it all comes out falsifying a police report hes not likely to get much more than a slap on the wrist and a suspended sentence and that nineteenyearold boys sitting in a cell terrified firmly caine suppressed the need to soothe and comfort hes not justin diana she let out a long shaky breath im that transparent at the moment it was hard not to make the comparison lifting her hands she hugged her arms as if seeking something solid he had that same tough oddly attractive insolence that i remember in justin as a teenager and when i thought about him waiting in that cell it was too easy to see how it had been for justin and i wondered she gave a small laugh i wondered if this could be another quirk of that fate of yours youre going to lose your objectivity diana his voice was tough and unsympathetic as the struggle went on inside him to be brother lover friend youve got no business in a courtroom without it i know that the words snapped out of her she turned away with her jaw tensed and one hand balled into a fist objectivity she thought still unable to take those deep cleansing breaths that always kept her calm she had no objectivity at the moment but too many comparisons and too many regrets she wanted to be held soothed and didnt dare ask because she needed to stand on her own i have to get it out of my system before i go back and see chad again the words were low and tense but they were the words hed wanted to hear automatically caine placed a hand on her shoulder when the muscles there only tightened more he increased his grip he would have dealt with his sister the same way thats what he told himself as he turned her around wordlessly he gathered her close and though her arms came around him she didnt cling he knew she was looking for support but not for answers the answers she would find for herself in that moment he discovered hed never wanted her more not just a warm soft body against his not just a mouth for tasting he wanted her thoughts feelings he wanted to share what she was and feed back to her himself so that there were no more boundaries and barriers no more doubts and while the tenderness enveloped him his hands were gentle on her hair sensing something diana lifted her head his eyes met hers briefly but she couldnt read them hed never looked at her that way before was there a question in them she wondered what was he asking her then his lips touched hers this had nothing to do with the other kisses they had shared it might have been the first his mouth was so soft and careful she thought dimly careful as though he werent so sure of himself it ran through her head that he was kissing her as though hed never kissed anyone before this man who had known so many women his hands didnt press her closer but rested lightly on her back as though he would release her at the least movement diana was very still whatever magic this was whatever reasons there were for it she wanted it to go on yet it wasnt desire she felt it was nothing so simple when he drew her away they stared at each other each as perplexed each as moved as the other what was that for diana managed after a moment caine dropped his arms slowly and stepped away from her im not sure he murmured shaken he walked back to the table and lifted his coffee what the hells going on he asked himself then drained the mug are you all right now he asked her as he turned back around yes no she said silently but nearly managed a smile i think ill go up and try to work out chads defense mrs walkers coming in tomorrow morning when he gave her a blank look she added the divorce case you referred to me oh yeah caine stared into his empty mug and wondered what was happening to his mind theyve hooked up your phone good diana remained at the window not certain what she should do well ill go on up then she said but still didnt move diana caine looked over at her not sure what he was going to say feeling ridiculous he gave a half laugh and shook his head must be something in the coffee he muttered listen do you have anything else tomorrow besides walker ah no no appointments i have paperwork ive got to drive up to salem and see someone about the day case why dont you come with me he continued before shed worked out an answer its a nice drive you can clear your head and draft out your work while im tied up yes i suppose i could she considered all right she agreed on impulse id like that i might not have too many free afternoons good well leave as soon as youre done with mrs walker they stood for a moment in a silence diana found unaccountably awkward it was strange she thought that two people who had no trouble with words should suddenly have such a strained conversation i should be done by tenthirty or eleven she searched for something else to say but found her mind a blank well ill go up then caine nodded as he walked back to the coffeepot when he heard her footsteps drift away he set his filled mug back down untasted what the hell is all this he wondered again passing a frustrated hand through his hair when hed asked her to accompany him the following day hed felt like a gangly teenager asking for a date with a half laugh caine went back to the table no hed never felt that lack of confidence as a teenager hed never felt it at all not with women after lighting a cigarette he stared at the glowing tip for several minutes hed always been sure of his ground when it came to the opposite sex enjoying women was part of it not just as bed partners but as companions that part of his life had always run smoothly it was his firm intention that it continue to run smoothly he knew without conceit that he didnt have to spend an evening alone unless he chose to then why had he been spending so many alone lately and when he added thoughtfully was the last time he had thought of any other woman but diana letting out a long breath caine began to sift the problem around in his mind pull it apart dissect it he owed part of his success in his field to a synthesis of intellect and emotion it had been that way since hed been a boy the quick unexpected bursts of temper or passion the long quiet contemplations he enjoyed puzzles or the slow meticulous solving of them at the moment however he wasnt enjoying this one uncomfortable that was the first feeling he was able to clearly define thinking about diana was making him uncomfortable but why he found her good company enjoyed the flavor of their sparring matches and he wanted her cain drew hard on the cigarette thinking of the sharp turbulent passion he felt from her when he held her when her mouth was avid on his desire didnt make him uncomfortable hed promised himself hed be her lover sooner or later and he always kept his promises it hadnt been desire moments ago he reflected caine knew all the angles of that emotion neither had it been the brotherly type of affection hed swung back to from time to time it was diana who didnt fit into any category he told himself she wasnt the easy sophisticate he was normally attracted to nor was she the younger cousin he could show a good time annoyed with himself he rose and paced to the window the light was thin winter white if she was making him uncomfortable why had he asked her to drive to salem with him because he needed to be with her even as the answer ran through his mind caine made his thoughts back up and play again need he repeated slowly now that was a dangerous word want was safer and more understandable but that hadnt been the answer that had sprung into his mind very slowly caine walked back to the stove and lifted his cooling coffee he drank forcing himself to keep his mind blank for a moment he thought of nothing but the faintly bitter taste of the coffee saw nothing but the aged exposed brick along the west wall in the distance he heard the phone ring on lucys desk then the quick rattle of the wind against the window behind him good god he thought still staring straight ahead was he in love with her no that was ridiculous love wasnt a word he used because love had repercussions in an angry gesture he dumped the remaining coffee down the sink a man didnt go for over thirty years then suddenly without giving it a second thought jump off a bridge unless unless hed woken one morning and discovered hed lost his mind hed been working too hard caine decided too many late nights poring over other peoples problems searching for answers what he needed was an evening with a compatible woman then eight hours sleep tomorrow he promised himself hed be thinking clearly again tomorrow he remembered as he headed out of the kitchen diana would still be there swearing quietly caine walked up the stairs chapter seven contents prev next diana would have enjoyed the ride more if she hadnt had the feeling something wasnt quite right caine was friendly enough the conversation didnt lag or fall into awkward silences yet she would have sworn there was something just under the surface of the camaraderie because it wasnt something she could define diana told herself she was imagining it perhaps allowing herself to assign to caine an echo of her own feelings there had been a tension in her since the previous day one she attributed at least in part to her meeting with chad rutledge it worried diana that she couldnt shake it an attorney a good one had to find that balance between callousness and emotional entanglement the balance was as crucial for the client as it was for the attorney diana knew it intellectually but realized that the scales in this case were already tilting to one side she could only comfort herself that the more involved she became in the technical points of the case the less tendency she would have to compare chad with justin for now she would do exactly as caine had suggested clear her head and enjoy the ride you didnt mention whom youre going to see in salem diana began he had to force himself to gather his thoughts to control the tension he was feeling like diana he told himself it was the case that had him tight nothing personal personal relationships never made his stomach knot hed been telling himself that since the previous evening greataunt agatha diana let out an irrepressible sound of mirth you dont have to make something up she said dryly you could simply tell me to mind my own business virginia days greataunt agatha caine said specifically tossing her a grin discuss the case he told himself it might help him shake the feeling that hed pried open a door for diana then stepped into quicksand shes reputed to be a very formidable lady and one who knows ginnie better than anyone else unfortunately she was iceskating a couple of weeks ago and broke her hip im going to see her at the hospital greataunt agatha iceskates apparently how old is she sixtyeight hmmm what are you looking for caine pushed the jaguar forward in a burst of speed passing a pickup before he answered what was he looking for he wondered even a few days before he wouldve been able to answer that with a shrug and a glib remark the case he thought with an annoyed shake of his head keep your mind on the case the prosecutions going for murder one the first thing i want to establish is that ginnie carried that pistol with her habitually if im going to prove selfdefense i have to get it into the jurys head early that ginnie went to laura simmonss apartment to confront her husband with his current mistress but not to kill his current mistress diana repeated apparently he had quite a number the detective report ginnie paid for a few months back indicates that dr francis day was a very busy man he didnt do all his operating at boston general caine punched in the car lighter if i can get the report into evidence it should make the jury more sympathetic then again it gives ginnie even more of a motive so youre right back to the gun caine nodded as he touched the lighter to the end of his cigarette the conversation was easing the tightness at the base of his neck not quicksand he thought now he mightve stepped into a puddle and gotten his feet wet but he wasnt being sucked in according to ginnie she never left the house without it she has a fixation about being robbed not surprising as she also has a penchant for wearing several thousand dollars worth of jewelry at a time yes and ginnie day hasnt endeared herself to the press or the public over the last few years diana remembered she comes across as a spoiled selfish child with more money than class true enough caine agreed but i can be grateful you wont be on the jury i suppose im feeling a bit impatient with her type at the moment diana mused shifting in her seat to face him irene walker she said flatly shed be the antithesis of virginia day howd it go this morning the bruises on her face havent faded yet diana began frowning at his profile ive never met a woman with less of a conception of her own worth its as if she felt she deserved to be beaten with an impatient sound diana tried to push away the frustration she felt at least the friend shes staying with has convinced her to press formal charges against her husband but trailing off diana gave a quick shake of her head i have a feeling irene walker is like a sponge simply soaking up the emotions of the people shes with shes convinced herself or her husbands convinced her that shes a nonentity without him ive recommended that she go into counseling the divorce and her husbands trial arent going to be easy for her she let out a huff of breath that was as much astonishment as bewilderment she still wears her wedding ring taking it off would be the final break wouldnt it he countered for a woman like irene walker do you know theyve only been married four years and she cant remember the number of times hes beaten her dianas eyes were hard and sharp for a moment im going to love getting him on the stand as i recall there were two witnesses to the last beating youd have him cold thats exactly the way i want it im hoping to get on the docket quickly while mrs walker still sees the bruises when she looks in the mirror i think shes a woman who forgets too easily caine glanced down at the briefcase next to her feet is that what youre going to work on today im going to draft out interrogatories i want to slap them on him right away between the divorce and the battery trial im going to see that he gets nothing but trouble going for the jugular she smiled then someone told me once it was cleaner tell me diana ran a fingertip over the back of the leather seat how long have you had this car the car he shot her a questioning look at the abrupt change of subject yes id love to buy a new one myself the questioning look became a grin oh she was definitely opening up he mused breaking out a jag one day diana arched a brow or do you think theyre reserved only for former states attorneys i suppose i pictured you in a mercedes stately and elegant diana narrowed her eyes are you trying to insult me certainly not caine replied gravely can you drive a stickshift you are trying to insult me without comment caine pulled over to the shoulder of the road curiously diana watched him get out round the hood and open the passenger door you drive awhile me he struggled with a grin at the halfincredulous halfexcited look in her eyes perhaps this most of all was what he couldnt resist when the sophistication and intelligence were replaced by pure simple pleasure if youre thinking about buying a car you should get the feel of it first unless he added slowly you cant drive a fivespeed i can drive anything diana stated as she climbed out fine caine settled back in the passenger seat as diana switched places ill tell you when to turn off diana gripped the wheel with one hand and put the car into first under her palm she could feel the light vibration of power the promise of speed after glancing in the rearview mirror she shot back onto the highway oh its wonderful she cried immediately a check on the speedometer had her easing off the gas and tempting she added with a quick laugh im afraid id end up defending myself in traffic court if i had one of these ive always found its just a matter of knowing you can press your foot down and go faster than anything else on the road caine commented yes knowing you can so that you dont tossing back her hair she laughed again and passed a slower stream of traffic as the speedometer hovered just above fiftyfive it would hardly be seemly for a public servant to zip down the road at ninety miles an hour but it feels wonderful knowing you could diana shifted into fifth and kept the speed steady is that why you bought it i like things with style he murmured studying her profile if they have enough power to challenge underneath the gloss the hands on the wheel were confident capable caine could picture her driving down an empty stretch of road on a summer night the windows open her hair flying you fascinate me diana she sent him a quick grin why because i can drive a jag without running into the median strip because you have style caine countered take the next turnoff while diana settled into a comer of a waiting room to work caine walked down the hospital corridor to agatha grants room he found her in solitary splendor pink lace bed jacket white hair perfectly coiffed thin cheeks tinted outrageously with a bumper crop of magazines littering the bed they ranged from gossip glossies to popular mechanics as caine entered agatha set down the sports magazine shed been thumbing through to eye him appreciatively about time they let someone with looks in here she said in a raspy voice come in and sit down honey caines grin was spontaneous as he walked to the bedside mrs grant im caine macgregor ah ginnies lawyer agatha nodded as she gestured to a chair the girl always did have an eye for a goodlooking face looks like its got her in a hell of a mess this time caine took another pile of magazines from the chair before he sat im hoping youll be able to help me with ginnies defense mrs grant i appreciate you seeing me like this so soon after your accident agatha snorted and waved the words away ill be up and around long before these doctors think she told him then gave a rueful smile maybe i wont be doing figureeights too soon okay honey tell me what you want to know you know that ginnie has been charged with murdering francis day when agatha gave a brisk unemotional nod caine continued its alleged that she went to laura simmonss apartment knowing her husband was there and that ms simmons was his mistress the last of many agatha added caustically caine only lifted a brow at the comment and continued ms simmons left ginnie alone with day at his request when she returned to the apartment twenty minutes later day was dead and ginnie was sitting on the couch with the pistol still in her hand hed been shot twice at close range ms simmons became hysterical rushed to a neighbors and called the police ginnie killed him agatha pushed at the magazines with gnarled redtipped fingers theres little doubt of it yes she admits to that however she claims that day became abusive when they were alone at first she says they shouted at each other something that had been habitual in their marriage for some time then she threatened to drag him through a messy divorce with all the trimmings correspondents detective reports something he wanted to avoid as he was next in line as chief of surgery at boston general agatha gave a low mirthless chuckle yes he would have hated that ginnies franny guarded his reputation as a distinguished dedicated man of medicine it wouldnt have done for it to come out publicly that he was a lecher caine made a quiet sound that might have been agreement or speculation shes a tough one he concluded noting agathas composed painted face during the argument caine went on he lost control slapped her by this time they were screaming at each other she claims he went wild knocked her to the floor and picked up a lamp he told her he was going to kill her when he came toward her ginnie took the gun out of her purse and shot agatha nodded over the explanation then leveled a hard look at caine do you believe her caine returned the look for several seconds before he spoke i believe that virginia day shot her husband in a moment of panic and in her own defense ginnies a hardheaded girl agatha said with a sigh spoiled we all spoiled her and she has a mean temper explodes easily without thinking of the consequences but shes not coldblooded agatha added with another level look she would not could not systematically plan to kill in order to prove that caine returned the first thing i have to establish is why she had a gun when she went to confront her husband the girl wouldnt step out of the door without that pistol with a sound of disgust agatha shifted against the pillows ugly little thing id ask her what the hell she thought she was going to do with it and shed laugh aunt aggie shed say if anyone tries to mug me theyre in for a surprise agatha let out another impatient sound stupid girl had to glitter diamonds emeralds shed think nothing of walking in the back bay or dashing around manhattan dripping with jewelry as long as she had that damn pistol you often saw her with the pistol in her possession i might be staying with her for a few days stop by her room before we went out somewhere id see her put the thing in her bag once at a party i saw it there when she went in her purse for a compact i gave her hell about it agatha added for all the good it did then youd swear in court under oath that virginia day habitually carried a twentytwo pistol in her possession and that on numerous occasions you saw her with the gun and discussed it with her honey id lie in hells face for her agatha gave him a thin icy smile never could stand that twotiming jerk she married mrs grant relax she told him with something like a cackle in this case i can swear to it without risking my mortal soul if ginnie hadnt had the pistol with her that night id have wondered what was going on good caine allowed himself to relax and we might keep it just between you and me about lying in hells face you got it she sent him a crafty smile then letting her eyes scan his face i dont suppose you and ginnie im her defense attorney caine countered as he rose reaching out he grasped agathas surprisingly strong hand thank you mrs grant if i were forty years younger and on trial for murder agatha said slowly youd be a hell of a lot more than my defense attorney flashing her a grin caine brought her hand to his lips dont kill anyone agatha i find you very hard to resist pleased she let out a lusty laugh that followed him down the corridor caine found diana where he had left her a law book balanced on one knee a legal pad on the other she was busy writing apparently not affected by the inconvenience without speaking he took a chair and waited for her to finish he always enjoyed watching her this way when she was absorbed with what she was doing and cut off from her surroundings no guards now he thought hed wanted to help her accomplish that just as much as hed wanted to make love with her now that she was well on her way to the first he realized he couldnt afford to do the second there were too many undercurrents in her he decided undercurrents had a habit of pulling in the unwary perhaps it had been the sudden realization the evening before that he could conquer her with time with care that made him now too cautious to attempt it it was time to put their relationship on one balanced level and leave it there for her sake he wondered ruefully or for his own when diana stopped writing ten minutes later she closed the book and started to stretch her shoulders before she spotted caine oh when did you get back only a few minutes ago you know not everyone is able to block out their surroundings and work the way you do one of my more basic skills diana claimed slipping everything back into her briefcase i developed it out of necessity when i wanted to tune out my aunt how did it go perfectly caine rose picking up dianas coat to help her into it just how much trouble did you have with your aunt diana immediately she tensed up closed up he saw it and wondered if his princess in the tower idea had been closer to the mark than hed realized my aunt her voice was cool and emotionless yes how much trouble did you have she was fond of phrases like a lady never wears diamonds before five a great deal obviously caine murmured as he picked up his own jacket i wonder if i was a little rough on you in atlantic city surprised diana stared up at him as they walked toward the elevator theres no need to apologize but her body was still on guard her voice still on edge what brought that on i was thinking about agatha caine pushed the button for the lobby she doesnt particularly approve of her niece but she loves her it shows he released a lock of hair that was caught in dianas collar im beginning to think it was just the opposite in your case aunt adelaide approved of what she thought shed made me with a shrug diana stepped out of the elevator it was enough as for love she never loved me but then again she never pretended to either i cant fault her for that why the hell not he demanded angry all at once with the clarity of the picture her limited words drew she gave him a steady look that clearly told him he was too close you cant blame someone for their emotions or for the lack of them when she turned away it was a signal that the conversation was ended unable to stop himself he grabbed her arm where she was cool again he was heating yes you can he countered you damn well can leave it caine i did when he started to object she turned again then stopped oh my god look diana stared through the glass doors still frowning at her words caine glanced over snow was falling fast and thick already blanketing the ground so much for the weather forecast caine muttered this was supposed to hold off until tonight diana drew on her gloves the drive back to bostons going to be very interesting and very slow she added as they stepped outside into the full force of the storm with any luck well be heading out of it caine took a firm grip on her arm as they walked across the parking lot as he finished the statement they looked toward the sky simultaneously at dianas arched brow look he shrugged both of them were already covered with snow we could go back to the hospital and wait it out not unless you dont want to risk driving in it caine looked toward the road as they stopped by the car well see how it goes for the first twenty minutes they drove through the storm with relative ease caine was a good driver and the car hugged the road confidently diana watched the snow hurtle down building quickly on the roadside coating naked trees the farther south they got the more the wind picked up so that snow covered the windshield as quickly as the wipers cleared it catching her breath diana saw the car in front of them fishtail and skid into the center lane before the driver regained control its pretty bad she murmured casting caine a look its not good he kept the speed slow and even with his eyes narrowed in concentration on the road ahead with every mile the visibility became shorter and the road slicker hed lived in new england long enough to know the makings of a blizzard when he saw one it was falling too thick and fast caine was aware now that rather than heading out of the storm they were heading into it on the other side of the median strip two cars slid into each other and stopped both he and diana remained silent for the next twenty miles theyd reached the halfway point between boston and salem in nearly twice the time it had taken them to make the entire trip earlier the light was failing and when he turned on the headlights the snow danced crazily in the beams there were drifts of over a foot of snow on the side of the road with more coming an abandoned car sat crookedly where it had skidded off and stalled diana began to wish shed taken caines suggestion of staying in the hospital more seriously a car passed them on the right at a dangerous speed that had it sliding toward the jags front fender diana smothered a gasp as caine swore ripely forced to brake then fight a skid he was still cursing as he brought the car under control and took the first turnoff its suicide to travel that road in this diana merely nodded busy trying to swallow her heart again well stop off at the first hotel we come to get a couple of rooms and wait until morning he took his eyes off the road long enough to look at her you all right diana let out a deep breath ask me again when im not praying caine gave quick chuckle then narrowed his eyes as the bluish glare of a neon light shone mistily through the snow i think were in luck the last slash of the m in motel had gone out but the rest of the neon was garishly visible ah a notel diana said with a grin what better shelter from a storm caine glanced at the singlestory compound before he pulled the car to a halt we wont get deluxe accommodations in this section will we have a roof probably thats good enough she had to use both hands to push open the door against the wind standing outside diana sank to her knees took a deep breath and burst out laughing whats so funny caine demanded as he began to pull her toward a tiny building marked office nothing nothing she shouted back it just feels wonderful now you should have told me you were frightened he tightened his arm around her waist as the wind shoved both of them back two steps diana lifted her face to the full fury of snow i would have when id rah out of my repertoire of prayers the door jingled stridently as caine shoved it open the cold clean smell of snow was immediately blocked out by the scent of cheap tobacco and stale beer behind a laminated counter a grizzled man lifted his eyes from a magazine he was reading yeah we need a couple of rooms for the night one glance told caine it was the sort of establishment that normally rented them by the hour amused he reminded himself beggars couldnt be choosers only got one the clerk lit a kitchen match with his thumbnail and eyed diana blizzards good for business diana looked at caine then back out the glass door behind him he was leaving it up to her she realized as a little nerve jumped at the base of her neck she remembered that last long skid well take it the clerk dug under the counter for a key thatll be twentytwo fifty he told caine still holding the key cash in advance any place to get some food around here caine asked as he counted out bills diner next door opentil two your rooms out and to the left number twentyseven checkout at ten or you owe another nights rent rooms got free tv and pay movies caine lifted a brow as he exchanged money for the key thank you friendly sort diana commented as they fought their way toward number you did mention food hungry caine checked the number on a peeling graypainted door im starving i hadnt realized it until dianas voice trailed off as her eyes widened in astonishment the room what there was of it was mostly bed one bed she noted but even that didnt alarm her in her present state the walls were a sizzling pink to match the wildpinkandpurple sunburst pattern of the bedspread there was one chair and an excuse for a table both painted in glaring white the rug though worn and thin picked up the purple tint all the way to the door of what diana assumed was the bath and on the ceiling over the bed was a round dusty mirror well it isnt the ritz caine said dryly struggling not to burst out laughing at her dazed expression he set both their briefcases on top of a white plastictopped dresser but it does have a roof hmm diana gave the mirror a last dubious look perhaps it was best not to think about that for the moment its freezing in here turning she saw that the drapes unfortunately matched the bedspread catching her expression caine couldnt hold back the grin its a room thats at its best in the dark ill see if i can get the heater working ignoring what she considered his odd humor diana sat gingerly on the edge of the bed the only bed she reminded herself the only room the only hotel one might think you were enjoying this whole fiasco who me caine gave the heater a quick kick that sent it roaring into life enjoying wasnt the word hed have picked even the thought of spending the night with her in this laughable room had the knot back in his stomach for the next few hours hed have to concentrate on pretending he was her big brother again if he was going to remember his resolution not to touch her ill go pick something up at the diner he continued when diana only stared at him theres no use both of us going out in this again want anything special quick and edible remembering the storm he had driven through she unbent enough to smile at him if he was going to accept the situation with a shrug then so would she thanks i owe you eleven dollars and a quarter ill bill you he promised then leaned over to give her a brief kiss before he went out alone diana glanced around the room again it wasnt so bad really she told herself if you kept your eyes halfclosed and the heater was certainly working great guns now she slipped out of her coat and looked for a closet it seemed the room didnt run to such extravagances draping the coat over the dresser diana unzipped her boots the idea of a hot bath was appealing but the prospect of undressing just to dress again had her vetoing the notion shed compensate by stretching out on the bed until caine came back with dinner maybe some television she thought idly then noticed a black box attached to the side of the set on closer examination diana noted it was some kind of timer fed by quarters the pay movies she remembered and decided to try her luck it might be wise to have a movie marathon that way itd be easier to remember they were both lawyers a word without gender rooming together through circumstances she glanced over her shoulder at the bed again and felt a little bead of tension work its way up her spine resolutely she turned away a search through her wallet found her three quarters and what would amount to fortyfive minutes of whatever movie was playing following the instructions printed on the box diana turned the set to the proper channel fed in the quarters and twisted a knob not unlike one on a parking meter she turned and went to the bed stretched out in the center and gave a sigh of pure appreciation it was while she was busy arranging the pillows behind her head that the movement on the set caught her eye after a classic doubletake she simply stared openmouthed when the initial shock wore off diana lay back and laughed until her sides ached good god she thought as she hauled herself off the bed again of all the motels in massachusetts they had to find one with pink walls and blue movies diana was just hitting the off switch when caine walked back in do you know what kind of movies you get for a quarter on this machine she demanded before hed shut the door behind him he shook himself like a dog scattering snow yes did you need some change very cute though she tried she couldnt keep her lips from curving i just wasted seventyfive cents i wouldnt be a bit surprised to have the vice squad banging on the door in this weather caine countered and set two white bags down on the little table is that dinner i smell so to speak i got quick i wont guarantee edible he pulled out two wrapped hamburgers you go first young attorney poisoned in notel diana murmured as she unwrapped one of the sandwiches theres fries too he peeked into the bag i think theyre fries anyway i got some wine for now and coffee for later he took out two capped foam cups and set them aside before he drew out a bottle the best i can say is that its red oh i dont know diana bit into the hamburger taking the bottle in her free hand this was a great week does this place run to glasses or do we swig straight from the bottle ill check in the bathroom no sudden stomach pains he asked as he went no she decided to risk the fries i dont suppose the storms letting up if anything its worse caine came back with two plastic glasses word over at the diner is more than a foot before morning diana sat on the edge of the bed and took the offered glass i suppose we could watch the news she mused with a glance at the set if you can get the news on that thing laughing caine sat down and unwrapped his hamburger poor diana what a shock that must have been im not a prude she said primly it was simply unexpected she took a sip of wine grimaced and sipped again its really not too bad best in the house caine told her a buck fiftynine a bottle in that case ill sip more slowly caine there is one small detail we should discuss he took a swallow of wine hed known it was coming while hed trudged through the storm hed decided exactly how to handle it im not sleeping on the floor diana made a face at his accurate reading of her mind theres always the bathtub be my guest its becoming painfully clear that chivalry is dead look he began over a mouthful of hamburger its a big bed if you dont want to put it to any better use than sleeping i certainly dont the sharp answer was precisely what hed been working toward if they kept it casual kept it up front they both might survive the night then you sleep on one side and ill sleep on the other he finished telling himself it was just as simple as that im not certain i like how quickly you agreed to that she murmured if youd like me to convince you otherwise he began with a slow smile no thats not what i meant frowning diana finished off her hamburger after all she mused hed driven for nearly two hours in that miserable storm she could hardly deny him a decent nights sleep you stay on your side and ill stay on mine she repeated he leaned over to fill her glass again if you insist i hate to repeat myself by bringing up clark gable again clark gable diana repeated blankly than gave a brief laugh claudette colbert it happened one night exactly he said with an amused smile in a similar situation they imagined something along the lines of the walls of jericho she gave him a long look hows your imagination caine shrugged and sipped his wine i told you once i could wait until you admitted you wanted me deliberately he lifted his eyes to hers and deliberately he baited her knowing shed step back he desperately needed her to step back i can be very patient refusing to acknowledge the challenge diana merely nodded as long as you know the rules i think ill skip the coffee and have a bath before i turn in standing he ran a casual hand down her hair you should get some sleep its been a long day she felt a quick sense of regret which she firmly stemmed yes i think i will shall i leave the light on no dont bother its impossible to miss the bed in this room he wanted to kiss her badly and made himself walk away good night diana good night diana waited until she heard the water running then slowly rose youre being a fool a voice told her with sharp surprising impatience you know theres nothing you want more than to make love with him to lose yourself in him thats just it diana thought with a sudden panic i would lose myself or a part im not sure im ready to lose hes different and i dont trust him or myself diana ran an agitated hand through her hair and listened to the sound it wouldnt be the same with caine as it might with any other man hed already broken down so many barriers once the physical was down he wouldnt stop there she couldnt wouldnt allow him that kind of hold over her oh but she wanted him tonight like caine diana let her coffee sit growing cold she wanted nothing that might keep her awake and restless while she shared a bed with him after a moments struggle she stripped down to her chemise she wasnt going to be a fool and sleep in her clothes carefully she climbed into bed keeping close to the edge she found this more difficult than she had anticipated as the mattress sagged in the center swearing against what caine would have called fate diana switched off the light and gripping the side of the bed to keep from rolling out of her territory firmly shut her eyes when caine came out the room was silent he could see dianas vague outline at the far side of the bed hed spoken easily enough about sharing that soft warm rectangle with her but the hot bath had done nothing to ease the need it might be wise he thought to use the rest of the wine in lieu of a sleeping pill god he was going to need something knowing she was only an arms length away it would have been smarter he told himself grimly not to have given her his word hed stay on his side but he had caine let the towel drop and got quietly into bed like diana he found himself sliding toward the center cursing silently he shifted away with the habit of years caine drifted awake slowly and early something soft and warm was wrapped around him though still more asleep than awake he knew by the scent it was diana without conscious thought he drew her closer then heard her sigh as she snuggled against him with lazy pleasure he ran a hand down her to where the silk gave way to skin then back again diana pressed against him her fingers sliding lazily over his back murmuring her name he touched his lips to her forehead while his hand slipped beneath the silk they gave simultaneous sounds of pleasure languid and soft he thought it was no more than a dream hed dreamed of having her but it had never been quite like this so slow and easy when he shifted his leg slid intimately between hers while his mouth began a leisurely journey over her face with an inarticulate murmur diana tilted her head back so that her lips found his the dream lingered the kiss lingered without pressure as he continued to stroke and caress beneath the thin silk there was no place for doubts in soft drowsy light no room for reservations on a soft sagging mattress he touched her seducing both of them into sleepy surrender warm so warm he thought feeling the first real tug of desire as he found her breast diana moaned a little and arched against him he thought he heard his own name whispered against his lips and then her hands were moving over him steeped in her and the fantasy he took his mouth to her shoulder nudging the strap aside they were as strong as he had imagined and smooth following the gentle slope he slipped the chemise down farther pressing quiet sleepy kisses along her arm he could hear her breathing now a little fast a little unsteady and found that his mouth had fastened onto her breast to suckle and nibble he was unaware of passion until the need was a hard knot in his stomach and his own breathing was labored her heartbeat was a hammer against his lips which were now demanding more and she was naked although he wasnt fully aware that he had pulled the short length of silk from her her fingers were digging into his flesh her hips moving in a fastergrowing rhythm his name sighed from between her parted lips for a moment he tried to clear his head separate dream from reality but his body was in full command then he was inside her driven past fantasies and beyond reason chapter eight contents prev next the light was a dim dark gray shuddering and stunned diana opened her eyes to see only shadows she was cupped in the center of the bed nestled beneath caine and the thin blanket they had shared through the night though his face was buried against her throat she could hear his unsteady breathing feel the racing thump of his heart against hers his skin was hot and like hers faintly damp her fingers were curled into his hair and the taste of him still lingered on her lips her mind like her body felt heavy as if wrapped in some thick sweet honey tiny thrills of pleasure hummed over her flesh where she could still feel the pressure of his fingers in one flashing explosion her brain cleared with a quick sound of outrage diana struggled from beneath him then rolled to the far edge of the bed how could you dazed caine opened his eyes to stare at her what you gave your word she began a furious search beneath the covers for her camisole still throbbing from her and equally stunned caine dragged a hand through his hair diana i should have known better than to trust you she said pulling the brief covering of the camisole over her before she jumped out of bed her body tingled her limbs felt weighted in defense her eyes grew stormier god knows why i thought youd keep a bargain bargain he repeated blankly you stay on your side of the bed and i stay on mine she reminded him bitterly you and your damn walls of jericho he rubbed a hand over his face are you crazy i must have been diana ranted to have thought youd understand common decency now wait a minute in the dim light caine could make out little more than her silhouette and the faint gleam of her eyes but he could feel his own anger growing surely enough and pushed himself out of bed his temper only increased as he felt a wave of weakness that came from a draining of passion dont tell me to wait a minute diana snapped wrapping her hands around her arms as she started to shiver that was despicable fury and something he didnt recognize as hurt sped through him swiftly despicable he repeated in an ominously low tone despicable in echoing the word he fought for control you didnt appear to think so a few moments ago her own fingers dug into her arms as she tossed back her head no she hadnt thought at all a few moments ago only felt only wanted caine had been right there warm gentle seductive you had no right no right i had no right he retorted and what about you i was halfasleep damn it diana so was i dragging a hand through his hair again caine struggled against a sensation of confused frustrated fury as he fought for calm he grabbed his pants and stepped into them guilt was overwhelming guilt that hed taken her beyond the point shed been prepared for by doing so hed changed things between them just when hed resolved to keep them stable look it just happened i didnt plan it things like that dont just happen shivering she whipped the garish bedspread from the tumbled bed and wrapped herself in it this did caine said between his teeth as he pulled on his turtleneck even anger couldnt completely dissipate the feeling that he had woken from some hazy dream i dont even know how the hell it got started he muttered his eyes seared into hers he might be guilty but he wasnt alone i know when it ended and before it ended you were just as much involved as i was the truth stung and frightened you expect me to believe you didnt know what you were doing she shouted at him that you didnt plan for this to happen on an irresistible wave of fury he swooped up his coat and marched to her why the hell dont you blame me for the blizzard he demanded or for the fact that this this dump he bit off with a violent gesture of his arm only had one room or that the damn mattress sags in the middle i know exactly what to blame you for diana said and what to regret the room fell into deadly silence broken only by the sound of angry breathing and the rumble of the heater she saw something violent flash into his eyes darkening them narrowing them in her own confused fury she welcomed it and a fight you dont regret it any more than i do caine said softly without another word he pulled open the door letting windblown snow rush in before he slammed it behind him alone diana gripped the spread tightly but still felt the icy chill on her skin it was outrage she told herself fury shed trusted him and hed betrayed her deceived her hed made her feel wonderful alive desired a tiny choked sound escaped her as she dropped onto the bed and huddled under the spread no no she told herself as she balled her hands into fists it shouldnt have happened once she had given in to him and to herself it would be only the beginning wouldnt she be right back to having her life dominated by someone who could pick up and leave at any moment not again diana swore pounding her fist on her knee never again shed barely begun to discover herself for herself everywhere in every aspect of her life there was caine whod been there urging her to reconcile with justin hed been there with an answer to her professional problems on her return to boston now he was here tempting her to strip away her last defenses expose the last of her emotions would she be any different from irene walker if she allowed it diana wondered when a woman was ruled by emotion didnt she open herself to whatever a man chose to give her closing her eyes she bit down on her lip no she wouldnt couldnt allow it all of her life shed been forced to accept whatever someone chose to give her it had been a mistake she told herself and one she could have avoided if she hadnt dropped her guard and she had every right to be furious with caine hed exploited the situation hed aroused her when she had been drowsy and defenseless dianas shoulders slumped under the spread hed been no more to blame than shed been herself she admitted hadnt she been half dreaming when shed run her hands up his naked back couldnt she remember if she allowed herself to that misty sleepy pleasure in pressing her body against his somewhere in the back of her mind shed known exactly what she was doing and yet shed made no attempt to stop it then she had blamed caine because it was easier than admitting shed wanted to love him squeezing her eyes shut again diana pressed her fingers against her brow oh how could she have said those things to him how could she have acted like some outraged hypocrite when hed been every bit as overwhelmed as she had been pushing the hair away from her face she stared around the empty room what now she wondered apologize though the answer had her shifting uncomfortably dianas conscience held firm shed been wrong dead wrong and admitting it was the only way she could live with it remembering her hard accusing words she knew she couldnt blame him if he told her to take her apology and go to hell with it with a sigh diana rose shed take a hot shower dress and wait for him to come back two hours later diana paced the cramped little room caught somewhere between worry and annoyance what was he doing out there she asked herself for the hundredth time a peek through the drapes showed her that the snow was falling with the same steady speed again she considered going out and looking for him and again she reminded herself that caine had the only key diana wasnt going to depend on the likelihood of securing another from the clerk hes hardly walking around out there she told herself as she pushed the drapes apart again across the lot cars were halfburied in drifts she could see no sign of life only the endless blowing curtain of snow she imagined caine sitting over in the diner enjoying one of his enormous breakfasts and cup after cup of steaming coffee she grew irritated at the picture particularly as her own stomach insisted on reminding her it was empty he was doing it on purpose she decided twitching the curtains back into place punishing me the flood of guilt shed felt earlier was now completely obliterated by resentment and basic hunger infuriated and undeniably trapped between four pink walls diana snatched up her briefcase and flopped in the center of the unmade bed she wasnt going to waste time worrying about caine macgregor shed catch up on the rest of her paperwork and wait out the storm if he never came back she told herself it was perfectly all right with her pulling out her pad she poured all of her anger and frustration into her work nearly another hour had passed before diana heard the key rattle in the lock tossing down her pad she continued to sit crosslegged in the center of the bed as caine walked in covered with snow and in no better frame of mind than when he had walked out three hours earlier he glanced at her then shrugged out of his coat her initial intention of greeting him with an apology was overruled as was her second idea of ignoring him where the hell have you been diana demanded caine tossed his wet coat over the table the storms due to continue through the afternoon he said briefly there still arent any other vacancies in this place and the next hotels ten miles down the road diana felt another surge of guilt that slipped away as caine dropped into the chair and calmly lit a cigarette it didnt take you three hours to find that out she snapped didnt it occur to you that i was stuck in here he gave her a glance that would have been mild had his eyes not been so dark couldnt you find the door on a sound of fury diana scrambled off the bed you have the only key with a shrug caine reached in his pocket drew it out then dropped in on the table its all yours he told her as he leaned across to pull a small bag from his coat pocket i picked up a couple of toothbrushes she caught one as he tossed it at her thank you she said icily she wouldnt apologize diana thought if they were stuck in that dreadful little room for the next month since it appears were going to be marooned here for another night we should discuss the arrangements caine fought back anger as it boiled again if he lost it this time he warned himself he would very likely strangle her make whatever arrangements you like he said coolly im going to shave picking up the bag he rose just a minute diana pressed her hand to his chest as he started to walk by her were going to get this straight the chill in his eyes turned quickly to fire dont push me diana push you she retorted do you think you can calmly walk back in here announcing youre going to shave after what happened this morning do you think im going to shrug this off as though it were a slight error in judgment that he returned taking her wrist and holding it aloft would be very wise jerking her wrist free she stood firmly in his path well i wont and youre not going to shave or anything else until you hear exactly what i have to say i heard all i wanted to hear this morning giving her a nonetoogentle shove out of his way caine started toward the bathroom dont you dare walk away from me as the final hold over her temper snapped diana grabbed his arm ive had enough pushed beyond endurance caine spun back around grabbing her shoulders with enough force to cause her to gasp in alarm i dont have to take this from you he shouted i wont calmly stand here while you accuse me of resorting to some devious plan to get you into bed with me i dont need any plan do you understand i could have had you last night and half a dozen times before without any need for ploys he gave her a quick hard shake we both know it damn it i wanted you and you wanted me but you havent got the guts to admit it eyes wide with fury diana pulled out of his hold dont tell me what to admit this morning i was asleep are you awake now he demanded yes damn it im awake now and good in one swift move caine dragged her back in his arms and took her mouth in a hard savage kiss he heard her muffled sound of protest felt her frantic struggles for freedom but only crushed her more tightly against him he thought of punishment he thought of releasing the anger and the tension that had been building and building inside of him since that morning then he thought of how much he needed her and thought of nothing else with his fingers still digging into her shoulders he pulled her away breathing hard eyes locked they stared at each other diana felt desire pounding in her demanding freedom she shook her head once as if to deny it but like an avalanche it was already thundering its way down the mountain surrendering to all the needs raging inside her she pulled his mouth back to hers and took what she wanted there were no gentle sleepy explorations now they were both awake both ravenous each feeding from the others lips as though years had passed since they had tasted this kind of pleasure locked together already struggling against the barrier of clothing they fell into the bed now fury was all passion and passion all urgency impatient diana dragged the sweater over his head then made a deep pleased sound in her throat as her hands found those tight ridges of muscle desperate for more she shifted until she lay half across him her mouth hot and avid on his all the longings she had refused all the desires she had suppressed burst out in one violent explosion she couldnt get enough of him shed known almost from the first that he would be the one to unlock that last door shed had so tightly locked freedom she moaned with the heady painful thrill of it as she nipped into his bottom lip wanting to drive him as she was driven as she began to tug at the hips of his slacks caine groaned rolling on top of her again pushing her deep into the mattress as a lover he was no less than she had expected terrifying vital exciting the slow dreamy loving of the morning had been only a brief sample of what he could bring her to a wildness was growing in her some latent savageness she had once feared and now reveled in with it there were no rules her body was liberated pulsing everywhere at once arching as fluid as hot wine as he pulled clothes from her in a frenzy she heard a low throaty laugh that she didnt recognize as her own as he swore at the last barrier of silk as if driven mad by the sound caine crushed his mouth to hers again probing deep as his impatient hand tore the strap of the chemise in an effort to find her and her lips answered his with equal pressure equal turbulence it seemed akin to war this desperate demanding this frantic challenging his hands ran bruisingly over her and she pressed him closer daring him to take more she heard his ragged breathing match hers as his mouth rushed down to her breast to ravage greedily until they were both past the edge of control passion was a bluewhite fire now searing skin to skin the silk ripped again as he dragged it down mouth and hands speeding after it pausing only to find new surprising points of delight diana cried out when he drove his tongue into her center but it was a low smoky sound trailing off into a throaty moan her body was damp and agile her movements instinctive arousal came in titanic waves thrusting her up tossing her back cresting again and again and remaining strong as the musky scent of passion whirled in her head she was unaware of the breathless wild demands she uttered reality had spiraled down to one man one need in a single cloudy moment she realized they might be one and the same his name trembled from her lips but whatever words she would have spoken were only a gasp as he drove her to a staggering peak then his mouth was fused to hers again and even as her arms locked around him he took her over the final verge of reason lids heavy body sated diana opened her eyes and found herself staring at their twin reflections in the mirror above the bed experimentally she spread her fingers over his back and watched the movement in the glass how dark her skin looked next to his she thought hazily and what a contrast the colors of their hair made when side by side it was odd to watch his body move with the breathing she could hear and feel she ran her hands over his back again and watched the muscles ripple under them strong she thought with another tingle of pleasure strong and reckless and so diana thought with satisfaction was she sighing she let her fingers dive into his hair caine made a quick impatient sound and started to shift away with a murmured protest she tightened her arms diana lifting his head he stared down at her then with a brief oath he rolled away i didnt mean for that to happen it sounds a little weak after this morning but caine diana shifted so that she lay across his chest again dont she pressed her lips to his until she felt resistance ease im so sorry for the things i said this morning no she laid her fingertips over his mouth i was wrong i knew it even when i was shouting at you but i couldnt stop if id stopped i would have admitted that i wanted you letting her head fall to his shoulder she shut her eyes tight on a long sigh he ran a hand down her hair i didnt mean to touch you again when i came back here she gave a quiet laugh as she pressed her face into his shoulder and i was going to apologize when you got back somehow he murmured i think this was a much better idea for both of us diana he drew her away until their eyes met again ive never wanted anyone he said cautiously exactly the way i want you i dont want to hurt you will you believe that she opened her mouth to speak but knew he would never understand the doubts the lifetime of small fears no questions now she said instead touching her lips to his again no reasons this is enough fighting back the need to press her for more caine gathered her close to his side for now he agreed and found an astonishing surge of pleasure at simply having her lie beside him you know he began as his eyes drifted toward the ceiling im beginning to like this room after all it does have a fascinating view following the direction of his gaze diana gave a wry smile the next thing i know youll ask me for a quarter for the television in the reflection she saw his brow lift questioningly no okay he rolled on top of her ive always preferred doing things myself rather than spectating caine as he nibbled at her neck she sighed tilting her head to accommodate him i hate to bring up something so mundane but im starving mmhmm he ran his lips along her jawline as he traced the shape of her shoulders seriously starving how seriously as in willing to risk another one of those hamburgers that sounds more like desperately he murmured and with a groan he rolled aside okay ill go buy you another slice of ptomaine thanks she said dryly but sat up as he did the moment the contact between them had been broken shed felt some of the tension return foolish she told herself she was a grown woman and lovemaking was part of life wasnt it as simple as that ill go with you its nearly as bad out there as it was yesterday he began as he reached for his pants why did he have the need to gather her to him again reassure her and himself that nothing had changed everything had changed id like to get out of this room for awhile diana let her eyes scan the walls the pink is beginning to close in on me caine tugged his sweater on all right well eat at the scene of the crime he lifted a brow as diana examined her torn chemise i suppose youre going to say i owe you one of those i could take you to small claims court she declared slipping into her blouse without it caine gave a burst of appreciative laughter and grabbed her around the waist itd be worth it just to hear your opening statement as she tipped her head back to smile up at him he was drowned in a wave of emotion too strong to resist desire he told himself almost desperately just desire and desire was easy oh again he murmured before his mouth found hers the fingers that had been buttoning her blouse stilled her head tilted back in surrender but her mouth met his aggressively through parted lips came a sound of quiet lingering pleasure that seemed to skip into the core of him and expand once before she had felt that strange soft texture to his kiss it was infinitely gentle but seemed to demand more than passion when he released her diana was forced to blink to clear her vision caine she said wonderingly was he telling her or asking her or was it something within herself that was questioning he took a step back not quite comfortable with the feeling of uncertainty she could bring out in him im in the position of telling you to get dressed again he smiled but his eyes remained intense otherwise i wont be responsible if you go hungry with fingers that werent completely steady she finished buttoning her blouse i think you like confusing me she muttered im not very good with moods and yours never stays the same sometimes they keep me guessing too he said half to himself when she looked at him her eyes direct her mouth unsmiling he consciously fought off the tension she was vulnerable he was responsible he wasnt at all sure he could handle the responsibility play it light caine warned himself keep it simple maybe i like keeping you in the same mental state im in myself diana gave him one of her long deliberating looks before she smiled do i confuse you caine he met the look as he slipped into his shoes something vibrated in the room that both of them took great care not to notice im going to decline to answer that question at this time interesting diana pulled up the zipper of her skirt that leads me to assume that i do she slipped into her coat i think i like that youll need your gloves was all he said as he pocketed the key again the minute they stepped outside diana sucked in her breath at the force of the wind and the cold the flakes were smaller she thought as she hooked her arm firmly through caines but the wind was going to make the drifts treacherous even after they stopped falling still as she looked around even the battered little motel seemed rather clean and picturesque in its coating of white its not such a bad little place she decided while they struggled against the wind it looks even better after youve been out in this for a while there was a path of sorts through the four feet of snow where other tenants of the motel had fought their way to the diner and back again struggling through this diana still found herself buried up to her knees when she stumbled she tightened her grip on caine sure you dont want to go back in and wait caine shouted close to her ear are you kidding she lifted her face squinting against the flying snow is that it with her free hand diana pointed to the dim outline of a building with floodlights making an eerie glow against the unrelieved white yeah the places been doing a thriving roundtheclock business since the blizzard our notel has all thirtyfive rooms booked youre a fount of information god she went on before caine could retort i could eat two hamburgers well discuss your suicidal tendencies when we get inside here watch out he tightened his grip on her arm to guide her therere steps buried somewhere under here breathless diana stumbled through the door when caine pushed it open the heavy scent of frying grease hung in the air overlaid by tobacco smoke and something that might have been bacon several scratched plasticcoated tables were scattered around the long room with vinylcushioned chairs and paper placemats along the rear of the room was a counter with many of its stools already occupied by diners most of whom turned to stare at the newcomers in a covered dessert dish on the far end were a few tiredlooking doughnuts while behind the counter several signs announced the specials it seemed the meatloaf dinner with gravy was only three fortynine back again the chubby waitress behind the counter sent caine a cheery smile and brought your lady come on in and warm up honey she told diana you could use some coffee i bet yes the dingy atmosphere was forgotten in the face of the friendly greeting id love some coffees on the house as long as it lasts the waitress proclaimed setting two cups and saucers on the counter im peggy sit yourselves down and drink up hungry starving diana said recklessly as she slid onto a stool beside a young nervouslooking man with flyaway hair and glasses we got fresh vegetable soup today peggy told diana as she handed out thin handwritten menus been simmering all morning sounds fine caine decided with a glance at diana mmm for a start she agreed chewing on her bottom lips as she studied the menu two soups hal peggy shouted through the opening that led to the kitchen the blts are popular today she added yes all right that sounds good closing the menu diana reached for a plastic container of cream as the waitress called out the rest of the order caine leaned over nuzzling at dianas ear as he whispered into it eat all you want were going to stock up on candy bars and canned sodas to get through tonight youre so resourceful she murmured turning her head so that her lips met his you folks from out of town peggy asked as she refilled the coffee cup of the man beside diana boston caine told her taking out a cigarette at the small sound of distress from beyond diana he glanced over charlie here was on his way to boston too the waitress said giving the young mans hand a sympathetic pat with his bride she tucked a strand of tumbling blond hair behind her ear and sent caine a quick wink supposed to be our honeymoon charlie muttered staring into his coffee lori took one look at the room and started to cry oh diana gave him an understanding smile i suppose it isnt exactly what she was looking forward to we had reservations at the hyatt he lifted his head then pushing his glasses back on his nose loris very sensitive yes im sure at a loss diana met the helpless stare he looked she thought a bit like a little boy who hadnt found his bicycle under the christmas tree well ah perhaps you could make the room a little more romantic that room with a snort charlie turned back to his coffee candles diana suggested with sudden inspiration as the soup was set on the counter maybe someone has some candles well sure i got a few in the back room peggy said helpfully as she gave the counter a swipe with a rag your bride like candlelight charlie maybe he mumbled but his frown became more thoughtful of course she does diana stirred her soup while she watched him what woman doesnt like candlelight and flowers she added now where can we get flowers got a few plastic poinsettias in the back the waitress cut in getting into the spirit we use em at christmas you know really brightens up the place wonderful you think shed like that charlie asked diana i think shell be very touched well im going to go dig them up wiping her hands on her apron the waitress headed toward the back charlie leaned forward to look at caine what do you think struggling to keep his face grave caine glanced up from his soup i bow to a ladys opinion on matters such as this go ahead kid someone down the counter advised give it a shot yeah abruptly decisive he rose as peggy came back arms full yeah i will here you go honey she passed over three candles in plastic holders and several sprays of plastic poinsettia with large glittered red bows you go fix up your honeymoon suite your little brides gonna feel better thanks he grinned at diana as he stuffed as much as he could into his pockets thanks a lot good luck charlie diana called after him then swung back to her soup catching caines look she arched a brow i think its very sweet i didnt say a word you didnt have to you cynic when he only grinned at her diana turned back to her lunch eat your soup some of us she announced loftily appreciate romance should i buy another bottle of wine he murmured raising her hand to his lips dont you dare laughing she leaned over to kiss him chapter nine contents prev next behind her desk with the fire noisily burning diana worked at a steady pace shed given the walker case meticulous research careful thought and long hours the story diana felt was almost too typical irene walker had been young fresh out of college when she had married she had never worked her husband hadnt permitted it instead shed kept his home and fixed his meals dedicating her life to his comfort now that their marriage was breaking up irene had no income no training for outside work and a small infant to care for diana was going to see to it that she was compensated for the four years she had worked as housekeeper cook laundress and hostess the fact that irene had been the victim of wifebeating only made diana more determined that her client receive justice and ive got him diana thought with a sense of satisfaction as she closed a law book ive got george walker cold now if irene would just stick with those counseling sessions shaking her head diana reminded herself not to get in any deeper she was already much too emotionally involved in the chad rutledge case she couldnt afford to spread herself too thin chad she thought pressing her hands to her tired eyes a moment things were not moving as smoothly there as they were for irene walker diana had already called over half the names on the list he had given her so far none of the people who knew him or beth could give her any corroborating evidence i need something she thought tossing down her pen in disgust i have to go into court with something more than chads story and my own feelings if i cant break beths story on the stand leaning back in her chair diana stared up at the ceiling and thought through the case as it stood a pretty wellliked college student blond delicate privileged family background a tough streetwise hood with a belligerent attitude and a quick temper if it came down to his word against hers diana had little doubt what the outcome would be then there was the medical evidence berns condition when she was admitted to the hospital emergency room chads admission that he had been with her no she couldnt go into court with nothing more than a story about starcrossed lovers and expect it to work especially when she wasnt too sure of her client oh he was innocent diana mused frowning she didnt doubt that but she was very much afraid that hed lose his head if she started pressing beth too hard diana wouldnt put it past him to stand up in open court and make a full confession with a weary sigh diana reminded herself that she still had the last few names on chads list to contact there were two diana only had first names on which meant a trip to the university and a bit of detective work who said law was all books and briefs she thought then managed a smile for the first time in more than an hour this was what she wanted diana distracted she glanced up oh yes lucy im going to leave now unless you need me for something she found a thread hanging from the sleeve of her dress wrapped it around two fingers and snapped it off caine checked in about half an hour ago his meeting ran over but he said hed be stopping in here before going home oh diana didnt notice lucys speculative look as she gazed into the fire no lucy you go on home i have some things i want to finish up here ill lock up want me to make some coffee before i leave hmm oh no smiling diana glanced back up no thanks have a nice evening you have one too lucy told her with a last meaningful look before she walked back down the hall tell caine i left his messages on his desk all right diana pondered the empty doorway for a moment lucy she decided was a great deal shrewder than that placid round face indicated and i thought i was being so discreet diana thought with a rueful smile working very calmly very practically day after day with caine just next door keeping up the polite friendly tone of colleagues in the same office building but it seemed lucy had caught something a look a gesture a tone of voice diana wondered just how realistic she had been in thinking she could keep her relationship with caine strictly between them she wondered suddenly why she had felt it necessary thoughtful diana rose to walk to the fire it was burning low now the coals piled high and glowing red stooping she added a log and watched it catch with violent snaps and hisses perhaps her emotions had been like that low and carefully banked until caine had come into her life now she knew what it was to feel wild bursts of flame fast crackling heat it was impossible always impossible to remain calm and controlled when she was with him it frightened her he frightened her caine and his ability to make her want him with unrestrained and uninhibited passion caine and his ability to make her think of him at odd moments emotion seemed to come so effortlessly to him and the demonstration of emotion shed been trained for so long to suppress passions control surges of feelings even now that she was freer with them more comfortable with some of them she was poles apart from caine shed never have his spontaneity or his careless selfease diana envied him while not completely understanding him she did understand however that caine had the ability to dominate by force of personality alone perhaps that was why she had insisted that they keep their relationship on a firmly professional level during business hours diana was struggling to hold on to those hours to keep them as a time where she still had complete control over her actions her feelings and her thoughts im going to fall in love with him if im not careful diana thought with a flutter of panic as she watched flames lap greedily around the new log if i havent already catching her bottom lip between her teeth she tried to think clearly but found as she found so often when she attempted to reason her feelings for caine that logic had no place there she wished there was a way to escape him she wished he would come back so that she could be with him with a sound of annoyance she turned away from the fire then heard the phone begin to ring in his office a glance at her watch told her it was nearly six and the offices were officially closed shrugging diana walked next door to answer caine macgregors office she said as she fumbled for the switch on the lamp is he back yet a booming voice demanded no im sorry diana picked up a pen as she slipped into caines chair mr macgregors out of the office may i take a message where is that boy exasperation came clearly over the wire so clearly diana held the receiver a few inches from her ear ive been trying to reach him all afternoon im sorry mr macgregors been in a meeting shall i have him return your call tomorrow damn boy never could stay put the voice muttered i beg your pardon hah dianas brow lifted at the exclamation id be happy to take your name and number and any message youd care to leave this isnt lucy the man stated suddenly where the devils lucy amused and just a bit perplexed diana put down the pen lucys gone for the day this is diana blade im mr macgregors associate is there something justins sister the voice interrupted in a bellow ill be damned now ive been wanting to have a few words with you girl id heard youd set up business there with caine yes she began growing more bewildered do you know my brother know him there was an explosion of laughter of course i know him girl i let him marry my daughter didnt i oh as the light dawned diana sat back in caines chair hadnt she been warned about daniel macgregor how do you do mr macgregor ive heard a great deal about you hah he snorted you dont listen to that son of mine do you she laughed idly toying with the phone cord not even aware that she was relaxing for the first time in eight hours caine speaks very highly of you mr macgregor im sorry youve missed him hmm well he paused as the germ of an idea formed in his mind so youre a lawyer too are you yes i was at harvard a few years behind caine small world small world rena tells me you favor justin good stock ah well a little nonplussed by the phrase diana trailed off good bloods an important thing dont you know yes brows knit she shook her head i suppose no supposing to it girl got to keep the line strong ive a birthday coming up he announced suddenly congratulations i didnt want any fuss he began breezily but my wife loves a party dont like to disappoint her no diana agreed with the beginnings of a smile of course you wouldnt she misses the children you know yes off they went in every direction he said in a pained voice and not a grandchild between them ah diana said again for lack of anything better a few grandchildren to spoil in her winter years he continued with a sigh but when do children think about their parents needs id like to know well anna wants all the children here next weekend he interrupted a family gathering well want caine to bring you along thank you mr macgregor i daniel girl after all youre part of the family now back in hyannis port daniel gave a crafty secret smile his careless words disguised the macgregors look after their own yes im sure she murmured then laughed id love to come for your birthday daniel good thats settled then you tell caine his mother wants him here friday night a lawyer too hmm thats handy aye thats handy friday night diana yes baffled again she stared at caines desk goodbye daniel diana hung up with the odd feeling she had agreed to something entirely different from a weekend visit to hyannis port sitting back in caines chair she thought over the conversation it seemed she mused that daniel macgregor was every bit as eccentric as his legend claimed i wonder how much caines like him diana reflected idly certainly caine had inherited his fathers skill in dominating a conversation when he chose and there was something in the laugh if she hadnt been thrown off by the way hed bellowed into the phone diana would have recognized the macgregor patriarch by the faint scottish burr and what in the world was all that business about good stock hearing the front door open and close diana rose from the desk to walk to the top of the stairs hi as he tossed his coat over a hook on the hall rack caine glanced up hi recognizing the fatigue in the single syllable diana went down to him howd it go he flexed his back three hours with ginnie day diana needed no more lifting her hands she began to knead at the tension in his shoulders you dont like her she said as caine let out a quiet sigh no i dont he stretched under dianas hands shes spoiled selfish and vain she has the courtesy of a nasty fiveyearold it must have been a very pleasant afternoon diana murmured caine chuckled and lifted his hands to her wrists i dont have to like her i just have to defend her it would be easier if ginnie herself wasnt the das best weapon theres no way to make a jury see her as a sympathetic victim most of the emotionll be on the prosecutions side while ill have to stick with straight law youre going for a bench trial diana said as she studied her face a hint of a smile played on his mouth as he nodded in agreement id rather present this kind of case to a judge when i told ginnie she had a temper fit and fired me laughing at dianas outraged expression caine cupped her face in his hands then kissed her for about five minutes he added she might be rude but shes not stupid it sounds to me as though it would have served her right if youd taken her dismissal at face value and walked out would you he countered her face relaxed into a smile no but id have been tempted are you through for the day yeah his hand slipped to her waist to gather her closer absolutely then get your coat she ordered on an impulse that would have surprised her even weeks before im going to take you to dinner then she added as she took her own coat from the hook im going to lure you back to my place really really here gravely diana handed him his coat caine studied her noting that her eyes were as confident as her words he touched her hair i like your style counselor macgregor diana returned as she buttoned his coat herself you havent seen anything yet flushed with cold and gripping an icy bottle of champagne diana opened the door of her apartment dinner had relaxed them slowly nudging the demands of their work the people whose lives and problems dominated so many of their hours to the back of their minds now they were just a man and a woman with lives and problems of their own ill get the glasses diana stated handing the bottle to caine he glanced idly at the label i suppose you intend to fuddle my mind with champagne coming back with two tulip glasses she smiled im counting on it why dont you open that lifting a brow caine tore the foil from the top of the bottle i might not be as easily manipulated as you think oh no diana set down the glasses then slid her hands up the front of his suit jacket slipping it off him this time she would test her own strengths and his weaknesses this time she wouldnt be led she would lead an open and shut case she murmured nibbling lightly on his bottom lip as she loosened the knot of his tie when she felt his arms come around her she drew back keeping her lips inches from his how about that champagne didnt we drink it already on a low laugh she caught the end of his tie between her thumb and forefinger no slowly she slipped the tie off and tossed it aside she felt a quick thrill at her own action and wondered if he felt it too why dont you pour it she murmured undoing the first three buttons of his shirt ill put on some music as she crossed the room diana stepped out of her shoes she turned the stereo on low so that the soft bluesy number was hardly more than a whisper when she dimmed the lights caine glanced over to see her slip off her pinecolored blazer i think he said quietly as he filled the both glasses im in trouble with a laugh that was more of a sigh diana walked back to him you are in trouble taking a glass she sat on the sofa and pulled him down beside her deep trouble she added nipping at his ear maybe i should put myself entirely in your hands turning his head he found her mouth with his but she allowed him only the briefest taste my thoughts exactly she touched the rim of her glass to his then drank have i ever told you she began while her fingers began to toy with the curls that fell over his ears that you fascinate me no do i caine lifted his hand to draw her closer but diana caught it in hers yes slowly she brought his hand to her lips pressing them against his palm tonight she would be all woman only a woman strong hands watching him she kissed his fingers one by one one of the first things i noticed was that they werent the soft lawyers hands id expected i wondered how theyd feel on my skin she laced her fingers with his as she brought the glass to her lips again feeling desire sprint through him caine stared at her she was mesmerizing him he hadnt known she could and the feeling left him burning and oddly weak in the dim light her eyes were dark and mysterious with the seductively languid look that had stirred him from the first moment diana then there was your mouth she went on letting her eyes linger on it such a clever mouth she brushed her lips lightly over his the first time you kissed me i couldnt think of anything else exciting she whispered tilting her head back ever so slightly when he sought to deepen the kiss and at times indescribably gentle i could spend hours and hours doing nothing more than kissing you but she shifted away to watch him over the rim of her glass as she drank champagne diana caines voice was low as he cupped his hand around her neck to drag her closer diana kept herself a frustrating distance away with her hand against his chest more time she thought greedily she wanted more of it to explore a power shed just discovered i like your eyes she murmured she could feel his need the tension of his need in the fingers that pressed into her skin he had always driven her quickly beyond control each time he touched her this time she thought flushed with power this time she would drive him then revel in the consequences i like the way they darken when you want me i can see it she spread her fingers over his chest i love seeing it youre tense as she felt his heart thud furiously beneath her palm her own speeded up to race with it you should drink your champagne and relax throbbing he met the challenge in her eyes through sheer force of will he lightened his grip and fought back the first flood of need she fully intended to drive him mad and knowing it caine determined to regain some control you know that i want you keeping his eyes on hers he lifted the glass you know that ill have you perhaps she smiled again as she shook back her hair her scent seemed to drift out from it to wrap around him the wine bubbled icily over her tongue adding to the sense of power i think of storms when i think of making love to you leisurely she ran a fingertip down his shirtfront then back up to loosen the rest of the buttons that morning on the beach when i first kissed you that little motel room in the blizzard storms and wind strange i never get a picture of anything placid she ran her hand over his naked chest slowly very slowly moving down if you want me to be gentle he managed as the soft touch of her fingers tore at his restraint this isnt the way did i say thats what i wanted she asked with a low laugh watching him diana took his mouth again this time allowing the kiss to linger his mind clouded her taste that wicked scent setting his glass aside caine plunged both hands into her hair and dove into the kiss more was all he could think he had to have more and still more her mouth had softened seductively under his with a deceptive surrender he would have recognized had his mind been as clear as his need her quiet sigh seemed to race through him with his breathing already labored caine reached for the zipper at the back of her dress not yet not yet diana ordered herself as her thoughts began to swim passion was lapping at her as the flames had lapped at the log she had watched in the fire but she wanted something more tonight she wanted a few more moments of control she wanted to prove to herself that she could erase every layer of the polish that lay over the dangerous inner man she had once feared what would happen if the two of them came together without that safe gloss of sophistication now she craved it feeling her dress begin to loosen she pulled away diana caine began on a half groan but she evaded him and rose dont you want any more champagne she asked pouring more into her glass in one quick move caine stood and grabbed her arm you know damn well what i want another thrill of excitement sped into her reflecting in her eyes even as she kept her voice low yes impulsively she drained her glass then held it lightly by the stem such a civilized drink take me to bed she invited softly as she stepped closer and make love to me as the last thread of control snapped caine yanked her against him the glass fell to the rug to roll across the room here he demanded and now with his mouth crushed on hers he dragged her to the floor his hands seemed to be everywhere at once seeking finding while his mouth stayed fused to hers diana gloried in it and while her body wildly responded sought to drive him further from reason her mouth was aggressive meeting his with a hot hungry fury that could only partially show the needs raging inside her she would feed on his desire even while she stoked it she pulled the shirt from his back and when his mouth freed hers briefly nipped her teeth lightly into his shoulder with a halfmuffled oath caine crushed her roaming mouth with his again he peeled the dress from her quickly hands rushing to possess the soft naked skin desire was stabbing at him painful forcing him to hurry where he would have lingered driving him to take quickly what he would have savored he thought he had felt need before but it had never been like this unreasonable unmanageable a rough urgency took the place of skill when he at last had her naked beneath him her taste filled him but he hadnt the patience to relish it her soft rounded curves entranced him but he hadnt the will to wait the whispering music seemed to be all bass and drums now pounding taunting and her scent promised no more and no less than the passion of the woman beneath him he swore once with no knowledge of whom of what he was cursing then took her with a force that had her gasping out his name halfmad he covered her mouth with his and swallowed the sounds he drove her drove himself until there was only blinding heat and whirling colors caine knew nothing else savagely he wanted nothing else caught in the vortex of the storm they moved like lightning until shattered their strength drained with something like pain he felt sanity return still he couldnt move his breath came in gasps he couldnt control as he buried his face in her hair he was trembling he realized with a small sliver of fear no woman no passion had ever made him tremble what was she doing to him he wondered as he tried to catch his breath the last thing he clearly remembered was pulling her to the floor all the rest came back as sensations they might have lain there for ten minutes or for hours he couldnt think even now that the desperation had passed he still couldnt think had he hurt her his mood had been close to violent when he had dragged her to the floor thered been something about the way she had looked at him when shed told him to take her to bed in that moment he had lost all sense of time and place and any tenuous claim hed still held to being civilized dazed caine lifted his head to look down at her her eyes were open though those long heavy lids were nearly closed her skin held that flushing glow of passion just spent incredibly he felt fresh desire ripple through him dropping his face back into her hair he took deep steadying breaths he needed a minute he told himself good god he needed a minute or hed take her like a madman again sighing his name diana ran her hands over his back thered been something in his eyes just then shed never expected to see vulnerability she didnt feel power now but wonder and something else that made her touch gentle and soothing no she hadnt expected to see vulnerability and even as she nestled closer diana wasnt certain she wanted to see it seeing it in his eyes only forced her to face her own weakness slowly and with uncanny success hed scaled the walls of her defenses and things werent so simple any longer she could feel his heartbeat begin to level the breath that feathered over her ear grew steadier when caine lifted his head again his eyes werent giving away any secrets youre a surprising woman diana he kissed her but touched the lips still warm and swollen from his gently why she murmured all that passion all that fire he added as his lips continued to nibble at hers in a woman who takes such pains to be dignified cool unflappable you wanted to make me crazy didnt you she sighed as his mouth began to feast at her throat triumph glowed through her shed discovered one more part of diana blade i did make you crazy his lips curved into a smile against her skin before he lifted his head again well have that champagne now before i take you to bed as you asked caine poured more wine into the glass on the table then offered it to her we seem to have lost the other glass well share this one sitting up diana drank letting the champagne pour through her with its icy effervescence its tastes even better now she said with a smile as she passed it back to caine as you said he sipped as his eyes answered her smile a civilized drink diana caine lifted his hand to her hair and watched his fingers comb through it stay with me at my place this weekend we can eat in watch old movies the grin touched his eyes again neck on the sofa were both going to be under a lot of pressure these next few weeks with the cases coming to trial it might be the last time for quite a while that well have the time to be together like this the picture he painted was tempting and frightening one more step into intimacy yet even as a part of her wanted to back away she couldnt resist i cant think of anything id rather oh with a look of comic dismay on her face diana paused in the act of reaching for the glass your father with a chuckle caine took another sip before he handed her the wine what does my father have to do with it he called i forgot completely her eyes laughed at him as she drank i believe weve received a royal summons oh cain traced a fingertip over the slope of her shoulder enjoying how dark and smooth her skin looked in the dim light for the weekend diana elaborated laughing out loud when his fingertip stopped the weekend your fathers birthday leaning across him diana filled the glass again he doesnt want a fuss you know but your mother of course with a wry smile caine shifted so that he could replace his fingertip with his lips my quiet undemanding father would simply treat his birthday as any other day of the year hell only go through the noise and fuss and bother of a party for my mothers sake and naturally hell only accept presents because she expects it if it were up to him the day would pass without a thought chuckling diana struggled to concentrate on his words as he began to lightly caress her well it was very sweet of him to include me in the invitation im looking forward to it i enjoyed talking to him even if the conversation was a bit confusing how he carefully traced her ear with his tongue taking the glass from her as it began to slip through her fingers mmm he said something about justin and i being from good stock caine as he caught the lobe in his teeth diana lost track of her own words what else he murmured pleased that her voice was unsteady and her body pliant against his it wasnt often he could coax her into this kind of surrender sweet and complete this time they would go slowly and he would savor every moment something something about it being handy we were both lawyers somehow she was cradled in his arms with his lips roaming her face his hands roaming her body and she was helpless i see and he did with a sigh that was halfamused halfexasperated caine continued to take her deeper did rena ever mention to you how she and justin happened to meet what drugged her eyes already closed her body already melting she couldnt understand the question or the need for it no no she didnt caine make love to me he wondered how she would react when she learned his father had engineered rena and justins meeting in the hope of their making a match he wondered how she would react when she learned daniel macgregor wasnt above applying a bit of genial pressure to secure what he might feel was a suitable mate for his youngest son and that she would fit the bill very nicely he wondered as his lips toyed with hers how he felt about the idea himself but it wasnt a night for thinking caine decided as her arms wound around his neck it wasnt a night for thinking at all rising he lifted her and took her to bed chapter ten contents prev next diana sat behind her desk staring into the fire that crackled and spat in the hearth in her hand she held irene walkers file numb she stayed perfectly still as a log crumbled quietly in the grate she couldnt believe it even running the conversation over again in her mind diana couldnt believe it charges dropped divorce action canceled glancing down diana studied the neatly written check that had been left on her desk paid in full thanks but no thanks irene walker had decided to give her husband another chance hes so sorry that he hurt me diana could hear irenes soft apologetic voice as if her former client were still in the room and he promised it would never happen again never happen again diana thought letting the file folder drop no therapy no counseling but it would never happen again irene walker lived in a dream world diana thought grimly and the next nightmare might leave her with more than a few loose teeth and some bruises damn after pounding a fist on the folder diana sprang up damn we had him cold all that paperwork all those hours of careful research for nothing and sooner or later irene would be back to go through the whole ugly mess again diana stared at the neat manila folder knowing every word it contained yes she would be back it was inevitable frustration drove diana to whirl to the window to glare out at the frosttipped branches how could irene love him after everything hed done to her how could she want to go back take her child back to that kind of life it would be like living with an open keg of gunpowder dear god diana thought on a sigh of disgust what a pitiful wasted life at the knock on her door she continued to stare out at the naked trees and frosty hedges yes bad time caine asked crossing the threshold but coming no farther into the room with her temper heating up diana turned irene walker she said moving to the desk to pick up the file she just reconciled with her husband caine glanced at the file then up into the smoldering fury in dianas eyes i see how could she be such a fool diana put the folder back down and strode to the fire he calls her up sweettalks her into seeing him then with a few roses for good measure convinces her hes a new man caine walked to the desk noting the check maybe he is are you joking diana demanded spinning around why should a few weeks separation make any difference shes left him before shed never started divorce proceedings before he pointed out that and the threat of a criminal action might make a man do some serious thinking oh hes done some thinking she agreed bitterly no he didnt want to face a possible jail sentence he didnt want to lose his wife and child and a good portion of his income but whats he done to deserve clemency nothing dragging a hand through her hair diana paced the room he wont agree to therapy or marriage counseling she says he doesnt want to make their problems public public she repeated gesturing broadly she burns the meat and he beats her in the backyard in front of the neighbors but he doesnt want to discuss the problem with a professional and she diana trailed off dropping into a chair shes hopeless how can she love someone who periodically uses her for a punching bag do you think she loves him caine countered do you really believe love has anything to do with it why else wouldnt it make sense to say shes more afraid of being on her own than she is of risking another beating crouching down in front of her caine took dianas hand diana loves a strong motivation but it isnt always the reason for staying with something even when it hurts maybe not i dont know the feeling of helplessness swamped her again love she didnt understand it for most of her life hadnt had to deal with it but it seemed love was the one emotion that turned a reasonably intelligent person into a fool it was a maze she thought in frustration full of dead ends wrong turns and potholes she thinks she loves him diana said at length because of that shes risking everything were lawyers he reminded her not psychiatrists irene walkers problem is no longer a legal one i know on a long breath she squeezed his hand but its so frustrating to know she couldve been helped even he couldve been helped and now now you take her folder file it and forget it caine gave her a long steady look you dont have any other choice its hard yeah but its necessary we can only advise in a legal frame diana we can only work with the law once something goes beyond that its out of our hands it has to be out of our hands he added why didnt we choose something simpler she murmured and something less painful it looks so basic from the outside this is right and this is wrong according to the law and this is how we might get around it legally speaking with a sigh of frustration she shook her head then suddenly therere people involved and its not so simple i wanted to help her damn it caine i really wanted to help her you cant help someone unless theyre ready for help and irene walker isnt ready for help diana nodded but her eyes still smoldered how could she explain that she saw the walker case her first case out on her own as her first failure both professionally and personally diana had felt that freeing irene from bondage would somehow have symbolized her own liberation from another kind of domination irenes was physical hers had been emotional and neither had been healthy i was ready to help her she said after a long breath i needed to help her he saw it then the vulnerability that could creep so unexpectedly into her eyes and bring him twin urges to protect and to run for cover caine stayed where he was while a quiet war raged inside him you cant keep drawing parallels diana she closed down instantly her emotional withdrawal should have relieved him he wished it had i have to work my own way she told him flatly we all do caine agreed in the same tone he should have left it at that but even as he told himself to he went on trying to reach her i defended a kid once drinking while intoxicated first offence i got him off with the minimum three months later he wrapped his car around a telephone pole and killed his passenger his eyes darkened with the memory but remained steady on hers she was seventeen years old oh caine at a loss diana could only reach for his hand we all carry around our baggage diana we can only do the best job we can and hope its right when its wrong or when one gets away from us we file it away youre right the anger seeped out of her as she rose i know youre right deliberately she took the walker file and dropped it into her desk drawer case closed she murmured as she shut the drawer lucy tells me you have two other clients coming in next week making an effort diana shook off the depression and looked back at him i handled them when i was with barclay they must have been satisfied caine grinned at her expression pleased with yourself well after all theyre coming to me not barclay stevens and fitz walking over he lifted his hands to her shoulders the tension was gone youre going to be very busy i certainly hope so with a smile diana slid her hands around his waist in order to become the best defense attorney on the east coast i require clients it helps caine agreed and gave her a quick kiss on the nose in the meantime its he glanced at his watch four fortyseven on friday evening so late diana smiled ruefully ive been brooding for some time are you finished brooding for the day yes absolutely then lets go my fatherll carry on for an hour if were late dont tell me youre worried about a tonguelashing diana asked with a laugh as she took her purse from the bottom drawer of her desk you dont know my father caine told her pulling her out the door diana found the trip relaxing and quick caine had been right she decided in telling her to file and forget the walker case and for the weekend she would slip chad rutledge and her other cases to the back of her mind it was time for the lawyer to ease off so that the woman could breathe she could look forward to seeing justin again with none of the doubts and pain shed taken with her to atlantic city perhaps this time they would be simply brother and sister a family though not on the same order as the macgregor clan it was natural to think of them as a clan diana had already seen caines close relationship with his sister even if it hadnt been obvious from the way caine had spoken of the rest of his family the phone call from daniel clearly showed just how much a family in every sense of the word the macgregors were diana found herself intrigued and a bit intimidated with the idea what she knew of family relationships was all secondhand that she mused meant she knew virtually nothing at all in boston caine macgregor was a dynamic successful attorney with a reputation for winning and women in boston he was her lover and her associate in hyannis port caine was a son and a brother diana knew very little of that side of him would he be different she mused wouldnt he have to be in her aunts house diana had always been a different person following a different set of rules logically she thought the same would hold true for caine as the car climbed higher diana caught a few glimpses of the sound with waves tossing below for a moment she lost herself in it appreciating the rocks froth and energy but when she looked up again her impression of nantucket sound faded with a new image the house was gray against the cold winter sky huge and structured like a fortress it stood with its back to the water there was a fairytale aura about it set apart built high standing against a dark moonless sky with dozens of windows burning with light it was ostentatious a bit foolish and unapologetically pretentious oh caine its wonderful diana leaned forward as the jaguar sped closer what a marvelous place to grow up its the closest thing to a scottish castle ive ever seen outside of a book my fathers going to be crazy about you with a half grin he glanced at her not everyone has the same impression of it at first glance my father has a few quirks he decided after a moment he built the house to please himself i cant think of a better reason to build one she tilted her head so that she could see the top of the tower there was a flag blowing wildly in the wind diana didnt need to see the colors to know it would be a scottish flag you must have loved growing up here yeah caine allowed his gaze to sweep from the tower to the sea wall it was odd he thought that dianas reaction brought him both pleasure and relief until that moment he hadnt realized how disappointed he would have been if shed been politely stunned yeah he repeated as his lips curved i guess we all did its huge and the devil to heat everythings done on a grand scale wide drafty corridors high ceilings and fireplaces you could roast an ox in gothic arches granite pillars and a wine cellar thats the closest thing to a dungeon ive ever seen we used to play spanish inquisition down there oh diana sent him an appalled look what lovely children you must have been i like to think we were inventive laughing she turned her attention back to the house it must be difficult to stay away no because you know its always going to be here and you can come back therere memories in every room caine swung the car around the circular drive and stopped maybe i should warn you that the inside is exactly what youd expect from the outside dungeons and all diana agreed with a nod as she stepped out i wouldnt have it any other way well get the bags later his hand linked with hers caine started up the rough granite steps on the door was a large brass knocker in the shape of a lions head caine pounded it against the wood as he read the gaelic inscription over it royal is my race he translated with a grin im impressed of course you are bending down he touched his lips to hers then with a quiet sound of pleasure he drew her closer and so am i he murmured before he deepened the kiss instinctively she wrapped her arms around him pressing her body against the warmth of his as the night wind whipped around them it was easy always so easy to forget everything but the feel and the taste of him she felt his fingers brush over the nape of her neck as he tangled them in her hair her head tilted back inviting more as her bones began to soften thats one way to ward off the chill dianas head whipped around at the voice leaning against the door was a tall angular man with dark brooding looks and a full sculptured mouth that was curved in a smile its the only way caine returned and gave the man a hard unselfconscious hug my brother alan caine told diana as he drew her inside out of the cold diana blade with her hand enveloped in the senators firm quick grip diana found herself quietly and thoroughly summed up there was something about that dark intense look she thought a bit uncomfortably that would brush away the nonsense and get right to the core he was more like caine than she had imagined even though there was almost no resemblance between them physically its good to have you here diana alans gaze changed so swiftly from intense to welcoming she wondered if she had imagined that brief appraisal everyones in the throne room at dianas lifted brow caine laughed and drew off her coat a family term for one of the drawing rooms its a barn carelessly he tossed their coats over the carved lions head that served as a newel post for the main staircase rena here she and justin were already settled in when i got here alan answered diana watched the silent subtle look that passed between the brothers well i guess that puts me at the top of the list then alan grinned a quick unexpected expression that lightened his features yeah caine swung an arm around dianas shoulders as they began to walk down the hall bringing diana should redeem me he shot his brother another look you come alone i take it ive already had the lecture alan returned dryly thirtyfive years old and without a wife he stated in a soft burr remarkably like his fathers im in disgrace better you than me caine murmured should i know what you two are talking about diana demanded with a puzzled smile caine looked down at her then up to meet his brothers amused eyes you will he muttered soon enough diana opened her mouth to question then was interrupted by the sound of a booming voice echoing off the walls the boy should come and see his mother more often children today are a disgrace what do they think about the line their ancestors and the generations to come wheres the pride in the family name hes off and running caine said under his breath he paused his arm still around dianas shoulders at the entrance to the drawing room to say the room was impressive would have been an understatement it had the dimensions of a ballroom with one huge claretcolored rug spreading from wall to wall at the far end was an enormous stone fireplace piled high with wood and flame the windows ran from floor to ceiling along one side with stainedglass inserts along the top the drapes were red and heavy but spread open so that the fire danced in reflection on the many panes furniture was gothic and oversized to suit the room a belter table held an ornate urn and a porcelain casket box the paintings against the thick dark paneling were all in fussy gilded frames sitting on the stone hearth was a lifesize statue of a jackal though there were no less than a dozen chairs and sofas scattered about the family was grouped in one section around a wide highbacked chair carved and curved like a throne and upholstered in the same red as the carpet and drapes in it sat a barrel of a man redbearded strikingly handsome in a bold warlike fashion it was a simple matter for diana to imagine him with a kilt and dirk rather than the fullcut italian suit he wore there was a woman to his right with fineboned features and dark slightly graying hair as daniel continued with his complaints her expression remained serene while her fingers were busy forming a pattern with floss and needle in a cloth held taut on a standing hoop to the left serena was curled on a curved overstuffed lounge idly watching the colors of the fire reflect in a glass of kirsch justin sat beside her his arm draped carelessly over the back of the lounge his fingers toying absently with his wifes hair theyre his court diana thought as her lips curved and theyve heard this proclamation hundreds of times before what a magnificent man she decided watching daniel drain the liquor in his glass before he continued it seems a small thing to ask daniel went on to have your children pay their respect to their father on his birthday it might be my last one he added shooting a look at his daughter you say that every year caine commented before serena could retort its his traditional threat serena stated as she sprang up to race to caine she hugged him fiercely giving him a hard kiss before turning to hug diana im so glad you came serena told her then took both her hands diana was as overwhelmed by the greeting as she was warmed by it she found the macgregors unselfconsciously physical shows of affection appealed to her while leaving her uncertain if she were capable of returning them im glad to be here you look wonderful with a laugh serena kissed her again ill pour your drinks give me a hand alan you need one too diana turning diana saw justin standing beside her pleasure and a sudden sense of awkwardness ran through her so that while her eyes lit with the first her hand reached for his with the second justin took it then lacing his fingers with her drew diana to him will you kiss me little sister he would ask diana thought as the clear green eyes stayed on hers to give her the choice of backing away rising on her toes she brushed his lips with hers and felt the awkwardness vanish oh its good to see you justin on impulse she wrapped her arms around him and held tight its so good to see you justin kissed the top of her head returning the embrace as his gaze drifted to caines he felt something the instinct that tells a person when two people close to him are intimate the knowledge flashed into his eyes as caine met his stare without faltering caine read justins expression easily and kept silent he remembered exactly how hed felt when he had found serena sharing justins suite at the comanche annoyed uncomfortable possessive protective all the feelings an older brother has when he suddenly discovers his sisters grown up in front of his eyes their friendship spanned a decade but fate had sent them a curve so that each had found himself attracted to the others sister ties of friendship and ties of blood ran strong in both of them caine justin brought diana to his side holding her there a moment as he tried to sort out his emotions well damn it are you going to keep the girl in the doorway or are you going to bring her in daniel demanded giving an impatient wheeze as he hauled himself out of his chair let me have a look at that sister of yours justin rena my glass is empty its nice to see you too caine drawled as he crossed the room hah daniel exclaimed as he gave him a stern look caine merely grinned at him until the folds on daniels wide face shifted with a bellowing laugh disrespectful young pup he gathered his son to him in a bear hug and gave him three hearty slaps on the back youre late your mother was worried you werent coming as long as i havent missed dinner caine unfolded himself from his father and went to anna so this is diana daniel clasped her by both shoulders a fine looking girl he decided with a quick nod youve a bit of your brother in you tall strong he went on aye blood will tell diana lifted a brow at the greeting thank you daniel i appreciate you including me in your family weekend ah but youre part of the family now arent you swinging her around he faced his wife a handsome girl aye anna lovely anna agreed then held out her hands dont let him make you feel like a thoroughbred at auction diana its just a habit of his come sit down a thoroughbred at auction daniel blustered now what kind of talk is that straight talk caine said casually as he sat on the arm of the sofa beside his mother thanks rena he gave his sister a wink as she passed out drinks daniel harrumphed and settled back into his thronelike chair so we have another lawyer in the family he began caine shot him a long deadly look but he continued placidly i have great respect for the law you know having two sons who passed the bar of course alans so busy with politics he doesnt take the time for anything else youre top of the list now caine muttered under his breath causing his brother to shrug and you went to harvard too daniel stated between sips now thats a coincidence for you small world small world his gaze skimmed briefly over his youngest son and now you two are partners were not partners caine and diana said in unison then shot each other a rueful look arent you now his fathers smile caine thought was entirely too bland now i wonder where i got an idea like that well he gave diana a paternal smile rena tells me you grew up in boston diana anna interrupted tranquilly as she began to embroider again do you know the omarra family my aunt was well acquainted with a louise omarra yes louise and what was her husbands name brian yes brian and louise omarra odd people anna smiled as she finished another stitch they really enjoy playing bridge a chuckle escaped diana before she could muffle it glancing up she caught annas quick knowing wink i hate the game myself anna went on stitching again perhaps because im so poor at it no caine corrected giving her hair a tug youre poor at it because you hate it the omarras have three grandchildren if im not mistaken daniel put in then narrowed his gaze as it swept around the room nice try caine murmured to his mother how do you feel about children diana daniel leaned back in his chair and fixed his clever eyes on her children she heard a muffled laugh from behind her which alan disguised halfheartedly with a fit of coughing caine muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like an oath well i havent had a great deal of experience with them she began sending caine a puzzled look where would we be without children daniel demanded leaning forward again to give us that sense of continuity of responsibility as he spoke he punctuated his words with a thump of his finger on the arm of his chair your glass is empty caine said abruptly and rose keep it up he said under his breath as he took the glass from his fathers hand and ill dilute every bottle of scotch in the house well now daniel cleared his throat and considered the possibility dinner should be ready soon shouldnt it anna i think serena whispered to justin that we might take a bit of the pressure off our siblings go ahead justin brushed his lips over her cheek im dying to see his face speaking of children serena said ignoring the fulminating look caine shot at her i think dad has a very good point a good point daniel repeated bouncing back to the topic with gusto of course i have a good point its disgraceful your mother without a single grandchild to spoil heartbreaking serena murmured sending her mother a wink well justin and i have decided to remedy that in about six and a half months and about time daniel began then stopped as his mouth hung open better late than never serena countered laughing at his stunned expression she rose and went to her father nothing to say macgregor youre with child with a smile at his phrasing she bent to kiss his cheek yes youll have your grandchild before the leaves turn in september as diana watched daniels eyes filled my little girl he murmured then rose to cup her face in his hands my little rena i wont be little for long daniel gathered her close always my little girl diana looked away moved and strangely unsettled by the scene she saw caine his gaze fixed on his sister his eyes dark and intense as they were when he worked out a complicated point of law hes trying to see her as a mother diana reflected hes trying to picture himself as an uncle to her child justins child she realized with a jolt her brothers child something stirred in her that old buried need for family hardly realizing she moved diana stood and went to justin to your child she said quietly and lifted her glass to the health and beauty of your son or daughter and to our parents who would have loved it justin stood taking her hand as he murmured something in comanche i dont remember the language diana told him thank you he translated aunt of my children well have champagne tonight daniel bellowed suddenly and caught serena close again another macgregors on the way blade justin and diana corrected together aye blade flushed with good humor he grabbed justin in one of his bear hugs good blood he declared then hugged diana for good measure until she was laughing and gasping for breath strong stock when he released her the words played back in dianas head a glimmer of a notion flitted through her head then fixed oh my god she thought he was talking about me about me and stunned she turned her head so that her eyes met caines he was watching her his arm draped around his sisters shoulder reading dianas glazed expression accurately he gave her a crooked smile and lifted his glass he couldnt sleep caine didnt have to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling to know he couldnt sleep instead he sat in a straddle chair smoking slowly as he watched the moonlight play on the bare branches outside his window the house was quiet now a quiet all the more complete after the noise and laughter at the dinner table strange how right diana had looked in the enormous shadowy room strange he thought again how right it had seemed for her to be here in the home of his childhood hed managed or nearly managed to rationalize his feelings about her for weeks he was attracted to her enjoyed her company liked to watch her laugh found pleasure in her passion it had been true of other women perhaps caine thought as he studied the tip of his cigarette it had been true of too many other women why couldnt he stop thinking about her hour after hour day after day why did he know before he had even attempted it that he wouldnt be able to walk away from her and he wouldnt by god he wouldnt let her walk away from him on a sound of annoyance he crushed out his cigarette and rose there were times when he couldnt rationalize his feelings he couldnt quite convince himself hed just enjoyed helping her along on her road to selfdiscovery there were times when he knew and was terrified that he was in love with her wanted needed those were easy words love wasnt not for caine love meant commitment one to one it meant giving and sharing deep intimacies when hed been very careful never to dip below the surface with any woman until diana for wanting and needing the path was clear but for loving it took all sorts of unexpected twists and treacherous turns it sounded like an easy word an easy word when applied to someone else he mused he loved and wasnt sure of his next step and how did diana blade feel about him caine wondered he stared out the window his palms resting on the sill she was a woman who budgeted her affections meticulously she wanted and needed him but with a short laugh caine turned away to light another cigarette to prowl restlessly around the room love how did a man go about coaxing love from a woman that was something hed been very careful to avoid and somehow he didnt think love could be coaxed from a woman like diana it was either there or it wasnt or it was there he continued thoughtfully and she wouldnt admit it suddenly painfully he needed her the softness the heat she would be asleep in the high huge fourposter in the next room without giving himself a chance to think caine crushed out his cigarette and went into the hall he knew every inch every board without faltering he found the door to dianas room and stepped inside closing it quietly behind him there was only moonlight here pale streams of it slanted over the bed the fire had been lit but was down to embers that gave neither heat nor light shed snuggled beneath the quilt for warmth her slow quiet breathing barely moved it emotions flooded him as he watched her and altered the hunger to an aching tenderness he knew at once how it would be to see her like this night after night to know when he woke each morning she would be beside him and he knew too what his life would be like without her bending he brushed his lips over her cheek diana he murmured as she sighed in sleep and shifted on the pillow whispering her name again he began to trace kisses over her face nibbling lightly at her lips until he felt her sleepy response i want you diana pressing his mouth to hers he let his tongue wake her on a sound of pleasure her response grew more active then coming fully awake she let out a gasp of surprise and scrambled up caine she hissed aware that her heart was pounding from a combination of fear and desire you scared me to death it didnt feel like fear he said quietly as he sat on the bed taking her shoulders he drew her closer what are you doing in here its the middle of the his mouth silenced her sweetly effectively slowly he slid his hands down finding to his pleasure that she was warm and soft and naked caine her mouth found a brief freedom as he tasted the curve of her shoulder you cant your parents house i can he corrected and heard her breath catch as his hands moved lower anywhere i want you diana i cant sleep for wanting you let me show you caine but his mouth was on hers again there was no protest as he pressed her back against the feather pillow had he ever loved her like this before diana wondered dazedly as he moved his lips and hands leisurely over her once once in that first dreamlike loving there was no urgency no hurry it was as if theyd had years together and were assured of years more slowly he savored the tastes of her mouth the tastes of her skin murmuring in approval as he went steeped in him she could find no will to rush the blazing passion she had grown used to was banked smoldering like an easy fire in a comfortable hearth they moved at the same lazy pace whispering requests murmuring in pleasure while they lay flesh to flesh beneath the thick quilt she hadnt been aware he had so much tenderness in him or indeed that she had it in herself she wanted to please him and to soothe her hands touched gently as his did but even gentleness aroused as the lazy stroking continued she seemed to become more and more aware of her body every pore every pulse with a long quiet moan diana surrendered to the next phase of passion he could hear the change in her breathing the subtle alteration in the rhythm of her body her needs accelerated his own he was dizzy from the scent of her mixed with the faintest touch of woodsmoke from the dying fire the linen sheets worn smooth and thin through the years skimmed over his skin as her hands pressed him closer as her desire deepened the taste of her seemed to grow darker and sweeter he kept his mouth light on hers toying with her tongue nipping while her fingers dove into his hair he slipped into her slowly aroused by the gasp of surprise that became a moan of need though she arched in invitation he kept his pace easy murmuring mindless promises against her lips as she shuddered for more the greater his need the tighter he clung to control hazy waves of passion rippled through him as she crested once yet he guided her gently up again and again saturated with desire she murmured his name over and over so that he quieted her with a long luxurious kiss he thought he could feel her melt bone by bone until her body was limp and he knew her mind was filled with nothing but him it was then he gave his own needs their freedom the red smoldering flame became a bluewhite flash that consumed them both chapter eleven contents prev next it would have taken days to explore every nook and cranny of the house the more diana saw of it the more she wanted to see shed spent most of her childhood and adolescent years in proper drawing rooms and parlors admiring paintings by reynolds or gainsborough steuben glass and queen anne furniture but nothing had prepared her for the macgregors lifestyle there were twentyfoot ceilings with arched beams and gargoyles carved mahogany doors stone fireplaces with spears crossed over the hearth even an occasional suit of armor she might find an ancient blunderbuss and a favrile compote in the same room it was a hodgepodge an aladdins cave at once barbaric and sophisticated if she chose she could wind her way down a shadowy corridor lit with gaslight and enjoy a huge tiled swimming pool or steaming jacuzzi as charmed as she was with the house diana was equally fascinated by the macgregors themselves whether their environment had grown to fit them or vice versa she couldnt be certain but they were an intriguing mixture of the worldly and primitive overlying it all was daniels fierce innate pride in his heritage his clan and his children and shed been wrong about one thing caine was no different here than he was in boston than hed been in atlantic city he was exactly who he was having no need to put on different faces for different people the security of his childhood the strong binding love of his family had given him that gift she wondered if he knew what a gift it was because she wanted to think diana drifted away alone into what caine had jokingly referred to as the war room here daniel kept his collection of weapons daggers swords pistols ornately carved rifles and to her amazement a small cannon the fire hadnt been lit so the room was chilly sunbeams filtered through the leaded glass windows to fall in crisscross patterns on the thick planked floor dianas heels echoed hollowly as she walked idly from case to case so she thought as she admired an italian dagger with a jeweled handle daniel macgregor was setting her up caine might have warned her shed meant to speak to him about it the night before but theyd had no time alone then when hed come to her room she couldnt wouldnt be pressured by people she hardly knew to make a decision that involved the rest of her life shed never thought of marrying caine even as she realized that wasnt quite true diana passed over it shed never seriously thought of it she amended marriage and children were things shed never permitted herself to consider didnt marriage mean giving up part of yourself to someone else for so long she had fought to keep that inner part private so private she admitted ruefully that there had been times she herself had forgotten just what diana blade was made of and marriage meant risk trusting someone to stay no there was only one person she could completely trust and depend on and that was herself shed realized that years ago when shed known the pain of loss the fear of desertion it wasnt going to happen to her again love no she wouldnt think of love diana told herself as she stared at the empty hearth she wasnt in love with caine she didnt choose to be in love with caine but something began to pull at her threatening to cloud logic with emotions frightened diana forced it away no she wouldnt fall in love she wouldnt consider marriage in any case it was academic it wasnt caine who was pressuring her hed asked her for nothing given no promises demanded none its foolish to worry about it she reminded herself ive let his family get to me that unity that closeness it appeals just as much as it frightens it tempted her to daydream and shed given up fantasies long ago all alone diana she turned smiling as justin walked into the room i cant get enough of this house she told him its like something out of the middle ages with unexpected touches of the twentieth century the macgregors are fascinating people the first time i walked in here i wondered if daniel macgregor was mad or brilliant with one of his quick charming grins he scanned the room i still havent made up my mind you really love him dont you justin lifted a brow at the serious tone of her question yes hes a man who demands strong emotions all of them do he added thoughtfully i dont think i fully realized until serena was kidnapped that id made them my family for ten years i wish youd had that i had other things with a shrug diana walked to a slightly rusted suit of armor i was very selfsufficient was and are justin murmured do you ever think too much she turned back lifting a brow in almost the identical manner of her brother you too justin have you gotten it into your head to match me up with caine his eyes remained calm and very cool it appears the two of you have managed that all on your own thats my business so it is dipping his hands into his pockets he studied her she was annoyed and he suspected a bit frightened i wasnt there for you when you were growing up diana perhaps its too late to play big brother now but i promised to be your friend she went to him quickly pressing her face to his shoulder as she held him im sorry its hard for me im afraid to need you or anyone justin asked tilting her face to his though she remained silent the answer was in her eyes its disconcerting to see so much of yourself in another person he murmured diana are you in love with caine dont ask me that drawing away she held up her hands as if to ward off the question dont ask me that all right he hadnt expected to feel concern or to feel this vague helplessness if i asked would you tell me about the years you lived with adelaide really tell me diana opened her mouth then closed it again no she said after a moment no thats over if it was over youd tell me about it diana he continued when she would have spoken im not going to give you advice or tell you what you should do but id like to tell you something about myself i was in love with serena but i didnt tell her i didnt he continued with a rueful grin tell myself id been in charge of my own life for so long id never loved anyone you our parents that was all too distant telling her was one of the hardest things i ever did there are people love comes gently to theyre not us what about rena diana wondered was it easy for her easier i think he smiled then and sitting on the arm of a chair lit a cigarette shes a great deal like her father more than any of the others shed suffer all sorts of torture before shed admit it but when she came to me in atlantic city shed already made up her mind that wed be together daniels little scheme had worked very well daniels scheme justin blew out a stream of smoke and laughed hed thrown us together very cleverly by buying me a ticket for the cruise liner serena worked on of course he didnt mention to me that she worked there or to her that he had a friend coming on board he counted on chemistry or on fate as he puts it fate diana murmured then gave a bewildered laugh the old devil to put in mildly justin watched her through a mist of smoke he knows how to get what he wants all the macgregors do and he added slowly so do you and i once we acknowledge what it is we want she shot him a look but justin rose and slipped an arm around her shoulders lets go find the clan or daniel will send search parties there was something different about caine diana couldnt quite put her finger on it but she sensed it at first she wondered if perhaps the virginia day case was troubling him he was to go to trial the following week and diana knew that he had been pumping his mother for every scrap of information she had on dr francis day on the surface he seemed relaxed enough laughing with his family teasing his sister but there was something going on beneath an edginess shed never found in him before there were times throughout the day that she caught him looking at her in his old direct dissecting way it was as if he were seeing her for the first time as if they hadnt worked and talked together as if they hadnt been as close as a man and woman could be while she felt herself being drawn into the circle of his family dianas thoughts of caine kept her from being completely relaxed thered been a change and if she was honest she would admit she had sensed it in the way he had made love to her the night before the road had suddenly developed a new surface she would navigate cautiously well now mellow pleased with himself daniel sat back in his thronelike chair with his gifts spread out on the floor around him a mans compensation for adding another year of course it has nothing to do with the basic greed or the love of opening presents serena commented as she crossed her bare feet on the coffee table one of the trials of my life has been disrespectful children daniel told diana with a sigh the curse of parenting she agreed knowing him well enough now to play the game the times ive been shouted at aye even threatened by my own flesh and blood daniel heaved a sigh as he flopped back in his chair im getting pretty close to tears serena said dryly i can overlook that in your condition daniel sent her a stern look but dont think ive forgotten how you yelled at me just because i bought that husband of yours a ticket for that boat yelled at me he repeated turning back to diana and broke half a dozen of my best cigars cigars anna said mildly old ones that were just lying around he said quickly it must have been difficult raising three volatile children diana felt caines fingers squeeze the back of her neck but she kept her expression bland ah i could tell you stories daniel smiled reminiscenfly and shook his head that one he said pointing a wide finger at caine hardly a moments peace anna will tell you then he continued before anna had a chance to that one was nothing but mischief when he was a lad and then there were the females a regular parade daniel announced proudly a parade diana repeated turning her head she started to smile at caine but found him staring at her with that odd light in his eyes with their gazes locked he cupped her face in his hand were both grown up now he murmured then covered her mouth in a long firm kiss well then daniel began with a wide grin as diana sat silent and flustered you havent tried the piano yet have you diana anna asked calmly what im sorry out of her depth diana turned to see a look of gentle understanding in annas eyes the piano she repeated you play dont you yes i do its so rarely touched these days would you mind playing something diana no of course not relieved she rose to cross the room to the baby grand youre pressuring the children daniel anna said quietly me he shot her an incredulous look nonsense anyone can see that they why dont you let them see for themselves first he subsided in a huff as diana sifted through the sheet music she was grateful for the distraction it was simpler for her to remain outwardly composed when she had something specific to do the notes came easily to her a result of years of structured lessons and an affection for music music had perhaps been the only one of her accomplishments that had pleased diana as much as it had pleased her aunt she used it now as she had often in the past as a curtain for her private thoughts and private emotions what had been in caines mind when he had kissed her diana wasnt accustomed to or completely comfortable with public shows of affection certainly not in the boisterous sense the macgregors were yet even with that she could have accepted a simple kiss was it her imagination or had there been something possessive in the gesture perhaps she was just letting daniels notsosubtle machinations get to her those and justins unexpected questions why should she feel pressured today when she hadnt felt so yesterday last night hadnt it really begun last night lifting her gaze from the keys she met caines eyes he was silent brooding diana mused as her brows drew together it wasnt characteristic of him to brood nor she reminded herself was it characteristic of him to be tense yet he was could something have changed overnight without her being aware of it it might have been better if she hadnt come diana thought as she felt little fingers of tension probe at the back of her neck she shouldnt have allowed herself to be charmed by the eccentricities of this family the closeness the camaraderie it might not have been wise to have seen cain in this kind of setting away from boston the office her own established apartment if she wasnt careful she might find herself forgetting her own goals and the rules shed set up to accomplish them success was first it had to be if she were to justify all the years she had danced to someone elses tune and success diana knew was a greedy god who demanded constant vigilance gaining it then maintaining it would require all of her skill and a large chunk of her time when she had chosen law diana had made a pact with herself there would be no personal complications to interfere with her career she had neither the inclination nor the patience for them again her gaze drifted to caine the knots of tension tightened hadnt she told herself from the beginning that if she let him get too close things would drift out of her control shed known yet had somehow convinced herself that she could handle an intimate relationship with him without letting her emotions completely outweigh her logic had it been pride that had caused her to accept the challenge passion it hardly mattered since she had accepted and was now forced to deal with the consequences as the music built her feelings intensified she could feel them pour through her hear the crackling snap from the blaze of the fire and sense somehow the varying emotions in play across the room why had she let herself get so involved she wondered in quick panic she had her life a streamlined path shed just begun to follow there were all those promises to herself to keep though she could remember even when she struggled not to the tenderness caine had brought to her bed in the dark hours of the night diana let the notes drift into silence then gripped her hands together finding they were not quite steady now that was a pleasure daniel gave a windy sigh from his chair is there anything that brings a man more contentment than a beautiful woman and a song caine reluctantly took his eyes from diana and gave his father a long cool stare did you have plans to survive until your next birthday he asked pleasantly now what kind of talk is that daniel blustered but then he hesitated hed planted enough seeds for an evening and he knew the value of strategic retreat well have another bottle of champagne and some more cake he declared caine toss another log or two on the fire before you come along as the family swept from the room serena paused by the piano to squeeze dianas hand hes an old meddler she murmured but he has a good heart when the room was quiet diana rose and watched as caine added fresh wood to the already blazing fire the tension at the back of her head had built to an ache do you want some more cake caine asked with his back still to her no no not really diana linked her hands together and wished they were back in boston would she be more certain of her moves there another drink now this is a ridiculously polite conversation caine thought in disgust as he turned to her yes all right moistening her lips diana searched for some safe topic did you get the information you wanted on the day case from your mother just a corroboration on francis days character caine shrugged as he poured from the decanter to glass it was nothing that i didnt already have but my mother has a way of getting to the heart of the matter without all the fuss he interned under her at boston general still its nothing i can use in litigation as he handed diana her drink caine brushed at her bangs in a habitual gesture when she stepped back he narrowed his eyes but said nothing it always helps to get an objective viewpoint before you go to trial am i on trial diana her eyes came swiftly to his i dont know what you mean youre hedging taking a step closer he circled the back of her neck then lowered his lips to hers he felt the tension beneath his fingers felt her initial resistance to the kiss as he drew back caine lifted an ironic brow yes it seems i am but i cant make my plea until im sure of the charges dont be ridiculous quickly annoyed diana lifted her drink and swallowed dont be evasive caine countered i thought wed gotten past that point in our relationship stop pushing me caine he took a long hard look at the drink in his hand but didnt taste it in what way i dont know every way she dragged a hand through her hair as she walked away lets just drop it i dont want to fight with you is that what were doing with a nod he drank then set down his glass well if it is lets do it right you get the first shot i dont want the first shot abruptly furious she whirled back to him im not going to stand in your parents drawing room and snipe at you but you would if we were somewhere else yes i dont know caine leave me alone the hell i will and the very calmness of his tone warned her of his mood lets hear it diana i want to know why youre pulling away from me im not pulling away youre imagining things she took a quick nervous sip of her drink and turned away again when his hand touched her shoulder she jerked then cursed herself not pulling away caine murmured trying to ignore the slash of hurt whats your term for it look its late im tired diana fumbled for the excuse knowing it was a weak one caine with a frustrated sigh she moved away from him again please dont pressure me now is that what you think im doing diana pressuring you yes damn it you your family justin all in your own separate ways setting down her glass she leaned her palms against a table she was overreacting but for once couldnt summon the logic to clear her mind caine cant we just leave this alone no i dont think so he would have gone to her but somehow the distance she had put between them stopped him he felt awkward and close to furious with her for making him so and he hurt that was something he would think about later its not my intention to pressure you diana he said in a low precise voice that had her digging her teeth into her lower lip but there are things that i think should be said now why she demanded as she spun back around why this sudden urgency there werent any complications when we were in boston what kind of complications are there now dont crossexamine me caine you have an objection to that question oh you make me furious when you act like this seething she dug her hands into the pockets of her skirt and whirled around the room ive felt like ive been under a microscope off and on since i walked through the front door you might have told me i was top of your fathers list as the proper mate for his second son my father has absolutely nothing to do with you and me diana id apologize for his lack of subtlety but i dont feel responsible for it i dont want your apology she fumed but it would have been more comfortable if id been prepared damn it i like him and the rest of your family its impossible not to but i dont like the quiet looks of speculation and the unasked questions what would you like me to do about it i dont know nothing she said as she moved to stand in front of the roaring fire but i dont have to like it did it ever occur to you that i might not particularly care for it myself simmering with anger caine swirled his drink and stared at her back did it ever occur to you that i might not care for the interference in my life no matter how well interitioned theyre your family she tossed back over her shoulder youre bound to be more accustomed to it than i i spent twenty years trying to live up to my aunts plans for me i didnt get this far to follow someone elses the hell with your aunt caine exploded and with everyone else that isnt you and me what do you want diana why dont you just spell it out i dont know what i want she shouted shocking herself with the admission i knew yesterday and now damn it caine i cant deal with this i cant deal with having my private life poked into not by your father my brother anyone its my life and ill make my own decisions you cant deal with it he murmured then gave a short laugh before he drained his glass then deal with this im in love with you diana stared at him in utter shock in utter silence she wondered if her heart had simply stopped and she didnt move a muscle as a log snapped loudly and sparks sprayed against the screen at her back they watched each other both pale their eyes dark with what seemed more like anger than any other emotion how had it come to this she wondered and what in gods name would they do about it well you dont seem thrilled about it furious with himself for having made the statement so baldly caine reached for the decanter with studied calm he poured a brandy how could he have known that silence could bring this kind of pain as he listened to the brandy splash against the glass he wondered why he had waited more than thirty years to say those words to a woman to find only emptiness would you like the statement stricken from the record counselor dont diana squeezed her eyes shut for a moment i dont know what to say to you or how to handle this its easier for you thereve been other women other women he exploded he wasnt pale anymore but his eyes were even darker more furious than shed ever seen them instinctively diana stepped back as he walked toward her how can you say that to me now what do i have to do to make up for a past that happened before i even met you and why the hell should i he gripped her by the shoulders fingers digging into flesh damn it diana i said i love you i love you his mouth came down on hers in anger and frustration as if by that alone he could wipe out the hurt she brought him the doubts he brought her something built inside her threatening to burst diana dragged herself away with a cry of alarm you frighten me her eyes swam with sudden tears as they faced each other again their breathing unsteady i said that you didnt but it was always a lie from the very beginning she choked back a sob and pushed her hair away from her face with both hands youre what ive always avoided i cant risk it dont you understand all of my life someones played carrot and stick with me do this fit into this mold and youll have security youll have normalcy ive just found my own mold i wont fit someone elses expectations now im not asking you to fit anything he tossed back ive never asked you to be anyone but yourself perhaps it was the truth of that which frightened her more than anything else she dragged a hand through her hair as the last lingering fear broke through how do i know youll stay how do i know if i let myself love you that one day there wouldnt be someone else something else and youd just walk away i can handle being alone now i know how but i cant i wont be left again caine struggled against fury against the sense of his own impotence ive asked you more than once to trust me its not me that frightens you diana its ghosts and your own selfdoubt she swallowed winning the battle of tears you dont understand youve never lost everything so you intend to go through your life never taking a chance because you might lose his eyes hardened as they swept her face i never took you for a coward i choose the chances i take she countered furiously i choose i wont put myself in a position to be hurt i wont take chances on my career why do you automatically assume ill hurt you and what in gods name does your career have to do with my loving you i have the same profession the same demands whos asking you to make a choice between love and the law did you have to chop down a tree caine were halfway through the cake and champagne and serena trailed off as she reached the center of the room the waves of tension and hurt poured over her so that she stared in awkward silence from caine to diana im sorry she said knowing of no gracious way to cover up the intrusion ill tell everyone youre busy no please diana met the banked fury in caines eyes before turning to his sister just tell them im a bit tired im going to go up now quickly without looking back she walked from the room caine watched her in silence then turned to retrieve his snifter of brandy from the sideboard oh caine im so sorry it seems i couldnt have picked a worse time to barge in it doesnt matter he drained the remaining liquor then poured more wed said all we had to say caine serena went to him distressed by the controlled voice and stony expression do you need a sympathetic ear or solitude i need a drink he answered taking both the snifter and decanter to a chair i need quite a few of them youre in love with diana right the first time he said and toasted her ignoring the sarcasm serena sat beside him and youd like to murder her right again its easy to be right when youve been through it i dont know what went on in here tonight but i told her in the midst of a nasty little argument that i was in love with her he brought the snifter to his lips again and swallowed deeply it seems my timing and my delivery were a bit off im going to do something i despise serena said with a sigh which is give advice thats my territory rena save it shut up firmly she took the snifter from his hand and set it down give her some room and some time youre not an easy man to love in the best of circumstances i should know i appreciate the testimonial caine a lot of things have changed in dianas life very quickly shes the kind of woman who needs to make her decisions a step at a time at least she thinks she is he gave a quiet laugh as he leaned back in the chair you were always an excellent judge of character rena youd have made a hell of a lawyer it comes in handy in my line of work too reaching out she took his hand dont press her caine there are storms inside diana let her battle them out i might have pressed her too far already on a long breath he shut his eyes oh god i hurt serena wanted to comfort and forced herself not to love has to hurt its rule number one go to bed she ordered briskly youll have a better idea what to do in the morning caine opened his eyes again its a hell of a thing that i should be sitting here taking advice from the kid sister who sharpened her left jab on me im a comfortable matron now serena said majestically as she patted her stomach hah caine retorted in an accurate imitation of their father go to bed serena advised before i take it into my head to see if that jabs still effective rising she tugged him to his feet you always were a bossy little busybody caine told her as they walked toward the doorway im still crazy about you yeah serena grinned up at him me too chapter twelve contents prev diana sat in the empty courtroom numb and nauseated the hands she folded together on her briefcase were ice cold and nerveless she knew she had to pull herself together go out and get in her car drive home somehow she knew if she stood up at that moment her legs would buckle she sat as still as a stone and waited for the feeling to pass logic told her she was being a fool she should feel wonderful she should celebrate shed won chad rutledge was free exonerated beth howards father would face perjury charges and so would beth diana added silently as she stared at the empty witness chair it was unlikely the girl would be convicted not when a dozen witnesses had seen so clearly that it had been fear that had caused her to lie about the rape not when a dozen witnesses had watched how pitifully she had fallen apart under examination not diana thought as a small pain rippled through her when a dozen witnesses had watched diana blade attorney at law rip her to shreds diana could hear the echo of her own voice in the now silent courtroom cold accusing merciless she could see the pale fragile face of beth howard as it crumbled and the tears the near hysterical confession she could hear chads loud furious demands that beth be left alone then there had been chaos in the courtroom as chad had been restrained and beth had wept out the entire story when the courtroom had been cleared diana had remained to deal with her victory and the cost of it in human terms she had never felt more alone or more lost than at that moment she wanted to weep but sat dryeyed she was a professional and tears had no place caine oh god she needed caine diana closed her eyes as the numbness faded into pain she had no right to need him or to use him as a lifeline when she felt she was sinking though two weeks had passed she could still see the look in his eyes as they had faced each other in his parents drawing room hurt she had hurt him and now they treated each other like strangers each time diana tried to tell herself it was for the best she remembered that look in his eyes and the flood of feeling that had risen in her only to be forced back in panic love she couldnt afford to love him couldnt afford the risk it would be best if she found another office perhaps left boston altogether running away a small voice asked her with a sigh diana stared down at her hands yes thats what she had in mind if she ran fast enough she might be able to escape caine but she wasnt going to be able to escape herself and if she were honest she would admit it was herself she was running from when had she started to love him perhaps it had been when he had shown her such gentleness and understanding after her first meeting with justin or perhaps it had been on that snowy beach when hed made her laugh then made her ache with need shed known it was happening but had pretended otherwise every time her emotions had begun to take over she had closed them off afraid she looked around the empty courtroom again then slowly rose to her feet it was twilight when she stepped outside in the west the sky was clumped with clouds that glowed with bronzes and pinks the lengthening of days was the only sign of spring as the wind was as sharp as a knife and the dark leafless trees shimmered under a thin coat of ice diana saw chad hunched in his coat sitting near the bottom of the courtroom steps she hesitated not certain she was strong enough for a confrontation then squaring her shoulders she walked down the remaining steps chad he looked up staring into her face for a long five seconds before he rose ive been waiting for you i can see that with a nonchalance she wasnt feeling diana sipped up the collar of her coat against the wind you should have waited inside i needed the air he kept his hands in his pockets his shoulders rounded against the cold as he watched her they wouldnt let me see beth im sorry carefully she kept all emotion and all weariness out of her voice i hurt too she thought in despair for you for myself must i always have the answers ill arrange for you to see her tomorrow you dont look so good diana gave him a thin smile thanks as she turned he caught at her arm ms blade awkwardly chad dropped his hand and stuffed it back in his pocket i gave you a hard time in there i guess ive given you a hard time all along it comes with the territory chad dont worry about it watching beth he swore softly then turned away to stare at the traffic i couldnt stand watching her cry in there i hated you for making her cry like that when i came out here to wait i had a lot of things i was going to say to you diana gripped her briefcase tighter and braced herself go ahead say them now he gave a shaky laugh and turned back to her i had some time to think i guess i dont do enough of that he took out a cigarette cupping his hands around the match as he lit it diana saw that his hands were steady ive got something different to say to you now ms blade chad blew out smoke on a long breath before he met her eyes you saved my life and i think maybe you saved beths too i want to thank you unable to speak diana stared at the hand he held out to her after a moment she accepted it then found hers clasped hard all i could think about in there was that you were hurting her i couldnt see past that sitting out here i started thinking about that cell and what it would be like to be in one for the next twenty years you dont know how good it is to sit outside and know nobodys going to come along and lock you back in a cage when his voice trembled chad swallowed but kept his hand tight on hers id have done that for her and i guess after a while id have hated her and she shed have lived with that lie crawling around inside of her beth wouldnt have made it i know that itll be over for her soon diana lifted her free hand to cover their joined ones objective she thought only a robot could be cool and objective when someone looked at them like this he needed to give his gratitude but he was also asking for comfort no courts going to punish beth for being terrified if they if she has to go to court will you help her yes if she wants me to and youll be there for her yeah im going to marry her right away the hell with money well figure something out his hand relaxed as he smiled for the first time i was always thinking i had to prove something you know to beth to myself to the whole damn world funny it doesnt seem so important anymore to prove that i can make it all by myself diana gave him an odd look and shook her head no she said slowly i suppose only fools think that way it wont be so easy with beth finishing school he grinned now as though the challenge appealed to him but well be together and thats what counts yes chad she dropped her hand to her side is it worth it the risk the pain he tilted back his head and drew in the cold evening air its worth anything everything with a wide brilliant smile he looked back at her youll come to the wedding ms blade yes she smiled back at him then gently kissed his cheek yes ill come to your wedding chad now go home youll see your girl tomorrow diana walked to her car realizing the sickness had left her stomach the dull threat of a headache at her temple had vanished they were so young she thought as she joined the long stream of traffic with a dozen strikes against them yet that look of shining hope in chads eyes made her believe theyd face the odds together and if there was any justice theyd make it and what about you diana asked herself are you determined to be a fool or are you going to face the odds just how much blade blood gamblers blood was there in her perhaps like chad she had been fluting with spending her life in a cell there was a certain safety there to compensate for the lack of freedom words began to flit through her head justins voice telling her that love came gently to some people but not to them caine furiously telling her he loved her demanding that she trust him she could hear her own voice edged with nerves telling him she wouldnt risk being left alone what was she now diana asked herself if not alone alone and aching with love and needs but letting those old fears the ghosts caine had called them rule her life in doing so she was breaking the most important promise she had ever made to herself to be diana blade shed intended to go home but now found herself pulling up in the drive beside the office instinct she wondered seeing that caines car was parked there her nerves began to jump again what would she say to him it might be best to go home wait until she could think clearly and plan even as this went through her mind diana stepped from the car she could see the light in the window of his office hes been working too hard she thought the day case the trial should be nearly over by now diana knew more of its progress from the press reports man from caine had they spoken a dozen words to each other in the last two weeks she wondered what would she say to him now the first floor was dark and silent she could hear the quiet creak of the door as she shut it behind her glancing up the stairs she slipped out of her coat her timing was probably very poor she thought and caught her bottom lip between her teeth as she again considered going home she walked up the stairs caines office door was open diana could hear the whispers from the fire as she moved toward it hesitating at the doorway she studied caine while he sat behind his desk his head was bent over a stack of papers his jacket and tie had been tossed in a heap over the back of the chair so that he wore the black vest unbuttoned and his shut open at the throat in the ashtray a cigarette he hadnt quite put out smoldered as she watched he dragged a hand through his hair then reached up without looking up for his coffee cup she studied him as she hadnt permitted herself to do since that night in hyannis port god he looks tired she thought with a jolt as if he hasnt slept properly in days could the case be going so badly suddenly he swore softly under his bream and ran his hand over his face swamped with concern diana stepped forward caine his head jerked up for an instant he stared at her with eyes that were dark and unguarded she felt his need as a tangible thing then just as quickly it was gone diana he turned coolly i didnt expect you back tonight maybe she had been mistaken it might only have been surprise she had seen in his eyes her own emotions she had felt she searched her mind for all the things she wanted to say chad rudedge was acquitted was all that came out congratulations he leaned back and studied her with apparent dispassion was she more beautiful than shed been yesterday he wondered as the ache crept into him was he going to go mad seeing her day after day loving her and not being loved in return it was ugly she said after a moment im not particularly proud of the way i treated beth howard on the stand caine balled his hand into a fist then flexed it her vulnerability would always tear at him do you want a drink no i yes she decided yes ill get it moving to a cabinet across the room diana found a decanter and poured without having any idea what the liquor was this wasnt happening the way it should she told herself all the words she wanted to say to him stuck in her throat selfdoubts hadnt he told her she was plagued with them as usual hed been accurate now she simply didnt know if she could find the right phrasing the right tone to tell him she wanted to do what hed asked of her almost from the beginning to trust moistening her lips she tried to break some of the tension hovering in the air is the day case giving you problems no not really its nearly over he sipped at his coffee and found it cold and bitter it suited his mood the prosecution didnt have as tight a case as id imagined i put ginnie on the stand today she was hard as nails unsympathetic and perfectly believable he couldnt shake her testimony an inch in crossexamination then youre feeling confident about the verdict virginia day will be acquitted he said flatly but she wont get justice at dianas puzzled look he pushed his coffee aside and rose legally shell be free but the public will look at her as a spoiled rich woman who murdered her husband and got away with it i can keep her out of jail but i cant vindicate her a lawyer i admire once told me a defense counsel has to keep his objectivity caine shot her a look then shrugged what the hell did he know diana set down her glass and walked to him why dont you let me buy you a drink and some dinner he needed to touch her caine could feel his fingertips tingle with the need to stroke the softness of her skin rejection the thought of facing it again had him slipping on his armor no he moved back behind his desk ive got a lot to catch up on tonight all right ill see whats in the refrigerator downstairs no the single sharp word stopped her the pain registered pushing her back a step turning she stared at the fire until she was certain her voice wouldnt tremble youd like me to go away wouldnt you i told you im busy i could wait unable to keep her hands still she toyed with the handle of the brass fireplace poker we could have a late supper at my apartment he stared at her the slim straight figure in jadegreen wool she was offering him the opportunity to go back to the way things had been the way it had always been for him with women before fun games no complications nothing had ever seemed so empty with a sigh caine looked down at his hands how many times in the last two weeks had he thought about her about the way things had been between them hed considered begging it wasnt a matter of pride once in the early hours of the morning hed considered going to her apartment and using force for lack of anything better every possible angle from reason to abduction had gone through his mind and every one had been discarded hed had to remind himself that love couldnt be forced or coaxed or pleaded out of a woman like diana he wanted her needed to lose himself in that mindless passion they could bring each other he could almost taste her from where he stood that not quite sweet not quite sharp flavor of her mouth when it heated it would have been simple once but it would never be simple again i appreciate the offer he said curtly im not interested she shut her eyes at that surprised again at how much pain words could bring i hurt you badly she murmured i dont know if theres any way to make up for it he gave a quick hard laugh i can do without the sympathy diana distressed by his tone she turned around caine thats not what drop it caine please damn it diana let it alone struggling for control he lifted his coffee again she saw his knuckles go white on the handle go home he ordered ive got work to do i have things i want to say to you doesnt it occur to you that i dont want to hear them i stripped my soul for you he tossed out before he could stop himself made a fool of myself ive already heard your reasons why you cant give me what i want i dont need to hear it all over again i dont think i can take it stop making this impossible for me she shouted at him i dont give a damn about you at the moment enraged he grabbed her arm and yanked her against him before he could stop himself his mouth was on hers savagely brutally the hell with love he told himself if this was all she wanted from him then it was all he would give he let the needs and frustration take him oblivious to her response or protest until she was limp and trembling on a wave of selfdisgust he shoved her away love he realized helplessly could not be ignored get out of here diana leave me alone shaken she gripped the back of a chair no not until ive finished all right you stay ill go but she was at the door ahead of him slamming it shut and leaning back against it sit down shut up and listen to me for a moment she thought hed simply yank her aside throttle her for good measure there was murder in his eyes as he glared down at her then he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets okay say your piece sit down she repeated dont press your luck her chin jerked up at the soft threat all right well stand im not going to apologize for the things i said two weeks ago i meant them my career is important to me vital because its something ive done for myself and trusting someone trusting them with my emotions is the most difficult thing in the world for me no one can make me do it its my own choice fine now get out of the way im not finished she swallowed then heard herself say i think its time we were partners partners the fury in his eyes was replaced by blank astonishment good god youre standing there now after everything ive said to you giving me a business proposition this has nothing to do with business she shot back i want you to marry me she watched as caines eyes narrowed sharpened until she could read nothing in them at all what did you say im asking you to marry me diana kept her eyes level and wondered why her legs didnt buckle brows drawn together he stood where he was youre proposing to me he asked carefully she felt the color warm her cheeks but wasnt certain if it was embarrassment or annoyance yes i thought it was perfectly clear he laughed quietly at first then with more feeling running his hands over his face caine turned and walked to the window diana watched his reaction with a mixture of anger and anxiety ill be damned he murmured i dont think its funny diana crossed her arms over her chest and felt like an idiot i dont know caine continued to stare out the window as he tried to sort out his thoughts after all the pain of the last two weeks she suddenly appears on his doorstep and asks him to marry her somehow it appeals to my humor ill just leave you alone to enjoy your little joke then she fumbled with the knob but even as she jerked the door open caine was there slamming it shut again diana get away she demanded as she attempted to shove him aside wait a minute taking her shoulders he pressed her back against the door are we always going to be at cross purposes he wondered his eyes werent laughing at her but were deadly serious and a bit wary id like to know why you asked me to marry you diana glared at him a moment then swallowed her pride because i knew after the things i had said to you that you wouldnt ask me i wasnt sure youd forgive me he shook his head and his fingers tightened demandingly on her shoulders dont be ridiculous its not a matter of forgiveness caine she wanted to touch him but kept her hands at her sides not certain she could accept that kind of unquestioning clemency i hurt you yes by god you did im sorry she whispered but it wasnt pity he saw in her eyes the first wave of relief washed over him you havent answered my question diana he kept his hands firm on her shoulders his eyes direct on hers why do you want me to marry you i suppose i need a promise she began feeling the flutter of fear again i think when people just live together its too easy to walk away and no he shook his head again thats not what i want and you know it why diana say it she swallowed as the slivers of fear grew to panic i faltering she closed her eyes say it he demanded again her lashes fluttered up so that she met his eyes levelly once the words were said she knew thered be no backing away for her they would be complete commitment he knew it as well she realized and needed it why had she been so foolish as to think she was the only one with fears i love you she whispered then let out a long shuddering breath with it went the fear oh god caine i love you she fell into his arms clinging and felt the release bubble up in laughter i love you she said again how many times would you like to hear it ill let you know in a minute he murmured as his lips found hers with a groan of pleasure of relief of joy he drew her closer again he demanded against her mouth tell me again she laughed and tugged him down until they lay on the rug i love you if id known how good it would feel to say it i would have told you before caine framing his face with her hands diana looked down at him with her eyes suddenly serious being with you belonging to you is worth everything ive known i have known but it seemed safer to pretend i could live without you taking her hand he pressed his lips to the palm i still cant give you guarantees diana i can only love you i dont want guarantees she drew him down so that her cheek rested against his not anymore im going to gamble on you macgregor slowly she ran her hands up his back and im going to win caine slipped the jacket of her suit off her shoulders as his lips toyed with hers its a night of firsts he decided my first proposal he began loosening the buttons of her blouse the first time i manage to drag those three little words out of you his lips followed the trail of his fingers and the first time i make love with you in my office diana sighed as she stripped his shirt from him theres a minor point of order counselor hmm you havent answered my proposal yet arent you supposed to give me time to think it over he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth no in that case i accept he lifted his head as a gleam of amusement lit his eyes do we intend to add to the macgregor line with her lids halfclosed she gave him a lazy smile absolutely i come from very good stock laughing he pressed his lips against her throat diana youve made my father a very happy man
