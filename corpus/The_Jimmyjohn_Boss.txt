 the jimmyjohn boss and other stories by owen wister to messrs harper bothers and henry mills alden whose friendliness and fair dealing i am glad of this chance to record owen wister preface its very plain that if a things the fashion too much the fashion if the people leap to do it or to be it in a passion of haste and crowding like a herd of sheep why then that thing becomes through imitation vulgar excessive obvious and cheap no gentleman desires to be pursuing what every tom and dick and harrys doing stranger do you write books i ask the question because im told that everybody writes that what with scribbling eating and digestion and proper slumber all our days and nights are wholly filled it seems an odd suggestion but if you do write stop it leave the masses read me and join the small selected classes the jimmyjohn boss i one day at nampa which is in idaho a ruddy old massive jovial man stood by the silver city stage patting his beard with his left hand and with his right the shoulder of a boy who stood beside him he had come with the boy on the branch train from boise because he was a careful german and liked to say everything twice twice at least when it was a matter of business this was a matter of very particular business and the german had repeated himself for nineteen miles presently the eastbound on the main line would arrive from portland then the silver city stage would take the boy south on his new mission and the man would journey by the branch train back to boise from boise no one could say where he might not go west or east he was a great and pervasive cattle man in oregon california and other places vogel and lex even today you may hear the two ranch partners spoken of so the veteran vogel was now once more going over his notions and commands to his youthful deputy during the last precious minutes until the eastbound should arrive und if only you haf someding like dis said the old man as he tapped his beard and patted the boy it would be five hoondert more dollars salary in your liddle pants the boy winked up at his employer he had a gray humorous eye he was slim and alert like a sparrowhawk the sort of boy his father openly rejoices in and his mother is secretly in prayer over only this boy had neither father nor mother since the age of twelve he had looked out for himself never quite without bread sometimes attaining champagne getting along in his american way variously on horse or afoot across regions of wide plains and mountains through towns where not a soul knew his name he closed one of his gray eyes at his employer and beyond this made no remark vat you mean by dat vink anyhow demanded the elder say said the boy confidentially honest now how about you and me five hundred dollars if i had your beard youve got a record and ive got a future and my blooms on me rich without a scratch how many dollars you gif me for dat bloom the sparrowhawk sailed into a freakish imitation of his master you are a liddle rascal cried the master shaking with entertainment und if der peoples vas to hear you sass old max vogel in dis style they would say poor old max he lose his grrip but i dont lose it his great hand closed suddenly on the boys shoulder his voice cut clean and heavy as an axe and then no more joking about him haf you understand that he said yes sir how old are you son nineteen sir oh my that

and aimed at an empty bottle which was sticking in the thin deceiver snow can you do this he said carelessly and fired the snow struck the bottle but the unharming bullet was buried half an inch to the left the boy took his pistol with solemnity no he said guess i cant do that he fired and the glass splintered into shapelessness told you i couldnt miss as close as you did said he you are a darling said mr vogel gif me dat lofely weapon a fortunate store of bottles lay leaned or stood about in the white snow of nampa and mr vogel began at them may i ask if anything is the matter inquired a mild voice from the stage stick that lily head indoors shouted vogel and the face and eyeglasses withdrew again into the stage the schoolteacher he will be beautifool virtuous company for you at malheur agency continued vogel shooting again and presently the large old german destroyed a bottle with a crashing smack ah said he in unison with the smack ahha no von shall say der old max lose his grrip i shoot it efry time now but the train she whistle i hear her the boy affected to listen earnestly bah i tell you i hear de whistle coming did you say there was a whistle ventured the occupant

looking away at the bottles at the railroad track at anything save his employer the employer proceeded i was afraid of nobody und noding in those days you are afraid of nobody and noding but those days was different no pullman sleepers no railroad at all we come oop the columbia in the steamboat we travel hoonderts of miles by team we sleep we eat nowheres in particular mit many unexpected interooptions there was indians there was offle bad white men und if you was not offle yourself you vanished quickly therefore in those days was max vogel hell und repeat the magnate smiled a broad

recommend you to let them see that aggomplishment in a friendly way maybe a shootingmatch mit prizes i pay for them pretty soon after you come und joodgement und joodgement here comes that train haf you well understand upon this the two shook hands looking square friendship in each others eyes the eastbound long quiet and dark beneath its flowing clots of smoke slowed to a halt a few valises and legs descended ascended herding and hurrying a few trunks were thrown resoundingly in and out of the train a woolly crooked old man came with a box and a bandanna bundle from the secondclass car the travellers of a thousand miles looked torpidly at him through the dim dusty windows of their pullman and settled again for a thousand miles more then the eastbound shooting heavier clots of smoke laboriously into the air drew its slow length out of nampa and away wheres that stage shrilled the woolly old man thats what im after why hello shouted vogel hello uncle pasco i heard you was dead uncle pasco blinked his small eyes to see who hailed him oh said he in his light crusty voice dutchy vogel no i aint dead you guessed wrong not dead help me up dutchy a tolerant smile broadened vogels face it was ten years since i see you said he carrying the old mans box shouldnt wonder maybe itll be another ten till you see me next he stopped by the stage step and wheeling nimbly surveyed his oldtime acquaintance noting the good hat the prosperous watchchain the big wellblacked boots not seen me for ten years heehee no usent to have a cent more than me twins in poverty thats how dutchy and me started if we was buried tomorrow theyd mark him pecunious and me impecunious thats what twins in poverty i stick to von business at a time uncle said goodnatured successful max a flicker of aberration lighted in the old mans eye hm yes said he pondering stuck to one business so you did hm then suddenly sly he chirped but ive struck it rich now he tapped his box jewelry he halfwhispered miners and cowboys yes said vogel those poor deluded fellows they buy such stuff and he laughed at the seedy visionary who had begun frontier life with him on the bottom rung and would end it there do you play that concertina yet uncle he inquired yes yes i always play its in here with my toothbrush and socks uncle pasco held up the bandanna well hes getting ready to start i guess ill be climbing inside holy gertrude this shrill comment was at sight of the schoolmaster patient within the stage what business are you in demanded uncle pasco i am in the spelling business replied the teacher and smiled faintly hell piped uncle pasco take this he handed in his bandanna to the traveller who received it politely max vogel lifted the box of cheap jewelry and both he and the boy came behind to boost the old man up on the stage step but with a nettled look he leaped up to evade them tottered halfway and then light as a husk of grain got himself to his seat and scowled at the schoolmaster after a brief inspection of that pale spectacled face dutchy he called out of the door this country is not what it was but old max vogel was inattentive he was speaking to the boy dean drake and held a flask in his hand he reached the flask to his new superintendent drink hearty said he there son dont be shy haf you forgot it is forbidden fruit after now kid sworn off inquired uncle pasco of the schoolmaster i understand replied this person that mr vogel will not allow his cowboys at the malheur agency to have any whiskey brought there personally i feel gratified and mr bolles the new schoolmaster gave his faint smile oh muttered uncle pasco forbidden to bring whiskey on the ranch hm his eyes wandered to the jewelrybox hm said he again and becoming thoughtful he laid back his motheaten sly head and spoke no further with mr bolles dean drake climbed into the stage and the vehicle started goot luck goot luck my son shouted the hearty max and opened and waved both his big arms at the departing boy he stood looking after the stage i hope he come back said he i think he come back if he come i rraise him fifty dollars without any beard ii the stage had not trundled so far on its silver city road but that a whistle from nampa station reached its three occupants this was the branch train starting back to boise with max vogel aboard and the boy looked out at the locomotive with a sigh only five days of town he murmured six months more wilderness now my life has been too much town said the new schoolmaster i am looking forward to a little wilderness for a change old uncle pasco leaning back said nothing he kept his eyes shut and his ears open change is what i dont get sighed dean drake in a few miles however before they had come to the ferry over snake river the recent leavetaking and his employers kind but dominating repression lifted from the boys spirit his gray eye wakened keen again and he began to whistle light opera tunes looking about him alertly like the sparrowhawk that he was ever see jeannie winston in fatinitza he inquired of mr bolles the schoolmaster with a startled thankful countenance stated that he had never ought to said drake you a man that cant be true men have never eyes like you thats what the girls in the harem sing in the second act golly whiz the boy gleamed over the memory of that evening you have a hard job before you said the schoolmaster changing the subject yep hard the wary drake shook his head warningly at mr bolles to keep off that subject and he glanced in the direction of slumbering uncle pasco uncle pasco was quite aware of all this i wouldnt take another lonesome job so soon pursued drake but i want the money ive been working eleven months along the owyhee as a sort of junior boss and id earned my vacation just got it started hot in portland when biff old vogel telegraphs me well ill be saving instead of squandering but it feels so good to squander i have never had anything to squander said bolles rather sadly you dont say well old man i hope you will it gives a man a lot hell never get out of spellingbooks are you cold here and despite the schoolmasters protest dean drake tucked his buffalo coat round and over him some day when im old he went on i mean to live respectable under my own cabin and vine wife and everything but not anyway till im thirtyfive he dropped into his opera tunes for a while but evidently it was not fatinitza and his vanished holiday over which he was chiefly meditating for presently he exclaimed ill give them a shootingmatch in the morning you shoot bolles hoped he was going to learn in this country and exhibited a smith wesson revolver drake grieved over it wrap it up warm said he ill lend you a real one when we get to the malheur agency but you can eat anyhow christmas being next week you see my programme is shoot all am and eat all pm i wish you could light on a notion what prizes to give my buccaroos buccaroos said bolles yep cowpunchers vaqueros buccaroos in oregon bastard spanish word you see drifted up from mexico vogel would not care to have me give em money as prizes at this uncle pasco opened an eye how many buccaroos will there be bolles inquired at the malheur agency its the headquarters of five of our ranches there ought to be quite a crowd a dozen probably at this time of year uncle pasco opened his other eye here you he said dragging at his box under the seat pull it cant you there just what youre after theres your prizes querulous and watchful like some aged rickety ape the old man drew out his trinkets in shallow shelves sooner give em nothing said dean drake whats that whats the matter with them guess the boys have had all the brass rings and glass diamonds they want thats all you know then i sold that box clean empty through the palouse country last week cept the bottom drawer and an outfit on meachams hill took that shows all you know im going clean through your country after ive quit silver city ill start in by baker city again and ill strike harney and maybe ill go to linkville i know what buccaroos want ill go to fort rinehart and ill go to the island ranch and first thing youll be seeing your boys wearing my stuff all over their fingers and sunday shirts and giving their girls my stuff right in harney city thats what all right uncle its a free country shaw guess it is i was in it before you was too you were wet behind the ears when i was jammin all around here how many are they up at your place did you say i said about twelve if youre coming our way stop and eat with us maybe i will and maybe i wont uncle pasco crossly shoved his box back all right uncle its a free country repeated drake not much was said after this uncle pasco unwrapped his concertina from the red handkerchief and played nimbly for his own benefit at silver city he disappeared and finding he had stolen nothing from them they did not regret him dean drake had some affairs to see to here before starting for harpers ranch and it was pleasant to bolles to find how drake was esteemed through this country the schoolmaster was to board at the malheur agency and had come this way round because the new superintendent must so travel they were scarcely birds of a feather drake and bolles yet since one remote roof was to cover them the indoor man was glad this boyhost had won so much goodwill from high and low that the shrewd old vogel should trust so much in a nineteenyearold was proof enough at least of his character but when brock the foreman from harpers came for them at silver city bolles witnessed the affection that the rougher man held for drake brock shook the boys hand with that serious quietness and absence of words which shows the western heart is speaking after a look at bolles and a silent bestowing of the baggage aboard the team he cracked his long whip and the three rattled happily away through the dips of an open country where clear streams ran blue beneath the winter air they followed the jordan that idaho jordan west towards oregon and the owyhee brock often turning in his drivers seat so as to speak with drake he had a long gradual chapter of confidences and events through miles he unburdened these to his favorite the california mare was coring well in harness the eagle over at whitehorse ranch had fought the cat most terrible gilbert had got a mulekick in the stomach but was eating his three meals they had a new boy who played the guitar he used maplesyrup an his meat and claimed he was from alabama brock guessed things were about as usual in most ways the new well had caved in again then in the midst of his gossip the thing he had wanted to say all along came out were pleased about your promotion said he and blushing shook drakes hand again warmth kindled the boys face and next with a sudden severity he said youre keeping back something the honest brock looked blank then labored in his memory has the sorrel girl in harney married you yet said drake brock slapped his leg and the horses jumped at his mirth he was mostly gravemannered but when his boy superintendent joked he rejoiced with the same pride that he took in all of drakes excellences the boys in this country will back you up said he next day and drake inquired what news from the malheur agency since the new chinaman has been cooking for them said brock they have been peaceful as a man could wish theyll approve of me then drake answered im feeding em hyas christmas muckamuck and what may that be asked the schoolmaster you no kumtux chinook inquired drake travel with me and youll learn all sorts of languages it means just a big feed all whiskey is barred he added to brock its the only way said the foreman theyve got those pennsylvania men up there drake had not encountered these the three brothers drinker said brock full halfpast full and drunk are what they call them thems the names theyve brought them from klamath and rogue river i should not think a chinaman would enjoy such comrades ventured mr bolles chinamen dont have comrades in this country said brock briefly they like his cooking its a lonesome section up there and a chinaman could hardly quit it not if he was expected to stay suppose they kick about the whiskey rule he suggested to drake cant help what they do oh ill give each boy his turn in harney city when he gets anxious its the whole united lot i dont propose to have cut up on me a look of concern for the boy came over the face of foreman brock several times again before their parting did he thus look at his favorite they paused at harpers for a day to attend to some matters and when drake was leaving this place one of the men said to him well stand by you but from his blithe appearance and talk as the slim boy journeyed to the malheur river and headquarter ranch nothing seemed to be on his mind oregon twinkled with sun and fine white snow they crossed through a world of pines and creviced streams and exhilarating silence the little waters fell tinkling through icicles in the loneliness of the woods and snowshoe rabbits dived into the brush east oregon the owyhee and the malheur country the old trails of general crook the willows by the streams the open swales the high woods where once buffalo horn and chief eegante and oits the medicineman prospered through this domain of war and memories went bolles the schoolmaster with dean drake and brock the third noon from harpers they came leisurely down to the old malheur agency where once the hostile indians had drawn pictures on the door and where castle rock frowned down unchanged i wish i was going to stay here with you said brock to drake by indian creek you can send word to me quicker than weve come why youre an old bat said the boy to his foreman and clapped him farewell on the shoulder brock drove away thoughtful he was not a large man his face was cleancut almost delicate he had a welltrimmed yellow mustache and it was chiefly in his blue eye and lean cheekbone that the frontiersman showed he loved dean drake more than he would ever tell even to himself the young superintendent set at work to ranchwork this afternoon of brocks leaving and the buccaroos made his acquaintance one by one and stared at him villany did not sit outwardly upon their faces they were not villains but they stared at the boy sent to control them and they spoke together laughing drake took the head of the table at supper with bolles on his right down the table some silence some staring much laughing went on the rich brute laugh of the belly untroubled by the brain sam the chinaman rapid and noiseless served the dishes what is it said a buccaroo can it bite said another if you guess what it is you can have it said a third its meat remarked drake incisively helping himself and tougher than it looks the brute laugh rose from the crowd and fell into surprised silence but no rejoinder came and they ate their supper somewhat thoughtfully the chinamans quick soft eye had glanced at dean drake when they laughed he served his dinner solicitously in his kitchen that evening he and bolles unpacked the good things the olives the dried fruits the cigars brought by the new superintendent for christmas and finding bolles harmless like his gentle asiatic self sam looked cautiously about and spoke you not know why they laugh said he they not talk about my meat then they mean new boss misser dlake he velly young boss i think said bolles mr drake understood their meaning sam i have noticed that at times he expresses himself peculiarly i also think they understood his meaning the oriental pondered me like misser dlake said he and drawing quite close he observed they not nice man velly much next day and every day misser dlake went gayly about his business at his desk or on his horse vigilant near and far with no sign save a steadier keenness in his eye for the christmas dinner he provided still further sending to the grande ronde country for turkeys and other things he won the heart of bolles by lending him a good horse but the buccaroos though they were boisterous over the coming christmas joy did not seem especially grateful drake however kept his worries to himself this thing happens anywhere he said one night in the office to bolles puffing a cigar ive seen a troop of cavalry demoralize itself by a sort of contagion from two or three men i think it was wicked to send you here by yourself blurted bolles poppycock its the chance of my life and ill jam her through or bust i think they have decided you are getting turkeys because you are afraid of them said bolles why of course but d you figure im the man to abandon my christmas turkey because my motives for eating it are misconstrued dean drake smoked for a while then a knock came at the door five buccaroos entered and stood close as is the way with the guilty who feel uncertain we were thinking as maybe youd let us go over to town said halfpast full the spokesman when oh any day along this week cant spare you till after christmas maybe youll not object to one of us goin youll each have your turn after this week a slight pause followed then halfpast full said what would you do if i went anyway cant imagine drake answered easily go and ill be in a position to inform you the buccaroo dropped his stolid bull eyes but raised them again and grinned well im not particular about goin this week boss thats not my name said drake but its what i am they stood a moment then they shuffled out it was an orderly retreat almost drake winked over to bolles that was a graze said he and smoked for a while theyll not go this time question is will they go next iii drake took a fresh cigar and threw his legs over the chair arm i think you smoke too much said bolles whom three days had made familiar and friendly yep have to just now thats what as uncle pasco would say they are a halfbreed lot though the boy continued returning to the buccaroos and their recent visit weaken in the face of a straight bluff you see unless they get whiskeycourageous and ive called em down on that oh said bolles comprehending didnt you see that was their game but he will not go after it the flesh is all they seem to understand murmured bolles halfpast full did not go to harney city for the tabooed whiskey nor did any one drake read his buccaroos like the children that they were after the late encounter of grit the atmosphere was relieved of storm the children the primitive pagan dangerous children forgot all about whiskey and lusted joyously for christmas christmas was coming no work a shootingmatch a big feed cheerfulness bubbled at the malheur agency the weather itself was in tune castle rock seemed no longer to frown but rose into the shining air a mass of friendly strength except when a rare sledge or horseman passed mr bolless journeys to the school were all to show it was not some pioneer colony in a new white silent world that heard only the playful shouts and songs of the buccaroos the sun overhead and the hardcrushing snow underfoot filled every one with a crisp tingling hilarity before the sun first touched castle rock on the morning of the feast they were up and in high feather over at the bunkhouse they raced across to see what sam was cooking they begged and joyfully swallowed lumps of his raw plumpudding merry christmas they wished him and melly clismas said he to them they played leapfrog over by the stable they put snow down each others backs their shouts rang round corners it was like boys let out of school when drake gathered them for the shootingmatch they cheered him when he told them there were no prizes what did they care for prizes when he beat them all the first round they cheered him again pity he hadnt offered prizes he wasnt a good business man after all the rounds at the target proceeded through the forenoon drake the acclaimed leader and the christmas sun drew to midsky but as its splendor in the heavens increased the happy shoutings on earth began to wane the body was all that the buccaroos knew well the flesh comes pretty natural to all of us and who had ever taught these men about the spirit the further they were from breakfast the nearer they were to dinner yet the happy shootings waned the spirit is a strange thing often it dwells dumb in human clay then unexpectedly speaks out of the clays darkness it was no longer a crowd drake had at the target he became aware that quietness had been gradually coming over the buccaroos he looked and saw a man wandering by himself in the lane another leaned by the stable corner with a vacant face through the windows of the bunkhouse he could see two or three on their beds the children were tired of shouting drake went indoors and threw a great log on the fire it blazed up high with sparks and he watched it although the sun shown bright on the windowsill presently he noticed that a man had come in and taken a chair it was halfpast full and with his boots stretched to the warmth he sat gazing into the fire the door opened and another buckaroo entered and sat off in a corner he had a bundle of old letters smeared sheets tied trite a twisted old ribbon while his large toptoughened fingers softly loosened the ribbon he sat with his back to the room and presently began to read the letters over one by one most of the men came in before long and silently joined the watchers round the treat fireplace drake threw another log on and in a short time this too broke into ample flame the silence was long a slice of shadow had fallen across the windowsill when a young man spoke addressing the logs i skinned a coon in san saba texas this day a year at the sound of a voice some of their eyes turned on the speaker but turned back to the fire again the spirit had spoken from the clay aloud and the clay was uncomfortable at hearing it after some more minutes a neighbor whispered to a neighbor play you a game of crib the man nodded stole over to where the board was and brought it across the floor on creaking tiptoe they set it between them and now and then the cards made a light sound in the room i treed that coon on honey said the young man after a while honey creek san saba kind o dry creek used to flow into big brady when it rained the flames crackled on the neighbors still played their cribbage still was the day bright but the shrinking wedge of sun had gone entirely from the windowsill halfpast full had drawn from his pocket a mouthorgan breathing halftunes upon it in the middle of suwanee river the man who sat in the corner laid the letter he was beginning upon the heap on his knees and read no more the great genial logs lay glowing burning from the fresher one the flames flowed and forked along the embered surface of the others ran red and blue shivers of iridescence with legs and arms crooked and sprawled the buccaroos brooded staring into the glow with seldomwinking eyes while deep inside the clay the spirit spoke quietly christmas day was passing but the sun shone still two good hours high outside over the snow and pines it was only in the deeper folds of the hills that the blue shadows had come the rest of the world was gold and silver and from far across that silence into this silence by the fire came a tinkling stir of sound sleighbells it was steadily coming too early for bolles to be back from his school festival the toythrill of the jingling grew clear and sweet a spirit of enchantment that did not wake the stillness but cast it into a deeper dream the bells came near the door and stopped and then drake opened it hello uncle pasco said he thought you were santa claus santa claus hm yes thats what told you maybe id come so you did turkey is due in lets see ninety minutes here boys some of you take uncle pascos horse no no i wont you leave me alone i aint stoppin here i aint hungry i just grubbed at the school sleepin at missouri petes tonight got to make the railroad tomorrow the old man stopped his precipitate statements he sat in his sledge deepy muffled blinking at drake and the buccaroos who had strolled out to look at him done a big business this trip said he told you i would now if you was only givin your children a christmastree like that i seen that feller yer schoolmarm doin just now heehee from his blankets he revealed the wellknown case them things would shine on a tree concluded uncle pasco hang em in the woods then said drake jewelry is it inquired the young texas man uncle pasco whipped open his case there you are said he all whats left that ringll cost you a dollar ive a dollar somewheres said the young man fumbling halfpast full on the other side of the sleigh stood visibly fascinated by the wares he was given a skilful glimpse of down among the blankets he peered and he pondered while uncle pasco glibly spoke to him scatter your truck out plain the buccaroo exclaimed suddenly im not buying in the dark come over to the bunkhouse and scatter brass will look just the same anywhere said drake brass screamed uncle brass your eye but the buccaroos plainly glad for distraction took the woolly old scolding man with them drake shouted that if getting cheated cheered them by all means to invest heavily and he returned alone to his fire where bolles soon joined him they waited accordingly and byandby the sleighbells jingled again as they had come out of the silence so did they go into it their little silvery tinkle dancing away in the distance faint and fainter then like a breath gone uncle pascos trinkets had audibly raised the mens spirits they remained in the bunkhouse their laughter reaching drake and bolles more and more sometimes they would scuffle and laugh loudly do you imagine its more leapfrog inquired the schoolmaster gambling said drake theyll keep at it now till one of them wins everything the rest have bought have they been lively ever since morning had a reaction about noon said drake regular homesick spell i felt sorry for em they seem full of reaction said bolles listen to that it was now near four oclock and sam came in announcing dinner all ready said the smiling chinaman pass the good word to the bunkhouse said drake if they can hear you sam went across and the shouting stopped then arose a thick volley of screams and cheers that dont sound right said drake leaping to his feet in the next instant the chinaman terrified returned through the open door behind him lurched halfpast full and stumbled into the room his boot caught and he pitched but saved himself and stood swaying heavily looking at drake the hair curled dense over his bull head his mustache was spread with his grin the light of cloddish humor and destruction burned in his big eye the clay had buried the spirit like a caving pit twas false jewelry all right he roared at the top of his voice a good old jimmyjohn full boss say boss goin to run our jimmyjohn off the ranch try it on kid come over and try it on the bull beat on the table dean drake had sat quickly down in his chair his gray eye upon the hulking buccaroo small and dauntless he sat a sparrowhawk caught in a trap and game to the end whatever end its a trifle tardy to outline any policy about your demijohn said he seriously you folks had better come in and eat before youre beyond appreciating ho well eat your grub boss sams cooking goes the buccaroo lurched out and away to the bunkhouse where new bellowing was set up ive got to carve this turkey friend said the boy to bolles ill do my best to help eat it returned the schoolmaster smiling misser dlake said poor sam i solly you i velly solly you iv reserve your sorrow sam said dean drake give us your soup for a starter come he said to bolles quick he went into the diningroom prompt in his seat at the head of the table with the schoolmaster next to him nice man uncle pasco he continued but his time is not now we have nothing to do for the present but sit like every day and act perfectly natural i have known simpler tasks said mr bolles but ill begin by spreading this excellently clean napkin youre no schoolmarm exclaimed drake you please me the worst of a bad thing said the mild bolles is having time to think about it and we have been spared that here they come said drake they did come but drakes alert strategy served the end he had tried for the drunken buccaroos swarmed disorderly to the door and halted once more the new superintendents ways took them aback here was the decent table with lights serenely burning with unwonted good things arranged upon it the olives the oranges the preserves neat as parade drill were the mens places all the cups and forks symmetrical along the white cloth there waiting his guests at the far end sat the slim young boss talking with his boarder mr bolles the parts in their smooth hair going with all the rest of this propriety even the daily tin dishes were banished in favor of crockery bashful of sams napkins boys said the boss or is it the baldheaded china at this bidding they came in uncertainly their whiskey was ashamed inside they took their seats glancing across at each other in a transient silence drawing their chairs gingerly beneath them thus ceremony fell unexpected upon the gathering and for a while they swallowed in awkwardness what the swift noiseless sam brought them he in a long white apron passed and repassed with his things from his kitchen doubly efficient and civil under stress of anxiety for his young master in the pauses of his serving he watched from the background with a face that presently caught the notice of one of them smile you almondeyed highbinder said the buccaroo and the chinaman smiled his best ive forgot something said halfpast full rising dont let em skip a course on me halfpast left the room thats what i have been hoping for said drake to bolles halfpast returned presently and caught drakes look of expectancy oh no boss said the buccaroo instantly from the door youre on to me but im on to you he slammed the door with ostentation and dropped with a loud laugh into his seat first smart thing ive known him do said drake to bolles i am disappointed two buccaroos next left the room together they may get lost in the snow said the humorous halfpast ill just show em the trail once more he rose from the dinner and went out yes he knew too much to bring it in here said drake to bolles he knew none but two or three would dare drink with me looking on dont you think he is afraid to bring it in the same room with you at all bolles suggested and me temperance this season now bolles thats unkind oh dear that is not at all what i know what you meant bolles i was only just making a little merry over this casualty no he dont mind me to that extent except when hes sober look at him halfpast was returning with his friends quite evidently they had all found the trail uncle pasco is a nice old man pursued drake i havent got my gun on have you yes said bolles but with a sheepish swerve of the eye drake guessed at once not baby bunting oh lord and i promised to give you an adult weapon the kind theyre wearing now by way of fulldress talkin secrets boss said halfpast full the wellmeaning sam filled his cup and this proceeding shifted the buccaroos truculent attention whats that mud he demanded coffee said sam politely the buccaroo swept his cup to the ground and the next man howled dismay burn your poor legs said halfpast he poured his glass over the victim they wrestled the company pounded the table betting hoarsely until halfpast went to the floor and his plate with him go easy said drake youre smashing the companys property baldheaded china for sure boss said a second of the brothers drinker and dropped a dish ill merely tell you said drake that the company dont pay for this china twice not twice said halfpast full smashing some more how about thrice want your money now another inquired a riot of banter seized upon all of them and they began to laugh and destroy how much did this cost said one prying askew his threetined fork how much did you cost yourself said another to drake what our kid boss two bits i guess hyas markook too dear they bawled at their own jokes loud and ominous threat sounded beneath their lightest word the new crashes of china that they threw on the floor struck sharply through the foreboding din of their mirth the spirit that drake since his arrival had kept under in them day by day but not quelled rose visibly each few succeeding minutes swelling upward as the tide does buoyed up on the whiskey it glittered in their eyes and yelled mutinously in their voices im waiting all orders said bolles to drake i havent any said drake new ones that is weve sat down to see this meal out got to keep sitting he leaned back eating deliberately saying no more to the buccaroos thus they saw he would never leave the room till they did as he had taken his chair the first so was the boy bound to quit it the last the game of prying forktines staled on them one by one and they took to songs mostly of love and parting with the red whiskey in their eyes they shouted plaintively of sweethearts and vows and lips and meeting in the wild wood from these they went to ballads of the cattletrail and the yuba river and so inevitably worked to the old coast song made of three languages with its verses rhymed on each year since the first beginning tradition laid it heavy upon each singer in his turn to keep the pot aboiling by memory or by new invention and the chant went forward with hypnotic cadence to a tune of larkish ripping gayety he who had read over his old stained letters in the homesick afternoon had waked from such dreaming and now sang once jes onced in the year o i met a fancy thing by the name o keroline i never could persuade her for to leave me be she went and she took and she married me his neighbor was ready with an original contribution once once again in the year o by the city of whatcom down along the shore i never could persuade them for to leave me be a siwash squaw went and took and married me what was you doin between all them years called halfpast full shut yer mouth said the next singer once once again in the year o twas the suddenest deed that i ever done i never could persuade them for to leave me be a rich bankers daughter she took and married me this is looking better said bolles to drake dont you believe it said the boy ten or a dozen years were thus sung i never could persuade them for to leave me be tempestuously brought down the chorus and the fists until the drunkards could sit no more but stood up to sing tramping the tune heavily together then just as the turn came round to drake himself they dashed their chairs down and herded out of the room behind halfpast full slamming the door drake sat a moment at the head of his christmas dinner the fallen chairs the lumpy wreck blood charged his face from his hair to his collar lets smoke said he they went from the dinner through the room of the great fireplace to his office beyond have a mild one he said to the schoolmaster no a strong one tonight if you please and bolles gave his mild smile you do me good now and then said drake dear me said the teacher i have found it the other way all the rooms fronted on the road with doors the oldtime agency doors where the hostiles had drawn their pictures in the days before peace had come to reign over this country drake looked out because the singing had stopped and they were very quiet in the bunkhouse he saw the chinaman steal from his kitchen sam is tired of us he said to bolles tired running away i guess id prefer a new situation myself thats where youre deficient bolles only got sense enough to stay where you happen to be hello what is he up to sam had gone beside a window of the bunkhouse and was listening there flat like a shadow suddenly he crouched and was gone among the sheds out of the bunkhouse immediately came a procession the buccaroos still quiet a careful gradual body drake closed his door and sat in the chair again theyre escorting that jug over here said he a new move and a big one he and bolles heard them enter the next room always without much noise or talk the loudest sound was the jug when they set it on the floor then they seemed to sit talking little bolles said drake the sun has set if you want to take after sam but the door of the sittingroom opened and the chinaman himself came in he left the door aswing and spoke clearly misser dlake said he slove bloke stove broke the superintendent came out of his office following sam to the kitchen he gave no look or word to the buccaroos with their demijohn he merely held his cigar sidewise in his teeth and walked with no hurry through the sittingroom sam took him through to the kitchen and round to a hind corner of the stove pointing misser dlake said he slove no bloke i hear them inside they going kill you thats about the way i was figuring it mused dean drake misser dlake said the chinaman with appealing eyes i velly solly you they no hurtee me me cook sam there is much meat in your words condensed beef dont class with you but reserve your sorrows yet a while now whats my policy he debated tapping the stove here and there for appearances somebody might look in shall i go back to my office and get my guns you not goin run now said the chinaman anxiously oh yes sam but i like my gun travelling keeps me kind of warm now if they should get a sight of me arming no shes got to stay here till i come back for her so long sam see you later and ill have time to thank you then drake went to the corral in a strolling manner there he roped the strongest of the horses and also the schoolmasters in the midst of his saddling bolles came down can i help you in any way said bolles youve done it saved me a bothering touchandgo play to get you out here and seem innocent im going to drift drift there are times to stay and times to leave bolles and this is a case of the latter have you a real gun on now poor bolles brought out guiltily his smith wesson i dont seem to think of things said he cheer up said drake how could you thoughtread me hide baby bunting though now were off quietly at the start as if we were merely jogging to pasture sam stood at his kitchen door mutely wishing them well the horses were walking without noise but halfpast full looked out of the window were by anyhow said drake quick now burn the earth the horse sprang at his spurs dust you son of a gun rattle your hocks brindle vamoose each shouted word was a lash with his quirt duck he called to bolles bolles ducked and bullets grooved the spraying snow they rounded a corner and saw the crowd jumping into the corral and sams door empty of that prudent celestial hes a very wise chinaman shouted drake as they rushed what screamed bolles very wise chinaman hell break that stove now to prove his innocence who did you say was innocent screamed bolles oh i said you were yelled drake disgusted and he gave over this effort at conversation as their horses rushed along v it was a dim wide stretch of winter into which drake and bolles galloped from the howling pursuit twilight already veiled the base of castle rock and as they forged heavily up a ridge through the caking snow and the yells came after them bolles looked seriously at dean drake but that youth wore an expression of rising merriment bolles looked back at the dusk from which the yells were sounding then forward to the spreading skein of night where the trail was taking him and the boy and in neither direction could he discern cause for gayety may i ask where we are going said he away drake answered just away bolles its a healthy resort ten miles were travelled before either spoke again the drunken buccaroos yelled hot on their heels at first holding more obstinately to this chase than sober ruffians would have attempted ten cold dark miles across the hills it took to cure them but when their shootings that had followed over heights where the pines grew and down through the open swales between dropped off and died finally away among the willows along the south fork of the malheur drake reined in his horse with a jerk now isnt that too bad he exclaimed it is all very bad said bolles sorry to hear the boys tone of disappointment i didnt think theyd fool me again continued drake jumping down again inquired the interested bolles why theyve gone home said the boy in disgust i was hoping so said the schoolmaster hoping why its sad bolles four miles farther and id have had them lost oh said bolles i wanted them to keep after us complained drake soon as we had a good lead i coaxed them coaxed them along on purpose by a trail they knew and four miles from here id have swung south into the mountains they dont know there theyd have been good and far from home in the snow without supper like you and me bolles but after all my trouble theyve gone back snug to that fireside well let us be as cosey as we can he built a bright fire and he whistled as he kicked the snow from his boots busying over the horses and the blankets take a rest he said to bolles one mans enough to do the work be with you soon to share our little cottage presently bolles heard him reciting confidentially to his horse twas the night after christmas and all in the house only we are not all in the house he slapped the belly of his horse tyee who gambolled away to the limit of his picketrope appreciating the moon bolles said he returning at length to the fire what are you so gazeful about father this is all my own doing lamented the schoolmaster what the moon is it has just come over me bolles continued it was before you got in the stage at nampa i was talking i told uncle pasco that i was glad no whiskey was to be allowed on the ranch it all comes from my folly why you hungry old new england conscience cried the boy clapping him on the shoulder how in the world could you foresee the crookedness of that hoary beelzebub thats all very well said bolles miserably you would never have mentioned it yourself to him you and i bolles are different i was raised on miscellaneous wickedness a look at my insides would be liable to make you say your prayers the schoolmaster smiled if i said any prayers he replied you would be in them drake looked moodily at the fire the lord helps those who help themselves said he ive prospered for a nineteenyearold ive hooked my claw fairly deep here and there as for today why thats in the game too it was their deal could they have won it on their own play a joker dropped into their hand its my deal now and i have some jokers myself go to sleep bolles weve a ride ahead of us the boy rolled himself in his blanket skillfully bolles heard him say once or twice in a sort of judicial conversation with the blanket and all in the house but we were not all in the house not all not a full house his tones drowsed comfortably into murmur and then to quiet breathing bolles fed the fire thatched the unneeded windbreak for the calm dry night was breathless and for a long while watched the moon and a tuft of the sleeping boys hair if he is blamed said the schoolmaster ill never forgive myself ill never forgive myself anyhow a paternal or rather maternal expression came over bolless face and he removed his large serious glasses he did not sleep very well the boy did im feeling like a bird said he as they crossed through the mountains next morning on a short cut to the owybee breakfast will brace you up bolles therell be a cabin pretty soon after we strike the other road keep thinking hard about coffee i wish i could said poor bolles he was forgiving himself less and less their start had been very early as drake bid the schoolmaster observe to have nothing to detain you nothing to eat and nothing to pack is a great help in journeys of haste the warming day and indian creek well behind them brought drake to whistling again but depression sat upon the selfaccusing bolles even when they sighted the owyhee road below them no cheerfulness waked in him not at the nearing coffee nor yet at the companionable tinkle of sleighbells dancing faintly upward through the bright silent air why if it aint uncle pasco said drake peering down through a gap in the foothill well get breakfast sooner than i expected quick give me baby bunting are you going to kill him whispered the schoolmaster with a beaming countenance and he scuffled with his pocket to hand over his hitherto belittled weapon drake considered him bolles bolles said he you have got the new england conscience rank plymouth rock is a pudding to your heart remind me to pray for you first spare minute i get now follow me close hell be much more useful to us alive they slipped from their horses stole swiftly down a shoulder of the hill and waited among some brush the bells jingled unsuspectingly onward to this ambush only hear em said drake all full of silver and merry christmas dont gaze at me like that bolles or ill laugh and give the whole snap away see him come the old mans breath streams out so calm hes not worried with new england conscience one two three just before the sleigh came opposite dean drake stepped out morning uncle said he throw up your hands uncle pasco stopped dead his eyes blinking then he stood up in the sleigh among his blankets hm said he the kid throw up your hands quit fooling with that blanket drake spoke dangerously now bolles he continued pitch everything out of the sleigh while i cover him hes got a shotgun under that blanket sling it out it was slung the wraps followed uncle pasco stepped obediently down and soon the chattels of the emptied sleigh littered the snow the old gentleman was invited to undress until they reached the sixshooter that drake suspected then they ate his lunch drank some whiskey that he had not sold to the buccaroos told him to repack the sleigh allowed him to wrap up again bade him take the reins and they would use his sixshooter and shotgun to point out the road to him he had said very little had uncle pasco but stood blinking obedient and malignant hm said he now goin to ride with me are you he was told yes that for the present he was their coachman their horses were tired and would follow tied behind were weary too said drake getting in take your legs out of my way or ill kick off your shins bolles are you fixed warm and comfortable now start her up for harper ranch uncle what are you proposing to do with me inquired uncle pasco not going to wring your neck and thats enough for the present faster uncle get a gait on bolles heres baby bunting much obliged to you for the loan of it old man uncle pascos eye fell on the caliber pistol did you hold me up with that lemonade straw he asked huskily yep said drake thats what oh hell murmured uncle pasco and for the first time he seemed dispirited uncle youre not making time said drake after a few miles ill thank you for the reins open your bandanna and get your concertina jerk the bellows for us that ill not screamed uncle pasco its music or walk home said the boy take your choice uncle pasco took his choice opening with the melody of the last rose of summer the sleigh whirled up the owyhee by the winter willows and the levels and the meadow pools bright frozen under the blue sky late in this day the amazed brock by his corrals at harpers beheld arrive his favorite his boy superintendent driving in with the schoolmaster staring through his glasses and uncle pasco throwing out active strains upon his concertina the old man had been bidden to bellows away for his neck drake was not long in explaining his need to the men this thing must be worked quick said he wholl stand by me all of them would and he took ten with the faithful brock brock would not allow gilbert to go because he had received another mulekick in the stomach nor was bolles permitted to be of the expedition to all his protests drake had but the single word this is not your fight old man youve done your share with baby bunting thus was the schoolmaster in sorrow compelled to see them start back to indian creek and the malheur without him with him uncle pasco would have joyfully exchanged he was taken along with the avengers they would not wring his neck but they would play cat and mouse with him and his concertina and they did but the conscience of bolles still toiled when drake and the men were safe away he got on the wagon going for the mail thus making his way next morning to the railroad and boise where max vogel listened to him and together this couple hastily took train and team for the malheur agency the avengers reached indian creek duly and the fourth day after his christmas dinner drake came once more in sight of castle rock i am doing this thing myself understand he said to brock i am responsible were here to take your orders returned the foreman but as the agency buildings grew plain and the time for action was coming brocks anxious heart spoke out of its fulness if they start in to to they might i wish youd let me get in front he begged all at once i thought you thought better of me said drake excuse me said the man then presently i dont see how anybody could a told hed smuggle whiskey that way if the old man brock meant max vogel goes to blame you ill give him my opinion straight the old mans got no use for opinions said drake he goes on results he trusted me with this job and were going to have results now the drunkards were sitting round outside the ranch house it was evening they cast a sullen inspection on the newcomers who returned them no inspection whatever drake had his men together and took them to the stable first a shed with mangers here he had them unsaddle because he mentioned to brock in case of trouble well be sure of their all staying im taking no chances now soon the drunkards strolled over saying goodday hazarding a few comments on the weather and like topics and meeting sufficient answers goin to stay dont know thats a good horse youve got fair but sam was the blithest spirit at the malheur agency hiyah he exclaimed misser dlake how fashion you come quick so and the excellent chinaman took pride in the meal of welcome that he prepared suppers now said drake to his men sit anywhere you feel like dont mind whose chair youre taking and well keep our guns on thus they followed him and sat the boy took his customary perch at the head of the table with brock at his right i miss old bolles he told his foreman you dont appreciate bolles from what you tell of him said brock ill examine him more careful seeing their boss the sparrowhawk back in his place flanked with supporters and his gray eye indifferently upon them the buccaroos grew polite to oppressiveness while sam handed his dishes to drake and the newcomers and the newcomers eat what was good before the old inhabitants got a taste these latter grew more and more solicitous they offered sugar to the strangers they offered their beds halfpast full urged them to sit companionably in the room where the fire was burning but when the meal was over the visitors went to another room with their arms and lighted their own fire they brought blankets from their saddles and after a little concertina they permitted the nearly perished uncle pasco to slumber soon they slumbered themselves with the door left open and drake watching he would not even share vigil with brock and all night he heard the voices of the buccaroos holding grand unending council when the relentless morning came and breakfast with the visitors again in their seats unapproachable the drunkards felt the crisis to be a strain upon their sobered nerves they glanced up from their plates and down along to dean drake eating his hearty porridge and back at one another and at the hungry welloccupied strangers say we dont want trouble they began to the strangers course you dont breakfasts what youre after oh well youd have got gay a man gets gay sure mr drake said halfpast full sweating with his effort we were sorry while we was afogging you up yes said drake you must have been just overcome by contrition a large laugh went up from the visitors and the meal was finished without further diplomacy one matter mr drake stammered halfpast full as the party rose our jobs were glad to pay for any things what got sort of broke sort of broke repeated the boy eyeing him so you want to hold your jobs if began the buccaroo and halted fact is youre a set of cowards said drake briefly i notice youve forgot to remove that whiskey jug the demijohn still stood by the great fireplace drake entered and laid hold of it the crowd standing back and watching he took it out with what remained in its capacious bottom set it on a stump stepped back levelled his gun and shattered the vessel to pieces the whiskey drained down wetting the stump creeping to the ground much potency lies in the objectlesson and a grin was on the faces of all present save uncle pascos it had been his demijohn and when the shot struck it he blinked nervously you ornery old mink said drake looking at him you keep to the jewelry business hereafter the buccaroos grinned again it was reassuring to witness wrath turn upon another you want to hold your jobs drake resumed to them you can trust yourselves yes sir said halfpast full but i dont trust you stated drake genially and the buccaroos hopeful eyes dropped im going to divide you pursued the new superintendent split you far and wide among the companys ranches stir you in with decenter blood youll go to whitehorse ranch just across the line of nevada he said to halfpast full im tired of the brothers drinker youll go lets see drake paused in his apportionment and a sleigh came swiftly round the turn the horse loping and lathery what vas dat shooting i hear joost now shouted max vogel before he could arrive he did not wait for any answer thank the good god he exclaimed at seeing the boy dean drake unharmed standing with a gun and to their amazement he sped past them never slacking his horses lope until he reached the corral there he tossed the reins to the placid bolles and springing out like a surefooted elephant counted his saddlehorses for he was a general satisfied he strode back to the crowd by the demijohn when dem men get restless he explained to drake at once always look out somebody might steal a horse the boy closed one gray confidential eye at his employer just my idea said he when i counted em before breakfast you liddle rrascal said max fondly what you shoot at drake pointed at the demijohn it was bigger than those bottles at nampa said he guess you could have hit it yourself maxs great belly shook he took in the situation it had a flavor that he liked he paused to relish it a little more in silence und you have killed noding else said he looking at uncle pasco who blinked copiously mine old friend you never get rich if you change your business so frequent i tell you that thirty years now maxs hand found drakes shoulder but he addressed brock he is all what you tell me said he to the foreman he have joodgement thus the huge jovial teuton took command but found drake had left little for him to do the buccaroos were dispersed at harpers at fort rinehart at alvord lake towards steins peak and at the island ranch by harney lake and if you know east oregon or the land where chief eegante helped out specimen jones his white soldier friend when the hostile bannocks were planning his immediate death as a spy you will know what wide regions separated the buccaroos bolles was taken into max vogels esteem also was chinese sam but max sat smoking in the office with his boy superintendent in particular satisfaction you are a liddle rrascal said he und i rraise you fifty dollars a kinsman of red cloud i it was thirty minutes before a june sundown at the post and the first call had sounded for parade over in the barracks the two companies and the single troop lounged a moment longer then laid their police literature down and lifted their stocking feet from the beds to get ready in the officers quarters the captain rose regretfully from afterdinner digestion and the three lieutenants sought their helmets with a sigh lieutenant balwin had been dining an unconventional and impressive guest at the mess and he now interrupted the anecdote which the guest was achieving with frontier deliberation make yourself comfortable he said ill have to hear the rest about the halfbreed when i get back there aint no more yet he got my cash with his private poker deck that onced and im fixing for to get hisn second call sounded the lines filed out and formed the sergeant of the guard and two privates took their station by the flag and when battalion was formed the commanding officer towering steeplestiff beneath his plumes received the adjutants salute ordered him to his post and began drill at all this the unconventional guest looked on comfortably from lieutenant balwins porch i doubt if i could put up with that there discipline all the week he mused carry arms present arms i guess thats all i know of it the winking white line of gloves stirred his approval pretty good that gosh see the sun on them bayonets the last note of retreat merged in the sonorous gun and the flag shining in the light of evening slid down and rested upon the earth the blue ranks marched to a single bugle the post was short of men and officers and the captain with the released lieutenants again sought digestion and cigars balwin returned to his guest and together they watched the day forsake the plain presently the guest rose to take his leave he looked old enough to be the father of the young officer but he was a civilian and the military man proceeded to give him excellent advice now dont get into trouble cutler the slouchshouldered scout rolled his quid gently and smiled at his superior with indulgent regard see here cutler you have a highly unoccupied look about you this evening ive been studying the customs of this population and ive noted a fact or two let em loose on me sir fact one when any male inhabitant of fort laramie has a few spare moments he hunts up a game of cards well sir youve called the turn on me fact two at fort laramie a game of cards frequently ends in discussion fact three mr calvin in them discussions jarvis cutler has the last word you put that in your census report alongside the other two well cutler if somebodys gun should happen to beat yours in an argument i should have to hunt another wagonmaster ill not forget that when was you expecting to pull out north whenever the other companies get here may be three days may be three weeks then i will have plenty time for a game tonight with this slight dig of his civilian independence into the lieutenants military ribs the scout walked away his long lugubrious frockcoat worn in honor of the mess occasionally flapping open in the breeze and giving a view of a belt richly fluted with cartridges and the ivory handle of a pistol looking out of its holster he got on his horse crossed the flat and struck out for the cabin of his sociable friends loomis and kelley on the hill the open door and a light inside showed the company and cutler gave a grunt for sitting on the table was the halfbreed the winner of his unavenged dollars he rode slower in order to think and arriving at the corral below the cabin tied his horse to the stump of a cottonwood a few steps towards the door and he wheeled on a sudden thought and under cover of the night did a crafty something which to the pony was altogether unaccountable he unloosed both front and rear cinch of his saddle so they hung entirely free in wide bands beneath the ponys belly he tested their slackness with his hand several times stopping instantly when the more and more surprised pony turned his head to see what new thing in his experience might be going on and seeing gave a delicate bounce with his hindquarters never you mind duster muttered the scout did you ever see a skunktrap oughts is for mushrats and number ones is mostly used for coons and possums and i guess theyd do for a skunk but you and well call this here trap a number two duster for the skunk im after is a big one all youve to do is to act natural cutler took the rope off the stump by which duster had been tied securely wound and strapped it to the tilted saddle and instead of this former tether made a weak knot in the reins and tossed them over the stump he entered the cabin with a countenance sweeter than honey goodevening boys he said why toussaint how do you do the hand of toussaint had made a slight a very slight movement towards his hip but at sight of cutlers mellow smile resumed its clasp upon his knee golly but youre gaylike this evening said kelley blamed if i knowed he could look so frisky added loomis sporting his oncedayear coat kelley pursued that aint for our benefit joole no were not that high in society both these cheerful waifs had drifted from the atlantic coast westward cutler looked from them to his costume and then amiably surveyed the halfbreed well boys im in big luck i am hows yourn nowadays toussaint pretty good sometime sometime heap hell the voice of the halfbreed came as near heartiness as its singularly false quality would allow and as he smiled he watched cutler with the inside of his eyes the scout watched nobody and nothing with great care looked about him pleasantly inquired for the whiskey threw aside hat and gloves sat down leaning the chair back against the wall and talked with artful candor them sprigs of lieutenants down there said he theyre a surprising lot for learning virtue to a man you take balwin why he aint been out of the academy only two years and hes been telling me how cardplaying aint good for you and what do you suppose hes been and offered jarvis cutler for a job im to be wagonmaster he paused and the halfbreeds attention to his next words increased wagonmaster and good pay too clean up to the black hills and the troopsll move soon as ever them reinforcements come drinks on it boys set em up joole loomis my contracts sealed with some of uncle sams cash and im going to play it right here hello somebody coming to join us hes in a hurry there was a sound of lashing straps and hoofs beating the ground and cutler looked out of the door as he had calculated the saddle had gradually turned with dusters movements and set the pony bucking stampeded said the scout and swore the proper amount called for by such circumstances some o you boys help me stop the durned fool loomis and kelley ran duster had jerked the prepared reins from the cottonwood and was lurching down a small dry gulch with the saddle bouncing between his belly and the stones cutler cast a backward eye at the cabin where toussaint had stayed behind alone head him off below boys and ill head him off above the scout sang out he left his companions and quickly circled round behind the cabin stumbling once heavily and hurrying on anxious lest the noise had reached the lurking halfbreed but the ivoryhandled pistol jostled from its holster lay unheeded among the stones where he had stumbled he advanced over the rough ground came close to the logs and craftily peered in at the small window in the back of the cabin it was evident that he had not been heard the sinister figure within still sat on the table but was crouched listening like an animal to the shouts that were coming from a safe distance down in the gulch cutler outside of the window could not see the face of toussaint but he saw one long brown hand sliding up and down the mans leg and its movement put him in mind of the tail of a cat the hand stopped to pull out a pistol into which fresh cartridges were slipped cutler had already done this same thing after dismounting and he now felt confident that his weapon needed no further examination he did not put his hand to his holster the figure rose from the table and crossed the room to a set of shelves in front of which hung a little yellow curtain behind it were cups cans bottles a pistol counters red white and blue and two fresh packs of cards blue and pink side by side seeing these toussaint drew a handkerchief from his pocket and unwrapped two further packs both blue and at this cutlers intent face grew into plain shape close to the window but receded again into uncertain dimness from down in the gulch came shouts that the runaway horse was captured toussaint listened ran to the door and quickly returning put the blue pack from the shelf into his pocket leaving in exchange one of his own he hesitated about altering the position of the cards on the shelf but kelley and loomis were unobservant young men and the halfbreed placed the pink cards on top of his blue ones the little yellow curtain again hung innocently over the shelves and toussaint pouring himself a drink of whiskey faced round and for the first time saw the window that had been behind his back he was at it in an instant wrenching its rusty pin that did not give but stuck motionless in the wood cursing he turned and hurried out of the door and round the cabin no one was there some hundred yards away the noiseless cutler crawled farther among the thickets that filled the head of the gulch toussaint whipped out a match and had it against his trousers to strike and look if there were footprints when second thoughts warned him this might be seen and was not worth risking suspicion over since so many feet came and went by this cabin he told himself no one could have been there to see him and slowly returned inside with a mind that fell a hairs breadth short of conviction the boys coming up with the horse met cutler who listened to how duster had stood still as soon as he had kicked free of his saddle making no objection to being caught they suggested that he would not have broken loose had he been tied with a rope and hearing this cutler bit off a piece of tobacco and told them they were quite right a horse should never be tied by his bridle for a savory moment the scout cuddled his secret and turned it over like the tobacco lump under his tongue then he explained and received serenely the amazement of loomis and kelley when you kids have travelled this western country awhile youll keep your cards locked said he hes going to let us win first youll see hell play a poor game with the pink deck then if we dont call for fresh cards why hell call for em himself but just for the fun of the thing if any of us loses steady why well call then when he gets hold of his strippers watch out when he makes his big play and is stretchin for to rake the counters in you grab em joole for by then ill have my gun on him and if he makes any trouble well feed him to the coyotes i expect that must have been it boys he continued in a new tone as they came within possible earshot of the halfbreed in the cabin a coyote come around him where he was tied the fool horse has seen enough of em to git used to em youd think but he dont there thatll hold him i guess hell have to pull the world along with him if he starts to run again the lamp was placed on the windowshelf and the four took seats cutler to the left of toussaint with kelley opposite the pink cards fell harmless and for a while the game was a dull one to see holding a pair of kings cutler won a little from toussaint who remarked that luck must go with the money of uncle sam after a few hands the halfbreed began to bet with ostentatious folly and losing to one man and another was joked upon the falling off of his game in an hours time his blue chips had been twice reinforced and twice melted from the neat oftencounted pile in which he arranged them moreover he had lost a horse from his string down on chug water lend me ten dollar he said to cutler you rich man now in the next few deals kelley became poor im sick of this luck said he then change it why dont you lets have a new deck and loomis rose joole you always are for something new said cutler now im doing pretty well with these pink cards but im no hog fetch on your fresh ones the eyes of the halfbreed swerved to the yellow curtain he was by a french trapper from canada out of a sioux squaw one of red clouds sisters and his heart beat hot with the evil of two races and none of their good he was at this moment irrationally angry with the men who had won from him through his own devices and malice undisguised shone in his lean flat face at sight of the blue cards falling in the first deal silence came over the company and from the distant paradeground the bugle sounded the melancholy strain of taps faint far solemn melodious the music travelled unhindered across the empty night them men are being checked off in their bunks now said cutler what you bet this game demanded toussaint ive heard em play that same music over a soldiers grave said kelley you goin to bet toussaint repeated cutler pushed forward the two necessary white chips no ones hand was high and loomis made a slight winning the deal went its round several times and once when it was toussaints cutler suspected that special cards had been thrown to him by the halfbreed as an experiment he therefore played the gull to a nicety betting gently upon his three kings but when he stepped out boldly and bet the limit it was not toussaint but kelley who held the higher hand winning with three aces why the coup should be held off longer puzzled the scout unless it was that toussaint was carefully testing the edges of his marked cards to see if he controlled them to a certainty so cutler played on calmly presently two aces came to him in toussaints deal and he wondered how many more would be in his threecard draw very pretty one only and he lost to loomis who had drawn three and held four kings the hands were getting higher they said the game had something to it now but toussaint grumbled for his luck was bad all this year he said cutler had now made sure that the aces and kings went where the halfbreed wished and could be slid undetected from the top or the middle or the bottom of the pack but he had no test yet how far down the scale the marking went at toussaints next deal cutler judged the time had come and at the second round of betting he knew it the three white men played their parts raising each other without pause and again there was total silence in the cabin every face bent to the table watching the turn repeat its circle with obstinate increase until new chips and more new chips had been brought to keep on with and the heap in the middle had mounted high in the hundreds while in front of toussaint lay his knife and a matchbox pledges of two more horses which he had staked he had drawn three cards while the others took two except cutler who had a pair of kings again and drawing three picked up two more kelley dropped out remarking he had bet more than his hand was worth which was true and loomis followed him their persistence had surprised toussaint a little he had not given every one suspicious hands cutlers four kings were enough he bet once more was raised by the scout called and threw down his four aces that beats me said cutler quietly and his hand moved under his frockcoat as the halfbreed eyeing the central pile of counters in triumph closed his fingers over it they were dashed off by kelley who looked expectantly across at cutler and seeing the scouts face wither into sudden old age cried out for gods sake jarvis wheres your gun kelley sprang for the yellow curtain and reeled backward at the shot of toussaint his arm thrashed along the windowsill as he fell sweeping over the lamp and flaring channels of oil ran over his body and spread on the ground but these could no longer hurt him the halfbreed had leaped outside the cabin enraged that cutler should have got out during the moment he had been dealing with kelley the scout was groping for his ivoryhandled pistol off in the darkness he found it and hurried to the little window at a second shot he heard inside loomis beating the rising flame away had seized the pistol from the shelf and aimlessly fired into the night at toussaint he fired again running to the door from the scorching heat cutler got round the house to save him if he could and saw the halfbreeds weapon flash and the body pitch out across the threshold toussaint gaining his horse shot three times and missed cutler whom he could not clearly see and he heard the scouts bullets sing past him as his horse bore him rushing away ii jarvis cutler lifted the dead loomis out of the cabin he made a try for kelleys body but the room had become a cave of flame and he was driven from the door he wrung his hands giving himself bitter blame aloud as he covered loomis with his saddleblanket and jumped bareback upon duster to go to the post he had not been riding a minute when several men met him they had seen the fire from below and on their way up the halfbreed had passed them at a run heres our point said cutler will he hide with the sioux or will he take to the railroad well thats my business more than being wagonmaster ill get a warrant you tell lieutenant balwin and somebody give me a fresh horse a short while later as cutler with the warrant in his pocket rode out of fort laramie the call of the sentinels came across the night number one twelve oclock and alls well a moment and the refrain sounded more distant given by number two when the fourth took it up far away along the line the words were lost leaving something like the faint echo of a song the halfbreed had crossed the platte as if he were making for his kindred tribe but the scout did not believe in this too plain trail theres chug water lying right the other way from where he went and i guess its there mr toussaint is aiming for with this idea cutler swung from north to southwest along the laramie he went slowly over his shortcut not to leave the widely circling toussaint too much in his rear the fugitive would keep himself carefully far on the other side of the laramie and very likely not cross it until the forks of chug water dawn had ceased to be gray and the doves were cooing incessantly among the river thickets when cutler reaching the forks found a bottom where the sagebrush grew seven and eight feet high and buried himself and his horse in its cover here was comfort here both rivers could be safely watched it seemed a good leisuretime for a little fire and some breakfast he eased his horse of the saddle sliced some bacon and put a match to his pile of small sticks as the flame caught he stood up to enjoy the cool of a breeze that was passing through the stillness and he suddenly stamped his fire out the smell of another fire had come across chug water on the wind it was incredible that toussaint should be there already there was no seeing from this bottom and if cutler walked up out of it the other man would see too if it were toussaint he would not stay long in the vast exposed plain across chug water but would go on after his meal in twenty minutes it would be the thing to swim or wade the stream and crawl up the mud bank to take a look meanwhile cutler dipped in water some old bread that he had and sucked it down while the little breeze from opposite hook the cottonwood leaves and brought over the smell of cooking meat the sun grew warmer and the doves ceased cutler opened his big watch and clapped it shut as the sound of mud heavily slopping into the other river reached him he crawled to where he could look at the laramie from among his sagebrush and there was toussaint leading his horse down to the water the halfbreed gave a shrill call and waved his hat his call was answered and as he crossed the laramie three sioux appeared riding to the bank they waited till he gained their level when all four rode up the chug water and went out of sight opposite the watching cutler the scout threw off some of his clothes for the water was still high and when he had crossed and drawn himself to a level with the plain there were the four squatted among the sagebrush beside a fire they sat talking and eating for some time one of them rose at last pointed south and mounting his horse dwindled to a dot blurred and evaporated in the heated trembling distance cutler at the edge of the bank still watched the other three who sat on the ground a faint shot came and they rose at once mounted and vanished southward there was no following them now in this exposed country and cutler feeling sure that the signal had meant something about toussaints horses made his fire watered his own horse and letting him drag a rope where the feed was green ate his breakfast in ease toussaint would get a fresh mount and proceed to the railroad with the comfort of certainty and tobacco the scout lolled by the river under the cottonwood and even slept in the cool of the afternoon he reached the cabin of an acquaintance twenty miles south and changed his horse a man had passed by he was told looked as if bound for cheyenne no cutler said hes known there and he went on watching toussaints tracks within ten miles they veered away from cheyenne to the southeast and cutler struck out on a trail of his own more freely by midnight he was on lodgepole creek sleeping sound among the last trees that he would pass he slept twelve hours having gone to bed knowing he must not come into town by daylight about nine oclock he arrived and went to the railroad station there the operator knew him the lowest haunt in the town had a tent south of the union pacific tracks and cutler getting his irons and a man from the saloon went there and stepped in covering the room with his pistol the fiddle stopped the shrieking women scattered and toussaint who had a glass in his hand let it fly at cutlers head for he was drunk there were two customers besides himself nobody shall get hurt here said cutler above the bedlam that was now set up only that mans wanted the quieter i get him the quieter itll be for others toussaint had dived for his pistol but the proprietor of the dancehall scenting law struck the halfbreed with the butt of another and he rolled over and was harmless for some minutes then he got on his legs and was led out of the entertainment which resumed more gayly than ever feet shuffled the fiddle whined and truculent treble laughter sounded through the canvas walls as toussaint walked between cutler and the saloonman to jail he was duly indicted and upon the scouts deposition committed to trial for the murder of loomis and kelley cutler hoping still to be wagonmaster wrote to lieutenant balwin hearing in reply that the reinforcements would not arrive for two months the session of the court came in one and cutler was the territorys only witness he gave his name and age and hesitated over his occupation call it pokerdealer sneered toussaints attorney i would but im such a fool one observed the witness put me down as wagonmaster to the military outfit thats going to white river what is your residence well i reside in the section that lies between the missouri river and the pacific ocean a pleasant neighborhood said the judge who knew cutler perfectly and precisely how well he could deal poker hands its not a pleasant neighborhood for some and cutler looked at toussaint you think you done with me toussaint inquired upon which silence was ordered in the court upon cutlers testimony the halfbreed was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged in six weeks from that day hearing this he looked at the witness i see you one day agin he said the scout returned to fort laramie and soon the expected troops arrived and the expedition started for white river to join captain brent the captain was stationed there to impress red cloud and had written to headquarters that this chief did not seem impressed very deeply and that the lives of the settlers were insecure reinforcements were accordingly sent to him on the evening before these soldiers left laramie news came from the south toussaint had escaped from jail the country was full of roving dubious indians and with the authentic news went a rumor that the jailer had received various messages these were to the effect that the sioux nation did not desire toussaint to be killed by the white man that toussaints mother was the sister of red cloud and that many friends of toussaint often passed the jailers house perhaps he did get such messages they are not a nice sort to receive however all this may have been the prisoner was gone iii fort robinson on the white river is backed by yellow bluffs that break out of the foothills in turret and toadstool shapes with stunt pines starving between their torrid bastions in front of the fort the land slants away into the flat unfeatured desert and in summer the sky is a bluesteel covet that each day shuts the sun and the earth and mankind into one box together while it lifts at night to let in the cool of the stars the white river which is not wide runs in a curve and around this curve below the fort some distance was the agency and beyond it a stockade inside which in those days dwelt the settlers all this was strung out on one side of the white river outside of the curve and at a point near the agency a footbridge of two cottonwood trunks crossed to the concave of the rivers bend a bottom of some extent filled with growing cottonwoods and the tepees of many sioux families along the river and on the plain other tepees stood one morning after lieutenant balwin had become established at fort robinson he was talking with his friend lieutenant powell when cutler knocked at the wire door the wagonmaster was a privileged character and he sat down and commented irrelevantly upon the lieutenants pictures indian curiosities and other wellmeant attempts to conceal the walk whats the trouble cutler dont know as theres any trouble come to your point man youre not a scout now toussaints here what in camp hiding with the sioux two knives heard about it two knives was a friendly indian hes laying for me cutler added youve seen him no i want to quit my job and go after him nonsense said powell you cant cutler said balwin i cant spare you youll be having to fill my place then i guess you mean to go without permission said powell sternly lord no hell shoot me thats all the two lieutenants pondered and its today continued cutler plaintively that he should be gettin hanged in cheyenne still the lieutenants pondered while the wagonmaster inspected a photograph of marie rose as marguerite i have it exclaimed powell lets kill him how about the commanding officer hed back us but well tell him afterwards cutler can you find toussaint if i get the time very well youre off duty till you do then report to me at once just after guardmounting two days later cutler came in without knocking toussaint was found he was down on the river now beyond the stockade in ten minutes the wagonmaster and the two lieutenants were rattling down to the agency in an ambulance behind four tall blue government mules these were handily driven by a seventeenyearold boy whom balwin had picked up liking his sterling american ways he had come west to be a cowboy but a chance of helping to impress red cloud had seemed still dearer to his heart they drew up at the agency store and all went in leaving the boy nearly out of his mind with curiosity and pretending to be absorbed with the reins presently they came out balwin with fieldglasses now said he where you see the stockade sir well said powell sticking his chin on cutlers shoulder to look along his arm as he pouted but the scout proposed to be deliberate now the gate of the stockade is this way aint it well well you start there and follow the fence to the corner the left corner towards the river then you follow the side thats nearest the river down to the other corner now that corner is about a hundred yards from the bank you take a beeline to the bank and go down stream maybe thirty yards no itll be forty yards i guess theres a lone pinetree right agin the edge the wagonmaster stopped i see all that said lieutenant balwin screwing the fieldglasses theres a buck and a squaw lying under the tree naw sir drawled cutler that aint no buck thats him lying in his injun blanket and chinnin a squaw why that mans an indian cutler i tell you i can see his braids oh hes rigged up injun fashion fust rate sir but them braids of his aint hisn false hair the lieutenants passed each other the fieldglasses three times and glared at the lone pine and the two figures in blankets the boy on the ambulance was unable to pretend any longer and leaned off his seat till he nearly fell well said balwin i never saw anything look more like a buck sioux look at his paint take the glasses yourself cutler but cutler refused hes like an injun he said but thats just what he wants to be the scouts conviction bore down their doubt they were persuaded you cant come with us cutler said powell you must wait for us here i know sir hed spot us sure but it aint right i started this whole business with my poker scheme at that cabin and i ought to stay with it clear through the officers went into the agency store and took down two rifles hanging at the entrance always ready for use were going to kill a man they explained and the owner was entirely satisfied they left the rueful cutler inside and proceeded to the gate of the stockade turning there to the right away from the river and following the paling round the corner down to the farther righthand corner looking from behind it the lone pinetree stood near and plain against the sky the striped figures lay still in their blankets talking with their faces to the river here and there across the stream the smokestained peak of a tepee showed among the green leaves did you ever see a more genuine indian inquired baldwin we must let her rip now anyhow said powell and they stepped out into the open they walked towards the pine till it was a hundred yards from them and the two beneath it lay talking all the while balwin covered the man with his rifle and called the man turned his head and seeing the rifle sat up in his blanket the squaw sat up also again the officer called keeping his rifle steadily pointed and the man dived like a frog over the bank like magic his blanket had left his limbs and painted body naked except for the breechclout balwins tardy bullet threw earth over the squaw who went flapping and screeching down the river balwin and powell ran to the edge which dropped six abrupt feet of clay to a trail then shelved into the swift little stream the red figure was making up the trail to the footbridge that led to the indian houses and both officers fired the man continued his limber flight and they jumped down and followed firing they heard a yell on the plain above and an answer to it and then confused yells above and below gathering all the while the figure ran on above the river trail below the bank and their bullets whizzed after it indian asserted balwin panting ran away though said powell sod you run think any siouxd stay when an army officer comes gunning for him shoot said powell s getting near bridge and they went on running and firing the yells all over the plain were thickening the air seemed like a substance of solid flashing sound the naked runner came round the river curve into view of the people at the agency store wheres a rifle said cutler to the agent officers got em the agent explained well i cant stand this said the scout and away he went that mans crazy said the agent you bet he aint remarked the ambulance boy cutler was much nearer to the bridge than was the man in the breechclout and reaching the bank he took half a minutes keen pleasure in watching the race come up the trail when the figure was within ten yards cutler slowly drew an ivoryhandled pistol the lieutenants below saw the man leap to the middle of the bridge sway suddenly with arms thrown up and topple into white river the current swept the body down and as it came it alternately lifted and turned and sank as the stream played with it sometimes it struck submerged stumps or shallows and bounded half out of water then drew under with nothing but the back of the head in sight turning round and round the din of indians increased and from the tepees in the cottonwoods the red sioux began to boil swarming on the opposite bank but uncertain what had happened the man rolling in the water was close to the officers its not our man said balwin did you or i hit him were gone anyhow said powell quietly look a dozen rifles were pointing at their heads on the bank above the indians still hesitated for there was two knives telling them these officers were not enemies and had hurt no sioux suddenly cutler pushed among the rifles dashing up the nearest two with his arm and their explosion rang in the ears of the lieutenants powell stood grinning at the general complication of matters that had passed beyond his control and balwin made a grab as the head of the man in the river washed by the false braid came off in his hand quick shouted cutler from the bank shove him up here two knives redoubled his harangue and the indians stood puzzled while the lieutenants pulled toussaint out not dead but shot through the hip they dragged him over the clay and hoisted him till cutler caught hold and jerked him to the level as a new noise of rattling descended on the crowd and the four blue mules wheeled up and halted the boy had done it himself massing the officers need he had pelted down among the sioux heedless of their yells and keeping his gray eyes on his team in got the three pushing toussaint in front and scoured away for the post as the squaw arrived to shriek the truth to her tribe what red clouds relation had been the victim cutler sat smiling as the ambulance swung along i told you i belonged in this here affair he said and when they reached the fort he was saying it still occasionally captain brent considered it neatly done but that boy put the finishing touches he said lets have him in the boy was had in and ate a dinner with the officers in glum embarrassment smoking a cigar after it without joy toussaint was given into the doctors hands and his wounds carefully dressed this will probably cost an indian outbreak said captain brent looking down at the plain blanketed riders galloped over it and yelling filled the air but toussaint was not destined to cause this further harm an unexpected influence intervened all afternoon the cries and galloping went on and next morning worse sign there seemed to be no indians in the world the horizon was empty the air was silent the smoking tepees were vanished from the cottonwoods and where those in the plain had been lay the lodgepoles and the fires were circles of white cold ashes by noon an interpreter came from red cloud red cloud would like to have toussaint if the white man was not willing it should be war captain brent told the story of loomis and kelley say to red cloud he ended that when a white man does such things among us he is killed ask red cloud if toussaint should live if he thinks yes let him come and take toussaint the next day with ceremony and feathers of state red cloud came bringing his interpreter and after listening until every word had been told him again requested to see the halfbreed he was taken to the hospital a sentry stood on post outside the tent and inside lay toussaint with whom cutler and the ambulanceboy were playing whiskeypoker while the patient was waiting to be hanged he might as well enjoy himself within reason such was cutlers frontier philosophy we should always do what we can for the sick at sight of red cloud looming in the doorway gorgeous and grim as fate the game was suspended the indian took no notice of the white men and walked to the bed toussaint clutched at his relations fringe but red cloud looked at him then the mongrel strain of blood told and the halfbreed poured out a chattering appeal while red cloud by the bedside waited till it had spent itself then he grunted and left the room he had not spoken and his crest of long feathers as it turned the corner was the last vision of him that the cardplayers had red cloud came back to the officers and in their presence formally spoke to his interpreter who delivered the message red cloud says toussaint heap no good no injun anyhow he not want him white man hunt pretty hard for him can keep him thus was toussaint twice sentenced he improved under treatment played many games of whiskeypoker and was conveyed to cheyenne and hanged these things happened in the early seventies but there are sioux still living who remember the two lieutenants and how they pulled the halfbreed out of white river by his false hair it makes them laugh to this day almost any indian is full of talk when he chooses and when he gets hold of a joke he never lets go sharons choice under providence a man may achieve the making of many things ships books fortunes himself even quite often enough to encourage others but let him beware of creating a town towns mostly happen no realestate operator decided that rome should be sharon was an intended town a one mans piece of deliberate manufacture his whim his pet his monument his device for immortally continuing above ground he planned its avenues gave it his middle name fed it with his railroad but he had reckoned without the inhabitants to say nothing of nature and one day they displeased him whenever you wish you can see sharon and what it has come to as i saw it when as a visitor without local prejudices they asked me to serve with the telegraphoperator and the ticketagent and the hotelmanager on the literary committee of judges at the school festival there would be a stage and flags and elocution and parents assembled and afterwards icecream with strawberries from el paso have you ever awarded prizes for school speaking inquired the telegraphoperator stuart yes i told him at concord in new hampshire ever have a chat afterwards with a mother whose girl did not get the prize it was boys i replied and parents had no say in it its boys and girls in sharon said he parents have no say in it here either but that dont seem to occur to them at the moment well all stick together of course i think i had best resign said i you would find me no hand at pacifying a mother there are fathers also said stuart but individual parents are small trouble compared with a big split in public opinion weve missed that so far though then why have judges why not a popular vote i inquired dont go back on us said stuart we are so few here and you know education cant be democratic or where will good taste find itself eastman knows that much at least and stuart explained that eastman was the head of the school and chairman of our committee he is from massachusetts and his taste is good but he is total abstinence wont allow any literature with the least smell of a drink in it not even in the singingclass would not have heres a health to king charles inside the door narrowing that as many of the finest classics speak of wine freely eastman is useful but a crank now take lochinvar we are to have it on strawberry night but say eastman kicked about it told the kid to speak something else kid came to me and i a smile lurked for one instant in the corner of stuarts eye and disappeared again then he drew his arm through mine as we walked you have never seen anything in your days like sharon said he you could not sit down by yourself and make such a thing up shakespeare might have but he would have strained himself doing it well eastman says lochinvar will go in my expurgated version too bad sir walter cannot know ever read his familiar letters great grief but he was a good man eastman stuck about that mention of wine remember so now am i come with this lost love of mine to lead but one measure drink one cup of wine well thought i eastman would agree to water water and daughter would go but is frequently used and spoils the meter so i fiddled with my pencil down in the telegraph office and i fixed the thing up hows this so now am i come with this beautiful maid to lead but one measure drink one lemonade eastman accepts that says its purer oh its not all sadness here how did you come to be in sharon i asked my exotic acquaintance ah how did i how did all our crowd at the railroad somebody has got to sell tickets somebody has got to run that hotel and telegraphs have got to exist here thats how we foreigners came many travellers change cars here and one train usually misses the other because the two companies do not love each other you hear lots of language especially in december eastern consumptives bound for southern california get left here and drummers are also thick remarks range from how provoking to things i would not even say myself so that big hotel and depot has to be kept running and we fellows get a laugh now and then our lot is better than these peoples he made a general gesture at sharon i should have thought it was worse said i no for well be transferred some day these poor folks are shipwrecked though it is their own foolishness all this again my eye followed as he indicated the town with a sweep of his hand and from the town i looked to the four quarters of heaven i may have seen across into old mexico no sign labels the boundary the vacuum of continent goes on you might think to patagonia symptoms of neighboring mexico basked on the sand heaps along sharons spacious avenues little torpid indecent gnomes in sashes and open rags with crowningsteeple straw hats and murder dozing in their small black eyes they might have crawled from holes in the sand or hatched out of brown cracked pods on some weeds that trailed through the broken bottles the old shoes and the wire fences outside these ramparts began the vacuum white gray indigo florescent where all the year the sun shines not the semblance of any tree dances in the heat only rocks and lumps of higher sand waver and dissolve and reappear in the shaking crystal of mirage not the scar of any riverbed furrows the void a river there is flowing somewhere out of the shiny violet mountains to the north but it dies subterraneously on its way to sharon misses the town and emerges thirty miles south across the sunlight in a shallow futile lake a cienaga called las palomas then it evaporates into the ceaseless blue sky the water you get in sharon is dragged by a herd of windwheels from the bowels of the sand over the town they turn and turn sharons upper story a filmy colony of slats in some of the homes beneath them you may go upstairs in the american homes not in the adobe mexican caves of song woman and knives and brick and stone edifices occur monuments of perished trade these rise among their flatter neighbors cubical and stark undershirts firearms and groceries for sale in the groundfloor blind dustwindows above most of the mansions however squat ephemerally upon the soil no cellar to them and no staircase the total fragile box ready to bounce and caracole should the wind drive hard enough inside them eating mending the newspaper and more babies eke out the twelvemonth outside the citizens loiter to their errands along the brief wide avenues of sharon that empty into space men women and children move about in the town sparse and casual and over their heads in a white tribe the windwheels on their rudders veer to the breeze and indolently revolve above the gaping obsoleteness through the dumb town the locomotive bell tolls pervadingly when a train of freight or passengers trundles in from the horizon or out along the dwindling fence of telegraph poles no matter where you are you can hear it come and go leaving sharon behind an airy carcass bleached and ventilated sitting on the sand with the sun and the hot wind pouring through its bones this town was the magnates child the thing that was to keep his memory green and as i took it in on that first walk of discovery stuart told me its story how the magnate had decreed the railroad shops should be here how at that corner lots grew in a night how horsemen galloped the streets shooting for joy and the hasty tents rose while the houses were hammered together how they had song dance cards whiskey license murder marriage opera the whole usual thing regular as the clock in our west in australia in africa in every virgin corner of the world where the anglosaxon rushes to spend his animal spirits regular as the clock and in sharons case about fifteen minutes long for they became greedy the cornerlot people they ran up prices for land which the railroad the breath of their nostrils wanted they grew ugly forgetting they were dealing with a magnate and that a railroad from ocean to ocean can take its shops somewhere else with appalling ease thus did the corner lots become sand again in a night and in the words of the poet concluded stuart sharon has an immense future behind it our talk was changed by the sight of a lady leaning and calling over a fence mrs jeffries said she oh mrs jeffries well called a voice next door i want to send leola and arvasita into your yard well the voice repeated our toolhouse blew over into your yard last night its jammed behind your tank oh indeed a window in the next house was opened a head put out and this occasioned my presentation to both ladies they were mrs mattern and mrs jeffries and they fell instantly into a stiff caution of deportment but they speedily found i was not worth being cautious over stuart whispered to me that they were widows of high standing and mothers of competing favorites for the elocution prize and i hastened to court their esteem mrs mattern was in body more ample standing high and yellow and fluffy but mrs jeffries was smooth and small and behind her spectacles she had an eye you must not let us interrupt you ladies said i after some civilities did i understand that something was to be carried somewhere you did said mrs jeffries she had come out of her house and i am pleased to notice no damage has been done to our fence this time it would have been fixed right up at my expense as always mrs jeffries retorted her neighbor and started to keep abreast of mrs jeffries as that lady walked and inspected the fence thus the two marched parallel along the frontier to the rear of their respective territories youll not resign said stuart to me it is yours till death aint it i told him that it was about once a month i can expect this said mrs jeffries returning along her frontier well its not the only case in sharon mrs jeffries said mrs mattern ill remind you of them three coops when you kept poultry and they got away across the railroad along with the barbers shop but cannot we help you get it out said i with a zealous wish for peace you are very accommodating sir said mrs mattern one of the prizeawarding committee said stuart an elegant judge of oratory has decided many contests at concord the home of emerson concord new hampshire i corrected but neither lady heard me how splendid for leola cried mrs mattern instantly leola oh leola come right out here mrs jeffries has been more prompt she was already in her house and now came from it bringing a pleasantlooking boy of sixteen it might be the youth grinned at me as he stood awkwardly brought in shirtsleeves from the performance of some household work this is guy said his mother guy took the prize last year guy hopes shut up mother said guy with entire sweetness i dont hope twice twice or a dozen times should raise no hard feelings if my son is sharons best speaker cried mrs jeffries and looked across the fence viciously shut up mother i aint said guy he is a master of humor recitations his mother now said to me perhaps you know or perhaps you do not know how high up that is reckoned why mother leola can speak all around me she can guy added to me nodding his head confidentially i did not believe him i think because i preferred his name to that of leola leola will study in paris france announced mrs mattern arriving with her child she has no advantages here this is the gentleman leola but before i had more than noted a darkeyed maiden who would not look at me but stood in skirts too young for her figure black stockings and a dangle of hair that should have been up her large parent had thrust into my hand a scrapbook here is what the santa fe observer says and when i would have read she read aloud for me the next is the los angeles christian home and heres what they wrote about her in el paso her histrionic genius for one so young it commences below that picture thats leola i now recognized the black stockings and the hair heres what a literary lady in lordsburg thinks pursued mrs mattern never mind that murmured leola i shall and the mother read the letter to me leola has spoke in five cultured cities she went on arvasita can

recites the letterandcoughing scene act third mr patterson of coloraydo springs pronounces it superior to modjeska that is leola again said mrs mattern showing me another newspaper cut hair stockings

ladies leola said her mother recite when the british warrior queen to the gentleman no momma please not said leola and her voice made me look at her something of appeal sounded in it leola is that young you must excuse her said her mother and i thought the girl winced come away guy suddenly snapped little mrs jeffries we are wasting the gentlemans time you are no infant prodigy and we have no pictures of your calves to show him in the papers why mother cried the boy and he gave a brotherly look to leola but the girl scarlet and upset now ran inside the house as for wasting time madam said i with indignation you are wasting yours in attempting to prejudice the judges there said guy and mrs mattern continued if i may say so without offense the age real or imaginary of the speakers may make a difference in albuquerque but with our committee not the slightest thank you im sure said mrs mattern bridling eastern ideas are ever welcome in sharon said mrs jeffries goodmorning and she removed guy and herself into her house while mrs mattern and arvasita stiffly ignoring me passed into their own door come have a drink said stuart to me i am glad you said it old mother mattern will let down those prodigy skirts the poor girl has been ashamed of them these two years but momma has bulldozed her into staying young for stage effect the girls not conceited for a wonder and she speaks well it is even betting which of the two widows you have made the maddest close by the saloon we were impeded by a rush of small boys they ran before and behind us suddenly from barrels and unforeseen places and wedging and bumping between us they shouted chickenlegs ah look at the chickenlegs for a sensitive moment i feared they were speaking of me but the folding slatdoors of the saloon burst open outward and a giant barkeeper came among the boys and caught and shook them to silence you want to behave was his single remark and they dispersed like a sundayschool i did not see why they should thus describe him he stood and nodded to us and jerked big thumb towards the departing flock funny how a boy will never think said he with amiability but theyll grow up to be about as good as the rest of us i guess dont you let them monkey with you josey he called naw i wont said a voice i turned and saw by a barrel a youth in kneebreeches glowering down the street at his routed enemies he was possibly eight and one hand was bound in a grimy rag this was chickenlegs did they harm you josey asked the giant naw they didnt not troubled your hand any naw they didnt well dont you let them touch you well see you through and as we followed him in towards our drink through his folding slatdoors he continued discoursing to me the newcomer i am against interfering with kids i like to leave em fight and fool just as much as they see fit now them boys aint malicious but theyre young you see theyre young and misfortune dont appeal to them josey lost his father last spring and his mother died last month last week he played with a freight car and left two of his fingers with it now you might think that was enough hardship indeed yes i answered but the little stake he inherited was gambled away by his stinking old aunt well i cried so were seeing him through you bet said a citizen in boots and pistol who was playing billiards this town is not going to permit any man to fool with josey stated his opponent in the game or women either added a lounger by the bar shaggybearded and also with a pistol mr abe hanson said the barkeeper presenting me to him joseys fathers partner hes took the boy from the aunt and is going to see him through how r ye said mr hanson hoarsely and without enthusiasm a member of the prizeawarding committee explained stuart and waved a hand at me they all brightened up and came round me heard my boy speak inquired one reub gadsdens his name i told him i had heard no speaker thus far and i mentioned leola and guy hope the boyll give us the jumping frog again said one i near bust whats the heifer speakin this trip another inquired huh her said a third youll talk different maybe this time retorted the other not agin the jumping frog he wont the first insisted i near bust he repeated id like for you to know my boy reub said mr gadsden to me insinuatingly quit fixing the judge al said leolas backer reub forgets his words an says em over an balks an mires down an backs out an starts fresh en its confusin to foller him im glad to see you take so much interest gentlemen said i yes were apt to see it through said the barkeeper and stuart and i bade them a goodmorning as we neared the schoolmasters house where stuart was next taking me we came again upon the boys with josey and no barkeeper at hand to see him through but josey made it needless at the word chickenlegs he flew in a limber manner upon the nearest and knocking him immediately flat turned with spirit upon a second and kicked him at this they set up a screeching and fell all together and the schoolmaster came out of his door boys boys said he and the sabbath too as this did not immediately affect them mr eastman made a charge and they fled from him then a long stocking of joseys was torn and hung in two streamers round his ankles and his dangling shoelaces were trodden to fringe if you want your hand to get well for strawberry night began mr eastman ah bother strawberry night said josey and hopped at one of his playmates but mr eastman caught him skilfully by the collar i am glad his misfortunes have not crushed him altogether said i josey yeatts is an anxious case sir returned the teacher several influences threaten his welfare yesterday i found tobacco on him chewing sir just you hurt me said josey and ill tell abe abe exclaimed mr eastman lifting his brow he means a man old enough to be his father sir i endeavor to instill him with some few notions of respect but the town spoils him indulges him completely i may say and when sharons sympathies are stirred sir it will espouse a cause very warmly give me that broke off the schoolmaster and there followed a brief wrestle chewing again today sir he added to me abe lemme have it shrieked josey lemme go or hell come over and fix you but the calm chilly eastman had ground the tobacco under his heel you can understand how my hands are tied he said to me readily i answered the men give josey his way in everything he has a i may say an unworthy aunt yes said i so i have gathered at this point josey ducked and slid free and the united flock vanished with jeers at us josey forgot they had insulted him they forgot he had beaten them against a common enemy was their friendship cemented you spoke of sharons warm way of espousing causes said i to eastman i did sir no one could live here long without noticing it sharon is a quiet town but sudden remarked stuart apt to be sudden theyre beginning about strawberry night he said to eastman wanted to know about things down in the saloon how does their taste in elocution chiefly lie i inquired eastman smiled he was young totally bald the moral dome of his skull rising white above visionary eyes and a serious auburn beard he was clothed in a bleak smooth slategray suit and at any climax of emphasis he lifted slightly upon his toes and relaxed again shutting his lips tight on the finished sentence your question said he has often perplexed me sometimes they seem to prefer verse sometimes prose stirs them greatly we shall have a liberal crop of both this year i am proud to tell you i have augmented our number of strawberry speakers by nearly fifty per cent how many will there be said i eleven you might wish some could be excused but i let them speak to stimulate their interest in culture will you not take dinner with me gentlemen i was just sitting down when little josey yeatts brought me out we were glad to do this and he opened another can of corned beef for us i cannot offer you wine sir said he to me though i am aware it is a general habit in luxurious homes and he tightened his lips general habit wherever they dont prefer whiskey said stuart i fear so the schoolmaster replied smiling that poison shall never enter my house gentlemen any more than tobacco and as i cannot reform the adults of sharon i am doing what i can for their children little hugh straight is going to say his lochinvar very pleasingly mr stuart i went over it with him last night i like them to be word perfect he continued to me as failures on exhibition night elicit unfavorable comment and are we to expect failures also i inquired reuben gadsden is likely to mortify us he is an earnest boy but nervous and one or two others but i have limited their length reuben gadsdens father declined to have his boy cut short and he will give us a speech of burkes but i hope for the best it narrows down it narrows down guy jeffries and leola mattern are the two the parents seem to take keen interest said i mr eastman smiled at stuart we have no reason to suppose they have changed since last year said he why sir he suddenly exclaimed if i did not feel i was doing something for the young generation here i should leave sharon tomorrow one is not appreciated not appreciated he spoke fervently of various local enterprises his failures his hopes his achievements and i left his house honoring him but amazed his heart was so wide and his head so narrow a man who would purify with simultaneous austerity the morals of lochinvar and of sharon about once a month said stuart i run against a new side he is blind on take his puzzlement as to whether they perfer verse or prose queer and dumb of him that you see sharon does not know the difference between verse and prose thats going too far said i they dont he repeated when it comes to strawberry night if the piece is about something they understand rhymes do not help or hinder and of course sex is apt to settle the question then i should have thought leola i began not the sex of the speaker its the listeners now you take women women generally prefer something that will give them a good cry we men want to laugh mostly yes said i i would rather laugh myself i think youd know youd rather if you had to live in sharon the laugh is one of the big differences between women and men and i would give you my views about it only my sundayoff time is up and ive got to go to telegraphing our ways are together said i im going back to the railroad hotel theres guy continued stuart he took the prize on the jumping frog spoke better than leola anyhow she spoke the wreck of the hesperus but guy had the back benches thats where the men sit pretty well useless guess if there had been a fire some of the fellows would have been scorched before theyd have got strength sufficient to run out but the ladies did not laugh much said they saw nothing much in jumping a frog and if leola had made em cry good and hard that night the committees decision would have kicked up more of a fuss than it did as it was mrs mattern got me alone but i worked us around to where mrs jeffries was having her icecream and i left them to argue it out let us adhere to that policy i said to stuart and he replied nothing but into the corner of his eye wandered that lurking smile which revealed that life brought him compensations he went to telegraphing and i to revery concerning strawberry night i found myself wishing now that there could have been two prizes i desired both leola and guy to be happy and presently i found the matter would be very close so far at least as my judgment went for boy and girl both brought me their selections begging i would coach them and this i had plenty of leisure to do i preferred guys choice the story of that bluejay who dropped nuts through the hole in a roof expecting to fill it and his friends came to look on and discovered the hole went into the entire house it is better even than the jumping frog better than anything i think and young guy told it well but leola brought a potent rival on the tearful side of things the death of paul dombey is plated pathos not wholly sterling but sharon could not know this and while leola most prettily recited it to me i would lose my recent opinion in favor of guy and acknowledge the value of her performance guy might have the men strong for him but this time the women were going to cry i got also a certain other sort of entertainment out of the competing mothers mrs jeffries and mrs mattern had a way of being in the hotel office at hours when i passed through to meals they never came together and always were taken by surprise at meeting me leola is ever so grateful to you mrs mattern would say oh i would answer do not speak of it have you ever heard guys bluejay story well if its anything like that frog business i dont want to and the lady would leave me guy tells me you are helping him so kindly said mrs jeffries oh yes im severe i answered brightly i let nothing pass i only wish i was as careful with leola but as soon as she begins paul had never risen from his little bed i just lose myself listening to her on the whole there were also compensations for me in these mothers and i thought it as well to secure them in advance when the train arrived from el paso and i saw our strawberries and our icecream taken out i felt the hour to be at hand and that whatever our decision no bias could be laid to me according to his prudent habit eastman had the speakers follow each other alphabetically this happened to place leola after guy and perhaps might give her the last word as it were with the people but our committee was there and superior to such accidents the flags and the bunting hung gay around the draped stage while the audience rustled or resoundingly trod to its chairs and seated neighbors conferred solemnly together over the programme stuart behind the bunting played silver threads among the gold upon a melodeon pretty good this he said to me pumping his feet what i said tune sharon is for free silver do you think they will catch your allusion i asked him no but i have a way of enjoying a thing by myself and he pumped away playing with tasteful variations until the hall was full and the singingclass assembled in gloves and ribbons they opened the ceremonies for us by rendering sweet and low very happily and i trusted it was an omen sharon was hearty and we had sweet and low twice then the speaking began and the speakers were welcomed coming and going with mild and friendly demonstrations nothing that one would especially mark went wrong until reuben gadsden he strode to the middle of the boards and they creaked beneath his tread he stood a moment in large glittering boots and with hair flat and prominently watered as he straightened from his bow his suspenderbuttons came into view and remained so for some singular internal reason while he sent his right hand down into the nearest pocket and began his oratory it is sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of france he said impressively and stopped we waited and presently he resumed it is sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of france he took the right hand out and put the left hand in it is sixteen or seventeen years said he and stared frowning at his boots i found the silence was getting on my nerves i felt as if it were myself who was drifting to idiocy and tremulous empty sensations began to occur in my stomach had i been able to recall the next sentence i should have prompted him it is sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of france said the orator rapidly and down deep back among the men came a voice well i guess it must be reub this snapped the tension i saw reubens boots march away mr eastman came from behind the bunting and spoke i suppose words of protest i could not hear them but in a minute or perhaps two we grew calm and the speaking continued there was no question what they thought of guy and leola he conquered the back of the room they called his name they blessed him with endearing audible oaths and even the ladies smiled at his pleasant honest face the ladies except mrs mattern she sat near mrs jeffries and throughout guys bluejay fanned herself exhibiting a wellsustained inattention she might have foreseen that mrs jeffries would have her turn when the death of paul dombey came and handkerchiefs began to twinkle out among the audience and various noises of grief were rising around us and the men themselves murmured in sympathy mrs jeffries not only preserved a suppressedhilarity countenance but managed to cough twice with a cough that visibly bit into mrs matterns soul but leolas appealing cadences moved me also when paul was dead she made her pretty little bow and we sat spellbound then gave her applause surpassing guys unexpectedly i found embarrassment of choice dazing me and i sat without attending to the later speakers was not successful humor more difficult than pathos were not tears more cheaply raised than laughter yet on the other hand guy had one prize and where merit was so even i sat i say forgetful of the rest of the speakers when suddenly i was aware of louder shouts of welcome and i awaked to josey yeatts bowing at us spit it out josey a large encouraging voice was crying in the back of the hall well see you through dont be scared josey yelled another then josey opened his mouth and rhythmically rattled the following i love little pussy her coat is so warm and if i dont hurt her shell do me no harm ill sit by the fiyer and give her some food and pussy will love me because i am good that was all it had come without falter or pause even for breath josey stood and the room rose to him again again they roared he aint a bit scared go it josey you dont forgit yer piece and a great deal more while they pounded with their boots i love little pussy began josey poor darling said a lady next me no mother ill sit by the fiyer josey was continuing but nobody heard him finish the room was a babel look at his little hand only three fingers inside them rags nobody to mend his clothes any more they all talked to each other and clapped and cheered while josey stood one leg slightly advanced and proudly stiff somewhat after the manner of those military engravings where some general is seen erect upon an eminence at the moment of victory mr eastman again appeared from the bunting and was telling us i have no doubt something of importance but the giant barkeeper now shouted above the din who says josey yeatts aint the speaker for this night at that striking of the common chord i saw them heave promiscuous and unanimous up the steps to the stage josey was set upon abe hansons shoulder while ladies wept around him what the literary committee might have done i do not know for we had not the time even to resign guy and leola now appeared bearing the prize between them a picture of washington handing the bible out of clouds to abraham lincoln and very immediately i found myself part of a procession men and women we were marching about sharon the barkeeper led four of sharons fathers followed him escorting josey borne aloft on abe hansons shoulder and rigid and military in his bearing leola and guy followed with the picture stuart walked with me whistling melodies of the war dixie and others eastman was not with us when the ladies found themselves conducted to the saloon they discreetly withdrew back to the entertainment we had broken out from josey saw them go and shrilly spoke his first word aint i going to have any icecream this presently caused us to return to the ladies and we finished the evening with entire unity of sentiment eastman alone took the incident to heart inquired how he was to accomplish anything with hands tied and murmured his constant burden once more one is not appreciated not appreciated i do not stop over in sharon any more my ranch friend whose presence there brought me to visit him is gone away but such was my virgin experience of the place and in later days fate led me to be concerned with two more local competitions one military and one civil which greatly stirred the population so that i never pass sharon on my long travels without affectionately surveying the sandy quivering bleached town unshaded by its twinkling forest of windwheels surely the heart always remembers a spot where it has been merry and one thing i should like to know shall know perhaps what sort of citizen in our republic josey will grow to be for whom will he vote may he not himself come to sit in washington and make laws for us universal suffrage holds so many possibilities napoleon shavetail augustus albumblatt young and new and sleek with the latest bookknowledge of war reported to his first troop commander at fort brown the ladies had watched for him because he would increase the number of men the officers because he would lessen the number of duties and he joined at a crisis favorable to becoming speedily known by them all upon that same day had household servants become an extinct race the last one the commanding officers cook had told the commanding officers wife that she was used to living where she could see the cars she added that there was no society here fit for man or baste at all this opinion was formed on the preceding afternoon when casey a sergeant of roguish attractions in g troop had told her that he was not a marrying man three hours later she wedded a gambler and this morning at six they had taken the stage for green river two hundred miles south the nearest point where the bride could see the cars frank said the commanding officers wife send over to h troop for york catherine he answered my dear our statesmen at washington say its wicked to hire the free american soldier to cook for you its too menial for his manhood frank stuff hush my love therefore york must be spared the insult of twenty more dollars a month our statesmen must be reelected and you and i catherine being cookless must join the general mess thus did all separate housekeeping end and the garrison began unitedly to eat three times a day what a chinaman set before them when the longexpected albumblatt stepped into their midst just in time for supper this youth was spicandspan from the military academy with a topdressing of three months thoughtful travel in germany i was deeply impressed with the modernity of their scientific attitude he pleasantly remarked to the commanding officer for captain duane silent usually talked at this first meal to make the boy welcome in this forlorn twocompany post were cut off from all that sort of thing here said he ive not been east of the missouri since but weve got the railroad across and weve killed some indians and weve had some fun and were glad were alive eh mrs starr i should think so said the lady especially now weve got a bachelor at the post said mrs bainbridge that has been the one drawback mr albumblatt i thank you for the compliment said augustus bending solemnly from his hips and mrs starr looked at him and then at mrs bainbridge were not overgay i fear the captain continued but the flats full of antelope and theres good shooting up both canyons have you followed the recent target experiments at metz inquired the traveller i refer to the flattened trajectory and the obus controversy we have not heard the reports answered the commandant with becoming gravity but we own a mountain howitzer the modernity of german ordnance began augustus do you dance mr albumblatt asked mrs starr for well have a hop and all be your partners mrs bainbridge exclaimed i will be pleased to accommodate you ladies its anything for varietys sake with us you see said mrs starr smoothly smiling and once again augustus bent blandly from his hips but the commanding officer wished leniency you see us all he hastened to say commissioned officers and dancingmen pretty shabby oh captain said a lady and pretty old captain said another lady but alive and kicking captain starr mr bainbridge the doctor and me we are seven augustus looked accurately about him do i understand seven captain we are seven the senior officer repeated again mr albumblatt counted heads i imagine you include the ladies captain ha ha seven commissioned males sir our major is on sickleave and two of our lieutenants are related to the presidents wife she cant bear them to be exposed none of us in the churchyard lie but we are seven ha ha captain thats an elegant double entendre on wordsworths poem and the war department only if i may correct your addition ha ha our total including myself is eight and augustus grew as hilarious as a wooden nutmeg the commanding officer rolled an intimate eye at his wife the lady was sitting big with rage but her words were cordial still indeed mr albumblatt the way officers who have influence in washington shirk duty here and get details east is something i cant laugh about at one time the captain was his own adjutant and quartermaster there are more officers at this table tonight than ive seen in three years so we are doubly glad to welcome you at fort brown i am fortunate to be on duty where my services are so required though i could object to calling it fort brown and augustus exhaled a new smile prefer smith said captain starr you misunderstand me when we say fort brown fort russell fort et cetera we are inexact they are not fortified cantonment et cetera would be a trifle lengthy wouldnt it put in the doctor his endurance on the wane perhaps but technically descriptive of our western posts the germans criticise these military laxities captain duane now ceased talking but urbanely listened and from time to time his eye would scan augustus and then a certain sublimated laugh to his wife well known would seize him for a single voiceless spasm and pass the experienced albumblatt meanwhile continued bytheway doctor you know the charite of course doctor guild had visited that great hospital but being now a goaded man he stuck his nose in his plate and said unwisely sharrity whats that for then augustus told him what and where it was and that krankenhaus is german for hospital and that he had been deeply impressed with the modernity of the ventilation thirtyfive cubic metres to a bed in new wards he stated how many do you allow doctor none answered the surgeon do i understand none doctor you do sir my patients breathe in cubic feet and swallow their doses in grains and have their inflation measured in inches now there again exclaimed augustus cheerily more antiquity to be swept away and people say we young officers have no work cut out for us patients dont die then under the metric system said the doctor no wonder europes overcrowded said starr but the students mind inhabited heights above such trifling death he said occurs in ratios not differentiated from our statistics and he told them much more while they booked at him over their plates he managed to say modernity and differentiate again for he came from our middle west where they encounter education too suddenly and it would take three generations of him to speak clean english but with all his polysyllabic wallowing he showed himself keenminded pat with authorities a spruce young graduate among these dingy rocky mountain campaigners they had fought and thirsted and frozen the books that he knew were not written when they went to school and so far as war is to be mastered on paper his equipment was full and polished while theirs was meagre and rusty and yet if you know things that other and older men do not it is as well not to mention them too hastily these soldiers wished that they could have been taught what he knew but they watched young augustus unfolding himself with a gaze that might have seemed chill to a less highly abstract thinker he however rose from the table pleasantly edified by himself and hopeful for them and as he left them goodnight ladies and gentlemen he said we shall meet again oh yes said the doctor again and again hes given me indigestion said bainbridge take some metric system said starr and lie flat on your trajectory said the doctor i hate hair parted in the middle for a man said mrs guild and his superior eyeglasses said mrs bainbridge his staring conceited teeth hissed mrs starr i dont like children slopping their knowledge all over me said the doctors wife hes well brushed though said mrs duane seeking the bright side hell wipe his feet on the mat when he comes to call id rather have mud on my carpet than that bandbox in any of my chairs said mrs starr hes no fool mused the doctor but kingdom come what an ass well gentlemen said the commanding officer and they perceived a flavor of the official in his tone mr albumblatt is just twentyone i dont know about you but ill never have that excuse again very well captain well be good said mrs bainbridge and grrateful said mrs starr rolling her eyes piously i prophecy hell entertain us the captains demeanor remained slightly official but walking home his catherine by his side in the dark was twice aware of that laugh of his twinkling in the recesses of his opinions and later going to bed a little joke took him so unready that it got out before he could suppress it my love said he my second lieutenant is grievously mislaid in the cavalry providence designed him for the artillery it was wifely but not right in catherine to repeat this strict confidence in strictest confidence to her neighbor mrs bainbridge over the fence next morning before breakfast at breakfast mrs bainbridge spoke of artillery reinforcing the post and her husband giggled girlishly and looked at the puzzled duane and at dinner mrs starr asked albumblatt would not artillery strengthen the garrison even a light battery pronounced augustus promptly would be absurd and useless whereupon the mess rattled knives sneezed and became variously disturbed so they called him albumbattery and then blattery which is more condensed and captain duanes official tone availed him nothing in this matter but he made no more little military jokes he disliked garrison personalities civilized by birth and ripe from weatherbeaten years of men and observing he looked his second lieutenant over and remembered to have seen worse than this he had no quarrel with the metric system truly the most sensible and thinking to leaven it with a little rule of thumb he made augustus his acting quartermaster but he presently indulged his wife with the soldiercook she wanted at home so they no longer had to eat their meals in albumblatts society and mrs starr said that this showed her husband dreaded his quartermaster worse than the secretary of war alas for the quartermasters sergeant johannes schmoll that routined and clockwork german he found augustus so much more german than he had ever been himself that he went speechless for three days upon his lists his red ink and his ciphering augustus swooped like a bird of prey and all his fond redtape devices were shredded to the winds augustus set going new quadratic ones of his own with an index and crossreferences it was then that schmoll recovered his speech and walked alone saying mein gott and often thereafter wandering among the piled stores and apparel he would fling both arms heavenward and repeat the exclamation he had rated himself the unique human soul at fort brown able to count and arrange underclothing augustus rejected his laborious tally and together they vigiled after hours verifying socks and drawers next augustus found more horseshoes than his papers called for that man gif me der stomach pain efry day wailed schmoll to sergeant casey i tell him lieutenant dose horseshoes is expendable we dont acgount for efry shoe like they was mens shoes und oder dings dot is issued i prefer to cake them cop says baby bismarck und he smile mit his two beaver teeth baby bismarck cried joyfully the rosyfaced casey yohanny take a drink und so continued the outraged schmoll he haf a board of soorvey on dreepound horseshoes und i haf der stomach pain it was buckles the next month the allowance exceeded the expenditure augustuss arithmetic came out wrong and another board sat on buckles yohanny youre lookin jaded under colonel safetypin said casey have something safetypin is my treat said schmoll und very apt but augustus found leisure to pervade the post with his modernity he set himself military problems and solved them he wrote an essay on the contact squadron he corrected bainbridge for saying throw back the left flank instead of refuse the left flank he had readingroom ideas canteen ideas ideas for the indians and the agency and recruitdrill ideas which he presented to sergeant casey casey gave him in exchange the name of napoleon shavetail and had his whiskey again paid for by the sympathetic schmoll but bless his educated heart said casey he dont learn me nothing thatll soil my innercence thus did the sunnyhumored sergeant take it but not thus the mess had augustus seen himself as they saw him could he have heard mrs starr but he did not the youth was impervious and to remove his complacency would require so mrs starr said an operation probably fatal the commanding officer held always aloof from gibing yet often when augustus passed him his gray eye would dwell upon the lieutenants back and his voiceless laugh would possess him that is the picture i retain of these days the unending golden sun the wide gentlecolored plain the splendid mountains the indians ambling through the flat clear distance and here close along the paradeground eyeglassed augustus neatly hastening with the captain on his porch asleep you might suppose one early morning the agent with two indian chiefs waited on the commanding officer and after their departure his wife found him breakfasting in solitary mirth without me she chided sitting down and i know youve had some good news the best my love providence has been tempted at last the wholesome irony of life is about to function frank dont tease so and where are you rushing now before the cakes to set our augustus a little military problem dearest plain living for today and high thinking be jolly well frank youre going to swear and i must know but frank had sworn and hurried out to the right to the adjutants office while his catherine flew to the left to the fence ella she cried oh ella mrs bainbridge instantly on the other side of the fence brought scanty light a telegram had come she knew from the crow agency in montana her husband had admitted this three nights ago and captain duane she knew had given him some orders about something and could it be the crows ella i dont know said catherine frank talked all about providence in his incurable way and it may be anything so the two ladies wondered together over the fence until mrs duane seeing the captain return ran to him and asked were the crows on the warpath then her frank told her yes and that he had detailed albumblatt to vanquish them and escort them to carlisle school to learn german and beethovens sonatas stuff stuff stuff why there he does go cried the unsettled catherine its something at the agency but captain duane was gone into the house for a cigar albumblatt with sergeant casey and a detail of six men was in truth hastening over that broad mile which opens between fort brown and the agency on either side of them the level plain stretched gray with its sage buff with intervening grass haycocked with the smoky mellowstained meerschaumlike canvas tepees of the indians quiet as a painting far eastward lay long low rosered hills half dissolved in the trembling mystery of sun and distance and westward close at hand and high shone the great paleblue serene mountains through the vaster serenity of the air the sounding hoofs of the troops brought the indians out of their tepees to see when albumblatt reached the agency there waited the agent and his two chiefs who pointed to one lodge standing apart some three hundred yards and said he is there so then augustus beheld his problem the military duty fallen to him from providence and captain duane it seems elementary for him who has written of the contact squadron it was to arrest one indian this man ute jack had done a murder among the crows and fled south for shelter the telegram heralded him but with boundless miles for hiding he had stolen in under the cover of night no welcome met him these fort brown indians were not his friends at any time and less so now when he arrived wild drunk among their families hounded out he sought this empty lodge and here he was at bay his hand against every mans counting his own life worthless except for destroying others before he must himself die is he armed albumblatt inquired and was told yes augustus considered the peaked cone tent the opening was on this side but a canvas drop closed it not much of a problem one man inside a sack with eight outside to catch him but the books gave no rule for this combination and augustus had met with nothing of the sort in germany he considered at some length smoke began to rise through the meeting poles of the tepee leisurely and natural and one of the chiefs said maybe ute jack cooking he hungry this is not a laughing matter said augustus to the bystanders who were swiftly gathering tell him that i command him to surrender he added to the agent who shouted this forthwith and silence followed tell him i say he must come out at once said augustus then and received further silence he eat now observed the chief cant talk much sergeant casey bellowed albumblatt go over there and take him out the lootenant understands said casey slowly that ute jack has got the drop on us and there aint no getting any drop on him sergeant you will execute your orders without further comment at this amazing step the silence fell cold indeed but augustus was in command shall i take any men along sir said casey in his soldiers machine voice er yes er no er do as you please the six troopers stepped forward to go for they loved casey but he ordered them sharply to fall back then looking in their eyes he whispered goodbye boys if its to be that way and walked to the lodge lifted the flap and fell shot instantly dead through the heart two bullets into him muttered a trooper heavily breathing as the sounds rang hes down another spoke to himself with fixed eyes and a sigh they did not know of passed among them the two chiefs looked at augustus and grunted short talk together and one with a sweeping lift of his hand out towards the tepee and the dead man by it said maybe ute jack only got three four cartridges so his fingers counted it after he kill three four men you get him pretty good the indian took the white mans death thus but the white men could not yet be even saturnine this will require reinforcement said augustus to the audience the place must be attacked by a front and flank movement it must be knocked down i tell you i must have it knocked down how are you to see where he is id like to know if its not knocked down augustuss voice was getting high i want the howitzer he screeched generally a soldier saluted and augustus chattered at him the howitzer the mountain howitzer i tell you dont you hear me to knock the cursed thing hes in down go to captain duane and give him my compliments and no ill go myself wheres my horse my horse i tell you its got to be knocked down if you please lieutenant said the trooper may we have the red cross ambulance red cross whats that for whats that sergeant casey sir hes alyin there ambulance certainly the howitzer perhaps theyre only flesh wounds i hope they are only flesh wounds i must have more men youll come with me from his porch duane viewed both augustus approach and the man stop at the hospital and having expected a bungle sat to hear but at albumblatts mottled face he stood up quickly and said whats the matter and hearing burst out casey why he was worth fifty of go on mr albumblatt what next did you achieve sir and as the tale was told he cooled bitter but official reinforcements is it mr albumblatt the howitzer captain good and g troop for my double flank movement i perhaps youd like h troop as reserve not reserve captain i should establish this is your duty mr albumblatt perform it as you can with what force you need thank you sir it is not exactly a battle but with a sotospeak intrenched take your troops and go sir and report to me when you have arrested your man then duane went to the hospital and out with the ambulance hoping that the soldier might not be dead but the wholesome irony of life reckons beyond our calculations and the unreproachful sunny face of his sergeant evoked in duanes memory many marches through long heat and cold back in the rough good times hit twice i thought they told me said he and the steward surmised that one had missed perhaps mused duane and perhaps it went as intended too whats all that fuss he turned sharply having lost augustus among his sadder thoughts and here were the operations going briskly powdersmoke in three directions at once here were pickets far outlying and a double line of skirmishers deployed in extended order and a mounted reserve and men standing to horse a command of near a hundred a pudding of pompous incompetent callow bosh with augustus by his howitzer scientifically raising and lowering it to bear on the lone white tepee that shone in the plain four races were assembled to look on the mess chinaman two black laundresses all the whites in the place on horse and foot some with their hats left behind and several hundred indians in blankets duane had a thought to go away and leave this galling farce under the eye of starr for the officers were at hand also but his second thought bade him remain and looking at augustus and the howitzer his laugh would have returned to him but his heart was sore for casey it was an hour of strategy and cannonade a humiliating hour which fort brown tells of to this day and the tepee lived through it all for it stood upon fifteen slender poles not speedily to be chopped down by shooting lead from afar when low bullets drilled the canvas the chief suggested to augustus that ute jack had climbed up and when the bullets flew high then ute jack was doubtless in a hole nor did augustus contrive to drop a shell from the howitzer upon ute jack and explode him a shrewd and deadly conception the shells went beyond except one that ripped through the canvas somewhat near the ground and augustus dripping turned at length and saying it wont go down stood vacantly wiping his white face then the two chiefs got his leave to stretch a rope between their horses and ride hard against the tepee it was military neither in essence nor to see but it prevailed the tepee sank a huge umbrella wreck along the earth and there lay ute jack across the fires slight hollow his kneecap gone with the howitzer shell but no blood had flown from that blood will not run you know when a man has been dead some time one single other shot had struck him one through his own heart it had singed the flesh you see mr albumblatt said duane in the whole crowds hearing he killed himself directly after killing casey a very rare act for an indian as you are doubtless aware but if your manoeuvres with his corpse have taught you anything you did not know before we shall all be gainers captain said mrs starr on a later day you and ute jack have ended our fun since the court of inquiry let mr albumblatt off he has not said germany once and thats three months tomorrow twenty minutes for refreshments upon turning over again my diary of that excursion to the pacific i find that i set out from atlantic waters on the th day of a backward and forlorn april which had come and done nothing towards making its share of spring but had gone missing its chance leaving the trees as bare as it had received them from the winds of march it was not bleak weather alone but care that i sought to escape by a change of sky and i hoped for some fellowtraveller who might begin to interest my thoughts at once no such person met me in the several pullmans which i inhabited from that afternoon until the forenoon of the following friday through that long distance though i had slanted southwestward across a multitude of states and vegetations and the mississippi lay eleven hundred miles to my rear the single event is my purchasing some catseyes of the newsagent at sierra blanca save this my diary contains only neat additions of daily expenses and moral reflections of a delicate and restrained melancholy they were pecos catseyes he told me obtained in the rocky canyons of that stream and destined to be worth little until fashion turned from foreign jewels to become aware of these fine native stones and i glad to possess the jewels of my country chose two bracelets and a necklace of them paying but twenty dollars for fifteen or sixteen catseyes and resolved to give them a setting worthy of their beauty the diary continues with moral reflections upon the servility of our taste before anything european and the handwriting is clear and deliberate it abruptly becomes hurried and at length wellnigh illegible it is best i think that you should have this portion as it comes unpolished unamended unarranged hot so to speak from my immediate pencil instead of cold from my subsequent pen i shall disguise certain names but that is all friday forenoon may i dont have to gaze at my catseyes to kill time any more im not the only passenger any more theres a lady she got in at el paso she has taken the drawingroom but sits outside reading newspaper cuttings and writing letters she is sixty i should say and has a cap and one gray curl this comes down over her left ear as far as a purple ribbon which suspends a medallion at her throat she came in wearing a sagegreen duster of pongee silk pretty nice only the buttons are as big as those largest mintdrops you porter she said brush this he put down her many things and received it her dress was sage green and pretty nice too you porter said she open every window why they are i declare whats the thermometer in this car ninetyfive maam folks mostly travelling that will do porter now you go make me a pitcher of lemonade right quick she went into the stateroom and shut the door when she came out she was dressed in what appeared to be chintz bedroom curtains they hang and flow loosely about her and are covered with a pattern of pink peonies she has slippers turkish that stare up in the air pretty handsome and comfortable but i never before saw any one travel with flypaper it must be hard to pack but its quite an idea in this train fully a dozen flies have stuck to it already and she reads her clippings and writes away and sips another glass of lemonade all with the most extreme appearance of leisure not to say sloth i cant imagine how she manages to produce this atmosphere of indolence when in reality she is steadily occupied possibly the way she sits but i think its partly the bedroom curtains these notes were interrupted by the entrance of the new conductor if you folks have chartered a private car just say so he shouted instantly at the sight of us he stood still at the extreme end and removed his hat which was acknowledged by the lady travel is surely very light gadsden she assented and went on with her writing but he remained standing still and shouting like an orator sprinkle the floor of this car julius and let the pore passengers get a breath of cool my lands he fanned himself sweepingly with his hat he seemed but little larger than a red squirrel and precisely that color sorrel hair sorrel eyebrows sorrel freckles light sorrel mustache thin aggressive nose receding chin and black attentive prominent eyes he approached and i gave him my ticket which is as long as a necktie and has my height the color of my eyes and hair and my general description punched in the margin why you aint middleaged he shouted and a singular croak sounded behind me but the lady was writing i have been growing younger since i bought that ticket i explained thats it thats it he sang a mans always as old as he feels and a woman is ever young he finished i see you are true to the old teachings and the oldtime chivalry gadsden said the lady continuously busy yes maam jacob served seven years for leah and seven more for rachel such men are raised today in every worthy louisiana home gadsden be it ever so humble yes maam give a fresh sprinkle to the floor julius soon as it goes to get dry excuse me but do you shave yourself sir i told him that i did but without excusing him you will see that i have a reason for asking he consequently pursued and took out of his coattails a round tin box handsomely labelled nat fly paper co so that i supposed it was thus of course that the lady came by her flypaper but this was pure coincidence and the conductor explained that companys me and a man at shreveport but he dissatisfies me right frequently you know what heaven a good razor is for a man and what you feel about a bad one vaseline and ground shells he said opening the box and im not saying anything except it will last your lifetime and never hardens rub the size of a pea on the fine side of your strop spread it to an inch with your thumb may i beg a favor on so short a meeting join me in the gentlemens lavatory with your razorstrop in five minutes i have to attend to a corpse in the baggagecar and will return at once anybodys corpse i know gadsden said the lady no maam just a corpse when i joined him for i was now willing to do anything he was apologetic again tis a short acquaintance he said but may i also beg your razor quick as i get out of the national fly i am going to register my new label first there will be uncle sam embracing the world signifying this mixture is universal then my name then the word stropine which is a novelty and carries copyright and i shall win comfort and doubtless luxury the post barber at fort bayard took a dozen off me at sight to retail to the niggers of the twentyfourth and as he did not happen to have the requisite cash on his person i charged him two roosters and fifty cents and both of us done well hes after more stropine and i got pullman prices for my roosters the buffetcar being out of chicken a la marengo there is your razor sir and i appreciate your courtesy it was beautifully sharpened and i bought a box of the stropine and asked him who the lady was mrs porcher brewton he exclaimed have you never met her socially why she why she is the most intellectual lady in bee bayou indeed i said why she visits new orleans and charleston and all the principal centres of refinement and is welcomed in washington she converses freely with our statesmen and is considered a queen of learning why she writes potry sir and is strongminded but a man wouldnt want to pick her up for a fool all the samey i shouldnt i dont said i dont you do it sir shes run her plantation all alone since the colonel was killed in sixtytwo she taught me sundayschool when i was a lad and she used to catch me at her pecantrees most every time in bee bayou he went forward and i went back with the stropine in my pocket the lady was sipping the last of the lemonade and looking haughtily over the top of her glass into i suppose the world of her thoughts her eyes met mine however has gadsden yes i perceive he has been telling about me she said in her languid formidable voice she set her glass down and reclined among the folds of the bedroom curtains considering me gadsden has always been lavish she mused caressingly he seems destined to succeed in life i hazarded ah n a she sighed with decision he will fail as she said no more and as i began to resent the manner in which she surveyed me i remarked you seem rather sure of his failure i am old enough to be his mother and yours said mrs porcher brewton among her curtains he is a noblehearted fellow and would have been a highsouled southern gentleman if born to that station but what should a conductor earning a month be dispersing his attention on silly patents for manys the time ive told him what i think but gadsden will always be flighty no further observations occurring to me i took up my necklace and bracelets from the seat and put them in my pocket will you permit a meddlesome old woman to inquire what made you buy those catseyes said mrs brewton why i dubiously began never mind she cried archly if you were thinking of some one in your northern home they will be prized because the thought at any rate was beautiful and genuine whereer i roam whatever realms to see my heart untravelled fondly turns to thee now dont you be embarrassed by an old woman i desired to inform her that i disliked her but one can never do those things and anxious to learn what was the matter with the catseyes i spoke amiably and politely to her twenty dollars she murmured and he told you they came from the pecos she gave that single melodious croak i had heard once before then she sat up with her back as straight as if she was twenty my dear young fellow never do you buy trash in these trains here you are with your coat full of whats gadsdens absurd razor concoctions strut strop bother and chinese paste buttons last summer on the northern pacific the man offered your catseyes to me as native gems found exclusively in dakota but i just sat and mentioned to him that i was on my way home from a holiday in china and he went right out of the car the last day i was in canton i bought a box of those catseyes at eight cents a dozen after this we spoke a little on other subjects and now shes busy writing again shes on business in california but will read a paper at los angeles at the annual meeting of the golden daughters of the west the meal station is coming but we have agreed to later friday afternoon i have been interrupted again gadsden entered removed his hat and shouted sharon twenty minutes for dinner i was calling the porter to order a buffet lunch in the car when there tramped in upon us three large men of such appearance that a flash of thankfulness went through me at having so little readymoney and only a silver watch mrs brewton looked at them and said well gentlemen and they took off their embroidered mexican hats weve got a baby show here said one of them slowly looking at me and wed be kind of obliged if youd hold the box theres lunch put up in a basket for you to take along said the next and a bottle of wine champagne so losing your dinner wont lose you nothing were looking for somebody raised east and without local prejudice said the third so we come to the pullman i now saw that so far from purposing to rob us they were in a great and honest distress of mind but i am no judge of a baby said i not being mar you dont have to be broke in the first more slowly and earnestly its a fair and secret ballot were striving for the votes is wrote out and ready and all were shy of is a stranger without family ties or business interests to hold the box and do the counting his deep tones ceased and he wiped heavy drops from his forehead with his shirt sleeve wed be kind of awful obliged to you he urged the town would be liable to make it two bottles said the second the third brought his fist down on the back of a seat and said ill make it that now but gentlemen said i five six and seven years ago i was not a stranger in sharon if my friend dean drake was still here but he aint now you might as well help folks and eat later this town will trust you and if you quit us once more he wiped the heavy drops away while in a voice full of appeal his friend finished his thought if we lose you well likely have to wait till this train comes in tomorrow for a man satisfactory to this town and the show is costing us a heap a light hand tapped my arm and here was mrs brewton saying for shame show your enterprise ill hold this yere train shouted gadsden if necessary mrs brewton rose alertly and they all hurried me out my slippers will stay right on when im down the steps said mrs brewton and gadsden helped her descend into the blazing dust and sun of sharon gracious said she what a place but i make it a point to see everything as i go nothing had changed there as of old lay the flat litter of the town sheds stores and dwellings a shapeless congregation in the desert gaping wide everywhere to the glassy quivering immensity and there above the roofs turned the slatted windwheels but close to the tracks opposite the hotel was an edifice a sort of tent of bunting from which brass music issued while about a hundred pink and blue sunbonnets moved and mixed near the entrance little black mexicans like charred toys lounged and lay staring among the ungraded dunes of sand gracious said mrs brewton again her eye lost nothing and as she made for the tent the chintz peonies flowed around her and her step was surprisingly light we passed through the sunbonnets and entered where the music played the precious blessed darlings she exclaimed clasping her hands this will do for the golden daughters she rapidly added yes this will distinctly do and she hastened away from me into the throng i had no time to look at much this first general minute i could see there were booths each containing a separate baby i passed a whole section of naked babies and one baby farther along had on golden wings and a crown and was bawling frightfully their names were over the booths and i noticed lucille erskine wales banquo lick nolin cuba manilla ellabelle bosco grady james j corbett nash and aqua marine there was a great sign at the end painted mrs edens manna in the wilderness and another sign labelled shotgun smiths twins in the midst of these first few impressions i found myself seated behind a bare table raised three feet or so with two boxes on it and a quantity of blank paper and pencils while one of the men was explaining me the rules and facts i cant remember them all now because i couldnt understand them all then and mrs brewton was distant among the sunbonnets talking to a gathering crowd and feeling in the mouths of babies that were being snatched out of the booths and brought to her the man was instructing me steadily all the while and it occurred to me to nod silently and coldly now and then as if i was doing this sort of thing every day but i insisted that some one should help me count and they gave me gadsden now these facts i do remember very clearly and shall never forget them the babies came from two towns sharon and rincon its neighbor alone neither had enough for a good show though in both it was every familys pride to have a baby every year the babies were in three classes six months and under one prize offered eighteen months two prizes three years two prizes a threefourths vote of all cast was necessary to a choice no one entitled to vote unless of immediate family of a competing baby no one entitled to cast more than one vote there were rules of entry and fees but i forget them except that no one could have two exhibits in the same class when i read this i asked how about twins well we didnt kind of foresee that muttered my instructor painfully what would be your idea look here you sir interposed mrs brewton he came in to count votes i was very glad to have her back thats right maam admitted the man he neednt to say a thing weve only got one twins entered he pursued which were glad of shotgun where is this mr smith interrupted mrs brewton uptown drinking maam and who may mr smith be most popular citizen of rincon maam we had to accept his twins because well he come down here himself and most of rincon come with him and as we aimed to have everything pass off pleasantlike i quite comprehend said mrs brewton and i should consider twins within the rule or any number born at one time but little aqua marine is the finest single child in that six months class i told her mother she ought to take that splurgy ring off the poor little things thumb its most unsafe but i should vote for that child myself thank you for your valuable endorsement said a spruce slim young man but the public is not allowed to vote here he added he was standing on the floor and resting his elbows on the table mrs brewton stared down at him are you the father of the child she inquired oh no i am the agent i aqua marines agent said mrs brewton sharply ha ha went the young man ha ha well thats good too shes part of our exhibit im in charge of the mannafeds dont you know i dont know said mrs brewton why mrs edens manna in the wilderness nourishes strengthens and makes no unhealthy fat take a circular and welcome im travelling for the manna i organized this show ive conducted twentyeight similar shows in two years we hold them in every state and territory second of last march i gave denver you heard of it probably i did not said mrs brewton well ha ha i thought every person up to date had heard of denvers olympic offspring olio is it up to date to loll your elbows on the table when youre speaking to a lady inquired mrs brewton he jumped and then grew scarlet with rage i didnt expect to learn manners in new mexico said he i doubt if you will said mrs brewton and turned her back on him he was white now but better instincts or else business prevailed in his injured bosom well said he i had no bad intentions i was going to say youd have seen ten thousand people and five hundred babies at denver and our mannafeds won out to beat the band three first medals and all exclusively mannafed we took the costume prize also of course here in sharon ive simplified no special medal for weight beauty costume or decorated perambulator well i must go back to our exhibit glad to have you give us a call up there and see the medals were offering and our fifteen mannafeds and take a package away with you he was gone the voters had been now voting in my two boxes for some time and i found myself hoping the manna would not win whoever did but it seemed this agent was a very capable person to begin with every family entering a baby drew a package of the manna free and one package contained a diamond ring then he had managed to have the finest babies of all classes in his own exhibit this was incontestable mrs brewton admitted after returning from a general inspection and it seemed to us extraordinary thats easy maam said gadsden he came around here a month ago dont you see i did not see but mrs brewton saw at once he had made a quiet selection of babies beforehand and then introduced the manna into those homes and everybody in the room was remarking that his show was very superior taken as a whole they all added taken as a whole i heard them as they came up to vote for the year and the month classes the month was to wait till last because the third box had been accidentally smashed by mr smith gadsden caught several trying to vote twice no you dont he would shout i know faces im not a conductor for nothing and the victim would fall back amid jeers from the sunbonnets once the passengers sent over to know when the train was going tell them to step over here and theyll not feel so lonesome shouted gadsden and i think a good many came the band was playing white wings with quite a number singing it when gadsden noticed the voting had ceased and announced this ballot closed the music paused for him and we could suddenly hear how many babies were in distress but for a moment only as we began our counting white wings resumed and the sunbonnets outsang their progeny there was something quite singular in the way they had voted here are some of the yearold tickets first choice ulysses grant blum d choice lewis hendricks first choice james redfield d lewis hendricks first elk chester d lewis hendricks can it be said the excited gadsden finish these quick ill open the monthers but he swung round to me at once see there he cried read that and that he plunged among more and i read first choice lawrence nepton ford jr d iona judd first choice mary louise kenton d iona judd hurry up said gadsden thats it and as we counted mrs brewton looked over my shoulder and uttered her melodious croak for which i saw no reason that young whippersnapper will go far she observed nor did i understand this but when they stopped the band for me to announce the returns one fact did dawn on me even while i was reading threeyearolds whole number of votes cast necessary to a choice second prize lewis hendricks receiving first prize largest number of votes cast for salvisa van meter no award eighteenmonth class whole number of votes cast necessary to a choice second prize iona judd receiving lillian brown gets for st prize none awarded there was a very feeble applause and then silence for a second and then the sunbonnets rushed together rushed away to others rushed back and talk swept like hail through the place yes that is what they had done they had all voted for lewis hendricks and iona judd for second prize and every family had voted the first prize to its own baby the browns and van meters happened to be the largest families present hell go far hell go far repeated mrs brewton sport glittered in her eye she gathered her curtains and was among the sunbonnets in a moment then it fully dawned on me the agent for mrs edens manna in the wilderness was indeed a shrewd strategist and knew his people to the roots of the grass they had never seen a babyshow they were innocent he came among them he gave away packages of manna and a diamond ring he offered the prizes but he proposed to win some therefore he made that rule about only the immediate families voting he foresaw what they would do and now they had done it whatever happened two prizes went to his mannafeds they dont see through it in the least which is just as well said mrs brewton returning and its little matter that only second prizes go to the best babies but whats to be done now i had no idea but it was not necessary that i should you folks of rincon and sharon spoke a deep voice it was the first man in the pullman and drops were rolling from his forehead and his eyes were the eyes of a beleaguered ox you fathers and mothers he said and took another breath they grew quiet im a father myself as is well known they applauded this salvisa is mine and she got my vote the father that will not support his own child is not does not is worse than if they were orphans he breathed again while they loudly applauded but folks ive got to get home to rincon ive got to and ill give up salvisa if im met fair yes yes youll be met said voices of men well heres my proposition mrs edens manna has took two and im satisfied it should we voted and will stay voted yes yes well now heres sharon and rincon two of the finest towns in this section and i say sharon and rincon has equal rights to get something out of this and drop private feelings and everybody back their town and i say let this lady and gentleman who will act elegant and on the square take a view and nominate the finest rincon yearold and the finest sharon month they can cut out of the herd and i say lets vote unanimous on their pick and let each town hold a first prize and go home in friendship feeling it has been treated right universal cheers endorsed him and he got down panting the band played union forever and i accompanied mrs brewton to the booths youll remember shouted the orator urgently after us one apiece we nodded dont get mixed he appealingly insisted we shook our heads and out of the booths rushed two women and simultaneously dashed their infants in our faces youll never pass cuba by entreated one this is bosco grady said the other cuba wore an immense garment made of the american flag but her mother whirled her out of it in a second see them dimples see them knees she said see them feet only feel of her toes look at his arms screamed the mother of bosco doubled his weight in four months did he indeed maam said cubas mother well he hadnt much to double didnt he then didnt he indeed no at you he didnt indeed and indeed i guess cuba is known to sharon i guess sharonll not let cuba be slighted well and i guess rinconll see that bosco grady gets his rights ladies said mrs brewton towering but poetical with her curl i am a mother myself and raised five noble boys and two sweet peerless girls this stopped them immediately they stared at her and her chintz peonies as she put the curl gently away from her medallion and proceeded but never did i think of myself in those dark weary days of the long ago i thought of my country and the lost cause they stared at her fascinated yes mm whispered they quite humbly now said mrs brewton what is more sacred than an american mothers love therefore let her not shame it with anger and strife all little boys and girls are precious gems to me and to you what is a cold lifeless medal compared to one of them though i would that all could get the prize but they cant you know no mm many mothers with their children in their arms were now dumbly watching mrs brewton who held them with a honeyed convincing smile if i choose only one in this beautiful and encouraging harvest it is because i have no other choice thank you so much for letting me see that little hero and that lovely angel she added with a yet sweeter glance to the mothers of bosco and cuba and i wish them all luck when their turn comes ive no say about the month class you know and now a little room please the mothers fell back but my head swam slightly the month class to be sure the orator had forgotten all about it in the general joy over his wise and fair proposition nobody had thought of it but they would pretty soon cuba and bosco were likely to remind them then we should still be face to face with a state of things that i cast a glance behind at those two mothers of sharon and rincon following us and i asked mrs brewton to look at them dont think about it now said she it will only mix you i always like to take a thing when it comes and not before we now reached the month class they were the naked ones the month had stayed nicely in peoples arms these were crawling hastily everywhere like crabs upset in the market and they screamed fiercely when taken upon the lap the mother of thomas jefferson brayin lucas showed us a framed letter from the statesman for whom her child was called the letter reeked with gratitude and said that offspring was mans proudest privilege that a souvenir sixteentoone spoon would have been cheerfully sent but babies had been named after mr brayin since january it congratulated the swelling army of the peoples cause but there was nothing eminent about little thomas except the letter and we selected reese moran a vigorous sharon baby who when they attempted to set him down and pacify him stiffened his legs dashed his candy to the floor and burst into lamentation we were soon on our way to the year class for mrs brewton was rapid and thorough as we went by the manna exhibit the agent among his packages and babies invited us in he was loudly declaring that he would vote for bosco if he could but when he examined cuba he became sure that denver had nothing finer than that mrs brewton took no notice of him but bade me admire aqua marine as far surpassing any other month child i proclaimed her splendid she was a wideeyed contented thing with a head shaped like a croquet mallet and the agent smiled modestly and told the mothers that as for his babies two prizes was luck enough for them they didnt want the earth if that thing happened to be brass said mrs brewton bending over the ring that aqua was still sucking and again remonstrating with the mother for this imprudence she passed on the threeyearolds were many of them in costume with extraordinary arrangements of hair and here was the child with gold wings and a crown i had seen on arriving her name was verbena m and she personated faith she had colored slippers and was drinking tea from her mothers cup another child named broderick mcgowan represented columbus and joyfully shouted kiyi every halfminute one child was attired as a prominent admiral another as a prominent general and one stood in a boat and was washington as mrs brewton examined them and dealt with the mothers the names struck me afresh not so much the boys ulysses grant and james j corbett explained themselves but i read the names of five adjacent girls lula ocilla nila cusseta and maylene and i asked mrs brewton how they got them from romances she told me in papers that we of the upper classes never see in choosing horace boyd of rincon for his hair his full set of front teeth well cared for and his general beauty i think both of us were also influenced by his good sensible name and his good clean sensible clothes with both our selections once they were settled were sharon and rincon satisfied we were turning back to the table to announce our choice when a sudden clamor arose behind us and we saw confusion in the manna department women were running and shrieking and i hastened after mrs brewton to see what was the matter aqua marine had swallowed the ring on her thumb it was gold it was pure gold wailed the mother clutching mrs brewton it cost a whole dollar in el paso she must have white of egg instantly said mrs brewton handing me her purse run to the hotel save your money said the agent springing forward with some eggs in a bowl lord you dont catch us without all the appliances handy wed run behind the trade in no time there now there he added comfortingly to the mother will you make her swallow it better let me better let me and heres the emetic lord why we had three swallowed rings at the denver olio and i got em all safe back within ten minutes after time of swallowing you go away said mrs brewton to me and tell them our nominations the mothers sympathetically surrounded poor little aqua saying to each other shes a beautiful child sure indeed she is but the mannafeds has had their turn sure indeed theyve been recognized and so forth while i was glad to retire to the voting table the music paused for me and as the crowd cheered my small speech some one said and now what are you going to do about me it was bosco grady back again and close behind him cuba they had escaped from mrs brewtons eye and had got me alone but i pretended in the noise and cheering not to see these mothers i noticed a woman hurrying out of the tent and hoped aqua was not in further trouble she was still surrounded i could see then the orator made some silence thanked us in the names of sharon and rincon and proposed our candidates be voted on by acclamation this was done rincon voted for sharon and reese moran in a solid roar and sharon voted for rincon and horace boyd in a roar equally solid so now each had a prize and the whole place was applauding happily and the band was beginning again when the mothers with cuba and bosco jumped up beside me on the platform and the sight of them produced immediate silence theres a good many here has a right to feel satisfied said mrs grady looking about and theyre welcome to their feelings but if this meeting thinks it is through with its business i can tell it that it aint not if it acts honorable it aint does those that have had their chance and those that can take home their prizes expect us month mothers come here for nothing do they expect i brought my bosco from rincon to be insulted and him the pride of the town cuba is known to sharon spoke the other lady ill say no more jumping jeans murmured the orator to himself i cant hold this train much longer said gadsden shes due at lordsburg now youll have made it up by tucson gadsden spoke mrs brewton quietly across the whole assembly from the manna department as for towns continued mrs grady that think anything of a baby thats only got three teeth ha ha laughed cubas mother shrilly teeth well were not proud of bald babies in sharon bosco was certainly bald all the men were looking wretched and all the women were growing more and more like eagles moreover they were separating into two bands and taking their husbands with them sharon and rincon drawing to opposite parts of the tent and what was coming i cannot say for we all had to think of something else a third woman bringing a man mounted the platform it was she i had seen hurry out my names shotgun smith said the man very carefully and im told youve reached my case he was extremely goodlooking with a blue eye and a blond mustache not above thirty and was trying hard to be sober holding himself with dignity are you the judge said he to me hell i began nnot guilty your honor said he at this his wife looked anxious sselfdefence he slowly continued told you once already why rolfe exclaimed his wife touching his elbow dont you cry little woman said he thisll come out all right where re the witnesses why rolfe rolfe she shook him as you shake a sleepy child now see here said he and wagged a finger at her affectionately you promised me youd not cry if i let you come rolfe dear its not that today its the twins its your twins shotgun this time said many mens voices we acquitted you all right last month justifiable homicide said gadsden dont you remember twins said shotgun drowsily oh yes mine why he opened on us his blue eyes that looked about as innocent as aqua marines and he grew more awake then he blushed deeply face and forehead i was not coming to this kind of thing he explained but she wanted the twins to get something he put his hand on her shoulder and straightened himself i done a heap of prospecting before i struck this claim said he patting her shoulder we got married last march a year its our first first first he turned to me with a confiding smile its our first dividend judge rolfe i never you come right down and now lets go get a prize he declared with his confiding pleasantness i remember now i remember they claimed twins was barred and i kicked down the bars take me to those twins theyre not named yet judge after they get the prize well name them fine names as good as any they got anywhere europe asia africa anywhere my gracious i wish they was boys come on judge you and mell go give em a prize and then well drink to em he hugged me suddenly and affectionately and we half fell down the steps but gadsden as suddenly caught him and righted him and we proceeded to the twins mrs smith looked at me helplessly saying im that sorry sir i had no idea he was going to be that gamesome not at all i said not at all under many circumstances i should have delighted in shotguns society he seemed so utterly sure that now he had explained himself everybody would rejoice to give the remainingmedal to his little girls but bosco and cuba had not been idle shotgun did not notice the spread of whispers nor feel the divided and jealous currents in the air as he sat and in expanding goodwill talked himself almost sober to entice him out there was no way several of his friends had tried it but beneath his innocence there seemed to lurk something wary and i grew apprehensive about holding the box this last time but gadsden relieved me as our count began shotgun is a splendid man said he and he has trailed more trainrobbers than any deputy in new mexico but he has seen too many friends today and is not quite himself so when he fell down that time i just took this off him he opened the drawer and there lay a sixshooter it was touch and go said gadsden but hes thinking that hard about his twins that hes not missed it yet twould have been the act of an enemy to leave that on him today well dyou say he broke off well well well it was the tickets we took out of the box that set him exclaiming i began to read them and saw that the agent was no mere politician but a statesman his aqua marine had a solid vote i remembered his extreme praise of both bosco and cuba this had set rincon and sharon bitterly against each other i remembered his modesty about aqua marine of course each town unable to bear the idea of the others beating it had voted for the mannafed who had votes shotgun and his wife had voted for their twins i looked towards the manna department and could see that aqua marine was placid once more and mrs brewton was dancing the ring before her eyes i hope i announced the returns in a firm voice what said shotgun smith and at that sound mrs brewton stopped dancing the ring he strode to our table theres the winner said gadsden quickly pointing to the manna exhibit what shouted smith again and they quit me for that hammerheaded sonofagun he whirled around the men stood ready and the women fled shrieking and cowering to their infants in the booths gentlemen gentlemen cried gadsden dont hurt him look here and from the drawer he displayed shotguns weapon they understood in a second and calmly watched the enraged and disappointed shotgun but he was a man he saw how he had frightened the women and he stood in the middle of the floor with eyes that did not at all resemble aqua marines at present im all right now boys he said i hope ive harmed no one ladies will you try and forget about me making such a break it got ahead of me i guess for i had promised the little woman he stopped himself and then his eye fell upon the manna department i guess i dont like one thing much now im not after prizes id not accept one from a goldbugcombinetrust that comes sneaking around stuffing wholesale concoctions into our childrens systems my twins are not mannafed my twins are raised as nature intended perhaps if they were swelled out with trash that acts like bakingpowder they would have a medal too for i notice he has made you vote his way pretty often this afternoon i saw the agent at the end of the room look very queer thats so said several i think ill clear out his boxes said shotgun with rising joy i feel like ive got to do something before i go home come on judge he swooped towards the manna with a yell and the men swooped with him and gadsden and i were swooped with them again the women shrieked but mrs brewton stood out before the boxes with her curl and her chintz mr smith said she you are not going to do anything like that you are going to behave yourself like the gentleman you are and not like the wild beast thats inside you never in his life before probably had shotgun been addressed in such a manner and he too became hypnotized fixing his blue eyes upon the strange lady i do not believe in patent foods for children said mrs brewton we agree on that mr smith and i am a grandmother and i attend to what my grandchildren eat but this highly adroit young man has done you no harm if he has the prizes whose doing is that please and who paid for them will you tell me please ah you are all silent and she croaked melodiously now let him and his manna go along but i have enjoyed meeting you all and i shall not forget you soon and mr smith i want you to remember me will you please she walked to mrs smith and the twins and shotgun followed her entirely hypnotized she beckoned to me your judge and i she said consider not only your beautiful twins worthy of a prize but also the mother and father that can so proudly claim them she put her hand in my pocket these catseyes she said you will wear and think of me and the judge who presents them she placed a bracelet on each twin and the necklace upon mrs smiths neck give him gadsdens stuff she whispered to me do you shave yourself sir said i taking out the stropine vaseline and ground shells and will last your life rub the size of a pea on your strop and spread it to an inch i placed the box in shotguns motionless hand and now gadsden well take the train said mrs brewton heres your lunch heres your wine said the orator forcing a basket upon me i dont know what wed have done without you and your mother a flash of indignation crossed mrs brewtons face but changed to a smile youve forgot to name my girls exclaimed shotgun suddenly finding his voice suppose you try that said mrs brewton to me a trifle viciously thank you i said to smith thank you i something handsome he urged how would cynthia do for one i suggested shucks no ive known two cynthias you dont want that he asked mrs smith and she did not at all something extra something fine something not stale said he i looked about the room there was no time for thought but my eye fell once more upon cuba this reminded me of spain and the spanish and my brain leaped i have them i cried armada and loyola thats what theyre named said shotgun write it for us and i did once more the band played and we left them all calling goodbye maam goodbye judge happy as possible the train was soon going sixty miles an hour through the desert we had passed lordsburg san simon and were nearly at benson before mrs brewton and gadsden whom she made sit down with us and i finished the lunch and champagne i wonder how long hell remember me mused mrs brewton at tucson where we were on time that woman is not worth one of his boots saturday afternoon may near los angeles i have been writing all day to be sure and get everything in and now sharon is twentyfour hours ago and here there are roses gardens and many nice houses at the waystations oh george washington father of your country what a brindled litter have you sired but here the moral reflections begin again and i copy no more diary mrs brewton liked my names for the twins theyll pronounce it loyola she said and that sounds right lovely later she sent me her paper for the golden daughters it is full of poetry and sentiment and all the things i have missed she wrote that if she had been sure the agent had helped aqua marine to swallow the ring she would have let them smash his boxes and i think she was a little in love with shotgun smith but what a pity we shall soon have no more mrs brewtons the causes that produced her slavery isolation literary tendencies adversity game blood that combination is broken forever i shall speak to mr howells about her she ought to be recorded the promised land perhaps there were ten of them these galloping dots were hard to count down in the distant bottom across the river their swiftly moving dust hung with them close thinning to a yellow veil when they halted short they clustered a moment then parted like beads and went wide asunder on the plain they veered singly over the level merged in twos and threes apparently racing shrank together like elastic and broke ranks again to swerve over the stretching waste from this visioned pantomime presently came a sound a tiny shot the figures were too far for discerning which fired it it evidently did no harm and was repeated at once a babel of diminutive explosions followed while the horsemen galloped on in unexpected circles soon for no visible reason the dots ran together bunching compactly the shooting stopped the dust rose thick again from the crowded hoofs cloaking the group and so passed back and was lost among the silent barren hills four emigrants had watched this from the high bleak rim of the big bend they stood where the flat of the desert broke and tilted down in grooves and bulges deep to the lurking columbia empty levels lay opposite narrowing up into the high country thats the colville reservation across the river from us said the man another sighed his wife the last indians well strike our trail to the okanagon goes over a corner of it were going to those hills the mother looked at her little girl and back where the cloud had gone only a corner liza the ferry puts us over on it and weve got to go by the ferry or stay this side of the columbia you wouldnt want to start a home here they had driven twentyone hundred miles at a walk standing by them were the six horses with the wagon and its tunneled roof of canvas shone duskily on the empty verge of the wilderness a dry windless air hung over the tableland of the big bend but a sound rose from somewhere floating voluminous upon the silence and sank again rapids the man pointed far up the giant rut of the stream to where a streak of white water twinkled at the foot of the hills weve struck the river too high he added then we dont cross here said the woman quickly no by what they told me the cabin and the ferry ought to be five miles down her face fell only five miles i was wondering john wouldnt there be a way round for the children to now mother interrupted the husband that aint like you weve crossed plenty indian reservations this trip already i dont want to go round the little girl said father dont make me go round mart the boy with a loose hook of hair hanging down to his eyes from his hat did not trouble to speak he had been disappointed in the westward journey to find all the indians peaceful he knew which way he should go now and he went to the wagon to look once again down the clean barrel of his rifle why nancy you dont like indians said her mother yes i do i like chiefs mrs clallam looked across the river it was so strange john the way they acted it seems to get stranger thinking about it they didnt see us they didnt have a notion but if were going right over were not going over there liza that quick waters the mahkin rapids and our ferrys clear down below from this place what could they have been after do you think those chaps oh nothing i guess they werent killing anybody playing crosstag said mart id like to know john how you know they werent killing anybody they might have been trying to then were perfectly safe liza we can set and let em kill us all day well i dont think its any kind of way to behave running around shooting right off your horse and fourth of july over too said mart from the wagon he was putting cartridges into the magazine of his winchester his commonsense told him that those horsemen would not cross the river but the notion of a night attack pleased the imagination of young sixteen it was the children said mrs clallam and nobodys getting me any wood how am i going to cook supper stir yourselves they had carried water in the wagon and father and son went for wood some way down the hill they came upon a gully with some dead brush and climbed back with this supper was eaten on the ground the horses were watered given grain and turned loose to find what pickings they might in the lean growth and dusk had not turned to dark when the emigrants were in their beds on the soft dust the noise of the rapids dominated the air with distant sonority and the children slept at once the boy with his rifle along his blankets edge john clallam lay till the moon rose hard and brilliant and then quietly lest his wife should hear from her bed by the wagon went to look across the river where the downward slope began he came upon her she had been watching for some time they were the only objects in that bald moonlight no shrub grew anywhere that reached to the waist and the two figures drew together on the lonely hill they stood hand in hand and motionless except that the man bent over the woman and kissed her when she spoke of iowa they had left he talked of the new region of their hopes the country that lay behind the void hills opposite where it would not be a struggle to live he dwelt on the home they would make and her mood followed his at last till husband and wife were building distant plans together the dipper had swung low when he remarked that they were a couple of fools and they went back to their beds cold came over the ground and their musings turned to dreams next morning both were ashamed of their fears by four the wagon was on the move inside nancys voice was heard discussing with her mother whether the schoolteacher where they were going to live now would have a black dog with a white tail that could swim with a basket in his mouth they crawled along the edge of the vast descent making slow progress for at times the valley widened and they receded far from the river and then circuitously drew close again where the slant sank abruptly when the ferrymans cabin came in sight the canvas interior of the wagon was hot in the longrisen sun the lay of the land had brought them close above the stream but no one seemed to be at the cabin on the other side nor was there any sign of a ferry groves of trees lay in the narrow folds of the valley and the water swept black between untenanted shores nothing living could be seen along the scant levels of the bottomland yet there stood the cabin as they had been told the only one between the rapids and the okanagon and bright in the sun the colville reservation confronted them they came upon tracks going down over the hill marks of wagons and horses plain in the soil and charred sticks with empty cans lying where camps had been heartened by this proof that they were on the right road john clallam turned his horses over the brink the slant steepened suddenly in a hundred yards tilting the wagon so no brake or shoe would hold it if it moved farther all out said clallam either folks travel light in this country or they unpack he went down a little way thats the trail too he said wheel marks down there and the little bushes are snapped off nancy slipped out im unpacked said she oh what a splendid hill to go down well go like anything yes that surely is the trail clallam pursued i can see away down where somebodys left a wheel among them big stones but where does he keep his ferryboat and where does he keep himself now john if its here were to go down dont you get to studying over something else itll be time enough after were at the bottom nancy heres your chair mrs clallam began lifting the lighter things from the wagon mart said the father well have to chain lock the wheels after were empty i guess well start with the worst you and mell take the stove apart and get her down somehow were in luck to have open country and no timber to work through drop that bedding mother yourself is all youre going to carry well pack that truck on the horses then pack it now and let me start first ill make two trips while youre at the stove theres the man said nancy a man a white man was riding up the other side of the river near the cabin he leaned to see something on the ground ten yards more and he was off the horse and picked up something and threw it away he loitered along picking up and throwing till he was at the door he pushed it open and took a survey of the interior then he went to his horse and when they saw him going away on the road he had come they set up a shouting and mart fired a signal the rider dived from his saddle and made headlong into the cabin where the door clapped to like a trap nothing happened further and the horse stood on the bank thats the funniest man i ever saw said nancy theyre all funny over there said mart ill signal him again but the cabin remained shut and the deserted horse turned took a few first steels of freedom then trotted briskly down the river why then he dont belong there at all said nancy wait child till we know something about it shes liable to be right liza the horse anyway dont belong or hed not run off thats good judgment nancy right good for a little girl i am six years old said nancy and i know lots more than that well lets get mother and the bedding started down itll be noon before we know it there were two packsaddles in the wagon ready against such straits as this the rolls were made balanced as side packs and circled with the swingropes loose cloths clothes fryingpans the lantern and the axe tossed in to fill the gap in the middle canvas flung over the whole and the diamondhitch hauled taut on the first pack when a second rider appeared across the river he came out of a space between the opposite hills into which the trail seemed to turn and he was leading the first mans horse the heavy work before them was forgotten and the clallams sat down in a row to watch hes stealing it said mrs clallam then the other man will come out and catch him said nancy mart corrected them a man never steals horses that way he drives them up in the mountains where the owner dont travel much the new rider had arrived at the bank and came steadily along till opposite the door where he paused and looked up and down the river see him stoop said clallam the father hes seen the tracks dont go further i guess hes after the other one added clallam the son which of them is the ferryman said mrs clallam the man had got off and gone straight inside the cabin in the black of the doorway appeared immediately the first man dangling in the grip of the other who kicked him along to the horse there the victim mounted his own animal and rode back down the river the chastiser was returning to the cabin when mart fired his rifle the man stopped short saw the emigrants and waved his hand he dismounted and came to the edge of the water they could hear he was shouting to them but it was too far for the words to carry from a certain reiterated cadence he seemed to be saying one thing john and mart tried to show they did not understand and indicated their wagon walking to it and getting aboard on that the stranger redoubled his signs and shootings ran to the cabin where he opened and shut the door several times came back and pointed to the hills hes going away and cant ferry us over said mrs clallam and the other man thought hed gone said nancy and he came and caught him in his house this dont suit me clallam remarked mart well go to the shore and talk to him when the man saw them descending the hill he got on his horse and swam the stream it carried him below but he was waiting for them when they reached the level he was tall shambling and bony and roved over them with a pleasant restless eye goodmorning said he fine weather i was baptized edward wilson but you inquire for wildgoose jake them other names are retired and pensioned i expect you seen me kick him couldnt help seeing oh i aint blamin you son not a bit i aint he cant bile water without burnin it and his toes turns in and hes blurry round the fingernails hes jest kultus he is hev some with a furtive smile that often ran across his lips he pulled out a flat bottle and all took an acquaintanceship swallow while the clallams explained their journey how many air there of yu slidin down the hill he inquired shifting his eye to the wagon ive got my wife and little girl up there thats all of us ladies along then ill step behind this bush he was dragging his feet from his waterlogged boots hear them suck now he commented didnt hev to think about a wetting onced but i aint young any more there i guess i aint caught a chill he had whipped his breeches off and spread them on the sand now you arrive down this here hill from ioway and says you wheres that ferry aint we hit the right spot well thats what you hev hit youre all right and the spot is hunkydory and its the durned old boat hez made the mistake begosh a cloud busted in this country and she tore out fer the coast and the jokes on her youd ought to hev heerd her cable snap whoosh if that wire didnt screech jest last week it was and the river come round the corner on us in a wave four feet high same as a wall i was up here on business and seen the whole thing so the ferry she up and bid us goodbye and lit out for astoria with her cargo beggin pardon hev you tobacco for mines in my wet pants twentyfour hogs and the driver and two sheeny drummers bound to the mines with brass jewlry all gone to hell for they didnt near git to astoria they sank in the sight of all as we run along the bank i seen their arms wave and them hogs rolling over like taters bilin round in the kettle wildgoose jakes words came slow and went more slowly as he looked at the river and spoke but rather to himself it warnt long though i expect it warnt three minutes till the water was all there was left there my stars what a lot of it and i might hev been part of that cargo easy as not freight behind time was all that come between me and them that went so wed hev gone bobbin down that flood me and my piahchuck your piahchuck mart inquired the man faced the boy like a rat but the alertness faded instantly from his eye and his lip slackened into a slipshod smilewhy yes sonny me and my grubstake youve been to school ill bet but they didnt learn yu chinook now did they chinooks the lingo us white folks trade in with the siwashes and we kinder falls into it talking along i was

older than they was and the poor hogs was better than any of us that cant be gainsaid oh no oh no mart laughed i mean it son some day such thoughts will come to you he stared at the river unsteadily with his light gray eyes well if the ferrys gone said john clallam getting on his legs well go on down to the next one hold on hold on did you never hear tell of a raft ill put you folks over this river wait till i git my pants on said he stalking nimbly to where they lay its just this way clallam continued were bound for the upper okanagon country and we must get in there to build our cabin

along and see here if i dont suit yu or fail in my bargain you neednt to pay me a cent he began climbing and on the way they came to an agreement wildgoose jake bowed low to mrs clallam and as low to nancy who held her mothers dress and said nothing keeping one finger in her mouth all began emptying the wagon quickly and tins of bakingpowder with rockingchairs and flowered quilts lay on the hill wildgoose jake worked hard and sustained a pleasant talk by himself his fluency was of an eagerness that parried interruption or inquiry so youve come acrosst the big bend aint it a cosey place reminds me of them medicine pictures before and after using the big bends the way this world looked before using before the bible fixed it up ye know ever seen specimens of big bend produce maam they send em east grain and plums and such the feller that gathered them curiosities hed hunt forty square miles apiece for em but its goodpayin policy and it fetches lots of settlers to the territory they come here hummin and walks around the wilderness and wheres the plums says they cant you see im busy says the land agent and out they goes but you neednt to worry maam the country where youre goin aint like that theres water and timber and rich soil and mines billy moon has gone there hes the man run the ferry when she wrecked he pulled his freight for the new mines at loop loop did the man

if it aint a good one on him to hev you see that ill tell him a little girl seen that and maybe hell feel the disgrace only hes no account and dont take any experience the reglar way hes nigh onto thirty and youll not believe me i know but he aint never even learned to spit right is he yours inquired nancy gosh no miss beggin pardon hes jest workin for me did he know you were coming to kick him when he hid hid whats that the mans eyes narrowed again into points you folks seen him hide he said to clallam why of course didnt he say anything he didnt get much chance muttered jake what did he hide at us you begosh i guess so said mart we took him for the ferryman and when he couldnt hear us what was he doin just riding along and so i fired to signal him and he flew into the door so you fired and he flew into the door oh hm jake continued to pack the second horse attending carefully to the ropes i never knowed he was that weak in the upper story he said in about five minutes knew his brains was tenas but didnt suspect he were that weak in the upper story youre sure he didnt go in till he heerd your gun hed taken a look and was going away said mart now aint some people jest odd now you follow me and ill tell you folks what id figured hed been at billy moon he lived in that cabin yu see and he had his stuff there yu see and run the ferry and a kind of a store he kept coffee and canned goods and starplug and this and that to supply the prospectin outfits that come acrosst on his ferry on the trail to the mines then a cloudburst hits his boat and his jobs spoiled on the river and he quits for the mines takin his stuff along do you follow me but he hed to leave some and he give me the key and i was to send the balance after him next freight team that come along my way leander thats him i was kickin he knowed about it and hell steal a hot stove hes that dumb he knowed there was stuff here of billy moons well last night we hed some horses stray and i says to him andy

place he said then what was he after said mart stealin but he figured hed come again he didnt like my gun much guns always skeers him when he dont know the parties shootin thats his dumbness maybe he thought i was after him hes jest that distrustful begosh well have the laugh on him when he finds he run from a little girl he didnt wait to see who he was running from said mart of course he didnt andy hears your gun and he dont inquire further but hits the first hole he kin crawl into thats andy thats the kind of boy i hev to work for me all the good ones goes where youre goin where the grain grows without irrigation and the blacktail deer comes out on the hill and asks yu to shoot em for dinner whos ready for the bottom if i stay talkin the sunll go down on us dont yu let me get started agin just you shet me off twiced anyway each twentyfour hours he began to descend with his packhorse and the first load all afternoon they went up and down over the hot bare face of the hill until the baggage heavy and light was transported and dropped piecemeal on the shore the tornout insides of their home littered the stones with familiar shapes and colors and nancy played among them visiting each parcel and folded thing theres the red tablecover she exclaimed and the big coffeegrinder and theres our table and the hole mart burned in it she took a long look at this oh how i wish i could see our pump she said and began to cry you talk to her mother said clallam shes tuckered out the men returned to bring the wagon with chainlocked wheels and tilted half over by the cross slant of the mountain it came heavily down reeling and sliding on the slippery yellow weeds and grinding deep ruts across the faces of the shelving beds of gravel jake guided it as he could straining back on the bits of the two hunched horses when their hoofs glanced from the stones that rolled to the bottom and the others leaned their weight on a pole lodged between the spokes making a balance to the wagon for it leaned the other way so far that at any jolt the two wheels left the ground when it was safe at the level of the stream dusk had come and a white flat of mist lay along the river striping its course among the gaunt hills they slept without moving and rose early to cut logs which the horses dragged to the shore the outside trunks were nailed and lashed with ropes and sank almost below the surface with the weight of the wood fastened crosswise on top but the whole floated dry with its cargo and crossed clumsily on the quickwrinkled current then it brought the wagon and the six horses swam the force of the river had landed them below the cabin and when they had repacked there was too little left of day to go on clallam suggested it was a good time to take moons leavings over to the okanagon but wildgoose jake said at once that their load was heavy enough and about this they could not change his mind he made a journey to the cabin by himself and returned saying that he had managed to lock the door father said mart as they were harnessing next day ive been up there i went awful early theres no lock to the door and the cabins empty i guessed that might be there has been a lock pried off pretty lately there was a lot of broken bottles around everywheres inside and out what do you make out of it said mart nothing yet he wants to get us away and im with him there i want to get up the okanagon as soon as we can well im takin yu the soonest way said wildgoose jake behind them from his casual smile there was no telling what he had heard ill put your stuff acrosst the okanagon tomorrow mornin but tonight yourselvesll all be over and the ladies kin sleep in my room the wagon made good time the trail crossed easy valleys and over the yellow grass of the hills while now and then their guide took a shortcut he wished to get home he said since there could be no estimating what leander might be doing while the sun was still well up in the sky they came over a round knob and saw the okanagon blue in the bright afternoon and the cabin on its further bank this was a roomier building to see than common and a hayfield was by it and a bit of green pasture fenced in saddlehorses were tied in front heads hanging and feet knuckled askew with long waiting and from inside an uneven riotous din whiffled lightly across the river and intervening meadow to the hill if youll excuse me said jake ill jest git along ahead and see what game them folks is puttin up on andy likely as not hes weighin em out flour at two cents with it costin me two and a half on freightin alone ill hev supper ready time you ketch up he was gone at once getting away at a sharp pace till presently they could see him swimming the stream when he was in the cabin the sounds changed dropping off to one at a time and expired but when the riders came out into the air they leaned and collided at random whirled their arms and screaming till they gathered heart charged with wavering menace at the door the foremost was flung from the sill and he shot along toppling and scraped his length in the dust while the owner of the cabin stood in the entrance the indian picked himself up and at some word of jakes which the emigrants could half follow by the fierce lift of his arm all got on their horses and set up a wailing like vultures driven off they went up the river a little and crossed but did not come down this side and mrs clallam was thankful when their evil noise had died away up the valley they had seen the wagon coming but gave it no attention a man soon came over the river from the cabin and was lounging against a tree when the emigrants drew up at the margin i dont know what you know he whined defiantly from the tree but im goin to cornwall connecticut and i dont care who knows it he sent a cowed look at the cabin across the river get out of the wagon nancy said clallam mart help her down im going back said the man blinking like a scolded dog i aint stayin here for nobody you can tell him i said so too again his eye slunk sidewise towards the cabin and instantly back while youre staying said mart you might as well give a hand here he came with alacrity and made a shift of unhitching the horses i was better off coupling freight cars on the housatonic he soon remarked his voice came shallow from no deeper than his throat and a peevish apprehension rattled through it that was a good job and ive had better too forty fifty sixty dollars better shall we unpack the wagon clallam inquired i dont know you ever been to new milford i sold shoes there thirtyfive dollars and board the emigrants attended to their affairs watering the horses and driving picket stakes leander uselessly followed behind them with conversation blinking and with lower lip sagged showing a couple of teeth my brothers in business in pittsfield massachusetts said he and i can get a salary in bridgeport any day i say so that a marlin no said mart its a winchester i had a marlin hes took it from me ill bet you never got shot at anybody want to shoot you mart inquired well and i guess youll believe they did day before yesterday if youre talking about up at that cabin it was me leander gave mart a leerthat wont do said he hes put you up to telling me that and im going to cornwall connecticut i know whats good for me i guess i tell you we were looking for the ferry and i signalled you across the river no no said leander i never seen you in my life dont you be like him and take me for a fool all right why did they want to murder you why said the man shrilly why hadnt they broke in and filled themselves up on his piahchuck till they were crazydrunk and when i came along didnt they when you came along they were nowhere near there said mart now youre going to claim it was me drunk it and scattered all them bottles of his screamed leander backing away i tell you i didnt i told him i didnt and he knowed it well too but hes just that mean when hes mad he likes to put a thing on me whether or no when he never seen me touch a drop of whiskey nor any one else neither they were riding and shooting loose over the country like they always do on a drunk and im glad they stole his stuff what business had he to keep it at billy moons old cabin and send me away up there to see it was all right let him do his own dirty work i aint going to break the laws on the salary he pays me the clallam family had gathered round leander who was stricken with volubility it aint once in a while but its every day and every week he went on always in a woolly scream and the longer he aint caught the bolder he gets and puts everything that goes wrong on to me was it me traded them for that liquor this afternoon it was his squaw big tracks and he knowed it well he lets that mudfaced baboon run the house when hes off and i dont have the keys nor nothing and never did have but of course he had to come in and say it was me just because he was mad about having you see them siwashes hollering around and he come and shook me where i was sittin and oh my he knowed well the lie he was acting i bet ive got the marks on my neck now see any red marks leander exhibited the back of his head but the violence done him had evidently been fleeting hell be awful good to you for hes that scared leander stood tremulously straight in silence his lip sagging as wildgoose jake called pleasantly from the other bank come to supper you folks said he why andy i told you to bring them across and youve let them picket their horses was you expectin mrs clallam to take your arm and ford six feet of water for some reason his voice sounded kind as he spoke to his assistant well mother said clallam if it was not for nancy john i know i know out on the shore here on this side would be a pleasanter bedroom for you but he looked up the valley i guess our friends plan is more sensible tonight so they decided to leave the wagon behind and cross to the cabin the horses put them with not much wetting to the other bank where jake most eager and friendly hovered to meet his party and when they were safe ashore pervaded his premises in their behalf turn them horses into the pasture andy said he and first feed em a couple of quarts it may have been hearing himself say this but tone and voice dropped to the confidential and his sentences came with a chuckle quarts to the horses and quarts to the siwashes and a skookum pack of trouble all round mrs clallam if i hednt acame to stop it a while ago why about all the spirits thats in stock jest now was bein traded off for some blamed ponies the bears hev let hobble on the range unswallered ever since i settled here a store on a trail like this here ye see it hez to keep spirits of course and well well heres my room you ladiesll excuse and make yourselves at home as well as you can it was of a surprising neatness due all to him they presently saw the log walls covered with a sort of bunting that was also stretched across to make a ceiling below the shingles of the roof fresh soap and towels china service a clean floor and bed on the wall a print of some white and red village among elms with a covered bridge and the water running over an aprondam just above and a rich smell of whiskey everywhere fix up as comfortable as yu can the host repeated and ill see how mrs jakes tossin the flapjacks shes injun yu know and five years of married life hadnt learned her to toss flapjacks now if i was you he was lingering in the doorway i wouldnt shet that winder so quick it dont smell nice yet for ladies in here and id hev liked to git the time to do better for ye but them siwashes well of course you folks see how it is maybe it aint always and only white men that patronizes our goods uncle sam is a long way off and i dont say wed ought to but when the cats away why the mice will ye know they most always will there was a rattle of boards outside at which he shut the door quickly and they heard him run a light muttering came in at the window and the mother peeping out saw andy fallen among a rubbish of crates and empty cans where he lay staring while his two fists beat up and down like a disordered toy wildgoose jake came and having lifted him with great tenderness was laying him flat as elizabeth clallam hurried to his help no maam he sighed you cant do nothing i guess just let me go over and get our medicines thank you maam said jake and the pain on his face was miserable to see there aint no medicine were kind of used to this andy and me maybe if you wouldnt mind stayin till he comes to why a sick man takes comfort at the sight of a lady when the fit had passed they helped him to his feet and jake led him away mrs jake made her first appearance upon the guests sitting down to their meal when she waited on table passing busily forth from the kitchen with her dishes she had but three or four english words and her best years were plainly behind her but her cooking was good fried and boiled with sticks of her own chopping and she served with industry indeed a squaw is one of the few species of the domestic wife that survive today upon our continent andy seemed now to keep all his dislike for her and followed her with a scowling eye while he frequented jake drawing a chair to sit next him when he smoked by the wall after supper and sometimes watching him with a sort of clouded affection upon his face he did not talk and the seizure had evidently jarred his mind as well as his frame when the squaw was about lighting a lamp he brushed her arm in a childish way so that the match went out and set him laughing she poured out a harangue in chinook showing the dead match to jake who rose and gravely lighted the lamp himself andy laughing more than ever when mrs clallam had taken nancy with her to bed jake walked john clallam to the riverbank and looking up and down spoke a little of his real mind i guess you see how it is with me anyway i dont commonly hev use for strangerfolks in this house but that little girl of yourn started cryin about not havin the pump along that shed been used to seein in the yard at home and i says to myself look ahere jake i dont care if they do ketch on to you and yer blamed whiskey business theyre not the sort to tell on you gee but that about the pump got me and i says jake youre goin to give them the best you hev got why that big bend desert and lonesome valley of the columbia hez chilled my heart in the days that are gone when i werent used to things and the little girl hed came so fur and i knowed how she was afeelin he stopped and seemed to be turning matters over im much obliged to you said clallam and your wife was jest beautiful about andy youve saw me wicked to andy i am and often for i rile turruble quick and god forgive me but when that boy gits at his meanness yuve seen jest a touch of it theres scarcely livin with him it seems like he got reglar inspired some days hell lie make up big lies to the fust man comes in at the door they aint harmless his lies aint then hell trick my woman thats real good to him and i believe hed lick whiskey up off the dirt and every drop is poison for him with his complaint but id ought to remember youd surely think i could remember and forbear most likely he made a big talk to you about that cabin john clallam told him well thats all true for onced i did think hed been up to stealin that whiskey gradual stead of fishin the times he was out all day and the salary i give him jake laughed a little aint enough to justify a mans breaking the law i did take his rifle away when he tried to shoot my woman i guess it was siwashes bruck into that cabin im pretty certain of it said clallam you what makes you john began the tale of the galloping dots and jake stopped walking to listen the harder yes he said thats bad thats jest bad they hev carried a lot off to drink thats the worst he had little to say after this but talked under his tongue as they went to the house where he offered a bed to clallam and mart they would not turn him out so he showed them over to a haystack where they crawled in and went to sleep most white men know when they have had enough whiskey most indians do not this is a difference between the races of which government has taken notice government says that no ardent spirits shall be introduced under any presence into the indian country it also says that the white man who attempts to break this law shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years and by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars it further says that if any superintendent of indian affairs has reason to suspect a man he may cause the boats stores packages wagons sleds and places of deposit of such person to be searched and if ardent spirits be found it shall be forfeit together with the boats and all other substances with it connected one half to the informer and the other half to the use of the united states the courts and all legal machines necessary for trial and punishment of offenders are oiled and ready two years is a long while in jail three hundred dollars and confiscation sounds heavy altogether the penalty looks severe on the printed page and all the while theres no brisker success in our far west than selling whiskey to indians very few people know what the whiskey is made of and the indian does not care he drinks till he drops senseless if he has killed nobody and nobody him during the process it is a good thing for then the matter ends with his getting sober and going home to his tent till such happy time when he can put his hand on some further possession to trade away the white offender is caught now and then but okanagon county lies pretty snug from the arm of the law its against canada to the north and the empty county of stevens to the east south of it rushes the columbia with the naked horrible big bend beyond and to its west rises a domain of unfooted mountains there is law up in the top of it at conconully sometimes but not much even today for that is still a new country where flow the methow the ashinola and the similikameen consequently a cabin like wildgoose jakes was a holiday place the blanketed denizens of the reservation crossed to it and the citizens who had neighboring cabins along the trail repaired here to spend what money they had as mrs clallam lay in her bed she heard customers arrive two or three loud voices spoke in english and several indians and squaws seemed to be with the party bantering in chinook the visitors were in too strong force for jakes word about coming some other night to be of any avail open your cellar and quit your talk elizabeth heard and next she heard some door that stuck pulled open with a shriek of the warped timber next they were gambling and made not much noise over it at first but the indians in due time began to lose to the soberer whites becoming quarrelsome and raising a clumsy disturbance though it was plain the whites had their own way and were feared the voices rose and soon there was no moment that several were not shouting curses at once till mrs clallam stopped her ears she was still for a time hearing only in a muffled way when all at once the smell of drink and tobacco that had sifted only a little through the cracks grew heavy in the room and she felt nancy shrink close to her side mother mother the child whispered whats that it had gone beyond cardplaying with the company in the saloon they seemed now to be having a savage horseplay those on their feet tramping in their scuffles upon others on the floor who bellowed incoherently elizabeth clallam took nancy in her arms and told her that nobody would come where they were but the child was shaking yes they will she whispered in terror they are and she began a tearless sobbing holding her mother with her whole strength a little sound came close by the bed and elizabeths senses stopped so that for half a minute she could not stir she stayed rigid beneath the quilt and nancy clung to her something was moving over the floor it came quite near but turned and its slight rustle crawled away towards the window who is that demanded mrs clallam sitting up there was no answer but the slow creeping continued always close along the floor like the folds of stuff rubbing and hands feeling their way in short slides against the boards she had no way to find where her husband was sleeping and while she thought of this and whether or not to rush out at the door the table was gently shaken there was a drawer opened and some object fell only a thief she said to herself and in a sort of sharp joy cried out her question again the singular broken voice of a woman answered seemingly in fear matches it said and matches said a second voice pronouncing with difficulty like the first she knew it was some of the squaws and sprang from the bed asking what they were doing there matches they murmured and when she had struck a light she saw how the two were cringing their blankets huddled round them their motionless black eyes looked up at her from the floor where they lay sprawled making no offer to get up it was clear to her from the pleading fear in the one word they answered to whatever she said that they had come here to hide from the fury of the next room and as she stood listening to this she would have let them remain but their escape had been noticed a man burst into the room and at sight of her and nancy stopped and was blundering excuses when jake caught his arm and had dragged him almost out but he saw the two on the floor at this getting himself free he half swept the crouching figures with his boot as they fled out of the room and the door was swung shut mrs clallam heard his violent words to the squaws for daring to disturb the strangers and there followed the heavy lashing of a quirt with screams and lamenting no trouble came from the indian husbands for they were stupefied on the ground and when their intelligences quickened enough for them to move the punishment was long over and no one in the house awake but elizabeth and nancy seated together in their bed watching for the day mother and daughter heard them rise to go out one by one and the hoofbeats of their horses grew distant up and down the river as the rustling trees lighted and turned transparent in the rising sun jake roused those that remained and got them away later he knocked at the door i hev a little raft fixed this morning said he and i guess we can swim the wagon over here whatevers quickest to take us from this place elizabeth answered breakfastll be ready maam whenever you say i am ready now i shall want to start ferrying our things wheres mr clallam tell him to come here i will maam im sorry tell mr clallam to come here please john had slept sound in his haystack and heard nothing well he said after comforting his wife and nancy you were better off in the room anyway id not blame him so liza how was he going to help it but elizabeth was a woman and just now saw one thing alone if selling whiskey led to such things in this country the man who sold it was much worse than any mere lawbreaker john clallam being now a long time married made no argument he was looking absently at the open drawer of a table thats queer he said and picked up a tintype she had no curiosity for anything in that room and he laid it in the drawer again his thoughts being taken up with the next step of their journey and what might be coming to them all during breakfast jake was humble about the fright the ladies had received in his house explaining how he thought he had acted for the best at which clallam and mart said that in a rough country folks must look for rough doings and get along as well as they can but elizabeth said nothing the little raft took all but nancy over the river to the wagon where they set about dividing their belongings in loads that could be floated back one at a time and jake returned to repair some of the disorder that remained from the night at the cabin john and mart poled the first cargo across and while they were on the other side elizabeth looked out of the wagon where she was working alone and saw five indian riders coming down the valley the dust hung in the air they had rushed through and they swung apart and closed again as she had seen before so she looked for a rifle but the firearms had gone over the okanagon with the first load she got down and stood at the front wheel of the wagon confronting the riders when they pulled up their horses one climbed unsteadily from his saddle and swayed towards her drink said he half friendly and held out a bottle elizabeth shook her head drink he grunted again pushing the bottle at her piahchuck skookurn he had a slugglish animal grin and when she drew back tipped the bottle into his mouth and directly choked so that his friends on their horses laughed loud as he stood coughing heap good he remarked looking at elizabeth who watched his eyes swim with the plot of the drink where you come back he inquired touching the wagon you cross okanagon me cross you cross horses cross all heap cheap what yes the others nodded heap cheap they said we dont want you said elizabeth no cross maybe he going cross you what yes again elizabeth nodded maybe he jake pursued the indian yes he is we dont want you we cross you all same he not the indian spoke loud and thick and elizabeth looked over the river where her husband was running with a rifle and jake behind him holding a warning hand on his arm jake called across to the indians who listened sullenly but got on their horses and went up the river now said jake to clallam they aint gone get your wife over here so she kin set in my room till i see what kin be done john left him at once and crossed on the raft his wife was stepping on it when the noise and flight of riders descended along the other bank where jake was waiting they went in a circle with hoarse shouts round the cabin as mart with nancy came from the pasture the boy no sooner saw them than he caught his sister up and carried her quickly away among the corrals and sheds where the two went out of sight you stay here liza her husband said ill go back over but mrs clallam laughed get ashore he cried to her quick where you go i go john what good what good in the name then ill get myself over said she and he seized her as she would have jumped into the stream while they crossed the indians had tied their horses and rambled into the cabin jake came from it to stop the clallams theyre after your contract said he quietly they say theyre going to have the job of takin the balance of your stuff thats left acrosst the okanagon over to this side what did you say asked mrs clallam i set em up drinks to gain time do you want me there said clallam begosh no that would mix things worse cant you make them go away elizabeth inquired me and them ye see maam we hev a sort of bargain theyre to git certain ferryin i cant make em savvy how i took charge of you if you want them he paused we want them exclaimed elizabeth if youre joking its a poor joke it aint no joke at all maam jakes face grew brooding of course folks kin say who theyll be ferried by and you may believe id rather do it i didnt look for jest this complication but maybe i kin steer through and its myself ive got to thank of course if them siwashes did git your job theyd sober up gittin ready and the emigrants waited but he did not go on with what was in his mind its all right said he in a brisk tone whatevers acomins acomin he turned abruptly towards the door keep yerselves away jest now he added and went inside the parents sought their children finding mart had concealed nancy in the haystack they put mrs clallam also in a protected place as a loud altercation seemed to be rising at the cabin this grew as they listened and jakes squaw came running to hide herself she could tell them nothing nor make them understand more than they knew but she touched johns rifle signing to know if it were loaded and was greatly relieved when he showed her the magazine full of cartridges the quarrelling had fallen silent but rose in a new gust of fierceness sounding as if in the open air and coming their way no indian appeared however and the noise passed to the river where the emigrants soon could hear wood being split in pieces john risked a survey its the raft he said theyre smashing it now theyre going back stay with the children liza youre never going to that cabin she said hes in a scrape mother john started away heedless of his wifes despair at his coming the indians shouted and surrounded him while he heard jake say drop your gun and drink with them drink said andy laughing with the same screech he had made at the match going out we re all going to canaan connecticut each indian held a tin cup and at the instant these were emptied they were thrust towards jake who filled them again going and coming through a door that led a step or two down into a dark place which was half underground once he was not quick or was imagined to be refusing for an indian raised his cup and drunkenly dashed it on jakes head jake laughed goodhumoredly and filled the cup its our one chance said he to john as the indian propping himself by a hand on the wall offered the whiskey to clallam we cross you okanagon he said what yes maybe you say no said another pressing the emigrant to the wall a third interfered saying something in their language at which the other two disagreed they talked a moment with threatening rage till suddenly all drew pistols at this the two remaining stumbled among the group and a shot went into the roof jake was there in one step with a keg that they no sooner saw than they fell upon it and the liquor jetted out as they clinched wrestling over the room till one lay on his back with his mouth at the open bung it was wrenched from him and directly there was not a drop more in it they tilted it and when none ran out flung the keg out of doors and crowded to the door of the dark place where jake barred the way dont take to that yet he said to clallam for john was lifting his rifle piahchuck yelled the indians scarcely able to stand all other thought had left them and a new thought came to jake he reached for a fresh keg while they held their tin cups in the left hand and pistols in the right pushing so it was a slow matter to get the keg opened they were fast nearing the sodden stage and one sank on the floor jake glanced in at the door behind him and filled the cups once again while all were drinking he went in the storeroom and set more liquor open beckoning them to come as they looked up from the rims to which their lips had been glued they moved round behind the table grasping it to keep on their feet with the one on the floor crawling among the legs of the rest when they were all inside jake leaped out and locked the door they kin sleep now said he gunpowder wont be needed keep wide away from in front there was a minute of stillness within and then a groveling noise and struggle a couple of bullets came harmless through the door those inside fought together as well as they could while those outside listened as it grew less the bodies falling stupefied without further sound of rising one or two still active began striking at the boards with what heavy thing they could find until suddenly the blade of an axe crashed through keep away cried jake but andy had leaped insanely in front of the door and fell dead with a bullet through him with a terrible scream jake flung himself at the place and poured six shots through the panel then as clallam caught him wrenched at the lock and they saw inside whiskey and blood dripped together and no one was moving there it was liquor with some and death with others and all of it lay upon the guilty soul of jake you deserve killing yourself said clallam thats been attended to replied jake and he reeled for during his fire some indian had shot once more clallam supported him to the room where his wife and nancy had passed the night and laid him on the bed ill get mrs clallam said he if shell be willin to see me said the wounded man humbly she came dazed beyond feeling any horror or even any joy and she did what she could it was seein em hit andy said jake is andy gone yes i kin tell hes gone from your face he shut his eyes and lay still so long a time that they thought he might be dying now but he moved at length and looked slowly round the wall till he saw the print of the village among the elms and the covered bridge his hand lifted to show them this thats the road said he andy and me used to go fishin acrosst that bridge did you ever see the housatonic river ive fished a lot there cornwall connecticut the hills are pretty there then andy got worse you look in that drawer john remembered and when he got out the tintype jake stretched for it eagerly his mother and him age ten he explained to elizabeth and held it for her to see then studied the faces in silence you kin tell its andy cant yu she told him yes that was before we knowed he werent werent goin to grow up like the other boys he played with so after a while when she was gone i got ashamed seein andys friends makin their way when he couldnt seem to and so i took him away where nobody hed ever been acquainted with us i was layin money by to get him the best doctor in europe i aint been a good man a faintness mastered him and elizabeth would have put the picture on the table but his hand closed round it they let him lie so and elizabeth sat there while john with mart kept nancy away till the horror in the outer room was made invisible they came and went quietly and jake seemed in a deepening torpor once only rousing suddenly to call his sons name and then upon looking from one to the other he recollected and his eyes closed again his mind wandered but very little for torpor seemed to be overcoming him the squaw had stolen in and sat cowering and useless towards sundown johns heart sickened at the sound of more horsemen but it was only two white men a sheriff and his deputy go easy said john hes not going to resist whats up here anyway who are you clallam explained and was evidently not so much as half believed if there are indians killed said the sheriff theres still another matter for the law to settle with him were sent to search for whiskey the countys about tired of him youll find him pretty sick said john people i find always are pretty sick said the sheriff and pushed his way in stopping at sight of mrs clallam and the figure on the bed im arresting that man madam he said with a shade of apology the county court wants him jake sat up and knew the sheriff youre a little late proctor said he the supreme courts agoin to call my case then he fell back for his case had been called hanks woman i many fish were still in the pool and though luck seemed to have left me still i stood at the end of the point casting and casting my vain line while the virginian lay and watched noondays extreme brightness had left the river and the plain in cooling shadow but spread and glowed over the yet undimmed mountains westward the tetons lifted their peaks pale and keen as steel through the high radiant air deep down between the blue gashes of their canons the sun sank long shafts of light and the glazed laps of their snowfields shone separate and white upon their lofty vastness like handkerchiefs laid out to dry opposite above the valley rose that other range the continental divide not sharp but long and ample it was bare in some high places and below these it stretched everywhere high and low in brown and yellow parks or in purple miles of pine a world of serene undulations a great sweet country of silence a passing band of antelope stood herded suddenly together at sight of us then a little breeze blew for a moment from us to them and they drifted like phantoms away and were lost in the levels of the sagebrush if humans could do like that said the virginian watching them go run you mean said i tell a foe by the smell of him explained the cowpuncher at fifty yards or a mile yes i said men would be hard to catch a woman needs it most he murmured he lay down again in his lounging sprawl with his grave eyes intently fixed upon my flycasting the gradual day mounted up the hills farther from the floor of earth warm airs eddied in its wake slowly stirring the scents of the plain together i looked at the southerner and there was no guessing what his thoughts might be at work upon behind that drowsy glance then for a moment a trout rose but only to look and whip down again into the pool that wedged its calm into the riffle from below second thoughts mused the virginian and as the trout came no more second thoughts he repeated and even a fish will have them sooner than folks has them in this mighty hasty country and he rolled over into a new position of ease at whom or what was he aiming these shafts of truth or did he moralize merely because health and the weather had steeped him in that serenity which lifts us among the spheres well sometimes he went on from these beginnings and told me wonderful things i reckon said he presently that knowing when to change your mind would be pretty near knowledge enough for plain people since my acquaintance with him this was the second summer of it i had come to understand him enough to know that he was unfathomable still for a moment it crossed my thoughts that perhaps now he was discoursing about himself he had allowed a jealous foreman to fall out with him at sunk creek ranch in the spring during judge henrys absence the man having a brief authority parted with him the southerner had chosen that this should be the means of ultimately getting the foreman dismissed and himself recalled it was strategic as he put it to me when i am gone it will be right easy for the judge to see which of us two he wants and ill not have done any talking all of which duly befell in the autumn as he had planned the foreman was sent off his assistant promoted and the virginian again hired but this was meanwhile he was indulging himself in a several months drifting and while thus drifting he had written to me that is how we two came to be on our way from the railroad to hunt the elk and the mountainsheep and were pausing to fish where buffalo fork joins its waters with snake river in those days the antelope still ran there in hundreds the yellowstone park was a new thing and mankind lived very far away since meeting me with the horses in idaho the virginian had been silent even for him so now i stood casting my fly and trusting that he was not troubled with second thoughts over his strategy have yu studded much about marriage he now inquired his serious eyes met mine as he lay stretched along the ground not much i said not very much lets swim he said they have changed their minds forthwith we shook off our boots and dropped our few clothes and heedless of what fish we might now drive away we went into the cool slow deep breadth of backwater which the bend makes just there as he came up near me shaking his head of black hair the cowpuncher was smiling a little not that any number of baths he remarked would conceal a mans objectionableness from an antelope not even a sheone then he went under water and came up again a long way off we dried before the fire without haste to need no clothes is better than purple and fine linen then he tossed the flapjacks and i served the trout and after this we lay on our backs upon a buffalohide to smoke and watch the tetons grow more solemn as the large stars opened out over the sky i dont care if i never go home said i the virginian nodded it gives all the peace o being asleep with all the pleasure o feeling the widest kind of awake said he yu might say the whole years strength flows hearty in every waggle of your thumb we lay still for a while how many things surprise yu any more he next asked i began considering but his silence had at length worked round to speech inventions of course said he these hyeh telephones an truck yu see so much about in the papers but i aint speaking o such things of the brain it is just the common things i mean the things that a livin noticin man is liable to see and maybe sample for himself how many o them kind can surprise yu still i still considered most everything surprised me onced the cowpuncher continued in his gentle southern voice i must have been a mighty green boy till i was fourteen or fifteen i expect i was astonished by ten oclock every morning but a man begins to ketch on to folks and things after a while i dont consideh that when that afteh a man is say twentyfive it is creditable he should get astonished too easy and so yuve not examined yourself thataway i had not well theres two things anyway i know them for sure that i expect will always get me dont care if i live to thirtyfive or fortyfive or eighty and ones the ways lightning can strike he paused then he got up and kicked the fire and stood by it staring at me and the other is the people that other people will marry he stopped again and i said nothing the people that other people will marry he repeated that will surprise me till i die if my sympathy i began but the brief sound that he gave was answer enough and more than enough cure for my levity no said he reflectively not any such thing as a famly for me yet never it may be not till i cant help it and that woman has not come along so far but i have been sorry for a woman lately i keep thinking what she will do for she will have to do something do yu know austrians are they quick in their feelings like italians or are they apt to be sluggish same as norwegians and them other dutchspeakin races i told him what little i knew about austrians this woman is the first i have ever saw of em he continued of course men will stampede into marriage in this hyeh western country where a woman is a scanty thing it aint what hank has done that surprises me and it is not on him that the sorrow will fall for she is good she is very good do yu remember little black hank from texas he claims he is he was working on the main ditch over at sunk creek last summer when that emly hen was around well seh yu would not have pleasured in his company and this year hank is placermining on galena creek where well likely go for sheep theres honey wiggin and a young fello named lin mclean and some others along with the outfit but hanks woman will not look at any of them though the mclean boy is a likely hand i have seen that for i have done a right smart o business thataway myself here and there she will mend their clothes for them and she will cook lunches for them any time o day and her conduct gave them hopes at the start but i reckon austrians have good religion no better than americans said i but the virginian shook his head bettern what ive saw any americans have of course i am not judging a whole nation by one citizen and especially her a woman and of course in them big austrian towns the folks has shook their virtuous sayins loose from their daily doins same as we have i expect selling yourself brings the quickest returns to man or woman all the world over but i am speakin not of towns but of the back country where folks dont just merely arrive on the cyars but come into the world the natural way and grow up slow onced a week anyway they see the bunch of old gravestones that marks their famly their blood and name are knowed about in the neighborhood and its not often one of such will sell themselves but their religion aint to them like this womans they can be ripsnortin ortnary in ways now she is getting naught but hindrance and temptation and meanness from her husband and every livin thing around her yet she keeps right along nor does she mostly bear any signs in her face she has certnly come from where they are used to believing in god and a hereafter mighty hard and all day long she has got one o them crucifixes and hank cant make her quit prayin to it but what is she going to do he will probably leave her i said yes said the virginian leave her alone her money all spent knowin maybe twenty words of english and thousands of miles away from everything she can understand for our words and ways is all alike strange to her then why did he want such a person i exclaimed there was surprise in the grave glance which the cowpuncher gave me why any man would he answered i wanted her myself till i found she was good i looked at this son of the wilderness standing thoughtful and splendid by the fire and unconscious of his own religion that had unexpectedly shone forth in these last words but i said nothing for words too intimate especially words of esteem put him invariably to silence i had forgot to mention her looks to yu he pursued simply she is fit for a man he stopped again then there was her wages that hank saw paid to her he resumed and so marriage was but a little thing to hank agaynst such a heap of advantages as for her idea in takin such as him maybe it was that he was small and she was big tall and big or maybe it was just his white teeth them ridiculous reasons will bring a woman to a man havent yu noticed but maybe it was just her sorrowful helpless state left stranded as she was and him keeping himself near her and sober for a week i had been seein this hyeh yellowstone park takin in its geysers and this and that for my enjoyment and when i found what they claimed about its strange sights to be pretty near so i landed up at galena creek to watch the boys prospectin honey wiggin yu know and mclean and the rest and so they got me to go down with hank to gardner for flour and sugar and truck which we had to wait for we lay around the mammoth springs and gardner for three days playin cyards with friends and i got plumb interested in them tourists for i had partly forgot about eastern people and hyeh they came fresh every day to remind a man of the great size of his country most always they would talk to yu if yu gave em the chance and i did i have come mighty nigh regrettin that i did not keep a tally of the questions them folks asked me and as they seemed genuwinely anxious to believe anything at all and the worser the thing the believinger theyd grow why i well theres times when i have got to lie to keep in good health so i fooled and i fooled and one noon i was on the front poach of the big hotel they have opened at the mammoth springs for tourists and the hotel kid bein on the watchout he sees the dust comin up the hill and he yells out stage yuve not saw that hotel yet seh well when the kid says stage the consequences is most sudden about as conspicuous yu may say as when old faithful geyser lets loose yu see one batch o tourists pulls out right after breakfast for norris basin leavin things empty and yawnin by noon the whole hotel outfit has been slumberin in its chairs steady for three hours maybe yu might hear a fly buzz but maybe not everythings liable to be restin barrin the kid hes awatchin out then he sees the dust and he says stage and it touches the folks off like a hot pokeh the syndicate manager he lopes to a lookinglass and then organizes himself behind the book and the young photograph chap bounces out o his private door like one o them cuckoo clocks and the fossil man claws his specimens and curiosities into shape and the porters line up same as parade and away goes the piano and fiddles upstairs it is mighty conspicuous so hank he come rennin out from somewheres too and the stage drives up then out gets a tall woman and i noticed her yello hair she was kind o dumbeyed yet fine to see i reckon hank noticed her too right away and right away her trouble begins for she was a ladys maid and her lady was out of the stage and roundin her up quick and its where have you put the keys willomene the lady was rich and stinkin lookin and had come from new yawk in her husbands private cyar well willomene fussed around in her pockets and them keys was not there so she started explaining in tanglefoot english to her lady how her lady must have took them from her before leavin the cyar but the lady seemed to relish hustlin herself into a rage she got tolerable conspicuous too and after a heap o words you are discharged she says and off she struts soon her husband came out to willomene still standin like statuary and he pays her a good sum of cash and he goes away and she keeps a standing yet for a spell then all of a sudden she says something i reckon was o jesus and sits down and starts a cryin i would like to have given her comfort but we all stood around on the hotel poach and the right thing would not come into my haid then the baggagewagon came in from cinnabar and they had picked the keys up on the road between cinnabar and gardner so the lady and her toilet was rescued but that did no good to willomene they stood her trunk down along with the rest a brassnailed little old concern and there was willomene out of a job and afoot a long long ways from her own range and so she kept sitting and onced in a while shed cry some more we got her a room in the cheap hotel where the park drivers sleeps when theyre in at the springs and she acted grateful like thanking the boys in her tanglefoot english next mawnin her folks druv off in a private team to norris basin and she seemed dazed for i talked with her then and questioned her as to her wishes but she could not say what she wished nor if it was east or west she would go and i reckon she was too stricken to have wishes our stuff for galena creek delayed on the railroad and i got to know her and then i quit givin hank cause for jealousy i kept myself with the boys and i played more cyards while hank he scacely played at all one night i came on them hank and willomene walkin among the pines where the road goes down the hill yu should have saw that pair o lovers her big shape was plain and kind o steadfast in the moon and alongside of her little black hank and there it was of course it aint nothing to be surprised at that a mean and triflin man tries to seem what he is not when he wants to please a good woman but why does she get fooled when its so plain to other folks that are not givin it any special thought all the rest of the men and women at the mammoth understood hank they knowed he was a worthless proposition and i certnly relied on his gettin back to his whiskey and openin her eyes that way but he did not i met them next evening again by the liberty cap supposin id been her brother or her mother what use was it me warning her brothers and mothers dont get believed the railroad brought the stuff for galena creek and hank would not look at it on account of his courtin i took it alone myself by yanceys and the second bridge and miller creek to the camp nor i didnt tell willomene goodbye for i had got disgusted at her blindness the virginian shifted his position and jerked his overalls to a more comfortable fit then he continued they was married the tuesday after at livingston and hank must have been powful pleased at himself for he gave willomene a wedding present with the balance of his cash spending his last nickel on buying her a redtailed parrot they had for sale at the first national bank the sonofagun hollad so freely at the bank the president awded the cashier to get shed of the outragious bird or he would wring its neck so hank and willomene stayed a week up in livingston on her money and then he fetched her back to gardner and bought their grub and bride and groom came up to the camp we had on galena creek she had never slep out before she had never been on a hawss neither and she mighty near rolled off down into pitchstone canyon comin up by the cutoff trail why seh i would not willingly take you through that place except yu promised me yu would lead your hawss when i said to but hank takes the woman he had married and he takes heavyloaded packhawsses tis the first time such a thing has been known of in the country yu remember them big tall grasstopped mountains over in the hoodoo country and how they descends slam down through the crosstimber that yu cant scatcely work through afoot till they pitches over into lots an lots o little canyons with maybe two inches of water runnin in the bottom all that is east fork water and over the divide is clarks fork or stinkin water if yu take the country yondeh to the southeast but any place yu go is them undesirable steep slopes and the cutoff trail takes along about the worst in the business well hank he got his outfit over it somehow and gentlemen hush but yud ought tve seen him and that poor girl pull into our camp yud certnly never have conjectured them two was a weddin journey he was leadin but skewed around in his saddle to jaw back at willomene for riding so ignorant suppose it was a thing she was responsible for yud not have talked to her thataway even in private and hyeh was the camp alookin and alistenin and some of us ashamed she was setting straddleways like a mountain and between him and her went the three packanimals plumb shiverin played out and the flour they had two hundred pounds tilted over hellwards with the redtailed parrot shoutin landslides in his cage tied on top o the leanin sacks it was that mean to see that shameless and unkind that even a thoughtless kid like the mclean boy felt offended and favorable to some sort of remonstrance the sonofa he said to me the sonofa if he dont stop lets stop him and i reckon we might have but hank he quit twas plain to see hed got a genuwine scare comin through pitchstone canyon and it turned him sour so hed hardly talk to us but just mumbled how kind o gruff when the boys come up to congratulate him as to his marriage but willomene she says when she saw me oh i am so glad and we shook hands right friendly and i wished id told her goodbye that day at the mammoth for she bore no spite and maybe i had forgot her feelings in thinkin of my own i had talked to her down at the mammoth at first yu know and she said a word about old friends our friendship was three weeks old that day but i expect her new experiences looked like years to her and she told me how near she come to gettin killed yu aint ever been over that trail seh yu certnly must see pitchstone canyon but well not go there with packs and we will get off our hawsses a good ways back for many animals feels that theres something the matter with that place and they act very strange about it the grand canyon is grand and makes yu feel good to look at it and a geyser is grand and all right too but this hyeh pitchstone hole if willomene had went down into that well ill tell yu that you may judge she seen the trail adrawin nearer and nearer the aidge between the timber and the jumpinoff place and she seen how them little loose stones and the crumble stuff would slide and slide away under the hawsss feet she could hear the stuff rattlin continually from his steps and when she turned her haid to look she seen it goin down close beside her but into what it went she could not see only there was a queer steam would come up now and agayn and her hawss trembled so she tried to get off and walk without sayin nothin to hank he kep on ahaid and her hawss she had pulled up started to follo as she was half off him and that gave her a tumble but there was an old crooked dead tree it growed right out o the aidge there she hung down below is a little green water tricklin green as the stuff that gets on brass and tricklin along over soft creamcolored formation like pie and it aint so far to fall but what a man might not be too much hurt for crawlin out but there aint no crawlin out o pitchstone canyon they say down in there is caves that yu cannot see tis them that coughs up the stream now and agayn with the wind yu can smell em a mile away and in the night i have been layin quiet and heard em not that its a big noise even when a man is close up its a fluffy kind of a sigh but it sounds as if some awful thing was amakin it deep down in the guts of the world they claim theres poison air comes out o the caves and lays low along the water they claim if a bear or an elk strays in from below and the caves sets up their coughin which they dont regular every day the animals die i have seen it come in two seconds and when it comes thataway risin upon yu with that fluffy kind of a sigh yu feel mighty lonesome seh so hank he happened to look back and see willomene hangin at the aidge o them black rocks and his scare made him mad and his mad stayed with him till they come into camp she looked around and when she seen hanks tent that him and her was to sleep in she showed surprise and he showed surprise when he see the bread she cooked what kind of a dutch woman are yu says he strainin for a joke if yu cant use a dutchoven you say to me you have a house to live in says willomene where is that house i did not figure on gettin a woman when i left camp says hank grinnin but not pleasant or id have hurried up with the shack im a buildin he was buildin one when i left galena creek and come away from that country to meet you the house was finished enough for the couple to move in i hefted her brassnailed trunk up the hill from their tent myself and i watched her take out her crucifix but she would not let me help her with that shed not let me touch it shed fixed it up agaynst the wall her own self her own way but she accepted some flowers i picked and set them in a can front of the crucifix then hank he come in and seein says to me are you one of the kind that squats before them silly dolls i would tell yu i answered him but it would not interest yu and i cleared out and left him and willomene to begin their housekeepin already they had quit havin much to say to each other down in their tent the only steady talkin done in that house was done by the parrot ive never saw any go ahaid of that bird i have told yu about hank and how when hed come home and see her prayin to that crucifix hed always get riled up he would mention it freely to the boys not that she neglected him yu know she done her part workin mighty hard for she was a willin woman but he could not make her quit her religion and willomene she had got to bein very silent before i come away she used to talk to me some at first but she dropped it i dont know why i expect maybe it was hard for her to have us that close in camp witnessin her troubles every day and she a foreigner i reckon if she got any comfort it would be when we was off prospectin or huntin and she could shut the cabin door and be alone the virginian stopped for a moment it will soon be a month since i left galena creek he resumed but i cannot get the business out o my haid i keep a studyin over it his talk was done he had unburdened his mind night lay deep and quiet around us with no sound far or near save buffalo fork plashing over its riffle ii we left snake river we went up pacific creek and through two ocean pass and down among the watery willowbottoms and beaverdams of the upper yellowstone we fished we enjoyed existence along the lake then we went over pelican creek trail and came steeply down into the giant country of grasstopped mountains at dawn and dusk the elk had begun to call across the stillness and one morning in the hoodoo country where we were looking for sheep we came round a jut of the strange organpipe formation upon a longlegged boy of about nineteen also hunting still hyeh said the virginian without emotion i guess so returned the boy equally matteroffactyu seem to be around yourself he added they might have been nextdoor neighbors meeting in a town street for the second time in the same day the virginian made me known to mr lin mclean who gave me a brief nod any luck he inquired but not of me oh drawled the virginian luck enough knowing the ways of the country i said no word it was bootless to interrupt their own methods of getting at what was really in both their minds the boy fixed his wideopen hazel eyes upon me fine weather he mentioned very fine said i i seen your horses a while ago he said camp far from here he asked the virginian not specially stay and eat with us weve got elk meat thats what im after for camp said mclean all of us is out on a hunt today except him how many are yu now the whole six makin money oh some days the gold washes out good in the pan and others its that fine itll float off without settlin so hank aint huntin today huntin we left him layin out in that clump obrush below their cabin been drinkin all night the virginian broke off a piece of the hoodoo mudrock from the weird eroded pillar that we stood beside he threw it into a bank of last years snow we all watched it as if it were important up through the mountain silence pierced the long quivering whistle of a bullelk it was like an unearthly singer practising an unearthly scale first time she heard that said mclean she was scared nothin maybe to resemble it in austria said the virginian thats so said mclean thats so you bet nothin just like hank over there neither well flesh is mostly flesh in all lands i reckon said the virginian i expect yu can be drunk and disorderly in every language but an austrian hank would be liable to respect her crucifix thats so he aint made her quit it yet not him but hes got meaner drunk this mawnin yu say thats his most harmless condition now nobodys in camp but them two her and him alone oh he dassent touch her who did he tell that to oh the camp is backin her the camp has explained that to him several times you bet and whats more she has got the upper hand of him herself she has him beat how beat she has downed him with her eye just by endurin him peacefully and with her eye ive saw it things changed some after yu pulled out we had a good crowd still and it was pleasant and not too lively nor yet too slow and willomene she come more among us shed not stay shut indoors like she done at first id have like tove showed her how to punish hank afteh she had downed yu with her eye inquired the virginian young mclean reddened and threw a furtive look upon me the stranger the outsider oh well he said i done nothing onusual but thats all different now all of us likes her and respects her and makes allowances for her bein dutch yu cant help but respect her and she shows she knows i reckon maybe she knows how to deal with hank said the virginian shucks said mclean scornfully and her so big and him so puny shed ought to lift him off the earth with one arm and lam him with a baste or two with the other and hed improve maybe thats why she dont mused the virginian slowly because she is so big big in the spirit i mean shed not stoop to his level dont yu see she is kind o way up above him and camp and everything just her and her crucifix her and her crucifix repeated young lin mclean staring at this interpretation which was beyond his lively understanding her and her crucifix turruble lonesome company well them are things yu dont know about i kind o laughed myself the first time i seen her at it hank he says to me soft come here lin and i peeped in where she was aprayin she seen us two but she didnt quit so i quit and hank came with me sayin tough words about it yes them are things yu sure dont know about whats the matter with you camping with us boys tonight we had been going to visit them the next day we made it today instead and mr mclean helped us with our packs and we carried our welcome in the shape of elk meat so we turned our faces down the grasstopped mountains towards galena creek once far through an open gap away below us we sighted the cabin with the help of our fieldglasses pity we cant make out hank sleepin in that brush said mclean he has probably gone into the cabin by now said i not him he prefers the brush all day when hes that drunk you bet afraid of her well oneasy in her presence not that shes liable to be in there now she dont stay inside nowadays so much shes been comin round the ditch silentlike but friendly and shell watch us workin for a spell and then shes apt to move off alone into the woods singin them dutch songs of hern that aint got no toon ive met her walkin that way tall and earnest lots of times but she dont want your company though shell patch your overalls and give yu lunch always nor she wont take pay thus we proceeded down from the open summits into the close pines and while we made our way among the crosstimber and over the little streams mclean told us of various days and nights at the camp and how hank had come to venting his cowardice upon his wifes faith why he informed her one day when he was goin take his dust to town that if he come back and found that thing in the house hed do it up for her so yu better pack off your wooden dummy somewheres says he and she just looked at him kind o stonelike and solemn for she dont care for his words no more and while he was away shed have us all in to supper up at the shack and look at us eatin while shed walk around puttin grub on your plate day time shed come around the ditch watchin for a while and move off slow singin her dutch songs and when hank comes back from spendin his dust he sees the crucifix same as always and he says didnt i tell yu to take that down you did says willomene lookin at him very quiet and he quit and honey wiggin says to him hank leave her alone and hank bein all trembly from spreein in town he says youre all agin me like as if he were a baby i should think you would run him out of camp said i well weve studied over that some mclean answered but whats to be done with willomene i did not know none of us seemed to know the boys got together night before last continued mclean and after holdin a unanimous meetin we visited her and spoke to her about goin back to her home she was slow in corrallin our idea on account of her bein no english scholar but when she did after three of us takin their turn at puttin the proposition to her she would not accept any of our dust and though she started to thank us the handsomest she knowed how it seemed to grieve her for she cried so we thought wed better get out shes tried to tell us the name of her home but yu cant pronounce such outlandishness as we went down the mountains we talked of other things but always came back to this and we were turning it over still when the sun had departed from the narrow cleft that we were following and shone only on the distant grassy tops which rose round us into an upper world of light well all soon have to move out of this camp anyway said mclean unstrapping his coat from his saddle and drawing it on it gets chill now in the afternoons d yu see the quakinasps all turned yello and the leaves keeps fallin without no wind to blow em down were liable to get snowed in on short notice in this mountain country if the water goes to freeze on us well have to quit workin theres camp we had rounded a corner and once more sighted the cabin i suppose it may have been still half a mile away upon the further side of a ravine into which our little valley opened but fieldglasses were not needed now to make out the cabin clearly windows and door smoke rose from it for suppertime was nearing and we stopped to survey the scene as we were looking another hunter joined us coming from the deep woods to the edge of the pines where we were standing this was honey wiggin he had killed a deer and he surmised that all the boys would be back soon others had met luck besides himself he had left one dressing an elk over the next ridge nobody seemed to have got in yet from appearances didnt the camp look lonesome theres somebody though said mclean the virginian took the glasses i reckon yes thats hank the cold has woke him up and hes comin in out o the brush each of us took the glasses in turn and i watched the figure go up the hill to the door of the cabin it seemed to pause and diverge to the window at the window it stood still head bent looking in then it returned quickly to the door it was too far to discern even through the glasses what the figure was doing whether the door was locked whether he was knocking or fumbling with a key or whether he spoke through the door to the person within i cannot tell what it was that came through the glasses straight to my nerves so that i jumped at a sudden sound and it was only the distant shrill call of an elk i was handing the glasses to the virginian for him to see when the figure opened the door and disappeared in the dark interior as i watched the square of darkness which the doors opening made something seemed to happen there or else it was a spark a flash in my own straining eyes but at that same instant the virginian dashed forward upon his horse leaving the glasses in my hand and with the contagion of his act the rest of us followed him leaving the pack animals to follow us as they should choose look cried mclean hes not shot her i saw the tall figure of a woman rush out of the door and pass quickly round the house hes missed her cried mclean again shes savin herself but the mans figure did not appear in pursuit instead of this the woman returned as quickly as she had gone and entered the dark interior she had something said wiggin what would that be maybe its all right after all said mclean she went out to get wood the rough steepness of our trail had brought us down to a walk and as we continued to press forward at this pace as fast as we could we compared a few notes mclean did not think he saw any flash wiggin thought that he had heard a sound but it was at the moment when the virginians horse had noisily started away our trail had now taken us down where we could no longer look across and see the cabin and the halfmile proved a long one over this ground at length we reached and crossed the rocky ford overtaking the virginian there these hawsses said he are played out well climb up to camp afoot and just keep behind me for the present we obeyed our natural leader and made ready for whatever we might be going into we passed up the steep bank and came again in sight of the door it was still wide open we stood and felt a sort of silence which the approach of two newcomers could not break they joined us they had been coming home from hunting and had plainly heard a shot here we stood for a moment more after learning this and then one of the men called out the names of hank and willomene again we or i at least felt that same silence which to my disturbed imagination seemed to be rising round us as mists rise from water theres nobody in there stated the virginian nobody thats alive he added and he crossed the cabin and walked into the door though he made no gesture i saw astonishment pass through his body as he stopped still and all of us came after him there hung the crucifix with a round hole through the middle of it one of the men went to it and took it down and behind it sunk in the log was the bullet the cabin was but a single room and every object that it contained could be seen at a glance nor was there hidingroom for anything on the floor lay the axe from the woodpile but i will not tell of its appearance so he had shot her crucifix her rock of ages the thing which enabled her to bear her life and that lifted her above life and she but there was the axe to show what she had done then was this cabin really empty i looked more slowly about half dreading to find that i had overlooked something but it was as the virginian had said nobody was there as we were wondering there was a noise above our heads and i was not the only one who started and stared it was the parrot and we stood away in a circle looking up at his cage crouching flat on the floor of the cage his wings huddled tight to his body he was swinging his head from side to side and when he saw that we watched him he began a low croaking and monotonous utterance which never changed but remained rapid and continuous i heard mclean whisper to the virginian you bet he knows the virginian stepped to the door and then he bent to the gravel and beckoned us to come and see among the recent footprints at the threshold the mans bootheel was plain as well as the womans broad tread but while the mans steps led into the cabin they did not lead away from it we tracked his course just as we had seen it through the glasses up the hill from the brush to the window and then to the door but he had never walked out again yet in the cabin he was not we tore up the halffloor that it had there was no use to dig in the earth and all the while that we were at this search the parrot remained crouched in the bottom of his cage his black eye fixed upon our movements she has carried him said the virginian we must follow up willomene the latest heavy set of footprints led us from the door along the ditch where they sank deep in the softer soil then they turned off sharply into the mountains this is the cutoff trail said mclean to me the same he brought her in by the tracks were very clear and evidently had been made by a person moving slowly whatever theories our various minds were now shaping no one spoke a word to his neighbor but we went along with a hush over us after some walking wiggin suddenly stopped and pointed we had come to the edge of the timber where a narrow black canyon began and ahead of us the trail drew near a slanting ledge where the footing was of small loose stones i recognized the odor the volcanic whiff that so often prowls and meets one in the lonely woods of that region but at first i failed to make out what had set us all running is he looking down into the hole himself some one asked and then i did see a figure the figure i had looked at through the glasses leaning strangely over the edge of pitchstone canyon as if indeed he was peering to watch what might be in the bottom we came near but those eyes were sightless and in the skull the story of the axe was carved by a piece of his clothing he was hooked in the twisted roots of a dead tree and hung there at the extreme verge i went to look over and lin mclean caught me as i staggered at the sight i saw he would have lost his own foothold in saving me had not one of the others held him from above she was there below hanks woman brought from austria to the new world the vision of that brown bundle lying in the water will never leave me i think she had carried the body to this point but had she intended this end or was some part of it an accident had she meant to take him with her had she meant to stay behind herself no word came from these dead to answer us but as we stood speaking there a giant puff of breath rose up to us between the black walls theres that fluffy sigh i told yu about said the virginian hes talkin to her i tell yu hes talkin to her burst out mclean suddenly in such a voice that we stared as he pointed at the man in the tree see him lean over hes sayin i have yu beat after all and mclean fell to whimpering wiggin took the boys arm kindly and walked him along the trail he did not seem twenty yet life had not shown this side of itself to him so plainly before lets get out of here said the virginian it seemed one more pitiful straw that the lonely bundle should be left in such a vault of doom with no last touches of care from its fellowbeings and no heap of kind earth to hide it but whether the place is deadly or not man dares not venture into it so they took hank from the tree that night and early next morning they buried him near camp on the top of a little mound but the thought of willomene lying in pitchstone canyon had kept sleep from me through that whole night nor did i wish to attend hanks burial i rose very early while the sunshine had still a long way to come down to us from the mountaintops and i walked back along the cutoff trail i was moved to look once more upon that frightful place and as i came to the edge of the timber there was the virginian he did not expect any one he had set up the crucifix as near the dead tree as it could be firmly planted it belongs to her anyway he explained some lines of verse came into my memory and with a change or two i wrote them as deep as i could with my pencil upon a small board that he smoothed for me call for the robin redbreast and the wren since oer shady groves they hover and with flowers and leaves do cover the friendless bodies of unburied men call to this funeral dole the ant the fieldmouse and the mole to rear her hillocks that shall keep her warm that kind o quaint language reminds me of a play i seen onced in saynt paul said the virginian about young prince henry i told him that another poet was the author they are both good writers said the virginian and as he was finishing the monument that we had made young lin mclean joined us he was a little ashamed of the feelings that he had shown yesterday a little anxious to cover those feelings with brass well he said taking an offish manoftheworld tone all this fuss just because a woman believed in god you have put it down wrong said the virginian its just because a man didnt padre ignazio at santa ysabel del mar the season was at one of its moments when the air hangs quiet over land and sea the old breezes had gone the new ones were not yet risen the flowers in the mission garden opened wide for no wind came by day or night to shake the loose petals from their stems along the basking silent manycolored shore gathered and lingered the crisp odors of the mountains the dust floated golden and motionless long after the rider was behind the hill and the pacific lay like a floor of sapphire on which to walk beyond the setting sun into the east one white sail shone there instead of an hour it had been from dawn till afternoon in sight between the short headlands and the padre had hoped that it might be his ship but it had slowly passed now from an arch in his garden cloisters he was watching the last of it presently it was gone and the great ocean lay empty the padre put his glasses in his lap for a short while he read in his breviary but soon forgot it again he looked at the flowers and sunny ridges then at the huge blue triangle of sea which the opening of the hills let into sightparadise he murmured need not hold more beauty and peace but i think i would exchange all my remaining years of this for one sight again of paris or seville may god forgive me such a thought across the unstirred fragrance of oleanders the bell for vespers began to ring its tones passed over the padre as he watched the sea in his garden they reached his parishioners in their adobe dwellings near by the gentle circles of sound floated outward upon the smooth immense silence over the vines and peartrees down the avenues of the olives into the planted fields whence women and children began to return then out of the lap of the valley along the yellow uplands where the men that rode among the cattle paused looking down like birds at the map of their home then the sound widened faint unbroken until it met temptation riding towards the padre from the south and cheered the steps of temptations jaded horse for a day one single day of paris repeated the padre gazing through his cloisters at the empty sea once in the year the motherworld remembered him once in the year a barkentine came sailing with news and tokens from spain it was in that a galleon had begun such voyages up to the lower country from acapulco where she loaded the cargo that had come across tehuantepec on mules from vera cruz by she had added the new mission of san diego to her ports in the year that we a thin strip of colonists away over on the atlantic edge of the continent declared ourselves an independent nation that spanish ship in the name of saint francis was unloading the centuries of her own civilization at the golden gate then slowly as mission after mission was planted along the soft coast wilderness she made new stops at santa barbara for instance and by point san luis for san luis obispo that lay inland a little way up the gorge where it opened among the hills thus the world reached these places by water while on land through the mountains a road came to lead to them and also to many more that were too distant behind the hills for ships to serve a long lonely rough road punctuated with church towers and gardens for the fathers gradually so stationed their settlements that the traveller might each morning ride out from one mission and by evening of a days fair journey ride into the next a long rough road and in its way pretty to think of now so there byandby was our continent with the locomotive whistling from savannah to boston along its eastern edge and on the other the scattered chimes of spain ringing among the unpeopled mountains thus grew the two sorts of civilization not equally we know what has happened since today the locomotive is whistling also from the golden gate to san diego but the old mission road goes through the mountains still and on it the steps of vanished spain are marked with roses and white cloisters and the crucifix but this was only the barkentine brought the world that he loved to the padre as for the new world which was making a rude noise to the northward he trusted that it might keep away from santa ysabel and he waited for the vessel that was overdue with its package containing his single worldly indulgence as the little ancient bronze bell continued its swinging in the tower its plaintive call reached something in the padres memory without knowing he began to sing he took up the slow strain not quite correctly and dropped it and took it up again always in cadence with the bell musical score appears here at length he heard himself and glancing at the belfry smiled a little it is a pretty tune he said and it always made me sorry for poor fra diavolo auber himself confessed to me that he had made it sad and put the hermitage bell to go with it because he too was grieved at having to kill his villain and wanted him to die if possible in a religious frame of mind and auber touched glasses with me and said how well i remember it is it the good lord or is it merely the devil that makes me always have a weakness for rascals i told him it was the devil i was not a priest then i could not be so sure with my answer now and then padre ignazio repeated aubers remark in french estce le bon dieu on estce bien le diable qui me fait tonjours aimer les coquins i dont know i dont know i wonder if auber has composed anything lately i wonder who is singing zerlina now he cast a farewell look at the ocean and took his steps between the monastic herbs and the oleanders to the sacristy at least be said if we cannot carry with us into exile the friends and the places that we have loved music will go where we go even to such an end of the world as this felipe he called to his organist can they sing the music i taught them for the dixit dominus tonight yes father surely then we will have that and felipe the padre crossed the chancel to the small shabby organ rise my child and listen here is something you can learn why see now if you cannot learn it with a single hearing the swarthy boy of sixteen stood watching his masters fingers delicate and white as they played so of his own accord he had begun to watch them when a child of six and the padre had taken the wild halfscared spellbound creature and made a musician of him there felipe he said now can you do it slower and more softly muchacho it is about the death of a man and it should go with our bell the boy listened then the father has played it a tone too low said he for our bell rings the note of sol or something very near it as the father must surely know he placed the melody in the right key an easy thing for him but the padre was delighted ah my felipe he exclaimed what could you and i not do if we had a better organ only a little better see above this row of keys would be a second row and many more stops then we would make such music as has never been heard in california yet but my people are so poor and so few and some day i shall have passed from them and it will be too late perhaps ventured felipe the americanos they care nothing for us felipe they are not of our religion or of any religion from what i can hear dont forget my dixit dominus and the padre retired once more to the sacristy while the horse that carried temptation came over the hill the hour of service drew near and as he waited the padre once again stepped out for a look at the ocean but the blue triangle of water lay like a picture in its frame of land empty as the sky i think from the color though said he that a little more wind must have begun out there the bell rang a last short summons to prayer along the road from the south a young rider leading one packanimal ambled into the mission and dismounted church was not so much in his thoughts as food and in due time after that a bed but the doors stood open and as everybody was going into them more variety was to be gained by joining this company than by waiting outside alone until they should return from their devotions so he seated himself at the back and after a brief jaunty glance at the sunburnt shaggy congregation made himself as comfortable as might be he had not seen a face worth keeping his eyes open for the simple choir and simple fold gathered for evensong and paid him no attention on their part a rough american bound for the mines was no longer anything but an object of aversion to them the padre of course had been instantly aware of the strangers presence for this is the sixth sense with vicars of every creed and heresy and if the parish is lonely and the worshippers few and seldom varying a newcomer will gleam out like a new book to be read and a trained priest learns to read shrewdly the faces of those who assemble to worship under his guidance but american vagrants with no thoughts save of golddigging and an overweening illiterate jargon for their speech had long ceased to interest this priest even in his starvation for company and talk from the outside world and therefore after the intoning he sat with his homesick thoughts unchanged to draw both pain and enjoyment from the music that he had set to the dixit dominus he listened to the tender chorus that opens william tell and as the latin psalm proceeded pictures of the past rose between him and the altar one after another came these strains which he had taken from the operas famous in their day until at length the padre was murmuring to some music seldom long out of his heart not the latin verse which the choir sang but the original french words ah voile man envie voila mon seul desir rendez moi ma patrie ou laissez moi mourir which may be rendered but one wish i implore one wish is all my cry give back my native land once more give back or let me die then it happened that he saw the stranger in the back of the church again and forgot his dixit dominus straightway the face of the young man was no longer hidden by the slouching position he had at first taken i only noticed his clothes before thought the padre restlessness was plain upon the handsome brow and in the mouth there was violence but padre ignazio liked the eyes he is not saying any prayers he surmised presently i doubt if he has said any for a long while and he knows my music he is of educated people he cannot be american and now yes he has taken i think it must be a flower from his pocket i shall have him to dine with me and vespers ended with rosy clouds of eagerness drifting across the padres brain but the stranger made his own beginning as the priest came from the church the rebellious young figure was waiting your organist tells me he said impetuously that it is you who may i ask with whom i have the great pleasure of speaking said the padre putting formality to the front and his pleasure out of sight the stranger reddened and became aware of the padres features moulded by refinement and the world i beg your lenience said he with a graceful and confident utterance as of equal to equal my name is gaston villere and it was time i should be reminded of my manners the padres hand waved a polite negative indeed yes padre but your music has astonished me to pieces if you carried such associations as ah the days and the nights he broke off to come down a california mountain he resumed and find paris at the bottom the huguenots rossini herold i was waiting for il trovatore is that something new said the padre eagerly the young man gave an exclamation the whole world is ringing with it he said but santa ysabel del mar is a long way from the whole world said padre ignazio indeed it would not appear to be so returned young gaston i think the comedie francaise must be round the corner a thrill went through the priest at the theatres name and have you been long in america he asked why always except two years of foreign travel after college an american said the surprised padre with perhaps a flavor of disappointment in his voice but no americans who have yet come this way have been have been he veiled the too blunt expression of his thought have been familiar with the huguenots he finished making a slight bow villere took his undermeaning i come from new orleans he returned and in new orleans there live many of us who can recognize a who can recognize good music wherever we meet it and he made a slight bow in his turn the padre laughed outright with pleasure and laid his hand upon the young mans arm you have no intention of going away tomorrow i trust said he with your leave answered gaston i will have such an intention no longer it was with the air and gait of mutual understanding that the two now walked on together towards the padres door the guest was twentyfive the host sixty and have you been in america long inquired gaston twenty years and at santa ysabel how long twenty years i should have thought said gaston looking lightly at the empty mountains that now and again you might have wished to travel were i your age murmured padre ignazio it might be so the evening had now ripened to the long afterglow of sunset the sea was the purple of grapes and wine colored hues flowed among the high shoulders of the mountains i have seen a sight like this said gaston between granada and malaga so you know spain said the padre often he had thought of this resemblance but never heard it told to him before the courtly proprietor of san fernando and the other patriarchal rancheros with whom he occasionally exchanged visits across the wilderness knew hospitality and inherited gentle manners sending to europe for silks and laces to give their daughters but their eyes had not looked upon granada and their ears had never listened to william tell it is quite singular pursued gaston how one nook in the world will suddenly remind you of another nook that may be thousands of miles away one morning behind the quai voltaire an old yellow house with rusty balconies made me almost homesick for new orleans the quai voltaire said the padre i heard rachel in valerie that night the young man went on did you know that she could sing too she sang several verses by an astonishing little jew musician that has come up over there the padre gazed down at his blithe guest to see somebody somebody once again he said is very pleasant to a hermit it cannot be more pleasant than arriving at an oasis returned gaston they had delayed on the threshold to look at the beauty of the evening and now the priest watched his parishioners come and go how can one make companions he began then checking himself he said their souls are as sacred and immortal as mine and god helps me to help them but in this world it is not immortal souls that we choose for companions it is kindred tastes intelligences and and so i and my books are growing old together you see he added more lightly you will find my volumes as behind the times as myself he had fallen into talk more intimate than he wished and while the guest was uttering something polite about the nobility of missionary work he placed him in an easychair and sought aguardiente for his immediate refreshment since the years beginning there had been no guest for him to bring into his rooms or to sit beside him in the high seats at table set apart for the gente fina such another library was not then in california and though gaston villere in leaving harvard college had shut horace and sophocles forever at the earliest instant possible under academic requirements he knew the greek and latin names that he now saw as well as he knew those of shakespeare dante moliere and cervantes these were here also nor could it be precisely said of them either that they made a part of the young mans daily reading as he surveyed the padres august shelves it was with a touch of the florid southern gravity which his northern education had not wholly schooled out of him that he said i fear that i am no scholar sir but i know what writers every gentleman ought to respect the subtle padre bowed gravely to this compliment it was when his eyes caught sight of the music that the young man felt again at ease and his vivacity returned to him leaving his chair he began enthusiastically to examine the tall piles that filled one side of the room the volumes lay richly everywhere making a pleasant disorder and as perfume comes out of a flower memories of singers and chandeliers rose bright from the printed names norma tancredi don pasquale la vestale dim lights in the fashions of today sparkled upon the exploring gaston conjuring the radiant halls of europe before him the barber of seville he presently exclaimedand i happened to hear it in seville but sevilles name brought over the padre a new rush of home thoughts is not andalusia beautiful he said did you see it in april when the flowers come yes said gaston among the music i was at cordova then ah cordova murmured the padre semiramide cried gaston lighting upon that opera that was a week i should like to live it over every day and night of it did you reach malaga from marseilles or gibraltar said the padre wistfully from marseilles down from paris through the rhone valley you know then you saw provence and did you go perhaps from avignon to nismes by the pont du gard there is a place i have made here a little little place with olivetrees and now they have grown and it looks something like that country if you stand in a particular position i will take you there tomorrow i think you will understand what i mean another resemblance said the volatile and happy gaston we both seem to have an eye for them but believe me padre i could never stay here planting olives i should go back and see the original ones and then id hasten up to paris and with a volume of meyerbeer open in his hand gaston hummed robert robert toi que jaime why padre i think that your library contains none of the masses and all of the operas in the world i will make you a little confession said padre ignazio and then you shall give me a little absolution with a penance said gaston you must play over some of these things to me i suppose that i could not permit myself this indulgence began the padre pointing to his operas and teach these to my choir if the people had any worldly associations with the music but i have reasoned that the music cannot do them harm the ringing of a bell here interrupted him in fifteen minutes he said our poor meal will be ready for you the good padre was not quite sincere when he spoke of a poor meal while getting the aguardiente for his guest he had given orders and he knew how well such orders could be carried out he lived alone and generally supped simply enough but not even the ample table at san fernando could surpass his own on occasions and this was for him an occasion indeed your halfbreeds will think i am one of themselves said gaston showing his dusty clothes i am not fit to be seated with you he too was not more sincere than his host in his pack which an indian had brought from his horse he carried some garments of civilization and presently after fresh water and not a little painstaking with brush and scarf there came back to the padre a young guest whose elegance and bearing and ease of the great world were to the exiled priest as sweet as was his traveled conversation they repaired to the hall and took their seats at the head of the long table for the stately spanish centuries of custom lived at santa ysabel del mar inviolate feudal remote they were the only persons of quality present and between themselves and the gente de razon a space intervened behind the padres chair stood an indian to wait upon him and another stood behind the chair of gaston villere each of these servants wore one single white garment and offered the many dishes to the gente fina and refilled their glasses at the lower end of the table a general attendant waited upon the mesclados the halfbreeds there was meat with spices and roasted quail with various cakes and other preparations of grain also the black fresh olives and grapes with several sorts of figs and plums and preserved fruits and white and red wine the white fifty years old beneath the quiet shining of candles freshcut flowers leaned from vessels of old mexican and spanish make there at one end of this feast sat the wild pastoral gaudy company speaking little over their food and there at the other the pale padre questioning his visitor about rachel the mere name of a street would bring memories crowding to his lips and when his guest would tell him of a new play he was ready with old quotations from the same author alfred de vigny they had and victor hugo whom the padre disliked long after the dulce or sweet dish when it was the custom for the vaqueros and the rest of the retainers to rise and leave the gente fina to themselves the host sat on in the empty hall fondly telling the guest of his bygone paris and fondly learning of the paris that was today and thus the two lingered exchanging their fervors while the candles waned and the longhaired indians stood silent behind the chairs but we must go to my piano the host exclaimed for at length they had come to a lusty difference of opinion the padre with ears critically deaf and with smiling unconvinced eyes was shaking his head while young gaston sang trovatore at him and beat upon the table with a fork come and convert me then said padre ignazio and he led the way donizetti i have always admitted there at least is refinement if the world has taken to this verdi with his streetband music but there now sit down and convert me only dont crush my poor little erard with verdis hoofs i brought it when i came it is behind the times too and oh my dear boy our organ is still worse so old so old to get a proper one i would sacrifice even this piano of mine in a moment only the tinkling thing is not worth a sou to anybody except its master but there are you quite comfortable and having seen to his guests needs and placed spirits and cigars and an ashtray within his reach the padre sat himself luxuriously in his chair to hear and expose the false doctrine of il trovatore by midnight all of the opera that gaston could recall had been played and sung twice the convert sat in his chair no longer but stood singing by the piano the potent swing and flow of tunes the torrid copious inspiration of the south mastered him verdi has grown he cried verdi has become a giant and he swayed to the beat of the melodies and waved an enthusiastic arm he demanded every crumb why did not gaston remember it all but if the barkentine would arrive and bring the whole music then they would have it right and he made gaston teach him what words he knewnon ti scordar he sang non ti scordar di me that is genius but one sees how the world moves when one is out of it a nostri monti ritorneremo home to our mountains ah yes there is genius again and the exile sighed and his spirit went to distant places while gaston continued brilliantly with the music of the final scene then the host remembered his guest i am ashamed of my selfishness he said it is already tomorrow i have sat later in less good company answered the pleasant gaston and i shall sleep all the sounder for making a convert you have dispensed roadside alms said the padre smiling and that should win excellent dreams thus with courtesies more elaborate than the world has time for at the present day they bade each other goodnight and parted bearing their late candles along the quiet halls of the mission to young gaston in his bed easy sleep came without waiting and no dreams at all outside his open window was the quiet serene darkness where the stars shone clear and tranquil perfumes hung in the cloisters and while the guest lay sleeping all night in unchanged position like a child up and down between the oleanders went padre ignazio walking until dawn day showed the oceans surface no longer glassy but lying like a mirror breathed upon and there between the short headlands came a sail gray and plain against the flat water the priest watched through his glasses and saw the gradual sun grow strong upon the canvas of the barkentine the message from his world was at hand yet today he scarcely cared so much sitting in his garden yesterday he could never have imagined such a change but his heart did not hail the barkentine as usual books music pale paper and print this was all that was coming to him and some of its savor had gone for the siren voice of life had been speaking with him face to face and in his spirit deep down the love of the world was restlessly answering that call young gaston showed more eagerness than the padre over this arrival of the vessel that might be bringing trovatore in the nick of time now he would have the chance before he took his leave to help rehearse the new music with the choir he would be a missionary too a perfectly new experience and you still forgive verdi the sins of his youth he said to his host i wonder if you could forgive mine verdi has left his behind him retorted the padre but i am only twentyfive explained gaston pathetically ah dont go away soon pleaded the exile it was the plainest burst that had escaped him and he felt instant shame but gaston was too much elated with the enjoyment of each new day to understand the shafts of anothers pain might scarcely pierce the bright armor of his gayety he mistook the priests exclamation for anxiety about his own happy soul stay here under your care he said it would do me no good padre temptation sticks closer to me than a brother and he gave that laugh of his which disarmed severer judges than his host by next week i should have introduced some sin or other into your beautiful garden of ignorance here it will be much safer for your flock if i go and join the other serpents at san francisco soon after breakfast the padre had his two mules saddled and he and his guest set forth down the hills together to the shore and beneath the spell and confidence of pleasant slow riding and the loveliness of everything the young man talked freely of himself and seriously said he if i missed nothing else at santa ysabel i should long to hear the birds at home our gardens are full of them and one smells the jasmine and they sing and sing when our ship from the isthmus put into san diego i decided to go on by land and see california then after the first days i began to miss something all that beauty seemed empty in a way and suddenly i found it was the birds for these little scampering quail are nothing there seems a sort of death in the air where no birds ever sing you will not find any birds at san francisco said the padre i shall find life exclaimed gaston and my fortune at the mines i hope i am not a bad fellow father you can easily guess all the things that i do i have never to my knowledge harmed any one i did not even try to kill my adversary in an affair of honor i gave him a mere flesh wound and by this time he must be quite recovered he was my friend but as he came between me gaston stopped and the padre looking keenly at him saw the violence that he had noticed in church pass like a flame over the young mans handsome face theres nothing dishonorable said gaston answering the priests look i have not thought so my son i did what every gentleman would do said gaston and that is often wrong cried the padre but im not your confessor ive nothing to confess said gaston frankly i left new orleans at once and have travelled an innocent journey straight to you and when i make my fortune i shall be in a position to return and claim the pressed flower put in the padre laughing ah you remember how those things are said gaston and he laughed also and blushed yes said the padre looking at the anchored barkentine i remember how those things are and for a while the vessel and its cargo and the landed men and various business and conversations occupied them but the freight for the mission once seen to there was not much else to hang about here for the barkentine was only a coaster like many others which now had begun to fill the sea a little more of late years and presently host and guest were riding homeward and guessing at the two men from their outsides any one would have got them precisely wrong for within the turbulent young figure of gaston dwelt a spirit that could not be more at ease while revolt was steadily smouldering beneath the schooled and placid mask of the padre yet still the strangeness of his being at such a place came back as a marvel into the young mans lively mind twenty years in prison he thought and hardly aware of it and he glanced at the silent priest a man so evidently fond of music of theatres of the world to whom pressed flowers had meant something once and now contented to bleach upon these wastes not even desirous of a brief holiday but finding an old organ and some old operas enough recreation it is his age i suppose thought gaston and then the notion of himself when he should be sixty occurred to him and he spoke do you know i do not believe said he that i should ever reach such contentment as yours perhaps you will said padre ignazio in a low voice never declared the youth it comes only to the few i am sure yes only to the few murmured the padre i am certain that it must be a great possession gaston continued and yet and yet dear me life is a splendid thing there are several sorts of it said the padre only one for me cried gaston action men women things to be there to be known to play a part to sit in the front seats to have people tell each other there goes gaston villere and to deserve ones prominence why if i were padre of santa ysabel del mar for twenty years no for one year do you know what i should have done some day it would have been too much for me i should have left these savages to a pastor nearer their own level and i should have ridden down this canyon upon my mule and stepped on board the barkentine and gone back to my proper sphere you will understand sir that i am far from venturing to make any personal comment i am only thinking what a world of difference lies between mens natures who can feel alike as we do upon so many subjects why not since leaving new orleans have i met any one with whom i could talk except of the weather and the brute interests common to us all that such a one as you should be here is like a dream but it is not a dream said the padre and sir pardon me if i do say this are you not wasted at santa ysabel del mar i have seen the priests at the other missions they are the sort of good men that i expected but are you needed to save such souls as these there is no aristocracy of souls said the padre almost whispering now but the body and the mind cried gaston my god are they nothing do you think that they are given to us for nothing but a trap you cannot teach such a doctrine with your library there and how about all the cultivated men and women away from whose quickening society the brightest of us grow numb you have held out but will it be for long do you not owe yourself to the saving of higher game henceforth are not twenty years of mesclados enough no no finished young gaston hot with his unforeseen eloquence i should ride down some morning and take the barkentine padre ignazio was silent for a space i have not offended you said the young man no anything but that you are surprised that i should choose to stay here perhaps you may have wondered how i came to be here at all i had not intended any impertinent oh no put such an idea out of your head my son you may remember that i was going to make you a confession about my operas let us sit down in this shade so they picketed the mules near the stream and sat down you have seen began padre ignazio what sort of a man i was once indeed it seems very strange to myself that you should have been here not twentyfour hours yet and know so much of me for there has come no one else at all the padre paused a moment and mastered the unsteadiness that he had felt approaching in his voice there has been no one else to whom i have talked so freely in my early days i had no thought of being a priest my parents destined me for a diplomatic career there was plenty of money and and all the rest of it for by inheritance came to me the acquaintance of many people whose names you would be likely to have heard of cities people of fashion artists the whole of it was my element and my choice and byandby i married not only where it was desirable but where i loved then for the first time death laid his staff upon my enchantment and i understood many things that had been only words to me hitherto looking back it seemed to me that i had never done anything except for myself all my days i left the world in due time i became a priest and lived in my own country but my worldly experience and my secular education had given to my opinions a turn too liberal for the place where my work was laid i was soon advised concerning this by those in authority over me and since they could not change me and i could not change them yet wished to work and to teach the new world was suggested and i volunteered to give the rest of my life to missions it was soon found that some one was needed here and for this little place i sailed and to these humble people i have dedicated my service they are pastoral creatures of the soil their vineyard and cattle days are apt to be like the sun and storm around them strong alike in their evil and in their good all their years they live as children children with mens passions given to them like deadly weapons unable to measure the harm their impulses may bring hence even in their crimes their hearts will generally open soon to the one great key of love while civilization makes locks which that key cannot always fit at the first turn and coming to know this said padre ignazio fixing his eyes steadily upon gaston you will understand how great a privilege it is to help such people and hour the sense of something accomplished under god should bring contentment with renunciation yes said gaston villere then thinking of himself i can understand it in a man like you do not speak of me at all exclaimed the padre almost passionately but pray heaven that you may find the thing yourself some day contentment with renunciation and never let it go amen said gaston strangely moved that is the whole of my story the priest continued with no more of the recent stress in his voice and now i have talked to you about myself quite enough but you must have my confession he had now resumed entirely his halfplayful tone i was just a little mistaken you see too selfreliant perhaps when i supposed in my first missionary ardor that i could get on without any remembrance of the world at all i found that i could not and so i have taught the old operas to my choir such parts of them as are within our compass and suitable for worship and certain of my friends still alive at home are good enough to remember this taste of mine and to send me each year some of the new music that i should never hear of otherwise then we study these things also and although our organ is a miserable affair felipe manages very cleverly to make it do and while the voices are singing these operas especially the old ones what harm is there if sometimes the priest is thinking of something else so theres my confession and now whether trovatore has come or not i shall not allow you to leave us until you have taught all you know of it to felipe the new opera however had duly arrived and as he turned its pages padre ignazio was quick to seize at once upon the music that could be taken into his church some of it was ready fitted by that afternoon felipe and his choir could have rendered ah se lerror t ingombra without slip or falter those were strange rehearsals of il trovatore upon this california shore for the padre looked to gaston to say when they went too fast or too slow and to correct their emphasis and since it was hot the little erard piano was carried each day out into the mission garden there in the cloisters among the oleanders in the presence of the tall yellow hills and the blue triangle of sea the miserere was slowly learned the mexicans and indians gathered swarthy and blackhaired around the tinkling instrument that felipe played and presiding over them were young gaston and the pale padre walking up and down the paths beating time or singing now one part and now another and so it was that the wild cattle on the uplands would hear trovatore hummed by a passing vaquero while the same melody was filling the streets of the faroff world for three days gaston villere remained at santa ysabel del mar and though not a word of the sort came from him his host could read san francisco and the goldmines in his countenance no the young man could not have stayed here for twenty years and the padre forbore urging his guest to extend his visit but the world is small the guest declared at parting some day it will not be able to spare you any longer and then we are sure to meet and you shall hear from me soon at any rate again as upon the first evening the two exchanged a few courtesies more graceful and particular than we who have not time and fight no duels find worth a mans while at the present day for duels are gone which is a very good thing and with them a certain careful politeness which is a pity but that is the way in the general profit and loss so young gaston rode northward out of the mission back to the world and his fortune and the padre stood watching the dust after the rider had passed from sight then he went into his room with a drawn face but appearances at least had been kept up to the end the youth would never know of the old mans discontent temptation had arrived with gaston but was going to make a longer stay at santa ysabel del mar yet it was something like a week before the priest knew what guest he had in his house now the guest was not always present made himself scarce quite often sail away on the barkentine that was a wild notion to be sure although fit enough to enter the brain of such a young scapegrace the padre shook his head and smiled affectionately when he thought of gaston villere the youths handsome reckless countenance would come before him and he repeated aubers old remark is it the good lord or is it merely the devil that always makes me have a weakness for rascals sail away on the barkentine imagine taking leave of the people here of felipe in what words should he tell the boy to go on industriously with his music no this could not be imagined the mere parting alone would make it forever impossible that he should think of such a thing and then he said to himself each new morning when he looked out at the ocean i have given my life to them one does not take back a gift pictures of his departure began to shine and melt in his drifting fancy he saw himself explaining to felipe that now his presence was wanted elsewhere that there would come a successor to take care of santa ysabel a younger man more useful and able to visit sick people at a distance for i am old now i should not be long here in any case he stopped and pressed his hands together he had caught his temptation in the very act now he sat staring at his temptations face close to him while there in the triangle two ships went sailing by one morning felipe told him that the barkentine was here on its return voyage south indeed said the padre coldly the things are ready to go i think for the vessel called for mail and certain boxes that the mission sent away felipe left the room in wonder at the padres manner but the priest was laughing alone inside to see how little it was to him where the barkentine was or whether it should be coming or going but in the afternoon at his piano he found himself saying other ships call here at any rate and then for the first time he prayed to be delivered from his thoughts yet presently he left his seat and looked out of the window for a sight of the barkentine but it was gone the season of the winemaking passed and the putting up of all the fruits that the mission fields grew lotions and medicines were distilled from the garden herbs perfume was manufactured from the petals of the flowers and certain spices and presents of it despatched to san fernando and ventura and to friends at other places for the padre had a special receipt as the time ran on two or three visitors passed a night with him and presently there was a word at various missions that padre ignazio had begun to show his years at santa ysabel del mar they whispered the padre is getting sick yet he rode a great deal over the hills by himself and down the canyon very often stopping where he had sat with gaston to sit alone and look up and down now at the hills above and now at the ocean below among his parishioners he had certain troubles to soothe certain wounds to heal a home from which he was able to drive jealousy a girl whom he bade her lover set right but all said the padre is sick and felipe told them that the music seemed nothing to him any more he never asked for his dixit dominus nowadays then for a short time he was really in bed feverish with the two voices that spoke to him without ceasing you have given your life said one voice and therefore said the other have earned the right to go home and die you are winning better rewards in the service of god said the first voice god can be served in other places than this answered the second as he lay listening he saw seville again and the trees of aranhal where he had been born the wind was blowing through them and in their branches he could hear the nightingales empty empty he said aloud he was right about the birds death does live in the air where they never sing and he lay for two days and nights hearing the wind and the nightingales in the trees of aranhal but felipe watching heard only the padre crying through the hours empty empty then the wind in the trees died down and the padre could get out of bed and soon could be in the garden but the voices within him still talked all the while as he sat watching the sails when they passed between the headlands their words falling forever the same way beat his spirit sore like bruised flesh if he could only change what they said he could rest has the padre any mail for santa barbara said felipe the ship bound southward should be here tomorrow i will attend to it said the priest not moving and felipe stole away at felipes words the voices had stopped a clock done striking silence strained like expectation filled the padres soul but in place of the voices came old sights of home again the waving trees at aranhal then would be rachel for a moment deciaiming tragedy while a houseful of faces that he knew by name watched her and through all the panorama rang the pleasant laugh of gaston for a while in the evening the padre sat at his erard playing trovatore later in his sleepless bed he lay saying now a then to die at home surely i may granted at least this and he listened for the inner voices but they were not speaking any more and the black hole of silence grew more dreadful to him than their arguments then the dawn came in at his window and he lay watching its gray grow warm into color us suddenly he sprang from his bed and looked the sea the southbound ship was coming people were on board who in a few weeks would be sailing the atlantic while he would stand here looking out of the same window merciful god he cried sinking on knees heavenly father thou seest this evil in my heart thou knowest that my weak hand cannot pluck it out my strength is breaking and still thou makest my burden heavier than i can bear he stopped breathless and trembling the same visions were flitting across his closed eyes the same silence gaped like a dry crater in his soul there is no help in earth or heaven he said very quietly and he dressed himself it was so early still that none but a few of the indians were stirring and one of them saddled the padres mule felipe was not yet awake and for a moment it came in the priests mind to open the boys door softly look at him once more and come away but this he did not do nor even take a farewell glance at the church and organ he bade nothing farewell but turning his back upon his room and his garden rode down the caution the vessel lay at anchor and some one had landed from her and was talking with other men on the shore seeing the priest slowly coming this stranger approached to meet him you are connected with the mission here he inquired i am perhaps it is with you that gaston villere stopped the young man from new orleans yes i am padre ignazio then you will save me a journey i promised him to deliver these into your own hands the stranger gave them to him a bag of golddust he explained and a letter i wrote it from his dictation while he was dying he lived scarcely an hour afterwards the stranger bowed his head at the stricken cry which his news elicited from the priest who after a few moments vain effort to speak opened the letter and read my dear friend it is through no mans fault but mine that i have come to this i have had plenty of luck and lately have been counting the days until i should return home but last night heavy news from new orleans reached me and i tore the pressed flower to pieces under the first smart and humiliation of broken faith i was rendered desperate and picked a needless quarrel thank god it is i who have the punishment my dear friend as i lie here leaving a world that no man ever loved more i have come to understand you for you and your mission have been much in my thoughts it is strange how good can be done not at the time when it is intended but afterwards and you have done this good to me i say over your words contentment with renunciation and believe that at this last hour i have gained something like what you would wish me to feel for i do not think that i desire it otherwise now my life would never have been of service i am afraid you are the last person in this world who has spoken serious words to me and i want you to know that now at length i value the peace of santa ysabel as i could never have done but for seeing your wisdom and goodness you spoke of a new organ for your church take the golddust that will reach you with this and do what you will with it let me at least in dying have helped some one and since there is no aristocracy in souls you said that to me do you remember perhaps you will say a mass for this departing soul of mine i only wish since my body must go underground in a strange country that it might have been at santa ysabel del mar where your feet would often pass at santa ysabel del mar where your feet would often pass the priest repeated this final sentence aloud without being aware of it those are the last words he ever spoke said the stranger except bidding goodbye to me you knew him well then no not until after he was hurt im the man he quarrelled with the priest looked at the ship that would sail onward this afternoon then a smile of great beauty passed over his face and he addressed the stranger i thank you said he you will never know what you have done for me it is nothing answered the stranger awkwardly he told me you set great store on a new organ padre ignazio turned away from the ship and rode back through the gorge when he reached the shady place where once he had sat with gaston villere he dismounted and again sat there alone by the stream for many hours long rides and outings had been lately so much his custom that no one thought twice of his absence and when he returned to the mission in the afternoon the indian took his mule and he went to his seat in the garden but it was with another look that he watched the sea and presently the sail moved across the blue triangle and soon it had rounded the headland gastons first coming was in the padres mind and as the vespers bell began to ring in the cloistered silence a fragment of aubers plaintive tune passed like a sigh across his memory musical score appears here but for the repose of gastons soul they sang all that he had taught them of il trovatore thus it happened that padre ignazio never went home but remained cheerful master of the desires to do so that sometimes visited him until the day came when he was called altogether away from this world and passed beyond these voices where is peace
