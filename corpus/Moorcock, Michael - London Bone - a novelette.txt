london bone a novelette by michael moorcock london bone a novelette by michael moorcock for ronnie scott one my name is raymond gold and im a wellknown dealer i was born too many years ago in upper street islington everybody reckons me in the london markets and i have a good reputation in manchester and the provinces i have bought and sold been the middleman an agent an art representative a professional mentor a tour guide a spiritual bridgebuilder these days i call myself a cultural speculator but you wont like it the more familiar word for my profession as i practised it until recently is scalper this kind of language is just another way of isolating the small businessman and making what he does seem sleazy while the stockbroker dealing in millions is supposed to be legitimate but i dont need to convince anyone today that theres no sodding justice scalping is risky what you do is invest in tickets on spec and hope to make a timely sale when the market for them hits zenith any kind of ticket really but mostly shows ive never seen anything offensive about getting the maximum possible profit out of an american matron with more money than sense whos anxious to report home with the right items ticked off the beento list weve all seen them rushing about in their overpriced limos and minibuses pretending to be individuals thursday changingoftheguard harrods planet hollywood royal academy teaattheritz cats its a sort of tribal dance they all feel compelled to perform if they dont perform it they feel inadequate saturday tower of london bucket of blood jacktheripper talk sherlock holmes pub sherlock holmes tour madame tussauds covent garden cream tea dogs these are people so traumatized by contact with strangers that their only security lies in these rituals these wellblazed trails and familiar chants its my job to smooth their paths to make them exclaim how pretty and wonderful and elegant and magical it all is the street people arent a problem theyre just so many charming dick van dykes americans need bullshit the way koala bears need eucalyptus leaves theyve become totally addicted to it they get so much of it back home that they cant survive without it its your duty to help them get their regular fixes while they travel and when they make it back after three weeks on alien shores their friends of course are always glad of some foreign bullshit for a change even if you sell a show ticket to a real enthusiast who has already been forty nine times and is so familiar to the cast they see him in the street and think hes a relative who are you hurting andros loud website lady hatchets loyal laureate who achieved rank and wealth by celebrating the lighter side of the moral vacuum he would surely applaud my enterprise in the buccaneering spirit of the free market venture capitalism at its bravest well hed applaud me if he had time these days from his railings against fate his horrible understanding of the true nature of his coming obscurity but thats partly what my storys about i have to say in my own favour that im not merely a speculator or if you like exploiter im also a patron for many years not just recently a niagara of dosh has flowed out of my pocket and into the real arts faster than a cat up a frenchman whole orchestras and famous soloists have been brought to the wigmore hall on the money they get from me but i couldnt have afforded this if it wasnt for the definitely iffy miss saigon a triumph of welloiled machinery over dodgy morality or the unbelievably decrepit good rockin tonite in which the living dead jive in the aisles nor of course that first great theatrical triumph of the new millennium schindler the musical make em weep uncle walt so who is helping most to support the arts you me the lottery i had another reputation of course which some saw as a second profession i was one of the last great london characters i was always on latenight telly lit from below and iain sinclair couldnt write a paragraph without dropping my name at least once im a quintessential londoner i am im a cockney gentleman i read israel zangwill and gerald kersh and alexander barron i can tell you the best books of pett ridge and arthur morrison i know pratface charlie driff and martin stone bernie michaud and the even more legendary gerry and pat goldstein theyre all historians archeologists revenants there isnt another culturedealer in london oldster or child who doesnt at some time come to me for an opinion even now when im as popular as a pig at a putney wedding and people hold their noses and dive into traffic rather than have to say hello to me they still need me for that ive known all the famous londoners or known someone else who did i can tell stories of longdead gangsters who made the krays seem like amnesty international bareknuckle boxing fighting the fascists in the east end gunbattles with the police all over stepney in the s the terrifying girl gangsters of whitechapel barricading the old bill in his own barracks down in notting dale i can tell you where all the music halls were and what was sung in them and why i can tell marie lloyd stories and max miller stories that are fresh and sharp and bawdy as the day they happened because their wit and experience came out of the market streets of london the same streets the same markets the same family names london is markets markets are london im a londoner through and through i know mr gog personally i know ma gog even more personally during the day i can walk anywhere from bow to bayswater faster than any taxi i love the markets brick lane church street portobello you wont find me on a bike with my bum in the air on a winters afternoon i walk or drive nothing in between i wear a camelhair in winter and a barracloughs in summer you know what would happen to a coat like that on a bike i love the theatre i like modern dance very good movies and ambitious international contemporary music i like poetry prose painting and the decorative arts i like the lot the very best that londons got the whole bloody casserole i gobble it all up and bang on my bowl for more let timid greenbelters creep in at weekends and sink themselves in the west ends familiar deodorised shit if they want to thats not my city thats a tourist set its what i live off what all of us showpeople live off its the old familiar circus the big rotate were selling what everybody recognises what makes them feel safe and certain and sure of every single moment in the city nothing to worry about in jolly old london we sell charm and colour by the yard whole word factories turn out new rhyming slang and saucy street characters are trained on council grants dont frighten the horses licensed pearlies pause for a photoopportunity in the dockside secure zones without all that cheap scenery without our myths and magical skills without our whorish good cheer and instincts for trade any kind of trade we probably wouldnt have a living city as it is the real city i live in has per square inch more creative energy at work at any given moment than anywhere else on the planet but youd never know it from a stroll up the strand its almost all in those lively little sidestreets the englishspeaking tourists cant help feeling a bit nervous about and which the french adore if you use music for comfortable escape youd probably find more satisfying and cheaper relief in a massage parlour than at the umpteenth revival of the sound of music id tell that to any hesitant punter whos not too sure check out the phone boxes for the ladies id say or you can go to the halfprice ticketbooth in leicester square and pick up a ticket thatll deliver real value ibsen or shakespeare shaw or greenbank certainly you can fork out three hundred sheets for a fifty sheet ticket that in a justlyordered world wouldnt be worth two pee and have your ears salved and your cradle rocked for two hours dont worry id tell them i make no judgements some hardworking whore profits whatever you decide so whos the cynic i went on one of those tours when my friends dave and di from bury came up for the festival of london in l and its amazing the crap they tell people they put sex violence and money into every story they know fuckall they soup everything up its sunreader history even the beefeaters at the tower poppinsland all that old english duff it makes you glad to get back to soho not so long ago you would usually find me in the princess louise berwick street at lunch time a few doors down from the chinese chippy and just across from mrs whites trim stall in berwick market its only a narrow door and is fairly easy to miss it has one bottleglass window onto the street this is a public house which has not altered since the s when it was very popular with dylan thomas mervyn peake ruthven todd henry treece and a miscellaneous bunch of other welsh adventurers who threatened for a while to take over english poetry from the irish its a shit pub so dark and smoky you can hardly find your glass in front of your face but the look of it keeps the tourists out its used by all the culture pros from arty types with backpacks who do specialised walking tours to famous gallery owners and top museum management and by the heavy metal bikers we all get on a treat we are mutually dependent in our continuing resistance to invasion or change to the preservation of the best and most vital aspects of our culture we leave them alone because they protect us from the tourists who might recognise us and make us put on our masks in a hurry they leave us alone because the police wont want to bother a bunch of wellconnected middleclass wankers like us it is a wonderful example of mutuality in the back rooms thanks to some freaky acoustics you can talk easily above the music and hardly know its there over the years there have been some famous friendships and unions struck between the two groups my own lady wife was known as karla the she goat in an earlier incarnation and had the most exquisite and elaborate tattoos i ever saw she was a wonderful wife and would have made a perfect mother she died on the al on the other side of watford gap she had just found out she was pregnant and was making her last sentimental run it did me in for marriage after that and urban romance i first heard about london bone in the princess lou when claire rood that elegant old dike from the barbican whod tipped me off about my new tailor pulled my ear to her mouth and asked me in words of solid gin and garlic to look out for some for her darling none of the usual faces seemed to know about it a couple of top level museum people knew a bit but it was soon obvious they were hoping id fill them in on the details i showed them a confident length of cuff i told them to keep in touch i did my friday walk starting in the horrible predawn chill of the portobello road where some youth tried to sell me a bit of scrimshawed reconstitute as the real old bone i warmed myself in the showrooms of elegant kensington and chelsea dealers telling outrageous stories of deals profits and crashes until they grew uncomfortable and wanted to talk about me and i got the message and left i wound up that evening in the urinal of the dragoons in meard alley swapping longtimenosees with my boyhood friend bernie michaud who begins immediately by telling me hes got a bit of business i might be interested in and since its bernie michaud telling me about it i listen bernie never deliberately spread a rumour in his life but hes always known how to make the best of one this is kosher he thinks it has a bit of a glow it smells like a winner a longdistance runner he is telling me out of friendship but im not really interested im trying to find out about london bone im not talking drugs ray you know that and its not bent bernies little pale face is serious he takes a thoughtful sip of his whisky it is admittedly a commodity i wasnt interested i hadnt dealt in goods for years services only bernie i said remember its my rule who wants to get stuck paying rent on a warehouse full of yesterdays faves im still trying to move those glenda sings michael jackson sides pratface talked me into what about investment he says this is the real business ray believe me so i heard him out it wouldnt be the first time bernie had brought me back a nice profit on some deal id helped him bankroll and i was all right at the time id just made the better part of a months turnover on a package of theatrelands most profitable stinkers brokered for a party of filthyrich new muscovites who thought chekhov was something you did with your lottery numbers as they absorbed the quintessence of euroersatz guaranteed to offer as its high emotional moment a long relentless bowel movement i would be converting their hard roubles back into beluga its a turning world the world of the international free market and everythings wonderful and cute and pretty and magical so long as you keep your place on the carousel its not good if it stops and its worse if you get thrown off altogether pray to mammon that you never have to seek the help of an organization that calls you a client that puts you outside the fairground forever no more rides no more fun no more life bernie only did quality art so i knew i could trust that side of his judgement but what was it a new batch of raphaels turned up in a willesden attic andy warhols lost landscapes found at the pheasantry theres american collectors frenzied for this stuff murmurs bernie through a haze of sons of the wind motorchair and montecristo fumes and if its decorated they go through the roof all the big swiss guys are looking for it freddy k in cairo has a saudi buyer who tops any price rose sarkissian in agadir represents three french collectors its never catalogued its all word of mouth and its already turning over millions theres one inferior piece in new york and none at all in paris the pieces in zurich are probably all fakes this made me feel that i was losing touch i still didnt know what he was getting at listen i say before we go any further lets talk about this london bone youre a fly one ray he says how did you suss it tell me what you know i say and then ill fill you in we went out of the pub bought some fishandchips at the chinese and then walked up berwick street and round to his little club in darblay street where we sat down in his office and closed the door the place stank of catpee he doted on his persians they were all out in the club at the moment being petted by the patrons first he says i dont have to tell you ray that this is strictly doubleschtum and i will kill you if a syllable gets out naturally i said have you ever seen any of this bone he asked he went to his cupboard and found some vinegar and salt or better still handled it no i said not unless its fake scrimshaw this stuffs got a depth to it youve never dreamed about a lustre you can tell its the real thing as soon as you see it not just the shapes or the decoration but the quality of it its like its got a soul you could come close but you could never fake it like amber for instance thats why the big collectors are after it its authentic its newlydiscovered and its rare what bone is it mastodon some people still call it mammoth ivory but i havent seen any actual ivory it could be dinosaur i dont know anyway this bone is better than ivory its in weird shapes probably fragments off some really big animal and wheres it coming from the heavy clay of good old london says bernie a fortune at our feet ray and my people know where to dig two i had to be straight with bernie until i saw a piece of the stuff in my own hand and got an idea about it for myself i couldnt do anything the only time in my life id gone for a gold brick id bought it out of respect for the genius running the scam he deserved what i gave him which was a bit less than he was hoping for rather than be conned i would rather throw the money away im like that with everything i had my instincts i told bernie i had to go with them he understood completely and we parted on good terms if the famous lloyd webber meltdown of o had happened a few months earlier or later i would never have thought again about going into the bone business but i was done in by one of those sudden changes of public taste which made the george m cohan crash of seem like a run of the mousetrap sentimental fascism went out the window liberalhumanist contemporary relevance artistic aspiration intellectual and moral substance and all that stuff was somehow in demand it was better than the sixties it was one of those splendid moments when the public pulls itself together and tries to grow up joness rhyme of the flying bomb song cycle made a glorious comeback american angels returned with even more punch and sondheim made an incredible comeback he became a quality brandname if it wasnt by sondheim or based on a tune sondheim used to hum in the shower the punters didnt want to know overnight the publics product loyalty had changed and i must admit it had changed for the better but my investments were in cats and dogs lord webbers last desperate attempt to squeeze from thurber what he sucked from eliot duce and starlight excess all of which were now taking a walk down sunset boulevard i couldnt even get a regular price ticket for myself at sunday in the park assassins or follies into the woods was solid for eighteen months ahead i saw passion from the wings and sweeney todd from the gods five guys named mo crumbled to dust phantom closed its author claimed sabotage quality will out ray says bernie next time i see him at the lou youve got to grant the public that you just have to give it time fuck the public i said with some feeling theyre just nostalgic for quality at the moment next year itll be something else meanwhile im bloody ruined you couldnt drum a couple of oncers on my entire stock even my eno sidebets have died covent gardens a disaster the weather in milan didnt help thats where cecilia bartoli caught her cold i was lucky to be offered halfprice for the rossinis without her and i know what id do if i could get a varda at bloody simon rattle so you wont be able to come in on the bone deal said bernie returning to his own main point of interest i said i was ruined i told him not wiped out well i got something to show you now anyway says bernie we went back to his place he put it in my hand as if it were a nugget of plutonium a knuckle of dark golden bone split off from a larger piece covered with tiny pictures the engravings are always on that kind of bone he said there are other kinds that dont have drawings maybe from a later date its the work of the first londoners i suppose when it was still a swamp about the time your phoenician ancestors started getting into the upriver woadtrade i dont know the significance of course the bone itself was hard to analyse because of the mixture of chemicals which has created it and some of it had fused suggesting prehistoric upheavals of some kind the drawings were extremely primitive any bored person with a sharp object and minimum talent could have done them at any time in history the larger weirder looking bones had no engravings stick people pursued other stick people endlessly across the fragment the work was unremarkable the beauty really was in the tawny ivory colour of the bone alone it glowed with a wealth of shades and drew you hypnotically into its depths i imagined the huge animal of which this fragment had one been an active part i saw the bellowing trunk the vast ears the glinting tusks succumbing suddenly to whatever had engulfed her i saw her body swaying her tail lashing as she trumpeted her defiance of her inevitable death and now men sought her remains as treasure it was a very romantic image and of course it would become my most sincere sales pitch thats six million dollars youre holding there said bernie minimum bernie had caught me at the right time and i had to admit i was convinced back in his office he sketched out the agreement we would go in on a fiftyfifty basis funding the guys who would do the actual digging who knew where the bonefields were and who would tell us as soon as we showed serious interest we would finance all the work pay them an upfront earnest and then load by load in agreed increments bernie and i would split the net profit fifty fifty there were all kinds of clauses and provisions covering the various problems we foresaw and then we had a deal the archeologists came round to my little place in dolphin square they were a scruffy bunch of students from the university of norbury who had discovered the bone deposits on a run of the mill field trip in a demolished southwark housing estate and knew only that there might be a market for them recent cuts to their grants had made them desperate some lefty had come up with a law out of the magna carta or somewhere saying public land couldnt be sold to private developers and so there was a court case disputing the councils right to sell the estate to livingstone international which also put a stop to the planned rebuilding so we had indefinite time to work the stoodies were grateful for our expertise as well as our cash i was happy enough with the situation it was one i felt we could easily control middleclass burbnerds get greedy the same as anyone else but they respond well to reason i told them for a start off that all the bone had to come in to us if any of it leaked onto the market by other means wed risk losing our prices and that would mean the scheme was over terminated i said significantly since we had reputations as well as investments to protect there would also be recriminations thats all i had to say since those v serials kids think were krays and mad frankie frazers just because we like to look smart and talk properly we were fairly sure we werent doing anything obviously criminal the stuff wasnt treasure trove it had to be cleared before proper foundations could be poured quite evidently li didnt think it was worth paying security staff to shuft the site we didnt know if digging shafts and tunnels was even trespass but we knew we had a few weeks before someone started asking about us and by then we hoped to have the whole bloody mastodon out of the deep clay and nicely earning for us the selling would take the real skill and that was my job it was going to have to be played sharper than south african diamonds after that neither bernie nor i had anything to do with the dig we rented a guarded lockup in clapham and paid the kids every time they brought in a substantial load of bone it was incredible stuff bernie thought that chemical action some of it relatively recent had caused the phenomenon like chalk you know you hardly find it anywhere just a few places in england france china and texas the kids reported that there was more than one kind of animal down there but that all the bone had the same rich appearance they had constructed a new tunnel with a hidden entrance so that even if the building site was blocked to them they could still get at the bone it seemed to be a huge field but most of the bone was at roughly the same depth much of it had fused and had to be chipped out they had found no end to it so far and they had tunneled through more than half an acre of the dense dark clay meanwhile i was in amsterdam and rio paris and vienna and new york and sydney i was in tokyo and seoul and hong kong i was in ryadh cairo and baghdad i was in kampala and new benin everywhere there were major punters i racked up so many free airmiles in a couple of months that they were automatically jumping me to first class but i achieved what i wanted nobody bought london bone without checking with me i was the acknowledged expert the prime source the best in the business if you want bone said the art world you want gold the serious fraud squad became interested in bone for a while but they had been assuming we were faking it and gave up when it was obviously not rubbish neither bernie nor i expected it to last any longer than it did by the time our first phase of selling was over we were turning over so much dough it was silly and the kids were getting tired and were worrying about exploring some of their wildest dreams there was almost nothing left they said so we closed down the operation moved our warehouses a couple of times and then let the bone sit there to make us some money while everyone wondered why it had dried up and at that moment inevitably and late as ever the newspapers caught on to the story there was a brief latenight tv piece a few supplements talked about it in their arts pages this led to some news stories and eventually it went to the tabloids and became anything you liked from the remains of martians to a new kind of nuclear waste anyone who saw the real stuff was convinced but everyone had a theory about it the real exclusive market was finished we kept schtum we were gearing up for the second phase we got as far away from our stash as possible of course a few faces tracked me down but i denied any knowledge of the bone i was a middleman i said i just had good contacts halfadozen people claimed to know where the bone came from of course they talked to the papers i sat back in satisfied security watching the mud swirl over our tracks another couple of months and wed be even safer than the house id bought in hampstead overlooking the heath it had a rather forlorn garden the size of kilburn which needed a lot of nurturing that suited me i was ready to retire to the country and a big indoor swimming pool by the time a close version of the true story came out from one of the stoodies whod lost all his share in a lottery syndicate it was just one of many it sounded too dull i told newspaper reporters that while i would love to have been involved in such a lucrative scheme my money came from theatre tickets meanwhile bernie and i thought of our warehouse and said nothing now the stuff was getting into the culture it was chic puncher used it in their ads it was called mammoth bone by the media there was a common story about how a herd had wandered into the swampy river and drowned in the mud lots of pictures dusted off from the natural history museum experts explained the colour the depths the markings the beauty models sported a bone motif our second phase was to put a fair number of inferior fragments on the market and see how the public responded that would help us find our popular price the most a customer would pay we were looking for a few good millionaires frankly as i told my partner i was more than ready to get rid of the lot but bernie counselled me to patience we had a plan and it made sense to stick to it the trade continued to run well for a while as the sole source of the stuff we could pretty much control everything then one sunday lunchtime i met bernie at the six jolly dragoons in meard alley soho he had something to show me he said he didnt even glance around he put it on the bar in plain daylight a small piece of bone with the remains of decorations still on it what about it i said its not ours he said my first thought was that the stoodies had opened up the field again that they had lied to us when they said it had run out no said bernie its not even the same colour its the same stuff but different shades gerry goldstein lent it to me where did he get it he was offered it he said we didnt bother to speculate where it had come from but we did have rather a lot of our bone to shift quickly against my will i made another world tour and sold mostly to other dealers this time it was a standard secondwave operation but run rather faster than was wise we definitely missed the crest however before deliveries were in and cheques were cashed jack merrywidow the fighting mp for brookgate and e holborn gets up in the house of commons on telly one afternoon and asks if prime minister bland or any of his dopedazed cabinet understand that human remains taken from the hallowed burial grounds of london are being sold by the piece in the international market place mr bland makes a plummy joke enjoyed at mr merrywidows expense and sits down but jack wont give up theyre suddenly on telly its the struggle of parliament time jacks had the bone examined by experts its human undoubtedly human the strange shapes are caused by limbs melting together in soil heavy with lime chemical reactions he says we have he raises his eyes to the camera been mining mass graves a shock to all those who still long for the years of common decency someone says jack is selling more than our heritage hasnt free market capitalism got a little bit out of touch when we start selling the arms legs and skulls of our forebears the torsos and shoulderblades of our honourable dead what did we used to call people who did that when was the government going to stop this trade in corpses its denied its proved it looks like trade is about to slump i think of framing the cheques as a reminder of the vagaries of fate and give up any idea of popping the question to my old muse little trudi who is back on the market having been dumped by her corporate suit in a fit hes told her of selfdisgust after seeing the tolstoy investment with eddie izzard bernie i tell my partner the bone business is down the drain we might as well bin the stuff weve stockpiled then two days later the tv news reports a vast public interest in london bone some lordly old queen with four names comes on the evening news to say how by owning a piece of bone you own londons true history you become a curator of some ancient ancestor hes clearly got a vested interest in the stuff its the hottest tourist item since jack the ripper razors and oj gloves more people want to buy it than ever the only trouble is i dont deal in dead people it is in fact where i have always drawn the line even pratface charlie wouldnt sell his great great grandmothers elbow to some overweight jap in a deerstalker and a kilt im faced with a genuine moral dilemma i make a decision i make a promise to myself i cant got back on that i go down to the italian chippy in fortess road stoke up on nourishing ritual grease cod roe chips and mushy peas bread and butter and tea syrup pudding then heave my out of shape but mentally prepared body up onto parliament hill to roll myself a big wackybaccy fag and let my subconscious think the problem through when i emerge from my reverie i have looked out over the whole misty london panorama and considered the citys complex history i have thought about the number of dead buried there since say the time of bodicea and what they mean to the soil we build on the food we still grow here and the air we breath we are recycling our ancestors all the time one way or another we are sucking them in and shitting them out were eating them were drinking them were coughing them up the dead dont rest bits of them are permanently at work so what am i doing wrong this thought is comforting until my moral sense sharpening itself up after a long rest kicks in with but whats different here is youre flogging the stuff to people who take it home with them back to wisconsin and california and peking you take it out of circulation youre dissipating the deep fabric of the city youre unravelling something like the real infrastructure the spiritual and physical bones of an ancient city on kite hill i suddenly realise that those bones are in some way the deep lifestuff of london it grows dark over the towers and roofs of the metropolis i sit on my bench and roll myself up a further joint i watch the silver rising from the river the deep golden glow of the distant lights the plush of the foliage and as i watch it seems to shred before my eyes like a rotten curtain even the traffic noise grows fainter is the city sick is she expiring somehow it seems theres a little less breath in the old girl i blame myself and bernie and those kids there and then on the spot i renounce all further interest in the bone trade if nobody else will take the relics back then i will theres no resolve purer than the determination you draw from a really good reefer three so now there isnt a tourist in any london market or antique arcade who isnt searching out bone they know it isnt cheap they know they have to pay and pay they do through the nose and half of what they buy is crap or fakes this is a question of status not authenticity as long as we say its good they can say its good we give it a provenance a story something to colour the tale to the folks back home were honest dealers we sell only the authentic stuff still they get conned but still they look still they buy jealous mancunians and brummies long for a history old enough to provide them with bone a few of the early settlements like chester and york start turning up something like it but its not the same jim morrisons remains disappear from pere la chaise they might be someone elses bones anyway rumour is they were kfc bones the revolutionary deathpits fail to deliver the goods the french are furious they accuse the british of gross materialism and poor taste oscar wilde disappears george eliot winston churchill you name them for a few months there is a grotesque trade in the remains of the famous but the fashion has no intrinsic substance and fizzles out anyone could have seen it wouldnt run bone has the image because bone really is beautiful too many people are yearning for that bone the real stuff it genuinely hurts me to disappoint them circumstances alter cases against my better judgement i continue in the business i bend my principles just for the duration we have as much turnover as we had selling to the swiss gnomes its the latest item on the beento list you have to bring me back some london bone ethel or ill never forgive you it starts to appear in the american luxury catalogs but by now there are ratsniffers everywhere from trade and industry from the national trust from the heritage corp from halfadozen south london councils from the special branch from the cid the inland revenue and both the funny and the serious fraud squads any busybody who ever wanted to put his head under someone elses bed is having a wonderful time having failed dramatically with the stop this disgusting trade approach the tabloids switch to offering bits of bone as prizes in circulation boosters i sell a newspaper consortium a tescos plastic bagfull for twoandahalf mill via a gobetween bernie and i are getting almost frighteningly rich i open some bank accounts offshore and i became an important anonymous shareholder in the queen elizabeth hall when its privatized it doesnt take long for the experts to come up with an analysis most of the bone has been down there since the seventeenth century and earlier they are the sites of the old plague pits where legend had it still living corpses were thrown in with the dead for a while it must have seemed like auschwitzonthames the chemical action of lime partial burning london clay and decaying flesh together with the broadening spread of the london watertable thanks to various engineering works over the last century letting untreated sewage into the mix had created our unique london bone as for the decorations that it was opined was the work of the pit guards working on earlier bones found on the same site blood shit and bone says bernie its what make the world go round that and money of course and love i add im doing all right these days its true what they say about a roller little trudi has enthusiastically rediscovered my attractions she has her eye on a ring i raise my glass and love bernie fuck that says bernie not in my experience hes buying paul mccartneys old place in wamering and having it converted for persians he has it is true also bought his wife her dream house she doesnt seem to mind its on the island of las cascadas about six miles off the coast of morocco shes at last agreed to divorce him apart from his mother shes the only woman he ever had anything to do with and he isnt he says planning to try another the only females he wants in his house in future come with a pedigree a mile long have all their shots and can be bought at harrods four i expect you heard what happened the private bonefields which contractors were discovering all over south and west london actually contained public bones they were part of our national inheritance they had living relatives and stones some of them so it became a political and a moral issue the church got involved the airwaves were crowded with concerned clergy there was the problem of the selfnamed boneminers kids inspired by our leaders rhetoric and aspiring to imitate those great captains of free enterprise they had been taught to admire were turning over ordinary graveyards which theyd already stripped of their saleable masonry and digging up somewhat fresher stiffs than was seemly a bit too fresh it was pointless the bone took centuries to get seasoned and so far nobody had been able to fake the process a few of the older graveyards had small deposits of bone in them brompton cemetery had a surprising amount for instance and so did highgate this attracted prospectors they used shovels mainly but sometimes low explosives the area around karl marxs monument looked like theyd refought the russian civil war over it the barbed wire put in after the event hadnt helped and as usual the public paid to clean up after private enterprise nobody in their right mind got buried any more cremation became very popular the borough councils and their financial managers were happy because more valuable real estate wasnt being occupied by a nonconsumer it didnt matter how many security guards were posted or by one extreme authority landmines the teenies left no grave unturned bone was still a profitable item even though the market had settled down since we started they dug up bernies mother they dug up my cousin leonard there wasnt a londoner who didnt have some intimate unexpectedly back above ground every night you saw it on telly it had caught the public imagination the media had never made much of the desecrated graveyards the chiselledoff angels heads and the uprooted headstones on sale in kings road and the boulevard st michel since the nineteen seventies these had been the targets of first generation graverobbers then there had seemed nothing left to steal even they had balked at doing the corpses besides there wasnt a market this second generation was making up for lost time turning over the soil faster than an earthworm on e the news shots became clichйs the heaped earth the headstone the smashed coffin the hint of the contents the leader of the opposition coming on to say how all this has happened since his mirror image got elected the councils argued that they should be given the authority to deal with the problem they owned the graveyards and also they reasoned the bonefields the profits from those fields should rightly go into the public purse they could help pay for the health service let the dead went their favourite slogan pay for the living for a change what the local politicians actually meant was that they hoped to claim the land in the name of the public and then make the usual profits privatising it there was a principle at stake they had to ensure their friends and not outsiders got the benefit the high court eventually gave the judgement to the public which really meant turning it over to some of the most rapacious borough councils in our history a decade or so earlier that charlie peace of elected bodies the westminster city council had tried to sell their old graveyards to new developers this current judgement allowed all councils at last to maximise their assets from what was after all dead land completely unable to pay for itself and therefore a natural target for privatization the feeding frenzy began it was the closest thing to mass cannibalism ive ever seen we had opened a fronter in old sweden street and had a couple of halfway presentable slags from bernies club taking the calls and answering enquiries we were straight up about it we called it the city bone exchange the bloke who decorated it and did the sign specialised in giving offices that longestablished look hed created most of those oldfashioned west end hotels youd never heard of until if its got a scottish name he used to say its one of mine americans love the skirl of the pipes but they trust a bit of brass and varnish best our place was almost all brass and varnish and it worked a treat the ritz and the savoy sent us their best potential buyers incredibly exclusive private hotels gave us taxiloads of blandfaced american boymen reeking of health and beauty products bellowing their credentials to the wind rich matrons eager for anyones approval massive germans with aggressive cackles stern orientals glaring at us daring us to cheat them they bought and they bought and they bought the snoopers kept on snooping but there wasnt really much to find out livingstone international took an aggressive interest in us for a while but what could they do we werent up to anything illegal just selling the stuff and nobody could identify what if anything had been nicked anyway i still had my misgivings they werent anything but superstitions really it did seem sometimes that for every layer of false antiquity for every act of disneyfication an inch or two of our real foundations crumbled you knew what happened when you did that to a house sooner or later you got trouble sooner or later you had no house we had more than our share of private detectives for a while they always pretended to be customers and they always looked wrong even to our girls livingstone international had definitely made a connection i think theyd found our mine and guessed what a windfall theyd lost they didnt seem at one with themselves over the matter they even made veiled threats there was some swagger come in to talk about violence but they were spotties whod got all their language off old nineties tv shows so we sweated it out and the girls took most of the heat those girls really didnt know anything they were magnificently ignorant they had tellies with chips which switch channels as soon as they detect a news or information programme ive always had a rule if youre caught by the same wave twice get out of the water while i didnt blame myself for not anticipating the great andrew lloyd webber slump i think i should have guessed what would happen next the tolerance of the public for bullshit had become decidedly and aggressively negative it was like the bone had set new standards of public aspiration as well as beauty my dad used to say that about the blitz classical music enjoyed a huge success during the second world war everybody grew up at once the bone had made it happen again it was a bit frightening to those of us who had always relied on a nice passive gullible greedy punter for an income the bitter fights which had developed over graveyard and bonefield rights and boundaries the eagerness with which some borough councils exploited their new resource the unseemly trade in what was after all human remains the corporate involvement the incredible profits the hypocrisies and politics around the bone brought us the outspoken disgust of europe we were used to that in fact we tended to cultivate it but that wasnt the problem the problem was that our own public had had enough when the elections came round the voters systematically booted out anyone who had supported the bone trade it was like the sudden rise of the antislavery vote in lincolns america they demanded an end to the commerce in london bone they got the boneshops closed down they got work on the bonefields stopped they got their graveyards and monuments protected and cleaned up they got a city which started cultivating peace and security as if it was a cash crop which maybe it was but it hurt me it was the end of my easy money of course ill admit i was glad it was stopping it felt like they were slowing entropy restoring the past the quality of life improved i began to think about letting a few rooms for company the mood of the country swung so far into disapproval of the bone trade that i almost began to fear for my life road and antiabortion activists switched their attention to bone merchants hampstead was full of screaming lefties convinced they owned the moral highground just because theyd paid off their enormous mortgages trudi after three months applied for a divorce arguing that she had not known my business when she married me she said she was disgusted she said id been living on bloodmoney the courts awarded her more than half of what id made but it didnt matter any more my investments were such that i couldnt stop earning economically i was a small oilproducing nation i had my own international dialling code it was horrible in a way unless i tried very hard it looked like i could never be ruined again there was no justice i met bernie in the king lyar in old sweden street a few doors down from our burned out office i told him what i planned to do and he shrugged we both knew it was dodgy he told me it was dodgy all along even when we thought it was mastodons what it feels like to me ray is it feels like a sort of a massive transformation of the zeitgeist you know like virginia woolf said about the day human nature changed something happens slowly and youre not aware of it everything seems normal then you wake up one morning and bingo its nazi germany or bolshevik russia or thatcherite england or the golden age and all the rules have changed maybe it was the bone that did it i said maybe it was a symbol everyone needed to rally round you know a focus maybe he said let me know when youre doing it ill give you a hand about a week later we got the van backed up to the warehouse loading bay it was three oclock in the morning and i was chilled to the marrow working in silence we transferred every scrap of bone to the van then we drove back to hampstead through a freezing rain i dont know why we did it the way we did it there would have been easier solutions i suppose but behind the high walls of my big back garden under the old trees and etiolated rhododendrons we dug a pit and filled it with the glowing remains of the ancient dead the stuff was almost phosphorescent as we chucked the big lumps of clay back on to it it glowed a rich amber and that faint rosemary smell came off it i can still smell it when i go in there to this day my soft fruit is out of this world the whole gardens doing wonderfully now in fact londons doing wonderfully we seem to be back on form theres still a bit of a bone trade of course but its marginal every so often im tempted to take a spade and turn over the earth again to look at the fortune im hiding there to look at the beauty of it the strange amber glow never fades and sometimes i think the decoration on the bone is an important message i should perhaps try to decipher im still a very rich man not justly so but there it is and of course im about as popular with the public as percy the paedophile gold the bone king i might as well be gold the grave robber i dont go down to soho much when i do make it to a show or something i try to disguise myself a bit i dont see anything of bernie any more and i heard two of the stoodies topped themselves i do my best to make amends im circulating my profits as fast as i can talents flooding into london from everywhere making a powerful mix they say they havent known a buzz like it since im a reliable investor in great new shows every year i back the iggy pop awards the most prestigious in the business but not everybody will take my money i am regularly reviled thats why some organisations receive anonymous donations they would refuse them if they knew they were from me ive had the extremes of good and bad luck riding this particular switch in the zeitgeist and the only time im happy is when i wake up in the morning and ive forgotten who i am it seems i share a common disgust for myself a few dubious customers however think i owe them something another bloke who used to be very rich before he made some frenetic investments after his career went down the drain called me the other day he knew of my interest in the theatre that i had invested in several west end hits he thought id be interested in his idea he wanted to revive his first success rebeccas incredibly far out well or something which he described as a powerful religious rock opera guaranteed to capture the new nostalgia market the times he told me they were achangin his show he continued was full of raw oldfashioned r b energy just the sort of authentic sound to attract the new nononsense youngsters wasnt it cool that madonna wanted to do the title role and bob geldof would play the spirit of the well rock and roll man its all in the staging man remember the boat in phantom i can make it look better than real on stage man that well is wet wet rock and roll i could see that little wizened fist punching the air in a parody of the vitality he craved and whose source had always eluded him i had to tell him it was a nonstarter id turned over a new leaf i said i was taking my ethics seriously these days i only deal in living talent
