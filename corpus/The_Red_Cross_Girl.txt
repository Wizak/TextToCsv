 the novels and stories of richard harding davis the red cross girl by richard harding davis with an introduction by gouverneur morris contents introduction by gouverneur morris the red cross girl the grand cross of the crescent the invasion of england blood will tell the sailorman the mind reader the naked man the boy who cried wolf the cardsharp introduction r h d and they rise to their feet as he passes gentlemen unafraid he was almost too good to be true in addition the gods loved him and so he had to die young some people think that a man of fiftytwo is middleaged but if r h d had lived to be a hundred he would never have grown old it is not generally known that the name of his other brother was peter pan within the year we have played at pirates together at the taking of sperm whales and we have ransacked the westchester hills for gunsites against the mexican invasion and we have made lists of guns and medicines and tinned things in case we should ever happen to go elephant shooting in africa but we werent going to hurt the elephants once r h d shot a hippopotamus and he was always ashamed and sorry i think he never killed anything else he wasnt that kind of a sportsman of hunting as of many other things he has said the last word do you remember the happy hunting ground in the bar sinister where nobody hunts us and there is nothing to hunt experienced persons tell us that a manhunt is the most exciting of all sports r h d hunted men in cuba he hunted for wounded men who were out in front of the trenches and still under fire and found some of them and brought them in the rough riders didnt make him an honorary member of their regiment just because he was charming and a faithful friend but largely because they were a lot of daredevils and he was another to hear him talk you wouldnt have thought that he had ever done a brave thing in his life he talked a great deal and he talked even better than he wrote at his best he wrote like an angel but i have dusted every corner of my memory and cannot recall any story of his in which he played a heroic or successful part always he was running at top speed or hiding behind a tree or lying face down in a foot of water for hours so as not to be seen always he was getting the worst of it but about the other fellows he told the whole truth with lightning flashes of wit and character building and admiration or contempt until the invention of moving pictures the world had nothing in the least like his talk his eye had photographed his mind had developed and prepared the slides his words sent the light through them and lo and behold they were reproduced on the screen of your own mind exact in drawing and color with the written word or the spoken word he was the greatest recorder and reporter of things that he had seen of any man perhaps that ever lived the history of the last thirty years its manners and customs and its leading events and inventions cannot be written truthfully without reference to the records which he has left to his special articles and to his letters read over again the queens jubilee the czars coronation the march of the germans through brussels and see for yourself if i speak too zealously even for a friend to whom now that r h d is dead the world can never be the same again but i did not set out to estimate his genius that matter will come in due time before the unerring tribunal of posterity one secret of mr roosevelts hold upon those who come into contact with him is his energy retaining enough for his own use he uses a good deal because every day he does the work of five or six men he distributes the inexhaustible remainder among those who most need it men go to him tired and discouraged he sends them away glad to be alive still gladder that he is alive and ready to fight the devil himself in a good cause upon his friends r h d had the same effect and it was not only in proximity that he could distribute energy but from afar by letter and cable he had some intuitive way of knowing just when you were slipping into a slough of laziness and discouragement and at such times he either appeared suddenly upon the scene or there came a boy on a bicycle with a yellow envelope and a book to sign or the postman in his buggy or the telephone rang and from the receiver there poured into you affection and encouragement but the great times of course were when he came in person and the temperature of the house which a moment before had been too hot or too cold became just right and a sense of cheerfulness and wellbeing invaded the hearts of the master and the mistress and of the servants in the house and in the yard and the older daughter ran to him and the baby who had been fretting because nobody would give her a doublebarrelled shotgun climbed upon his knee and forgot all about the disappointments of this uncompromising world he was touchingly sweet with children i think he was a little afraid of them he was afraid perhaps that they wouldnt find out how much he loved them but when they showed him that they trusted him and unsolicited climbed upon him and laid their cheeks against his then the loveliest expression came over his face and you knew that the great heart which the other day ceased to beat throbbed with an exquisite bliss akin to anguish one of the happiest days i remember was when i and mine received a telegram saying that he had a baby of his own and i thank god that little miss hope is too young to know what an appalling loss she has suffered perhaps he stayed to dine then perhaps the older daughter was allowed to sit up an extra halfhour so that she could wait on the table and though i say it that shouldnt she could do this beautifully with dignity and without giggling and perhaps the dinner was good or r h d thought it was and in that event he must abandon his place and storm the kitchen to tell the cook all about it perhaps the gardener was taking life easy on the kitchen porch he too came in for praise r h d had never seen our japanese iris so beautiful as for his they wouldnt grow at all it wasnt the iris it was the man behind the iris and then back he would come to us with a wonderful story of his adventures in the pantry on his way to the kitchen and leaving behind him a cook to whom there had been issued a new lease of life and a gardener who blushed and smiled in the darkness under the actinidia vines it was in our little house at aiken in south carolina that he was with us most and we learned to know him best and that he and i became dependent upon each other in many ways events into which i shall not go had made his life very difficult and complicated and he who had given so much friendship to so many people needed a little friendship in return and perhaps too he needed for a time to live in a house whose master and mistress loved each other and where there were children before he came that first year our house had no name now it is called lets pretend now the chimney in the livingroom draws but in those first days of the builtover house it didnt at least it didnt draw all the time but we pretended that it did and with much pretense came faith from the fireplace that smoked to the serious things of life we extended our pretendings until real troubles went down before them down and out it was one of aikens very best winters and the earliest spring i ever lived anywhere r h d came shortly after christmas the spireas were in bloom and the monthly roses you could always find a sweet violet or two somewhere in the yard here and there splotches of deep pink against gray cabin walls proved that precocious peachtrees were in bloom it never rained at night it was cold enough for fires in the middle of the day it was hot the wind never blew and every morning we had a four for tennis and every afternoon we rode in the woods and every night we sat in front of the fire that didnt smoke because of pretending and talked until the next morning he was one of those rarely gifted men who find their chiefest pleasure not in looking backward or forward but in what is going on at the moment weeks did not have to pass before it was forced upon his knowledge that tuesday the fourteenth let us say had been a good tuesday he knew it the moment he waked at a m and perceived the tuesday sunshine making patterns of bright light upon the floor the sunshine rejoiced him and the knowledge that even before breakfast there was vouchsafed to him a whole hour of life that day began with attentions to his physical wellbeing there were exercises conducted with great vigor and rejoicing followed by a tub artesian cold and a loud and joyous singing of ballads at fifty r h d might have posed to some praxiteles and copied in marble gone down the ages as statue of a young athlete he stood six feet and over straight as a sioux chief a noble and leonine head carried by a splendid torso his skin was as fine and clean as a childs he weighed nearly two hundred pounds and had no fat on him he was the weightthrowing rather than the running type of athlete but so tenaciously had he clung to the suppleness of his adolescent days that he could stand stifflegged and lay his hands flat upon the floor the singing over silence reigned but if you had listened at his door you must have heard a pen going swiftly and boldly he was hard at work doing unto others what others had done unto him you were a stranger to him some magazine had accepted a story that you had written and published it r h d had found something to like and admire in that story very little perhaps and it was his duty and pleasure to tell you so if he had liked the story very much he would send you instead of a note a telegram or it might be that you had drawn a picture or as a cub reporter had shown golden promise in a half column of unsigned print r h d would find you out and find time to praise you and help you so it was that when he emerged from his room at sharp eight oclock he was wideawake and happy and hungry and whistled and doubleshuffled with his feet out of excessive energy and carried in his hands a whole sheaf of notes and letters and telegrams breakfast with him was not the usual american breakfast a sullen dyspeptic gathering of persons who only the night before had rejoiced in each others society with him it was the time when the mind is or ought to be at its best the body at its freshest and hungriest discussions of the latest plays and novels the doings and undoings of statesmen laughter and sentiment to him at breakfast these things were as important as sausages and thick cream breakfast over there was no dawdling and putting off of the days work else how at eleven sharp could tennis be played with a free conscience loving as he did everything connected with a newspaper he would now pass by those on the halltable with never so much as a wistful glance and hurry to his workroom he wrote sitting down he wrote standing up and almost you may say he wrote walking up and down some people accustomed to the delicious ease and clarity of his style imagine that he wrote very easily he did and he didnt letters easy clear to the point and gorgeously human flowed from him without let or hindrance that masterpiece of corresponding the german march through brussels was probably written almost as fast as he could talk next to phillips brooks he was the fastest talker i ever heard but when it came to fiction he had no facility at all perhaps i should say that he held in contempt any facility that he may have had it was owing to his incomparable energy and joblike patience that he ever gave us any fiction at all every phrase in his fiction was of all the myriad phrases he could think of the fittest in his relentless judgment to survive phrases paragraphs pages whole stories even were written over and over again he worked upon a principle of elimination if he wished to describe an automobile turning in at a gate he made first a long and elaborate description from which there was omitted no detail which the most observant pair of eyes in christendom had ever noted with reference to just such a turning thereupon he would begin a process of omitting one by one those details which he had been at such pains to recall and after each omission he would ask himself does the picture remain if it did not he restored the detail which he had just omitted and experimented with the sacrifice of some other and so on and so on until after herculean labor there remained for the reader one of those swiftly flashed iceclear pictures complete in every detail with which his tales and romances are so delightfully and continuously adorned but it is quarter to eleven and this being a time of holiday r h d emerges from his workroom happy to think that he has placed one hundred and seven words between himself and the wolf who hangs about every writers door he isnt satisfied with those hundred and seven words he never was in the least satisfied with anything that he wrote but he has searched his mind and his conscience and he believes that under the circumstances they are the very best that he can do anyway they can stand in their present order until after lunch a sign of his youth was the fact that to the day of his death he had denied himself the luxury and slothfulness of habits i have never seen him smoke automatically as most men do he had too much respect for his own powers of enjoyment and for the sensibilities perhaps of the best havana tobacco at a time of his own deliberate choosing often after many hours of hankering and renunciation he smoked his cigar he smoked it with delight with a sense of being rewarded and he used all the smoke there was in it he dearly loved the best food the best champagne and the best scotch whiskey but these things were friends to him and not enemies he had toward food and drink the continental attitude namely that quality is far more important than quantity and he got his exhilaration from the fact that he was drinking champagne and not from the champagne perhaps i shall do well to say that on questions of right and wrong he had a will of iron all his life he moved resolutely in whichever direction his conscience pointed and although that ever present and never obtrusive conscience of his made mistakes of judgment now and then as must all consciences i think it can never once have tricked him into any action that was impure or unclean some critics maintain that the heroes and heroines of his books are impossibly pure and innocent young people r h d never called upon his characters for any trait of virtue or renunciation or selfmastery of which his own life could not furnish examples fortunately he did not have for his friends the same conscience that he had for himself his great gift of eyesight and observation failed him in his judgments upon his friends if only you loved him you could get your biggest failures of conduct somewhat more than forgiven without any trouble at all and of your molehill virtues he made splendid mountains he only interfered with you when he was afraid that you were going to hurt some one else whom he also loved once i had a telegram from him which urged me for heavens sake not to forget that the next day was my wifes birthday whether i had forgotten it or not is my own private affair and when i declared that i had read a story which i liked very very much and was going to write to the author to tell him so he always kept at me till the letter was written have i said that he had no habits every day when he was away from her he wrote a letter to his mother and no swift scrawl at that for no matter how crowded and eventful the day he wrote her the best letter that he could write that was the only habit he had he was a slave to it once i saw r h d greet his old mother after an absence they threw their arms about each other and rocked to and fro for a long time and it hadnt been a long absence at that no ocean had been between them her heart had not been in her mouth with the thought that he was under fire or about to become a victim of jungle fever he had only been away upon a little expedition a mere matter of digging for buried treasure we had found the treasure part of it a chipmunks skull and a broken arrowhead and r h d had been absent from his mother for nearly two hours and a half i set about this article with the knowledge that i must fail to give more than a few hints of what he was like there isnt much more space at my command and there were so many sides to him that to touch upon them all would fill a volume there were the patriotism and the americanism as much a part of him as the marrow of his bones and from which sprang all those brilliant headlong letters to the newspapers those trenchant assaults upon evildoers in public office those quixotic efforts to redress wrongs and those simple and dexterous exposures of this and that from an absolutely unexpected point of view he was a quickener of the public conscience that people are beginning to think tolerantly of preparedness that a nation which at one time looked yellow as a dandelion is beginning to turn red white and blue is owing in some measure to him r h d thought that war was unspeakably terrible he thought that peace at the price which our country has been forced to pay for it was infinitely worse and he was one of those who have gradually taught this country to see the matter in the same way i must come to a close now and i have hardly scratched the surface of my subject and that is a failure which i feel keenly but which was inevitable as r h d himself used to say of those deplorable personal interviews which appear in the newspapers and in which the important person interviewed is made by the cub reporter to say things which he never said or thought or dreamed of you cant expect a fifteendollaraweek brain to describe a thousanddollaraweek brain there is however one question which i should attempt to answer no two men are alike in what one salient thing did r h d differ from other men differ in his personal character and in the character of his work and that question i can answer offhand without taking thought and be sure that i am right an analysis of his works a study of that book which the recording angel keeps will show one dominant characteristic to which even his brilliancy his clarity of style his excellent mechanism as a writer are subordinate and to which as a man even his sense of duty his powers of affection of forgiveness of lovingkindness are subordinate too and that characteristic is cleanliness the biggest force for cleanliness that was in the world has gone out of the world gone to that happy hunting ground where nobody hunts us and there is nothing to hunt gouverneur morris chapter the red cross girl when spencer flagg laid the foundationstone for the new milliondollar wing he was adding to the flagg home for convalescents on the hills above greenwich the new york republic sent sam ward to cover the story and with him redding to take photographs it was a crisp beautiful day in october full of sunshine and the joy of living and from the great lawn in front of the home you could see half over connecticut and across the waters of the sound to oyster bay upon sam ward however the beauties of nature were wasted when the night previous he had been given the assignment he had sulked and he was still sulking only a year before he had graduated into new york from a small upstate college and a small upstate newspaper but already he was a star man and hewitt the city editor humored him whats the matter with the story asked the city editor with the speeches and lists of names it ought to run to two columns suppose it does exclaimed ward anybody can collect typewritten speeches and lists of names thats a messenger boys job wheres there any heartinterest in a wall street broker like flagg waving a silver trowel and singing see what a good boy am and a lot of grownup men in pinafores saying this stone is well and truly laid wheres the story in that when i was a reporter declared the city editor i used to be glad to get a day in the country because youd never lived in the country returned sam if youd wasted twentysix years in the backwoods as i did youd know that every minute you spend outside of new york youre robbing yourself of what demanded the city editor theres nothing to new york except cement iron girders noise and zinc garbage cans you never see the sun in new york you never see the moon unless you stand in the middle of the street and bend backward we never see flowers in new york except on the womens hats we never see the women except in cages in the elevators they spend their lives shooting up and down elevator shafts in department stores in apartment houses in office buildings and we never see children in new york because the janitors wont let the women who live in elevators have children dont talk to me new yorks a little nemo nightmare its a joke its an insult how curious said sam now i see why they took you off the street and made you a city editor i dont agree with anything you say especially are you wrong about the women they ought to be caged in elevators but theyre not instead they flash past you in the street they shine upon you from boxes in the theatre they frown at you from the tops of buses they smile at you from the cushions of a taxi across restaurant tables under red candle shades when you offer them a seat in the subway they are the only thing in new york that gives me any trouble the city editor sighed how young you are he exclaimed however tomorrow you will be free from your only trouble there will be few women at the celebration and they will be interested only in convalescents and you do not look like a convalescent sam ward sat at the outer edge of the crowd of overdressed females and overfed men and with a sardonic smile listened to flagg telling his assembled friends and sycophants how glad he was they were there to see him give away a million dollars arent you going to get his speech asked redding the staff photographer get his speech said sam they have pinkertons all over the grounds to see that you dont escape with less than three copies im waiting to hear the ritual they always have and then im going to sprint for the first train back to the centre of civilization theres going to be a fine lunch said redding and reporters are expected i asked the policeman if we were and he said we were sam rose shook his trousers into place stuck his stick under his armpit and smoothed his yellow gloves he was very thoughtful of his clothes and always treated them with courtesy you can have my share he said i cannot forget that i am fiftyfive minutes from broadway and even if i were starving i would rather have a club sandwich in new york than a thanksgiving turkey dinner in new rochelle he nodded and with eager athletic strides started toward the iron gates but he did not reach the iron gates for on the instant trouble barred his way trouble came to him wearing the blue cambric uniform of a nursing sister with a red cross on her arm with a white collar turned down white cuffs turned back and a tiny black velvet bonnet a bow of white lawn chucked her impudently under the chin she had hair like goldenrod and eyes as blue as flax and a complexion of such health and cleanliness and dewiness as blooms only on trained nurses she was so lovely that redding swung his hooded camera at her as swiftly as a cowboy could have covered her with his gun reporters become star reporters because they observe things that other people miss and because they do not let it appear that they have observed them when the great man who is being interviewed blurts out that which is indiscreet but most important the cub reporter says thats most interesting sir ill make a note of that and so warns the great man into silence but the star reporter receives the indiscreet utterance as though it bored him and the great man does not know he has blundered until he reads of it the next morning under screaming headlines other men on being suddenly confronted by sister anne which was the official title of the nursing sister would have fallen backward or swooned or gazed at her with soulful worshipping eyes or were they that sort of beast would have ogled her with impertinent approval now sam because he was a star reporter observed that the lady before him was the most beautiful young woman he had ever seen but no one would have guessed that he observed that least of all sister anne he stood in her way and lifted his hat and even looked into the eyes of blue as impersonally and as calmly as though she were his greataunt as though his heart was not beating so fast that it choked him i am from the republic he said everybody is so busy here today that im not able to get what i need about the home it seems a pity he added disappointedly because its so well done that people ought to know about it he frowned at the big hospital buildings it was apparent that the ignorance of the public concerning their excellence greatly annoyed him when again he looked at sister anne she was regarding him in alarm obviously she was upon the point of instant flight you are a reporter she said some people like to place themselves in the hands of a reporter because they hope he will print their names in black letters a few others only reporters know how few would as soon place themselves in the hands of a dentist a reporter from the republic repeated sam but why ask me demanded sister anne sam could see no reason for her question in extenuation and explanation he glanced at her uniform i thought you were at work here he said simply i beg your pardon he stepped aside as though he meant to leave her in giving that impression he was distinctly dishonest there was no other reason persisted sister anne i mean for speaking to me the reason for speaking to her was so obvious that sam wondered whether this could be the height of innocence or the most banal coquetry the hostile look in the eyes of the lady proved it could not be coquetry i am sorry said sam i mistook you for one of the nurses here and as you didnt seem busy i thought you might give me some statistics about the home not really statistics you know but local color sister anne returned his look with one as steady as his own apparently she was weighing his statement she seemed to disbelieve it inwardly he was asking himself what could be the dark secret in the past of this young woman that at the mere approach of a reporter even of such a nicelooking reporter as himself she should shake and shudder if thats what you really want to know said sister anne doubtfully ill try and help you but she added looking at him as one who issues an ultimatum you must not say anything about me sam knew that a woman of the selfadvertising cluborganizing class will always say that to a reporter at the time she gives him her card so that he can spell her name correctly but sam recognized that this young woman meant it besides what was there that he could write about her much as he might like to do so he could not begin his story with the flagg home for convalescents is also the home of the most beautiful of all living women no copy editor would let that get by him so as there was nothing to say that he would be allowed to say he promised to say nothing sister anne smiled and it seemed to sam that she smiled not because his promise had set her mind at ease but because the promise amused her sam wondered why sister anne fell into step beside him and led him through the wards of the hospital he found that it existed for and revolved entirely about one person he found that a million dollars and some acres of buildings containing sunrooms and hundreds of rigid white beds had been donated by spencer flagg only to provide a background for sister anne only to exhibit the depth of her charity the kindness of her heart the unselfishness of her nature do you really scrub the floors he demanded i mean you yourself down on your knees with a pail and water and scrubbing brush sister anne raised her beautiful eyebrows and laughed at him we do that when we first come here she said when we are probationers is there a newer way of scrubbing floors and these awful patients demanded sam do you wait on them do you have to submit to their complaints and whinings and ingratitude he glared at the unhappy convalescents as though by that glance he would annihilate them its not fair exclaimed sam its ridiculous id like to choke them thats not exactly the object of a home for convalescents said sister anne you know perfectly well what i mean said sam here are you if youll allow me to say so a magnificent splendid healthy young person wearing out your young life over a lot of lame ducks failures and cripples nor is that quite the way we look at said sister anne we demanded sam sister anne nodded toward a group of nurse im not the only nurse here she said there are over forty you are the only one here said sam who is not thats just what i mean i appreciate the work of a trained nurse i understand the ministering angel part of it but you im not talking about anybody else im talking about you you are too young somehow you are different you are not meant to wear yourself out fighting disease and sickness measuring beef broth and making beds sister anne laughed with delight i beg your pardon said sam stiffly no pardon me said sister anne but your ideas of the duties of a nurse are so quaint no matter what the duties are declared sam you should not be here sister anne shrugged her shoulders they were charming shoulders as delicate as the pinions of a bird one must live said sister anne they had passed through the last cold corridor between the last rows of rigid white cots and had come out into the sunshine below them stretched connecticut painted in autumn colors sister anne seated herself upon the marble railing of the terrace and looked down upon the flashing waters of the sound yes thats it she repeated softly one must live sam looked at her but finding that to do so made speech difficult looked hurriedly away he admitted to himself that it was one of those occasions only too frequent with him when his indignant sympathy was heightened by the fact that the woman was very fair he conceded that he was not going to pretend to himself that he was not prejudiced by the outrageous beauty of sister anne by the assault upon his feelings made by her uniform made by the appeal of her profession the gentlest and most gracious of all professions he was honestly disturbed that this young girl should devote her life to the service of selfish sick people if you do it because you must live then it can easily be arranged for there are other ways of earning a living the girl looked at him quickly but he was quite sincere and again she smiled now what would you suggest she asked you see she said i have no one to advise me no man of my own age i have no brothers to go to i have a father but it was his idea that i should come here and so i doubt if he would approve of my changing to any other work your own work must make you acquainted with many women who earn their own living maybe you could advise me sam did not at once answer he was calculating hastily how far his salary would go toward supporting a wife he was trying to remember which of the men in the office were married and whether they were those whose salaries were smaller than his own collins one of the copy editors he knew was very illpaid but sam also knew that collins was married because his wife used to wait for him in the office to take her to the theatre and often sam had thought she was extremely well dressed of course sister anne was so beautiful that what she might wear would be a matter of indifference but then women did not always look at it that way sam was so long considering offering sister anne a life position that his silence had become significant and to cover his real thoughts he said hurriedly take typewriting for instance that pays very well the hours are not difficult and manicuring suggested sister anne sam exclaimed in horror you he cried roughly for you quite impossible why for me said the girl in the distress at the thought sam was jabbing his stick into the gravel walk as though driving the manicuring idea into a deep grave he did not see that the girl was smiling at him mockingly you protested sam you in a barbers shop washing mens fingers who are not fit to wash the streets you walk on i good lord his vehemence was quite honest the girl ceased smiling sam was still jabbing at the gravel walk his profile toward her and unobserved she could study his face it was an attractive face strong clever almost illegally goodlooking it explained why as he had complained to the city editor his chief trouble in new york was with the women with his eyes full of concern sam turned to her abruptly how much do they give you a month forty dollars answered sister anne this is what hurts me about it said sam it is that you should have to work and wait on other people when there are so many strong hulking men who would count it gods blessing to work for you to wait on you and give their lives for you however probably you know that better than i do no i dont know that said sister anne sam recognized that it was quite absurd that it should be so but this statement gave him a sense of great elation a delightful thrill of relief there was every reason why the girl should not confide in a complete stranger even to deceive him was quite within her rights but though sam appreciated this he preferred to be deceived i think you are working too hard he said smiling happily i think you ought to have a change you ought to take a day off do they ever give you a day off next saturday said sister anne why because explained sam if you wont think it too presumptuous i was going to prescribe a day off for you a day entirely away from iodoform and white enamelled cots it is what you need a day in the city and a lunch where they have music and a matinee where you can laugh or cry if you like that better and then maybe some fresh air in the park in a taxi and after that dinner and more theatre and then ill see you safe on the train for greenwich before you answer he added hurriedly i want to explain that i contemplate taking a day off myself and doing all these things with you and that if you want to bring any of the other forty nurses along as a chaperon i hope you will only honestly i hope you wont the proposal apparently gave sister anne much pleasure she did not say so but her eyes shone and when she looked at sam she was almost laughing with happiness i think that would be quite delightful said sister anne quite delightful only it would be frightfully expensive even if i dont bring another girl which i certainly would not it would cost a great deal of money i think we might cut out the taxicab and walk in the park and feed the squirrels oh exclaimed sam in disappointment then you know central park sister annes eyes grew quite expressionless i once lived near there she said in harlem not exactly in harlem but near it i was quite young said sister anne since then i have always lived in the country or in other places sams heart was singing with pleasure its so kind of you to consent he cried indeed you are the kindest person in all the world i thought so when i saw you bending over these sick people and now i know it is you who are kind protested sister anne to take pity on me pity on you laughed sam you cant pity a person who can do more with a smile than old man flagg can do with all his millions now he demanded in happy anticipation where are we to meet thats it said sister anne where are we to meet let it be at the grand central station the day cant begin too soon said sam and before then telephone me what theatre and restaurants you want and ill reserve seats and tables oh exclaimed sam joyfully it will be a wonderful day a wonderful day sister anne looked at him curiously and so it seemed a little wistfully she held out her hand i must go back to my duties she said goodby not goodby said sam heartily only until saturday and my names sam ward and my address is the city room of the republic whats your name sister anne said the girl in the nursing order to which i belong we have no last names so asked sam ill call you sister anne no just sister said the girl sister repeated sam sister he breathed the word rather than spoke it and the way he said it and the way he looked when he said it made it carry almost the touch of a caress it was as if he had said sweetheart or beloved ill not forget said sam sister anne gave an impatient annoyed laugh nor i she said sam returned to new york in the smokingcar puffing feverishly at his cigar and glaring dreamily at the smoke he was living the day over again and in anticipation the day off still to come he rehearsed their next meeting at the station he considered whether or not he would meet her with a huge bunch of violets or would have it brought to her when they were at luncheon by the head waiter he decided the latter way would be more of a pleasant surprise he planned the luncheon it was to be the most marvellous repast he could evolve and lest there should be the slightest error he would have it prepared in advance and it should cost half his weeks salary the place where they were to dine he would leave to her because he had observed that women had strange ideas about clothes some of them thinking that certain clothes must go with certain restaurants some of them seemed to believe that instead of their conferring distinction upon the restaurant the restaurant conferred distinction upon them he was sure sister anne would not be so foolish but it might be that she must always wear her nurses uniform and that she would prefer not to be conspicuous so he decided that the choice of where they would dine he would leave to her he calculated that the whole day ought to cost about eighty dollars which as star reporter was what he was then earning each week that was little enough to give for a day that would be the birthday of his life no he contradicted the day he had first met her must always be the birthday of his life for never had he met one like her and he was sure there never would be one like her she was so entirely superior to all the others so fine so difficult in her manner there was something that rendered her unapproachable even her simple nurses gown was worn with a difference she might have been a princess in fancy dress and yet how humble she had been when he begged her to let him for one day personally conduct her over the great city you are so kind to take pity on me she had said he thought of many clever pretty speeches he might have made he was so annoyed he had not thought of them at the time that he kicked violently at the seat in front of him he wondered what her history might be he was sure it was full of beautiful courage and selfsacrifice it certainly was outrageous that one so glorious must work for her living and for such a paltry living forty dollars a month it was worth that merely to have her sit in the flat where one could look at her for already he had decided that when they were married they would live in a flat probably in one overlooking central park on central park west he knew of several attractive suites there at thirtyfive dollars a week or if she preferred the suburbs he would forsake his beloved new york and return to the country in his gratitude to her for being what she was he conceded even that sacrifice when he reached new york from the speculators he bought frontrow seats at five dollars for the two most popular plays in town he put them away carefully in his waistcoat pocket possession of them made him feel that already he had obtained an option on six hours of complete happiness after she left sam sister anne passed hurriedly through the hospital to the matrons room and wrapping herself in a raccoon coat made her way to a waiting motor car and said home to the chauffeur he drove her to the flagg family vault as flaggs envious millionaire neighbors called the pile of white marble that topped the highest hill above greenwich and which for years had served as a landfall to mariners on the sound there were a number of people at tea when she arrived and they greeted her noisily i have had a most splendid adventure said sister anne there were six of us you know dressed up as red cross nurses and we gave away programmes well one of the new york reporters thought i was a real nurse and interviewed me about the home of course i knew enough about it to keep it up and i kept it up so well that he was terribly sorry for me and one of the tea drinkers was little hollis holworthy who prided himself on knowing whos who in new york he had met sam ward at first nights and prize fights he laughed scornfully dont you believe it he interrupted that man who was talking to you was sam ward hes the smartest newspaper man in new york he was just leading you on do you suppose theres a reporter in america who wouldnt know you in the dark wait until you see the sunday paper sister anne exclaimed indignantly he did not know me she protested it quite upset him that i should be wasting my life measuring out medicines and making beds there was a shriek of disbelief and laughter i told him continued sister anne that i got forty dollars a month and he said i could make more as a typewriter and i said i preferred to be a manicurist oh anita protested the admiring chorus and he was most indignant he absolutely refused to allow me to be a manicurist and he asked me to take a day off with him and let him show me new york and he offered as attractions movingpicture shows and a drive on a fifth avenue bus and feeding peanuts to the animals in the park and if i insisted upon a chaperon i might bring one of the nurses were to meet at the sodawater fountain in the grand central station he said the day cannot begin too soon oh anita shrieked the chorus lord deptford who as the newspapers had repeatedly informed the american public had come to the flaggs countryplace to try to marry anita flagg was amused what an awfully jolly rag he cried and what are you going to do about it nothing said anita flagg the reporters have been making me ridiculous for the last three years now i have got back at one of them and she added thats all there is to that that night however when the house party was making toward bed sister anne stopped by the stairs and said to lord deptford i want to hear you call me sister call you what exclaimed the young man i will tell you he whispered what id like to call you you will not interrupted anita do as i tell you and say sister once say it as though you meant it but i dont mean it protested his lordship ive said already what i never mind what youve said already commanded miss flagg ive heard that from a lot of people say sister just once his lordship frowned in embarrassment sister he exclaimed it sounded like the pop of a cork anita flagg laughed unkindly and her beautiful shoulders shivered as though she were cold not a bit like it deptford she said goodnight later helen page who came to her room to ask her about a horse she was to ride in the morning found her ready for bed but standing by the open window looking out toward the great city to the south when she turned miss page saw something in her eyes that caused that young woman to shriek with amazement anita she exclaimed you crying what in heavens name can make you cry it was not a kind speech nor did miss flagg receive it kindly she turned upon the tactless intruder suppose cried anita fiercely a man thought you were worth forty dollars a month honestly didnt know honestly believed you were poor and worked for your living and still said your smile was worth more than all of old man flaggs millions not knowing they were your millions suppose he didnt ask any money of you but just to take care of you to slave for you only wanted to keep your pretty hands from working and your pretty eyes from seeing sickness and pain suppose you met that man among this rotten lot what would you do what wouldnt you do why anita exclaimed miss page what would you do demanded anita flagg this is what youd do youd go down on your knees to that man and say take me away take me away from them and pity me and be sorry for me and love me and love me and love me and why dont you cried helen page because im as rotten as the rest of them cried anita flagg because im a coward and thats why im crying havent i the right to cry at the exact moment miss flagg was proclaiming herself a moral coward in the local room of the republic collins the copy editor was editing sams story of the laying of the cornerstone the copy editors cigar was tilted near his left eyebrow his blue pencil like a guillotine ready to fall upon the guilty word or paragraph was suspended in midair and continually like a hawk preparing to strike the blue pencil swooped and circled but page after page fell softly to the desk and the blue pencil remained inactive as he read the voice of collins rose in muttered ejaculations and as he continued to read these explosions grew louder and more amazed at last he could endure no more and swinging swiftly in his revolving chair his glance swept the office in the name of mike he shouted what is this the reporters nearest him busy with pencil and typewriters frowned in impatient protest sam ward swinging his legs from the top of a table was gazing at the ceiling wrapped in dreams and tobacco smoke upon his clever cleancut features the expression was faraway and beatific he came back to earth whats what sam demanded at that moment elliott the managing editor was passing through the room his hands filled with freshly pulled proofs he swung toward collins quickly and snatched up sams copy the story already was late and it was important whats wrong he demanded over the room there fell a sudden hush read the opening paragraph protested collins its like that for a column its all about a girl about a red cross nurse not a word about flagg or lord deptford no speeches no news its not a news story at all its an editorial and an essay and a spring poem i dont know what it is and whats worse wailed the copy editor defiantly and to the amazement of all its so darned good that you cant touch it youve got to let it go or kill it the eyes of the managing editor masked by his green paper shade were racing over sams written words he thrust the first page back at collins is it all like that theres a column like that run it just as it is commanded the managing editor use it for your introduction and get your story from the flimsy and in your head cut out flagg entirely call it the red cross girl and play it up strong with pictures he turned on sam and eyed him curiously whats the idea ward he said this is a newspaper not a magazine the click of the typewriters was silent the hectic rush of the pencils had ceased and the staff expectant smiled cynically upon the star reporter sam shoved his hands into his trousers pockets and also smiled but unhappily i know its not news sir he said but thats the way i saw the story outside on the lawn the band playing and the governor and the governors staff and the clergy burning incense to flagg and inside this girl right on the job taking care of the sick and wounded it seemed to me that a million from a man that wont miss a million didnt stack up against what this girl was doing for these sick folks what i wanted to say continued sam stoutly was that the moving spirit of the hospital was not in the man who signed the checks but in these women who do the work the nurses like the one i wrote about the one you called the red cross girl collins strong through many years of faithful service backed by the traditions of the profession snorted scornfully but its not news its not news said elliott doubtfully but its the kind of story that made frank omalley famous its the kind of story that drives men out of this business into the arms of what kipling calls the illegitimate sister it seldom is granted to a man on the same day to give his whole heart to a girl and to be patted on the back by his managing editor and it was this combination and not the drinks he dispensed to the staff in return for its congratulations that sent sam home walking on air he loved his business he was proud of his business but never before had it served him so well it had enabled him to tell the woman he loved and incidentally a million other people how deeply he honored her how clearly he appreciated her power for good no one would know he meant sister anne save two people sister anne and himself but for her and for him that was as many as should know in his story he had used real incidents of the day he had described her as she passed through the wards of the hospital cheering and sympathetic he had told of the little acts of consideration that endeared her to the sick people the next morning she would know that it was she of whom he had written and between the lines she would read that the man who wrote them loved her so he fell asleep impatient for the morning in the hotel at which he lived the republic was always placed promptly outside his door and after many excursions into the hall he at last found it on the front page was his story the red cross girl it had the place of honor righthand column but more conspicuous than the headlines of his own story was one of reddings photographs it was the one he had taken of sister anne when first she had approached them in her uniform of mercy advancing across the lawn walking straight into the focus of the camera there was no mistaking her for any other living woman but beneath the picture in bold staring uncompromising type was a strange and grotesque legend daughter of millionaire flagg it read in a new role miss anita flagg as the red cross girl for a long time sam looked at the picture and then folding the paper so that the picture was hidden he walked to the open window from below broadway sent up a tumultuous greeting cable cars jangled taxis hooted and on the sidewalks on their way to work processions of shopgirls stepped out briskly it was the street and the city and the life he had found fascinating but now it jarred and affronted him a girl he knew had died had passed out of his life forever worse than that had never existed and yet the city went or just as though that made no difference or just as little difference as it would have made had sister anne really lived and really died at the same early hour an hour far too early for the rest of the house party anita flagg and helen page booted and ridinghabited sat alone at the breakfast table their tea before them and in the hands of anita flagg was the daily republic miss page had brought the paper to the table and with affected indignation at the impertinence of the press had pointed at the frontpage photograph but miss flagg was not looking at the photograph or drinking her tea or showing in her immediate surroundings any interest whatsoever instead her lovely eyes were fastened with fascination upon the column under the heading the red cross girl and as she read the lovely eyes lost all trace of recent slumber her lovely lips parted breathlessly and on her lovely cheeks the color flowed and faded and glowed and bloomed when she had read as far as a paragraph beginning when sister anne walked between them those who suffered raised their eyes to hers as flowers lift their faces to the rain she dropped the paper and started for telephone any man cried she to the mutual discomfort of helen page and the servants who thinks im like that mustnt get away im not like that and i know it but if he thinks so thats all i want and maybe i might be like that if any man would help she gave her attention to the telephone and information she demanded to be instantly put into communication with the daily republic and mr sam ward she turned again upon helen page im tired of being called a good sport she protested by men who arent half so good sports as i am im tired of being talked to about money as though i were a stockbroker this mans got a head on his shoulders and hes got the shoulders too and hes got a darned goodlooking head and he thinks im a ministering angel and a saint and he put me up on a pedestal and made me dizzy and i like being made dizzy and im for him and im going after him be still implored helen page any one might think you meant it she nodded violently at the discreet backs of the menservants ye gods parker cried anita flagg does it take three of you to pour a cup of tea get out of here and tell everybody that you all three caught me in the act of proposing to an american gentleman over the telephone and that the betting is even that ill make him marry me the faithful and sorely tried domestics fled toward the door and whats more anita hurled after them get your bets down quick for after i meet him the odds will be a hundred to one had the republic been an afternoon paper sam might have been at the office and might have gone to the telephone and things might have happened differently but as the republic was a morning paper the only person in the office was the lady who scrubbed the floors and she refused to go near the telephone so anita flagg said ill call him up later and went happily on her ride with her heart warm with love for all the beautiful world but later it was too late to keep himself fit sam ward always walked to the office on this particular morning hollis holworthy was walking uptown and they met opposite the cathedral youre the very man i want said hollworthy joyously youve got to decide a bet he turned and fell into step with sam its one i made last night with anita flagg she thinks you didnt know who she was yesterday and i said that was ridiculous of course you knew i bet her a theatre party to sam it seemed hardly fair that so soon before his fresh wound had even been dressed it should be torn open by impertinent fingers but he had no right to take offense how could the man or any one else know what sister anne had meant to him im afraid you lose he said he halted to give holworthy the hint to leave him but holworthy had no such intention you dont say so exclaimed that young man fancy one of you chaps being taken in like that i thought you were taking her in getting up a story for the sunday supplement sam shook his head nodded and again moved on but he was not yet to escape and instead of your fooling her exclaimed holworthy incredulously she was having fun with you with difficulty sam smiled so it would seem he said she certainly made an awfully funny story of it exclaimed holworthy admiringly i thought she was making it up she must have made some of it up she said you asked her to take a day off in new york that isnt so is it yes thats so by jove cried holworthy and that you invited her to see the movingpicture shows sam conscious of the dearly bought front row seats in his pocket smiled pleasantly did she say i said that or you he asked she did well then i must have said it holworthy roared with amusement and that you invited her to feed peanuts to the monkeys at the zoo sam avoided the little mans prying eyes yes i said that too and i thought she was making it up exclaimed holworthy we did laugh you must see the fun of it yourself lest sam should fail to do so he proceeded to elaborate you must see the fun in a man trying to make a date with anita flagg just as if she were nobody i dont think said sam that was my idea he waved his stick at a passing taxi im late he said he abandoned hollis on the sidewalk chuckling and grinning with delight and unconscious of the mischief he had made an hour later at the office when sam was waiting for an assignment the telephone boy hurried to him his eyes lit with excitement youre wanted on the phone he commanded his voice dropped to an awed whisper miss anita flagg wants to speak to you the blood ran leaping to sams heart and face then he remembered that this was not sister anne who wanted to speak to him but a woman he had never met say you cant find me he directed the boy gasped fled and returned precipitately the lady says she wants your telephone number says she must have it tell her you dont know it tell her its against the rules and hang up ten minutes later the telephone boy in the strictest confidence had informed every member of the local staff that anita flagg the rich the beautiful the daring the original of the red cross story of that morning had twice called up sam ward and by that young man had been thrown down and thrown hard that night elliott the managing editor sent for sam and when sam entered his office he found also there walsh the foreign editor with whom he was acquainted only by sight elliott introduced them and told sam to be seated ward he began abruptly im sorry to lose you but youve got to go its on account of that story of this morning sam made no sign but he was deeply hurt from a paper he had served so loyally this seemed scurvy treatment it struck him also that considering the spirit in which the story had been written it was causing him more kinds of trouble than was quite fair the loss of position did not disturb him in the last month too many managing editors had tried to steal him from the republic for him to feel anxious as to the future so he accepted his dismissal calmly and could say without resentment last night i thought you liked the story sir i did returned elliott i liked it so much that im sending you to a bigger place where you can get bigger stories we want you to act as our special correspondent in london mr walsh will explain the work and if youll go youll sail next wednesday after his talk with the foreign editor sam again walked home on air he could not believe it was real that it was actually to him it had happened for hereafter he was to witness the march of great events to come in contact with men of international interests instead of reporting what was of concern only from the battery to fortyseventh street he would now tell new york what was of interest in europe and the british empire and so to the whole world there was one drawback only to his happiness there was no one with whom he might divide it he wanted to celebrate his good fortune he wanted to share it with some one who would understand how much it meant to him who would really care had sister anne lived she would have understood and he would have laid himself and his new position at her feet and begged her to accept them begged her to run away with him to this tremendous and terrifying capital of the world and start the new life together among all the women he knew there was none to take her place certainly anita flagg could not take her place not because she was rich not because she had jeered at him and made him a laughingstock not because his admiration and he blushed when he remembered how openly how ingenuously he had shown it to her meant nothing but because the girl he thought she was the girl he had made dreams about and wanted to marry without a moments notice would have seen that what he offered ridiculous as it was when offered to anita flagg was not ridiculous when offered sincerely to a tired nerveworn overworked nurse in a hospital it was because anita flagg had not seen that that she could not now make up to him for the girl he had lost even though she herself had inspired that girl and for a day given her existence had he known it the anita flagg of his imagining was just as unlike and as unfair to the real girl as it was possible for two people to be his anita flagg he had created out of the things he had read of her in impertinent sunday supplements and from the impression he had been given of her by the little ass holworthy she was not at all like that ever since she had come of age she had been beset by sycophants and flatterers both old and young both men and girls and by men who wanted her money and by men who wanted her and it was because she got the motives of the latter two confused that she was so often hurt and said sharp bitter things that made her appear hard and heartless as a matter of fact in approaching her in the belief that he was addressing an entirely different person sam had got nearer to the real anita flagg than had any other man and so when on arriving at the office the next morning which was a friday he received a telegram reading arriving tomorrow ninethirty from greenwich the day cannot begin too soon dont forget you promised to meet me anita flagg he was able to reply extremely sorry but promise made to a different person who unfortunately has since died when anita flagg read this telegram there leaped to her lovely eyes tears that sprang from selfpity and wounded feelings she turned miserably appealingly to helen page but why does he do it to me her tone was that of the bewildered child who has struck her head against the table and from the naughty table without cause or provocation has received the devil of a bump before miss page could venture upon an explanation anita flagg had changed into a very angry young woman and whats more she announced he cant do it to me she sent her telegram back again as it was word for word but this time it was signed sister anne in an hour the answer came sister anne is the person to whom i refer she is dead sam was not altogether at ease at the outcome of his adventure it was not in his nature to be rude certainly not to a woman especially not to the most beautiful woman he had ever seen for whether her name was anita or anne about her beauty there could be no argument but he assured himself that he had acted within his rights a girl who could see in a wellmeant offer to be kind only a subject for ridicule was of no interest to him nor did her telegrams insisting upon continuing their acquaintance flatter him as he read them they showed only that she looked upon him as one entirely out of her world as one with whom she could do an unconventional thing and make a good story about it later knowing that it would be accepted as one of her amusing caprices he was determined he would not lend himself to any such performance and besides he no longer was a footloose happygolucky reporter he no longer need seek for experiences and material to turn into copy he was now a man with a responsible position one who soon would be conferring with cabinet ministers and putting ambassadors at their ease he wondered if a beautiful heiress whose hand was sought in marriage by the nobility of england would understand the importance of a london correspondent he hoped someone would tell her he liked to think of her as being considerably impressed and a little unhappy saturday night he went to the theatre for which he had purchased tickets and he went alone for the place that sister anne was to have occupied could not be filled by any other person it would have been sacrilege at least so it pleased him to pretend and all through dinner which he ate alone at the same restaurant to which he had intended taking her he continued to pretend she was with him and at the theatre where there was going forward the most popular of all musical comedies the seat next to him which to the audience appeared wastefully empty was to him filled with her gracious presence that sister anne was not there that the pretty romance he had woven about her had ended in disaster filled him with real regret he was glad he was leaving new york he was glad he was going where nothing would remind him of her and then he glanced up and looked straight into her eyes he was seated in the front row directly on the aisle the seat sister anne was supposed to be occupying was on his right and a few seats farther to his right rose the stage box and in the stage box and in the stage box almost upon the stage and with the glow of the footlights full in her face was anita flagg smiling delightedly down on him there were others with her he had a confused impression of bulging shirtfronts and shining silks and diamonds and drooping plumes upon enormous hats he thought he recognized lord deptford and holworthy but the only person he distinguished clearly was anita flagg the girl was all in black velvet which was drawn to her figure like a wet bathing suit round her throat was a single string of pearls and on her hair of goldenrod was a great hat of black velvet shaped like a bell with the curving lips of a lily and from beneath its brim anita flagg sitting rigidly erect with her whitegloved hands resting lightly on her knee was gazing down at him smiling with pleasure with surprise with excitement when she saw that in spite of her altered appearance he recognized her she bowed so violently and bent her head so eagerly that above her the ostrich plumes dipped and courtesied like wheat in a storm but sam neither bowed nor courtesied instead he turned his head slowly over his left shoulder as though he thought she was speaking not to him but some one beyond him across the aisle and then his eyes returned to the stage and did not again look toward her it was not the cut direct but it was a cut that hurt and in their turn the eyes of miss flagg quickly sought the stage at the moment the people in the audience happened to be laughing and she forced a smile and then laughed with them out of the corner of his eye sam could not help seeing her profile exposed pitilessly in the glow of the footlights saw her lips tremble like those of a child about to cry and then saw the forced hard smile and heard her laugh lightly and mechanically thats all she cares he told himself it seemed to him that in all he heard of her in everything she did she kept robbing him still further of all that was dear to him in sister anne for five minutes conscious of the footlights miss flagg maintained upon her lovely face a fixed and intent expression and then slowly and unobtrusively drew back to a seat in the rear of the box in the darkest recesses she found holworthy shut off from a view of the stage by a barrier of womens hats your friend mr ward she began abruptly in a whisper is the rudest most illbred person i ever met when i talked to him the other day i thought he was nice he was nice but he has behaved abominably like a boor like a sulky child has he no sense of humor because i played a joke on him is that any reason why he should hurt me hurt you exclaimed little holworthy in amazement dont be ridiculous how could he hurt you why should you care how rude he is wards a clever fellow but he fancies himself hes conceited hes too goodlooking and a lot of silly women have made such a fuss over him so when one of them laughs at him he cant understand it thats the trouble i could see that when i was telling him telling him repeated miss flagg telling him what about what a funny story you made of it explained holworthy about his having the nerve to ask you to feed the monkeys and to lunch with him miss flagg interrupted with a gasping intake of her breath oh she said softly soso you told him that did you and what else did you tell him only what you told us that he said the day could not begin too soon that he said he wouldnt let you be a manicure and wash the hands of men who werent fit to wash the streets you walked on there was a pause did i tell you he said that breathed anita flagg you know you did said holworthy there was another pause i must have been mad said the girl there was a longer pause and holworthy shifted uneasily im afraid you are angry he ventured angry exclaimed miss flagg i should say i was angry but not with you im very much pleased with you at the end of the act im going to let you take me out into the lobby with his arms tightly folded sam sat staring unhappily at the stage and seeing nothing he was sorry for himself because anita flagg had destroyed his ideal of a sweet and noble woman and he was sorry for miss flagg because a man had been rude to her that he happened to be that man did not make his sorrow and indignation the less intense and indeed so miserable was he and so miserable were his looks that his friends on the stage considered sending him a note offering if he would take himself out of the front row to give him back his money at the box office sam certainly wished to take himself away but he did not want to admit that he was miserable that he had behaved ill that the presence of anita flagg could spoil his evening could in the slightest degree affect him so he sat completely wretched feeling that he was in a false position that if he were it was his own fault that he had acted like an ass and a brute it was not a cheerful feeling when the curtain fell he still remained seated he knew before the second act there was an interminable wait but he did not want to chance running into holworthy in the lobby and he told himself it would be rude to abandon sister anne but he now was not so conscious of the imaginary sister anne as of the actual box party on his near right who were laughing and chattering volubly he wondered whether they laughed at him whether miss flagg were again entertaining them at his expense again making his advances appear ridiculous he was so sure of it that he flushed indignantly he was glad he had been rude and then at his elbow there was the rustle of silk and a beautiful figure all in black velvet towered above him then crowded past him and sank into the empty seat at his side he was too startled to speak and miss anita flagg seemed to understand that and to wish to give him time for without regarding him in the least and as though to establish the fact that she had come to stay she began calmly and deliberately to remove the belllike hat this accomplished she bent toward him her eyes looking straight into his her smile reproaching him in the familiar tone of an old and dear friend she said to him gently this is the day you planned for me dont you think youve wasted quite enough of it sam looked back into the eyes and saw in them no trace of laughter or of mockery but instead gentle reproof and appeal and something else that in turn begged of him to be gentle for a moment too disturbed to speak he looked at her miserably remorsefully its not anita flagg at all he said its sister anne come back to life again the girl shook her head no its anita flagg im not a bit like the girl you thought you met and i did say all the things holworthy told you i said but that was before i understood before i read what you wrote about sister anne about the kind of me you thought youd met when i read that i knew what sort of a man you were i knew you had been really kind and gentle and i knew you had dug out something that i did not know was there that no one else had found and i remembered how you called me sister i mean the way you said it and i wanted to hear it again i wanted you to say it she lifted her face to his she was very near him so near that her shoulder brushed against his arm in the box above them her friends scandalized and amused were watching her with the greatest interest half of the people in the now halfempty house were watching them with the greatest interest to them between reading advertisements on the programme and watching anita flagg making desperate love to a lucky youth in the front row there was no question of which to choose the young people in the front row did not know they were observed they were alone as much alone as though they were seated in a biplane sweeping above the clouds say it again prompted anita flagg sister i will not returned the young man firmly but ill say this he whispered ill say youre the most wonderful the most beautiful and the finest woman who has ever lived anita flaggs eyes left his quickly and with her head bent she stared at the bass drum in the orchestra i dont know she said but that sounds just as good when the curtain was about to rise she told him to take her back to her box so that he could meet her friends and go on with them to supper but when they reached the rear of the house she halted we can see this act she said or my cars in front of the theatre we might go to the park and take a turn or two or three which would you prefer dont make me laugh said sam as they sat all together at supper with those of the box party but paying no attention to them whatsoever anita flagg sighed contentedly theres only one thing she said to sam that is making me unhappy and because it is such sad news i havent told you it is this i am leaving america i am going to spend the winter in london i sail next wednesday my business is to gather news said sam but in all my life i never gathered such good news as that good news exclaimed anita because explained sam i am leaving america am spending the winter in england i am sailing on wednesday no i also am unhappy but that is not what makes me unhappy tell me begged anita some day said sam the day he chose to tell her was the first day they were at sea as they leaned upon the rail watching fire island disappear this is my unhappiness said sam and he pointed to a name on the passenger list it was the earl of deptford and valet and because he is on board anita flagg gazed with interest at a pursuing seagull he is not on board she said he changed to another boat sam felt that by a word from her a great weight might be lifted from his soul he looked at her appealingly hungrily why did he change he begged anita flagg shook her head in wonder she smiled at him with amused despair is that all that is worrying you she said chapter the grand cross of the crescent of some college students it has been said that in order to pass their examinations they will deceive and cheat their kind professors this may or may not be true one only can shudder and pass hurriedly on but whatever others may have done when young peter hallowell in his senior year came up for those final examinations which should he pass them even by a nose would gain him his degree he did not cheat he may have been too honest too confident too lazy but peter did not cheat it was the professors who cheated at stillwater college on each subject on which you are examined you can score a possible hundred that means perfection and in the brief history of stillwater which is a very new college only one man has attained it after graduating he accepted a position in an asylum for the insane from which he was promoted later to the poorhouse where he died many stillwater undergraduates studied his career and lest they also should attain perfection were afraid to study anything else among these peter was by far the most afraid the marking system at stillwater is as follows if in all the subjects in which you have been examined your marks added together give you an average of ninety you are passed with honors if of seventyfive you pass with distinction if of fifty you just pass it is not unlike the grocers nice adjustment of fresh eggs good eggs and eggs the whole college knew that if peter got in among the eggs he would be lucky but the professors and instructors of stillwater were determined that no matter what young hallowell might do to prevent it they would see that he passed his examinations and they constituted the jury of awards their interest in peter was not because they loved him so much but because each loved his own vinecovered cottage his salary and his dignified title the more and each knew that that one of the faculty who dared to flunk the son of old man hallowell who had endowed stillwater who supported stillwater and who might be expected to go on supporting stillwater indefinitely might also at the same time hand in his official resignation chancellor black the head of stillwater was an uptodate college president if he did not actually run after money he went where money was and it was not his habit to be downright rude to those who possessed it and if any threethousanddollarayear professor through a too strict respect for stillwaters standards of learning should lose to that institution a halfmilliondollar observatory swimmingpool or gymnasium he was the sort of college president who would see to it that the college lost also the services of that too conscientious instructor he did not put this in writing or in words but just before the june examinations when on the campus he met one of the faculty he would inquire with kindly interest as to the standing of young hallowell that is too bad he would exclaim but more in sorrow than in anger still i hope the boy can pull through he is his dear fathers pride and his fathers heart is set upon his sons obtaining his degree let us hope he will pull through for four years every professor had been pulling peter through and the conscience of each had become calloused they had only once more to shove him through and they would be free of him forever and so although they did not conspire together each knew that of the firing squad that was to aim its rifles at peter his rifle would hold the blank cartridge the only one of them who did not know this was doctor henry gilman doctor gilman was the professor of ancient and modern history at stillwater and greatly respected and loved he also was the author of those wellknown textbooks the founders of islam and the rise and fall of the turkish empire this latter work in five volumes had been not unfavorably compared to gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire the original newspaper comment dated some thirty years back the doctor had preserved and would produce it now somewhat frayed and worn and read it to visitors he knew it by heart but to him it always possessed a contemporary and news interest here is a review of the history he would say he always referred to it as the history that i came across in my transcript in the eyes of doctor gilman thirty years was so brief a period that it was as though the clipping had been printed the previous afternoon the members of his class who were examined on the rise and fall and who invariably came to grief over it referred to it briefly as the fall sometimes feelingly as the fall the history began when constantinople was byzantium skipped lightly over six centuries to constantine and in the last two volumes finished up the mohammeds with the downfall of the fourth one and the coming of suleiman since suleiman doctor gilman did not recognize turkey as being on the map when his history said the turkish empire had fallen then the turkish empire fell once chancellor black suggested that he add a sixth volume that would cover the last three centuries in a history of turkey issued as a textbook said the chancellor i think the russianturkish war should be included doctor gilman from behind his goldrimmed spectacles gazed at him in mild reproach the war in the crimea he exclaimed why i was alive at the time i know about it that is not history accordingly it followed that to a man who since the seventeenth century knew of no event of interest cyrus hallowell of the meatpackers trust was not an imposing figure and such a man the son of cyrus hallowell was but an ignorant young savage to whom the history certainly had been a closed book and so when peter returned his examination paper in a condition almost as spotless as that in which he had received it doctor gilman carefully and conscientiously with malice toward none and with no thought of the morrow marked five each of the other professors and instructors had marked peter fifty in their fear of chancellor black they dared not give the boy less but they refused to be slaves to the extent of crediting him with a single point higher than was necessary to pass him but doctor gilmans five completely knocked out the required average of fifty and young peter was found and could not graduate it was an awful business the only son of the only hallowell refused a degree in his fathers own private college the son of the man who had built the hallowell memorial the new laboratory the anna hallowell chapel the hallowell dormitory and the hallowell athletic field when on the bulletin board of the dim hall of the memorial to his departed grandfather peter read of his own disgrace and downfall the light the stainedglass window cast upon his nose was of no sicklier a green than was the nose itself not that peter wanted an am or an ab not that he desired laurels he had not won but because the young man was afraid of his father and he had cause to be father arrived at stillwater the next morning the interviews that followed made stillwater history my son is not an ass is what hallowell senior is said to have said to doctor black and if in four years you and your faculty cannot give him the rudiments of an education i will send him to a college that can and ill send my money where i send peter in reply chancellor black could have said that it was the fault of the son and not of the college he could have said that where three men had failed to graduate one hundred and eighty had not but did he say that oh no he did not say that he was not that sort of a college president instead he remained calm and sympathetic and like a conspirator in a comic opera glanced apprehensively round his study he lowered his voice there has been contemptible work here he whispered spite and a mean spirit of reprisal i have been making a secret investigation and i find that this blow at your son and you and at the good name of our college was struck by one man a man with a grievance doctor gilman doctor gilman has repeatedly desired me to raise his salary this did not happen to be true but in such a crisis dotor black could not afford to be too particular i have seen no reason for raising his salary and there you have the explanation in revenge he has made this attack but he overshot his mark in causing us temporary embarrassment he has brought about his own downfall i have already asked for his resignation every day in the week hallowell was a fair sane man but on this particular day he was wounded his spirit was hurt his selfesteem humiliated he was in a state of mind to believe anything rather than that his son was an idiot i dont want the man discharged he protested just because peter is lazy but if doctor gilman was moved by personal considerations if he sacrificed my peter in order to get even that exclaimed black in a horrified whisper is exactly what he did your generosity to the college is well known you are recognized all over america as its patron and he believed that when i refused him an increase in salary it was really you who refused it and he struck at you through your son everybody thinks so the college is on fire with indignation and look at the mark he gave peter five that in itself shows the malice five is not a mark it is an insult no one certainly not your brilliant son look how brilliantly he managed the gleeclub and football tour is stupid enough to deserve five no doctor gilman went too far and he has been justly punished what hallowell senior was willing to believe of what the chancellor told him and his opinion of the matter as expressed to peter differed materially they tell me he concluded that in the fall they will give you another examination and if you pass then you will get your degree no one will know youve got it theyll slip it to you out of the sidedoor like a cold potato to a tramp the only thing people will know is that when your classmates stood up and got their parchments the thing theyd been working for four years the only reason for their going to college at all you were not among those present thats your fault but if you dont get your degree next fall that will be my fault ive supported you through college and youve failed to deliver the goods now you deliver them next fall or you can support yourself that will be all right said peter humbly ill pass next fall im going to make sure of that said hallowell senior tomorrow you will take those history books that you did not open especially gilmans rise and fall which it seems you have not even purchased and you will travel for the entire summer with a private tutor peter who had personally conducted the football and baseball teams over half of the middle states and daily bullied and browbeat them protested with indignation wont travel with a private tutor if i say so returned hallowell senior grimly youll travel with a governess and a trained nurse and wear a strait jacket and youll continue to wear it until you can recite the history of turkey backward and in order that you may know it backward and forward you will spend this summer in turkey in constantinople until i send you permission to come home constantinople yelled peter in august are you serious do i look it asked peters father he did in constantinople explained mr hallowell senior there will be nothing to distract you from your studies and in spite of yourself every minute you will be imbibing history and local color ill be imbibing fever returned peter and sunstroke and sudden death if you want to get rid of me why dont you send me to the island where they sent dreyfus its quicker you dont have to go to turkey to study about turkey you do said his father peter did not wait for the festivities of commencement week all day he hid in his room packing his belongings or giving them away to e members of his class who came to tell him what a rotten shame it was and to bid him goodby they loved peter for himself alone and at losing him were loyally enraged they sired publicly to express their sentiments and to that end they planned a mock trial of the rise and fall at which a packed jury would sentence it to cremation they planned also to hang doctor gilman in effigy the effigy with a rope round its neck was even then awaiting mob violence it was complete to the silverwhite beard and the gold spectacles but peter squashed both demonstrations he did not know doctor gilman had been forced to resign but he protested that the horseplay of his friends would make him appear a bad loser it would look boys he said as though i couldnt take my medicine looks like kicking against the umpires decision old gilman fought fair he gave me just what was coming to me i think a darn sight more of him than do of that bunch of bootlickers that had the colossal nerve to pretend i scored fifty doctor gilman sat in his cottage that stood the edge of the campus gazing at a plaster bust of socrates which he did not see since that morning he had ceased to sit in the chair of history at stillwater college they were retrenching the chancellor had told him curtly cutting down unnecessary expenses for even in his anger doctor black was too intelligent to hint at his real motive and the professor was far too innocent of evil far too detached from college politics to suspect he would remain a professor emeritus on half pay but he no longer would teach the college he had served for thirty yearssince it consisted of two brick buildings and a faculty of ten young men no longer needed him even his ivycovered cottage in which his wife and he had lived for twenty years in which their one child had died would at the beginning of the next term be required of him but the college would allow him those six months in which to look round so just outside the circle of light from his student lamp he sat in his study and stared with unseeing eyes at the bust of socrates he was not considering ways and means they must be faced later he was considering how he could possibly break the blow to his wife what eviction from that house would mean to her no one but he understood since the day their little girl had died nothing in the room that had been her playroom bedroom and nursery had been altered nothing had been touched to his wife somewhere in the house that wonderful godgiven child was still with them not as a memory but as a real and living presence when at night the professor and his wife sat at either end of the study table reading by the same lamp he would see her suddenly lift her head alert and eager as though from the nursery floor a step had sounded as though from the darkness a sleepy voice had called her and when they would be forced to move to lodgings in the town to some students boardinghouse though they could take with them their books their furniture their mutual love and comradeship they must leave behind them the haunting presence of the child the colored pictures she had cut from the christmas numbers and plastered over the nursery walls the rambler roses that with her own hands she had planted and that now climbed to her window and each summer peered into her empty room outside doctor gilmans cottage among the trees of the campus paper lanterns like oranges aglow were swaying in the evening breeze in front of hallowell the flame of a bonfire shot to the top of the tallest elms and gathered in a circle round it the glee club sang and cheer succeeded cheercheers for the heroes of the cinder track for the heroes of the diamond and the gridiron cheers for the men who had flunked especially for one man who had flunked but for that man who for thirty years in the class room had served the college there were no cheers no one remembered him except the one student who had best reason to remember him but this recollection peter had no rancor or bitterness and still anxious lest he should be considered a bad loser he wished doctor gilman a every one else to know that so when the celebration was at its height and just before train was due to carry him from stillwater ran across the campus to the gilman cottage say goodby but he did not enter the cottage he went so far only as halfway up the garden walk in the window of the study which opened upon the veranda he saw through frame of honeysuckles the professor and wife standing beside the study table they were clinging to each other the woman weep silently with her cheek on his shoulder thin delicate wellbred hands clasping arms while the man comforted her awkward unhappily with hopeless futile caresses peter shocked and miserable at what he had seen backed steadily away what disaster had befallen the old couple he could not imagine the idea that he himself might in any way connected with their grief never entered mind he was certain only that whatever the trouble was it was something so intimate and personal that no mere outsider might dare to offer his sympathy so on tiptoe he retreated down the garden walk and avoiding the celebration at the bonfire returned to his rooms an hour later the entire college escorted him to the railroad station and with hes a jolly good fellow and hes off to philippopolis in the morn ing ringing in his ears he sank back his seat in the smokingcar and gazed at the lights of stillwater disappearing out of his life and he was surprised to find that what lingered his mind was not the students dancing like indians round the bonfire or at the steps of the smokingcar fighting to shake his hand but the man and woman alone in the cottage stricken with sudden sorrow standing like two children lost in the streets who cling to each other for comfort and at the same moment whisper words of courage two months later at constantinople peter was suffering from remorse over neglected opportunities from prickly heat and from fleas and it not been for the movingpicture man and the poker and baccarat at the cercle oriental he would have flung himself into the bosphorus in the mornings with the tutor he read ancient history which he promptly forgot and for the rest of the hot dreary day with the movingpicture man through the bazaars and along the waterfront he stalked suspects for the camera the name of the movingpicture man was harry stetson he had been a newspaper reporter a pressagent and an actor in vaudeville and in a movingpicture company now on his own account he was preparing an illustrated lecture on the east adapted to churches and sundayschools peter and he wrote it in collaboration and in the evenings rehearsed it with lantern slides before an audience of the hotel clerk the tutor and the german soldier of fortune who was trying to sell the young turks very old battleships every other foreigner had fled the city and the entire diplomatic corps had removed itself to the summer capital at therapia there stimson the first secretary of the embassy and in the absence of the ambassador charge daffaires invited peter to become his guest stimson was most anxious to be polite to peter for hallowell senior was a power in the party then in office and a word from him at washington in favor of a rising young diplomat would do no harm but peter was afraid his father would consider therapia out of bounds he sent me to constantinople explained peter and if he thinks im not playing the game the lord only knows where he might send me nextand he might cut off my allowance in the matter of allowance peters father had been most generous this was fortunate for poker as the pashas and princes played it at he cercle was no game for cripples or children but owing to his letterofcredit and his illspent life peter was able to hold his own against men three times his age and of fortunes nearly equal to that of his father only they disposed of their wealth differently on many hot evening peter saw as much of their money scattered over the green table as his father had spent over the hallowell athletic field in this fashion peter spent his first month of exile in the morning trying to fill his brain with names of great men who had been a long time dead and in his leisure hours with local color to a youth of his active spirit it was a full life without joy or recompense a letter from charley hines a classmate who lived at stillwater which arrived after peter had endured six weeks of constantinople released him from boredom and gave life a real interest it was a letter full of gossip intended to amuse one paragraph failed of its purpose it read old man gilman has got the sack the chancellor offered him up as a sacrifice to your father and because he was unwise enough to flunk you he is to move out in september i ran across them last week when i was looking for rooms for a freshman cousin they were reserving one in the same boardinghouse its a shame and i know youll agree they are a fine old couple and i dont like to think of them herding with freshmen in a shine boardinghouse black always was a swine peter spent fully ten minutes getting to the cable office just learned he cabled his father gilman dismissed because flunked me consider this outrageous please see he is reinstated the answer which arrived the next day did not satisfy peter it read informed gilman acted through spite have no authority as you know to interfere any act of black since peter had learned of the disaster that through his laziness had befallen the gilmans his indignation at the injustice had been hourly increasing nor had his banishment to constantinople strengthened his filial piety on the contrary it had rendered him independent and but little inclined to kiss the paternal rod in consequence his next cable was not conciliatory dismissing gilman looks more like we acted through spite makes me appear contemptible black is a toady will do as you direct please reinstate to this somewhat peremptory message his father answered if your position unpleasant yourself to blame not black incident is closed is it said the son of his father he called stetson to his aid and explained stetson reminded him of the famous cablegram of his distinguished contemporary perdicaris alive and raisuli dead peters paraphrase of this ran gilman returns to stillwater or i will not try for degree the reply was equally emphatic you earn your degree or you earn your own living this alarmed stetson but caused peter to deliver his ultimatum choose to earn my own living am leaving constantinople within a few days stetson was also leaving constantinople by steamer via naples peter who had come to like him very much would have accompanied him had he not preferred to return home more leisurely by way of paris and london youll get there long before i do said peter and as soon as you arrive i want you to go to stillwater and give doctor gilman some souvenir of turkey from me just to show him ive no hard feelings he wouldnt accept money but he cant refuse a present i want it to be something characteristic of the country like a prayer rug or a scimitar or an illuminated koran or somewhat doubtfully somewhat sheepishly stetson drew from his pocket a flat morocco case and opened it whats the matter with one of these he asked in a velvetlined jewel case was a star of green enamel and silver gilt to it was attached a ribbon of red and green thats the star of the crescent said peter where did you buy it buy it exclaimed stetson you dont buy them the sultan bestows them ill bet the sultan didnt bestow that one said peter ill bet returned stetson ive got something in my pocket that says he did he unfolded an imposing document covered with slanting lines of curving arabic letters in gold peter was impressed but still skeptical what does that say when it says it in english he asked it says translated stetson that his imperial majesty the sultan bestows upon henry stetson educator author lecturer the star of the order of the crescent of the fifth class for services rendered to turkey peter interrupted him indignantly never try to fool the fakirs my son he protested im a fakir myself what services did you ever services rendered continued stetson undisturbed in spreading throughout the united states a greater knowledge of the customs industries and religion of the ottoman empire that he explained refers to my i should say our movingpicture lecture i thought it would look well if when i lectured on turkey i wore a turkish decoration so i went after this one peter regarded his young friend with incredulous admiration but did they believe you he demanded when you told them you were an author and educator stetson closed one eye and grinned they believed whatever i paid them to believe if you can get one of those cried peter old man gilman ought to get a dozen ill tell them hes the author of the longest and dullest history of their fleabitten empire that was ever written and hes a real professor and a real author and i can prove it ill show them the five volumes with his name in each how much did that thing cost you two hundred dollars in bribes said stetson briskly and two months of diplomacy i havent got two months for diplomacy said peter so ill have to increase the bribes ill stay here and get the decoration for gilman and you work the papers at home no one ever heard of the order of the crescent but that only makes it the easier for us theyll only know what we tell them and well tell them its the highest honor ever bestowed by a reigning sovereign upon an american scholar if you tell the people often enough that anything is the best they believe you thats the way father sells his hams youve been a pressagent from now on youre going to be my pressagent i mean doctor gilmans pressagent i pay your salary but your work is to advertise him and the order of the crescent ill give you a letter to charley hines at stillwater he sends out college news to a syndicate and hes the local associated press man hes sore at their discharging gilman and hes my best friend and hell work the papers as far as you like your job is to make stillwater college and doctor black and my father believe that when they lost gilman they lost the man who made stillwater famous and before we get through boosting gilman well make my fathers milliondollar gift laboratory look like an insult in the eyes of the former pressagent the light of battle burned fiercely memories of his triumphs in exploitation of his strategies and tactics in advertising soared before him its great he exclaimed ive got your idea and youve got me and youre darned lucky to get me ive been pressagent for politicians actors society leaders breakfast foods and horseshows and im the best i was in charge of the publicity bureau for galloway when he ran for governor he thinks the people elected him i know i did nora nashville was getting fifty dollars a week in vaudeville when i took hold of her now she gets a thousand i even made people believe mrs hamptonrhodes was a society leader at newport when all she ever saw of newport was bergers and the muschenheimkings why i am the man that made the american people believe russian dancers can dance its plain to see you hate yourself said peter you must not get so despondent or you might commit suicide how much money will you want how much have you got all kinds said peter some in a letterofcredit that my father earned from the fretful pig and much more in cash that i won at poker from the pashas when thats gone ive got to go to work and earn my living meanwhile your salary is a hundred a week and all you need to boost gilman and the order of the crescent we are now the gilman defense publicity and development committee and you will begin by introducing me to the man i am to bribe in this country you dont need any introduction to the man you want to bribe exclaimed stetson you just bribe him that same night in the smokingroom of the hotel peter and stetson made their first move in the game of winning for professor gilman the order of the crescent stetson presented peter to a young effendi in a frock coat and fez stetson called him osman he was a clerk in the foreign office and appeared to be a friend of a friend of a friend of the assistant third secretary the five volumes of the rise and fall were spread before him and peter demanded to know why so distinguished a scholar as doctor gilman had not received some recognition from the country he had so sympathetically described osman fingered the volumes doubtfully and promised the matter should be brought at once to the attention of the grand vizier after he had departed stetson explained that osman had just as little chance of getting within speaking distance of the grand vizier as of the ladies of his harem its like tammany said stetson there are sachems district leaders and lieutenants each of them is entitled to trade or give away a few of these decorations just as each district leader gets his percentage of jobs in the streetcleaning department this fellow will go to his patron his patron will go to some undersecretary in the cabinet he will put it up to a palace favorite and they will divide your money in time the minister of foreign affairs will sign your brevet and a hundred others without knowing what he is signing then you cable me and the star of the crescent will burst upon the united states in a way that will make halleys comet look like a wax match the next day stetson and the tutor sailed for home and peter was left alone to pursue as he supposed the order of the crescent on the contrary he found that the order of the crescent was pursuing him he had not appreciated that from underlings and backstair politicians an itinerant showman like stetson and the only son of an american croesus would receive very different treatment within twentyfour hours a fat man with a blueblack beard and diamond rings called with osman to apologize for the latter osman the fat man explained had been about to make a fatal error for doctor gilman he had asked the order of the crescent of the fifth class the same class that had been given stetson the fifth class the fat man explained was all very well for tradesmen dragomans and eunuchs but as an honor for a savant as distinguished as the friend of his hallowell the fourth class would hardly be high enough the fees the fat man added would also be higher but he pointed out it was worth the difference because the fourth class entitled the wearer to a salute from all sentries there are few sentries at stillwater said peter but i want the best and i want it quick get me the fourth class the next morning he was surprised by an early visit from stimson of the embassy the secretary was considerably annoyed my dear hallowell he protested why the devil didnt you tell me you wanted a decoration of course the state department expressly forbids us to ask for one for ourselves or for any one else but whats the constitution between friends ill get it for you at once but on two conditions that you dont tell anybody i got it and that you tell me why you want it and what you ever did to deserve it instead peter explained fully and so sympathetically that the diplomat demanded that he too should be enrolled as one of the gilman defense committee doctor gilmans history he said must be presented to the sultan you must have the five volumes rebound in red and green the colors of mohammed and with as much gold tooling as they can carry i hope he added they are not soiled not by me peter assured him i will take them myself continued stimson to muley pasha the minister of foreign affairs and ask him to present them to his imperial majesty he will promise to do so but he wont but he knows i know he wont so that is all right and in return he will present us with the order of the crescent of the third class going up exclaimed peter the third class that will cost me my entire letterofcredit not at all said stimson ive saved you from the grafters it will cost you only what you pay to have the books rebound and the third class is a real honor of which any one might be proud you wear it round your neck and at your funeral it entitles you to an escort of a thousand soldiers id rather put up with fewer soldiers said peter and wear it longer round my neck whats the matter with our getting the second class or the first class at such ignorance stimson could not repress a smile the first class he explained patiently is the great grand cross and is given only to reigning sovereigns the second is called the grand cross and is bestowed only on crowned princes prime ministers and men of worldwide fame whats the matter with doctor gilmans being of worldwide fame said peter he will be some day when stetson starts boosting some day retorted stimson stiffly i may be an ambassador when i am i hope to get the grand cross of the crescent but not now im sorry youre not satisfied he added aggrievedly no one can get you anything higher than the third class and i may lose my official head asking for that nothing is too good for old man gilman said peter nor for you you get the third class for him and ill have father make you an ambassador that night at poker at the club peter sat next to prince abdul who had come from a reception at the grand vizier s and still wore his decorations decorations now fascinated peter and those on the coat of the young prince he regarded with wideeyed awe he also regarded abdul with wideeyed awe because he was the favorite nephew of the sultan and because he enjoyed the reputation of having the worst reputation in turkey peter wondered why he always had found abdul charming distinguished courteous to the verge of humility most cleverly cynical most brilliantly amusing at poker he almost invariably won and while doing so was so politely bored so indifferent to his cards and the cards held by others that peter declared he had never met his equal in a pause in the game while some one tore the cover off a fresh pack peter pointed at the star of diamonds that nestled behind the lapel of abduls coat may i ask what that is said peter the prince frowned at his diamond sunburst as though it annoyed him and then smiled delightedly it is an order he said in a quick aside bestowed only upon men of worldwide fame i dined tonight he explained with your charming compatriot mr joseph stimson and joe told said peter the prince nodded joe told he repeated but it is all arranged your distinguished friend the sage of stillwater will receive the crescent of the third class peters eyes were still fastened hungrily upon the diamond sunburst why he demanded cant some one get him one like that as though about to take offense the prince raised his eyebrows and then thought better of it and smiled there are only two men in all turkey he said who could do that and is the sultan the other one asked peter the prince gasped as though he had suddenly stepped beneath a cold shower and then laughed long and silently you flatter me he murmured you know you could if you liked whispered peter stoutly apparently abdul did not hear him i will take one card he said toward two in the morning there was seventyfive thousand francs in the pot and all save prince abdul and peter had dropped out will you divide asked the prince why should i said peter ive got you beat now do you raise me or call the prince called and laid down a full house peter showed four tens i will deal you one hand double or quits said the prince over the end of his cigar peter squinted at the great heap of motherofpearl counters and goldpieces and banknotes you will pay me double what is on the table he said or you quit owing me nothing the prince nodded go ahead said peter the prince dealt them each a hand and discarded two cards peter held a seven a pair of kings and a pair of fours hoping to draw another king which might give him a three higher than the three held by abdul he threw away the seven and the lower pair he caught another king the prince showed three queens and shrugged his shoulders peter leaning toward him spoke out of the corner of his mouth ill make you a sporting proposition he murmured you owe me a hundred and fifty thousand francs ill stake that against what only two men in the empire can give me the prince allowed his eyes to travel slowly round the circle of the table but the puzzled glances of the other players showed that to them peters proposal conveyed no meaning the prince smiled cynically for yourself he demanded for doctor gilman said peter we will cut for deal and one hand will decide said the prince his voice dropped to a whisper and no one must ever know he warned peter also could be cynical not even the sultan he said abdul won the deal and gave himself a very good hand but the hand he dealt peter was the better one the prince was a good loser the next afternoon the gazette officially announced that upon doctor henry gilman professor emeritus of the university of stillwater u s a the sultan had been graciously pleased to confer the grand cross of the order of the crescent peter flashed the great news to stetson the cable caught him at quarantine it read captured crescent grand cross get busy but before stetson could get busy the campaign of publicity had been brilliantly opened from constantinople prince abdul although pitchforked into the gilman defense committee proved himself one of its most enthusiastic members for me it becomes a case of noblesse oblige he declared if it is worth doing at all it is worth doing well today the sultan will command that the rise and fall be translated into arabic and that it be placed in the national library moreover the university of constantinople the college of salonica and the national historical society have each elected doctor gilman an honorary member i proposed him the patriarch of mesopotamia seconded him and the turkish ambassador in america has been instructed to present the insignia with his own hands nor was peter or stimson idle to assist stetson in his presswork and to further the idea that all europe was now clamoring for the rise and fall peter paid an impecunious but overeducated dragoman to translate it into five languages and stimson officially wrote of this and of the bestowal of the crescent to the state department he pointed out that not since general grant had passed through europe had the sultan so highly honored an american he added he had been requested by the grand vizier who had been requested by prince abdul to request the state department to inform doctor gilman of these high honors a request from such a source was a command and as desired the state department wrote as requested by the grand vizier to doctor gilman and tendered congratulations the fact was sent out briefly from washington by associated press this official recognition by the government and by the newspapers was all and more than stetson wanted he took off his coat and with a megaphone rather than a pen told the people of the united states who doctor gilman was who the sultan was what a grand cross was and why americas greatest historian was not without honor save in his own country columns of this were paid for and appeared as patent insides with a portrait of doctor gilman taken from the stillwater college annual and a picture of the grand cross drawn from imagination in eight hundred newspapers of the middle western and eastern states special articles paragraphs portraits and pictures of the grand cross followed and using stillwater as his base stetson continued to flood the country young hines the local correspondent acting under instructions by cable from peter introduced him to doctor gilman as a traveller who lectured on turkey and one who was a humble admirer of the author of the rise and fall stetson having studied it as a student crams an examination begged that he might sit at the feet of the master and for several evenings actually at his feet on the steps of the ivycovered cottage the disguised pressagent drew from the unworldly and unsuspecting scholar the simple story of his life to this still in his character as disciple and student he added photographs he himself made of the master of the masters ivycovered cottage of his favorite walk across the campus of the great historian at work at his desk at work in his rose garden at play with his wife on the croquet lawn these he held until the insignia should be actually presented this pleasing duty fell to the turkish ambassador who much to his astonishment had received instructions to proceed to stillwater massachusetts a place of which he had never heard and present to a doctor gilman of whom he had never heard the grand cross of the crescent as soon as the insignia arrived in the official mailbag a secretary brought it from washington to boston and the ambassador travelled down from bar harbor to receive it and with the secretary took the local train to stillwater the reception extended to him there is still remembered by the ambassador as one of the happiest incidents of his distinguished career never since he came to represent his imperial majesty in the western republic had its barbarians greeted him in a manner in any way so nearly approaching his own idea of what was his due this ambassador hines had explained to the mayor of stillwater who was also the proprietor of its largest department store is the personal representative of the sultan so weve got to treat him right its exactly added stetson as though the sultan himself were coming and so few crowned heads visit stillwater continued hines that we ought to show we appreciate this one especially as he comes to pay the highest honor known to europe to one of our townsmen the mayor chewed nervously on his cigar whatd i better do he asked mr stetson here hines pointed out has lived in turkey and he knows what they expect maybe he will help us will you begged the mayor i will said stetson then they visited the college authorities chancellor black and most of the faculty were on their vacations but there were half a dozen professors still in their homes around the campus and it was pointed out to them that the coming honor to one lately of their number reflected glory upon the college and upon them and that they should take official action it was also suggested that for photographic purposes they should wear their academic robes caps and hoods to these suggestions with alacrity partly because they all loved doctor gilman and partly because they had never been photographed by a movingpicture machine they all agreed so it came about that when the ambassador hot and cross and dusty stepped off the waytrain at stillwater station he found to his delighted amazement a red carpet stretching to a perfectly new automobile a company of the local militia presenting arms a committee consisting of the mayor in a high hat and white gloves and three professors in gowns and colored hoods and the stillwater silver cornet band playing what after several repetitions the ambassador was graciously pleased to recognize as his national anthem the ambassador forgot that he was hot and cross he forgot that he was dusty his face radiated satisfaction and perspiration here at last were people who appreciated him and his high office and as the mayor helped him into the automobile and those students who lived in stillwater welcomed him with strange yells and the movingpicture machine aimed at him point blank he beamed with condescension but inwardly he was ill at ease inwardly he was chastising himself for having through his ignorance of america failed to appreciate the importance of the man he had come to honor when he remembered he had never even heard of doctor gilman he blushed with confusion and when he recollected that he had been almost on the point of refusing to come to stillwater that he had considered leaving the presentation to his secretary he shuddered what might not the sultan have done to him what a narrow escape attracted by the band by the sight of their fellow townsmen in khaki by the sight of the stout gentleman in the red fez by a tremendous liking and respect for doctor gilman the entire town of stillwater gathered outside his cottage and inside the old professor trembling and bewildered and yet strangely happy bowed his shoulders while the ambassador slipped over them the broad green scarf and upon his only frock coat pinned the diamond sunburst in woeful embarrassment doctor gilman smiled and bowed and smiled and then as the delighted mayor of stillwater shouted speech in sudden panic he reached out his hand quickly and covertly and found the hand of his wife now then three long ones yelled the cheer leader now then see the conquering hero yelled the bandmaster attention present arms yelled the militia captain and the townspeople and the professors applauded and waved their hats and handkerchiefs and doctor gilman and his wife he frightened and confused she happy and proud and taking it all as a matter of course stood arm in arm in the frame of honeysuckles and bowed and bowed and bowed and the ambassador so far unbent as to drink champagne which appeared mysteriously in tubs of ice from the rear of the ivycovered cottage with the mayor with the wives of the professors with the students with the bandmaster indeed so often did he unbend that when the perfectly new automobile conveyed him back to the touraine he was sleeping happily and smiling in his sleep peter had arrived in america at the same time as had the insignia but hines and stetson would not let him show himself in stillwater they were afraid if all three conspirators foregathered they might inadvertently drop some clew that would lead to suspicion and discovery so peter worked from new york and his first act was anonymously to supply his father and chancellor black with all the newspaper accounts of the great celebration at stillwater when doctor black read them he choked never before had stillwater college been brought so prominently before the public and never before had her president been so utterly and completely ignored and what made it worse was that he recognized that even had he been present he could not have shown his face how could he who had as every one connected with the college now knew out of spite and without cause dismissed an old and faithful servant join in chanting his praises he only hoped his patron hallowell senior might not hear of gilmans triumph but hallowell senior heard little of anything else at his office at his clubs on the golflinks every one he met congratulated him on the high and peculiar distinction that had come to his pet college you certainly have the darnedest luck in backing the right horse exclaimed a rival porkpacker enviously now if i pay a hundred thousand for a velasquez it turns out to be a bad copy worth thirty dollars but you pay a professor three thousand and he brings you in half a million dollars worth of free advertising why this doctor gilmans doing as much for your college as doctor osler did for johns hopkins or as walter camp does for yale mr hallowell received these congratulations as gracefully as he was able and in secret raged at chancellor black each day his rage increased it seemed as though there would never be an end to doctor gilman the stone he had rejected had become the cornerstone of stillwater whenever he opened a newspaper he felt like exclaiming will no one rid me of this pestilent fellow for the rise and fall in an edition deluxe limited to two hundred copies was being bought up by all his bookcollecting millionaire friends a popular edition was on view in the windows of every bookshop it was offered as a prize to subscribers to all the more sedate magazines and the name and features of the distinguished author had become famous and familiar not a day passed but that some new honor at least so the newspapers stated was thrust upon him paragraphs announced that he was to be the next exchange professor to berlin that in may he was to lecture at the sorbonne that in june he was to receive a degree from oxford a freshwater college on one of the great lakes leaped to the front by offering him the chair of history at that seat of learning at a salary of five thousand dollars a year some of the honors that had been thrust upon doctor gilman existed only in the imagination of peter and stetson but this offer happened to be genuine doctor gilman rejected it without consideration he read the letter from the trustees to his wife and shook his head we could not be happy away from stillwater he said we have only a month more in the cottage but after that we still can walk past it we can look into the garden and see the flowers she planted we can visit the place where she lies but if we went away we should be lonely and miserable for her and she would be lonely for us mr hallowell could not know why doctor gilman had refused to leave stillwater but when he read that the small eastern college at which doctor gilman had graduated had offered to make him its president his jealousy knew no bounds he telegraphed to black reinstate gilman at once offer him six thousand offer him whatever he wants but make him promise for no consideration to leave stillwater he is only member faculty ever brought any credit to the college if we lose him ill hold you responsible the next morning hat in hand smiling ingratiatingly the chancellor called upon doctor gilman and ate so much humble pie that for a week he suffered acute mental indigestion but little did hallowell senior care for that he had got what he wanted doctor gilman the distinguished was back in the faculty and had made only one condition that he might live until he died in the ivycovered cottage two weeks later when peter arrived at stillwater to take the history examination which should he pass it would give him his degree he found on every side evidences of the worldwide fame he himself had created the newsstand at the depot the bookstores the drugstores the pictureshops all spoke of doctor gilman and postcards showing the ivycovered cottage photographs and enlargements of doctor gilman advertisements of the different editions of the history proclaimed his fame peter fascinated by the success of his own handiwork approached the ivycovered cottage in a spirit almost of awe but mrs gilman welcomed him with the same kindly sympathetic smile with which she always gave courage to the unhappy ones coming up for examinations and doctor gilmans high honors in no way had spoiled his gentle courtesy the examination was in writing and when peter had handed in his papers doctor gilman asked him if he would prefer at once to know the result i should indeed peter assured him then i regret to tell you hallowell said the professor that you have not passed i cannot possibly give you a mark higher than five in real sympathy the sage of stillwater raised his eyes but to his great astonishment he found that peter so far from being cast down or taking offense was smiling delightedly much as a fond parent might smile upon the precocious act of a beloved child i am afraid said doctor gilman gently that this summer you did not work very hard for your degree peter laughed and picked up his hat to tell you the truth professor he said youre right i got working for something worth while and i forgot about the degree chapter the invasion of england this is the true inside story of the invasion of england in by the germans and why it failed i got my data from baron von gottlieb at the time military attachй of the german government with the russian army in the second russianjapanese war when russia drove japan out of manchuria and reduced her to a thirdrate power he told me of his part in the invasion as we sat after the bombardment of tokio on the ramparts of the emperors palace watching the walls of the paper houses below us glowing and smoking like the ashes of a prairie fire two years before at the time of the invasion von gottlieb had been carl schultz the headwaiter at the east cliff hotel at cromer and a spy the other end of the story came to me through lester ford the london correspondent of the new york republic they gave me permission to tell it in any fashion i pleased and it is here set down for the first time in telling the story my conscience is not in the least disturbed for i have yet to find any one who will believe it what led directly to the invasion was that some weekend guest of the east cliff hotel left a copy of the riddle of the sands in the coffeeroom where von gottlieb found it and the fact that ford attended the shakespeare ball had neither of these events taken place the german flag might now be flying over buckingham palace and then again it might not as every german knows the riddle of the sands is a novel written by a very clever englishman in which is disclosed a plan for the invasion of his country according to this plan an army of infantry was to be embarked in lighters towed by shallowdraft seagoing tugs and despatched simultaneously from the seven rivers that form the frisian isles from there they were to be convoyed by battleships two hundred and forty miles through the north sea and thrown upon the coast of norfolk somewhere between the wash and mundesley the fact that this coast is lowlying and bordered by sand flats which at low water are dry that england maintains no north sea squadron and that her nearest naval base is at chatham seem to point to it as the spot best adapted for such a raid what von gottlieb thought was evidenced by the fact that as soon as he read the book he mailed it to the german ambassador in london and under separate cover sent him a letter in this he said i suggest your excellency bring this book to the notice of a certain royal personage and of the strategy board general bolivar said when you want arms take them from the enemy does not this also follow when you want ideas what the strategy board thought of the plan is a matter of history this was in a year later during the coronation week lester ford went to clarksons to rent a monks robe in which to appear at the shakespeare ball and while the assistant departed in search of the robe ford was left alone in a small room hung with fulllength mirrors and shelves and packed with the uniforms that clarkson rents for covent garden balls and amateur theatricals while waiting ford gratified a long secretly cherished desire to behold himself as a military man by trying on all the uniforms on the lower shelves and as a result when the assistant returned instead of finding a young american in english clothes and a high hat he was confronted by a german officer in a spiked helmet fighting a duel with himself in the mirror the assistant retreated precipitately and ford conscious that he appeared ridiculous tried to turn the tables by saying does a german uniform always affect a territorial like that the assistant laughed goodnaturedly it did give me quite a turn he said its this talk of invasion i fancy but for a fact sir if i was a coast guard and you came along the beach dressed like that id take a shot at you just on the chance anyway and quite right too said ford he was wondering when the invasion did come whether he would stick at his post in london and dutifully forward the news to his paper or play truant and as a war correspondent watch the news in the making so the words of mr clarksons assistant did not sink in but a few weeks later young major bellew recalled them bellew was giving a dinner on the terrace of the savoy restaurant his guests were his nephew young herbert who was only five years younger than his uncle and herberts friend birrell an irishman both in their third term at the university after five years service in india bellew had spent the last eights week at oxford and was complaining bitterly that since his day the undergraduate had deteriorated he had found him serious given to study far too well behaved instead of jorrocks he read galsworthy instead of wines he found pleasure in debating clubs where he discussed socialism ragging practical jokes ingenious hoaxes that once were wont to set england in a roar were a lost art his undergraduate guests combated these charges fiercely his criticisms they declared unjust and without intelligence youre talking rot said his dutiful nephew take phil here for example ive roomed with him three years and i can testify that he has never opened a book he never heard of galsworthy until you spoke of him and you can see for yourself his table manners are quite as bad as yours worse assented birrell loyally and as for ragging what rags in your day were as good as ours as the carrie nation rag for instance when five hundred people sat through a temperance lecture and never guessed they were listening to a man from balliol and the abyssinian ambassador rag cried herbert what price that when the dreadnought manned the yards for him and gave him seventeen guns that was an oxford rag and carried through by oxford men the country hasnt stopped laughing yet you give us a rag challenged herbert make it as hard as you like something risky something that will make the country sit up something that will send us all to jail and phil and i will put it through whether it takes one man or a dozen go on he persisted and i bet we can get fifty volunteers right here in town and all of them undergraduates give you the idea yes mocked bellew trying to gain time thats just what i say you boys today are so dull you lack initiative its the idea that counts anybody can do the acting thats just amateur theatricals is it snorted herbert if you want to know what stage fright is just go on board a british battleship with your face covered with burnt cork and insist on being treated like an ambassador youll find its a little different from a first night with the simla thespians ford had no part in the debate he had been smoking comfortably and with welltimed nods impartially encouraging each disputant but now he suddenly laid his cigar upon his plate and after glancing quickly about him leaned eagerly forward they were at the corner table of the terrace and as it was now past nine oclock the other diners had departed to the theatres and they were quite alone below them outside the open windows were the trees of the embankment and beyond the thames blocked to the west by the great shadows of the houses of parliament lit only by the flame in the tower that showed the lower house was still sitting ill give you an idea for a rag whispered ford one that is risky that will make the country sit up that ought to land you in jail have you read the riddle of the sands bellew and herbert nodded birrell made no sign dont mind him exclaimed herbert impatiently he never reads anything go on its the book most talked about explained ford and what else is most talked about he answered his own question the landing of the germans in morocco and the chance of war now i ask you with that book in everybodys mind and the war scare in everybodys mind what would happen if german soldiers appeared tonight on the norfolk coast just where the book says they will appear not one soldier but dozens of soldiers not in one place but in twenty places what would happen roared major bellew loyally the boy scouts would fall out of bed and kick them into the sea shut up snapped his nephew irreverently he shook ford by the arm how he demanded breathlessly how are we to do it it would take hundreds of men two men corrected ford and a third man to drive the car i thought it out one day at clarksons when i came across a lot of german uniforms i thought of it as a newspaper story as a trick to find out how prepared you people are to meet invasion and when you said just now that you wanted a chance to go to jail whats your plan interrupted birrell we would start just before dawn began ford we demanded herbert are you in this am i in it cried ford indignantly its my own private invasion im letting you boys in on the ground floor if i dont go there won t be any invasion the two pinkcheeked youths glanced at each other inquiringly and then nodded we accept your services sir said birrell gravely whats your plan in astonishment major bellew glanced from one to the other and then slapped the table with his open palm his voice shook with righteous indignation of all the preposterous outrageous are you mad he demanded do you suppose for one minute i will allow his nephew shrugged his shoulders and rising pushed back his chair oh you go to the devil he exclaimed cheerfully come on ford he said well find some place where uncle cant hear us two days later a touring car carrying three young men in the twentyone miles between wells and cromer broke down eleven times each time this misfortune befell them one young man scattered tools in the road and on his knees hammered ostentatiously at the tin hood and the other two occupants of the car sauntered to the beach there they chucked pebbles at the waves and then slowly retraced their steps each time the route by which they returned was different from the one by which they had set forth sometimes they followed the beaten path down the cliff or as it chanced to be across the marshes sometimes they slid down the face of the cliff sometimes they lost themselves behind the hedges and in the lanes of the villages but when they again reached the car the procedure of each was alike each produced a pencil and on the face of his half inch road map traced strange fantastic signs at lunchtime they stopped at the east cliff hotel at cromer and made numerous and trivial inquiries about the cromer golf links they had come they volunteered from ely for a day of seabathing and golf they were returning after dinner the headwaiter of the east cliff hotel gave them the information they desired he was an intelligent headwaiter young and of pleasant not to say distinguished bearing in a frock coat he might easily have been mistaken for something even more important than a headwaiter for a german ridingmaster a leader of a hungarian band a manager of a ritz hotel but he was not above his station he even assisted the porter in carrying the coats and golf bags of the gentlemen from the car to the coffeeroom where with the intuition of the homing pigeon the three strangers had unaided found their way as carl schultz followed carrying the dustcoats a road map fell from the pocket of one of them to the floor carl schultz picked it up and was about to replace it when his eyes were held by notes scrawled roughly in pencil with an expression that no longer was that of a headwaiter carl cast one swift glance about him and then slipped into the empty coatroom and locked the door five minutes later with a smile that played uneasily over a face grown gray with anxiety carl presented the map to the tallest of the three strangers it was open so that the pencil marks were most obvious by his accent it was evident the tallest of the three strangers was an american what the devil he protested which of you boys has been playing hob with my map for just an instant the two pinkcheeked ones regarded him with disfavor until for just an instant his eyebrows rose and with a glance he signified the waiter oh that exclaimed the younger one the automobile club asked us to mark down petrol stations those marks mean thats where you can buy petrol the headwaiter breathed deeply with an assured and happy countenance he departed and for the twohundredth time that day looked from the windows of the diningroom out over the tumbling breakers to the gray stretch of sea as though fearful that his face would expose his secret he glanced carefully about him and then assured he was alone leaned eagerly forward scanning the empty tossing waters in his minds eye he beheld rolling tugboats straining against long lines of scows against the dead weight of fieldguns against the pull of thousands of motionless silent figures each in khaki each in a black leather helmet each with one hundred and fifty rounds in his own language carl schultz reproved himself patience he muttered patience by ten tonight all will be dark there will be no stars there will be no moon the very heavens fight for us and by sunrise our outposts will be twenty miles inland at lunchtime carl schultz carefully obsequiously waited upon the three strangers he gave them their choice of soup thick or clear of gooseberry pie or halfpay pudding he accepted their shillings gratefully and when they departed for the links he bowed them on their way and as their car turned up jetty street for one instant he again allowed his eyes to sweep the dull gray ocean brownsailed fishingboats were beating in toward cromer on the horizon line a norwegian tramp was drawing a lengthening scarf of smoke save for these the sea was empty by gracious permission of the manageress carl had obtained an afternoon off and changing his coat he mounted his bicycle and set forth toward overstrand on his way he nodded to the local constable to the postman on his rounds to the driver of the char а banc he had been a year in cromer and was well known and well liked three miles from cromer at the top of the highest hill in overstrand the chimneys of a house showed above a thick tangle of firtrees between the trees and the road rose a wall high compact forbidding carl opened the gate in the wall and pushed his bicycle up a winding path hemmed in by bushes at the sound of his feet on the gravel the bushes new apart and a man sprang into the walk and confronted him but at sight of the headwaiter the legs of the man became rigid his heels clicked together his hand went sharply to his visor behind the house surrounded on every side by trees was a tiny lawn in the centre of the lawn where once had been a tennis court there now stood a slim mast from this mast dangled tiny wires that ran to a kitchen table on the table its brass work shining in the sun was a new and perfectly good wireless outfit and beside it with his hand on the key was a heavily built heavily bearded german in his turn carl drew his legs together his heels clicked his hand stuck to his visor i have been in constant communication said the man with the beard they will be here just before the dawn return to cromer vand openly from the postoffice telegraph your cousin in london will meet you tomorrow at the crystal palace on receipt of that in the last edition of all of this afternoons papers he will insert the final advertisement thirty thousand of our own people will read it they will know the moment has come as carl coasted back to cromer he flashed past many pretty gardens where upon the lawns men in flannels were busy at tennis or with pretty ladies deeply occupied in drinking tea carl smiled grimly high above him on the skyline of the cliff he saw the three strangers he had served at luncheon they were driving before them three innocuous golf balls a nation of wasters muttered the german sleeping at their posts they are fiddling while england falls mr shutliffe of stiffkey had led his cow in from the marsh and was about to close the cowbarn door when three soldiers appeared suddenly around the wall of the village church they ran directly toward him it was nine oclock but the twilight still held the uniforms the men wore were unfamiliar but in his day mr shutliffe had seen many uniforms and to him all uniforms looked alike the tallest soldier snapped at mr shutliffe fiercely in a strange tongue du bist gefangen he announced das dorf ist besetzt wo sind unsere leute he demanded youll ave to excuse me sir said mr shutliffe but i am a trifle ard of earing the soldier addressed him in english what is the name of this village he demanded mr shuttiffe having lived in the village upward of eighty years recalled its name with difficulty have you seen any of our people with another painful effort of memory mr shutliffe shook his head go indoors commanded the soldier and put out all lights and remain indoors we have taken this village we are germans you are a prisoner do you understand yes sir thankee sir kindly stammered mr shutliffe may i lock in the pigs first sir one of the soldiers coughed explosively and ran away and the two others trotted after him when they looked back mr shutliffe was still standing uncertainly in the dusk mildly concerned as to whether he should lock up the pigs or obey the german gentleman the three soldiers halted behind the church wall that was a fine start mocked herbert of course you had to pick out the village idiot if they are all going to take it like that we had better pack up and go home the village inn is still open said ford well close it they entered with fixed bayonets and dropped the butts of their rifles on the sanded floor a man in gaiters choked over his ale and two fishermen removed their clay pipes and stared the barmaid alone arose to the occasion now then she exclaimed briskly what way is that to come tumbling into a respectable place none of your teagarden tricks in here young fellow my lad or the tallest of the three intruders in deep guttural accents interrupted her sharply we are germans he declared this village is captured you are prisoners of war those lights you will out put and yourselves lock in if you into the street go we will shoot he gave a command in a strange language so strange indeed that the soldiers with him failed to entirely grasp his meaning and one shouldered his rifle while the other brought his politely to a salute you ass muttered the tall german get out as they charged into the street they heard behind them a wild feminine shriek then a crash of pottery and glass then silence and an instant later the ship inn was buried in darkness that will hold stiffkey for a while said ford now back to the car but between them and the car loomed suddenly a tall and impressive figure his helmet and his measured tread upon the deserted cobblestones proclaimed his calling the constable whispered herbert he must see us but he mustnt speak to us for a moment the three men showed themselves in the middle of the street and then as though at sight of the policeman they had taken alarm disappeared through an opening between two houses five minutes later a motorcar with its canvas top concealing its occupants rode slowly into stiffkeys main street and halted before the constable the driver of the car wore a leather skullcap and goggles from his neck to his heels he was covered by a raincoat mr policeman he began when i turned in here three soldiers stepped in front of my car and pointed rifles at me then they ran off toward the beach whats the idea manoeuvres because theyve no right to yes sir the policeman assured him promptly i saw them its manoeuvres sir territorials they didnt look like territorials objected the chauffeur they looked like germans protected by the deepening dusk the constable made no effort to conceal a grin just territorials sir he protested soothingly skylarking maybe but meaning no harm still ill have a look round and warn em a voice from beneath the canvas broke in angrily i tell you they were germans its either a silly joke or its serious and you ought to report it its your duty to warn the coast guard the constable considered deeply i wouldnt take it on myself to wake the coast guard he protested not at this time of the night but if any germans been annoying you gentlemen and you wish to lodge a complaint against them you give me your cards ye gods cried the man in the rear of the car go on he commanded as the car sped out of stiffkey herbert exclaimed with disgust whats the use he protested you couldnt wake these people with dynamite i vote we chuck it and go home they little know of england who only stiffkey know chanted the chauffeur reprovingly why we havent begun yet wait till we meet a live wire two miles farther along the road to cromer young bradshaw the jobmasters son at blakeney was leading his bicycle up the hill ahead of him something heavy flopped from the bank into the road and in the light of his acetylene lamp he saw a soldier the soldier dodged across the road and scrambled through the hedge on the bank opposite he was followed by another soldier and then by a third the last man halted put out that light he commanded go to your home and tell no one what you have seen if you attempt to give an alarm you will be shot our sentries are placed every fifty yards along this road the soldier disappeared from in front of the ray of light and followed his comrades and an instant later young bradshaw heard them sliding over the cliffs edge and the pebbles clattering to the beach below young bradshaw stood quite still in his heart was much fear fear of laughter of ridicule of failure but of no other kind of fear softly silently he turned his bicycle so that it faced down the long hill he had just climbed then he snapped off the light he had been reliably informed that in ambush at every fifty yards along the road to blakeney sentries were waiting to fire on him and he proposed to run the gauntlet he saw that it was for this moment that first as a volunteer and later as a territorial he had drilled in the town hall practiced on the rifle range and in mixed manoeuvres slept in six inches of mud as he threw his leg across his bicycle herbert from the motorcar farther up the hill fired two shots over his head these he explained to ford were intended to give verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative and the sighing of the bullets gave young bradshaw exactly what he wanted the assurance that he was not the victim of a practical joke he threw his weight forward and lifting his feet coasted downhill at forty miles an hour into the main street of blakeney ten minutes later when the car followed a mob of men so completely blocked the waterfront that ford was forced to stop his headlights illuminated hundreds of faces anxious sceptical eager a gentleman with a white mustache and a look of a retired army officer pushed his way toward ford the crowd making room for him and then closing in his wake have you seen any any soldiers he demanded german soldiers ford answered they tried to catch us but when i saw who they were i ran through them to warn you they fired and how many and where a halfcompany at stiffkey and a halfmile farther on a regiment we didnt know then they were germans not until they stopped us youd better telephone the garrison and thank you snapped the elderly gentleman i happen to be in command of this district what are your names ford pushed the car forward parting the crowd ive no time for that he called weve got to warn every coast town in norfolk you take my tip and get london on the long distance as they ran through the night ford spoke over his shoulder weve got them guessing he said now what we want is a live wire some one with imagination some one with authority who will wake the countryside looks ahead there said birrell as though it hadnt gone to bed before them as on a mafeking night every window in cley shone with lights in the main street were fishermen shopkeepers trippers in flannels summer residents the women had turned out as though to witness a display of fireworks girls were clinging to the arms of their escorts shivering in delighted terror the proprietor of the red lion sprang in front of the car and waved his arms whats this tale about germans he demanded jocularly you can see their lights from the beach said ford theyve landed two regiments between here and wells stiffkey is taken and theyve cut all the wires south the proprietor refused to be had let em all come he mocked all right returned ford let em come but dont take it lying down get those women off the streets and go down to the beach and drive the germans back gangway he shouted and the car shot forward we warned you he called and its up to you to his words were lost in the distance but behind him a mans voice rose with a roar like a rocket and was met with a savage deepthroated cheer outside the village ford brought the car to a halt and swung in his seat this thing is going to fail he cried petulantly they dont believe us weve got to show ourselves many times in a dozen places the british mind moves slowly said birrell the irishman now if this had happened in my native land he was interrupted by the screech of a siren and a demon car that spurned the road that splattered them with pebbles tore past and disappeared in the darkness as it fled down the lane of their headlights they saw that men in khaki clung to its sides were packed in its tonneau were swaying from its running boards before they could find their voices a motor cycle driven as though the angel of death were at the wheel shaved their mudguard and in its turn vanished into the night things are looking up said ford where is our next stop as i said before what we want is a live one herbert pressed his electric torch against his road map we are next billed to appear he said about a quarter of a mile from here at the signaltower of the great eastern railroad where we visit the night telegraph operator and give him the surprise party of his life the three men had mounted the steps of the signaltower so quietly that when the operator heard them they already surrounded him he saw three german soldiers with fierce upturned mustaches with flat squat helmets with long brown rifles they saw an anжmic palefaced youth without a coat or collar for the night was warm who sank back limply in his chair and gazed speechless with widebulging eyes in harsh guttural tones ford addressed him you are a prisoner he said we take over this office in the name of the german emperor get out as though instinctively seeking his only weapon of defence the hand of the boy operator moved across the table to the key of his instrument ford flung his rifle upon it no you dont he growled get out with eyes still bulging the boy lifted himself into a sitting posture my pay my months pay he stammered can i take it the expression on the face of the conqueror relaxed take it and get out ford commanded with eyes still fixed in fascinated terror upon the invader the boy pulled open the drawer of the table before him and fumbled with the papers inside quick cried ford the boy was very quick his hand leaped from the drawer like a snake and ford found himself looking into a revolver of the largest calibre issued by a civilized people birrell fell upon the boys shoulders herbert twisted the gun from his fingers and hurled it through the window and almost as quickly hurled himself down the steps of the tower birrell leaped after him ford remained only long enough to shout dont touch that instrument if you attempt to send a message through we will shoot we go to cut the wires for a minute the boy in the tower sat rigid his ears strained his heart beating in sharp suffocating stabs then with his left arm raised to guard his face he sank to his knees and leaning forward across the table inviting as he believed his death he opened the circuit and through the night flashed out a warning to his people when they had taken their places in the car herbert touched ford on the shoulder your last remark he said was that what we wanted was a live one dont mention it said ford he jammed that gun half down my throat i can taste it still where do we go from here according to the route we mapped out this afternoon said herbert we are now scheduled to give exhibitions at the coast towns of salthouse and weybourne but not with me exclaimed birrell fiercely those towns have been tipped off by now by blakeney and cley and the boy scouts would club us to death i vote we take the back roads to morston and drop in on a lonely coast guard if a coast guard sees us the authorities will have to believe him and theyll call out the navy herbert consulted his map there is a coast guard he said stationed just the other side of morston and he added fervently let us hope hes lonely they lost their way in the back roads and when they again reached the coast an hour had passed it was now quite dark there were no stars nor moon but after they had left the car in a side lane and had stepped out upon the cliff they saw for miles along the coast great beacon fires burning fiercely herbert came to an abrupt halt since seeing those fires he explained i feel a strange reluctance about showing myself in this uniform to a coast guard coast guards dont shoot mocked birrell they only look at the clouds through a telescope three germans with rifles ought to be able to frighten one coast guard with a telescope the whitewashed cabin of the coast guard was perched on the edge of the cliff behind it the downs ran back to meet the road the door of the cabin was open and from it a shaft of light cut across a tiny garden and showed the white fence and the walk of shells v we must pass in single file in front of that light whispered ford and then after we are sure he has seen us we must run like the devil im on in that last scene growled herbert only repeated ford with emphasis we must be sure he has seen us not twenty feet from them came a bursting roar a flash many roars many flashes many bullets hes seen us yelled birrell after the light from his open door had shown him one german soldier fully armed the coast guard had seen nothing further but judging from the shrieks of terror and the sounds of falling bodies that followed his first shot he was convinced he was hemmed in by an army and he proceeded to sell his life dearly clip after clip of cartridges he emptied into the night now to the front now to the rear now out to sea now at his own shadow in the lamplight to the people a quarter of a mile away at morston it sounded like a battle after running half a mile ford bruised and breathless fell at full length on the grass beside the car near it tearing from his person the last vestiges of a german uniform he found birrell he also was puffing painfully what happened to herbert panted ford i dont know gasped birrell when i saw him last he was diving over the cliff into the sea how many times did you die about twenty groaned the american and besides being dead i am severely wounded every time he fired i fell on my face and each time i hit a rock a scarecrow of a figure appeared suddenly in the rays of the headlights it was herbert scratched bleeding dripping with water and clad simply in a shirt and trousers he dragged out his kit bag and fell into his golf clothes anybody who wants a perfectly good german uniform he cried can have mine i left it in the first row of breakers it didnt fit me anyway the other two uniforms were hidden in the seat of the car the rifles and helmets to lend color to the invasion were dropped in the open road and five minutes later three gentlemen in inconspicuous harris tweeds and with golf clubs protruding from every part of their car turned into the shore road to cromer what they saw brought swift terror to their guilty souls and the car to an abrupt halt before them was a regiment of regulars advancing in column of fours at the double an officer sprang to the front of the car and seated himself beside ford ill have to commandeer this he said run back to cromer dont crush my men but go like the devil we heard firing here explained the officer at the coast guard station the guard drove them back to the sea he counted over a dozen they made pretty poor practice for he isnt wounded but his gravel walk looks as though some one had drawn a harrow over it i wonder exclaimed the officer suddenly if you are the three gentlemen who first gave the alarm to colonel raglan and then went on to warn the other coast towns because if you are he wants your names ford considered rapidly if he gave false names and that fact were discovered they would be suspected and investigated and the worst might happen so he replied that his friends and himself probably were the men to whom the officer referred he explained they had been returning from cromer where they had gone to play golf when they had been held up by the germans you were lucky to escape said the officer and in keeping on to give warning you were taking chances if i may say so we think you behaved extremely well ford could not answer his guilty conscience shamed him into silence with his siren shrieking and his horn tooting he was forcing the car through lanes of armed men they packed each side of the road they were banked behind the hedges their campfires blazed from every hilltop your regiment seems to have turned out to a man exclaimed ford admiringly my regiment snorted the officer youve passed through five regiments already and there are as many more in the dark places theyre everywhere he cried jubilantly and i thought they were only where you see the campfires exclaimed ford thats what the germans think said the officer its working like a clock he cried happily there hasnt been a hitch as soon as they got your warning to colonel raglan they came down to the coast like a wave on foot by trains by motors and at nine oclock the government took over all the railroads the county regiments regulars yeomanry territorials have been spread along this shore for thirty miles down in london the guards started to dover and brighton two hours ago the automobile club in the first hour collected two hundred cars and turned them over to the guards in bird cage walk cody and grahamewhite and eight of his air men left hendon an hour ago to reconnoitre the south coast admiral beatty has started with the channel squadron to head off the german convoy in the north sea and the torpedo destroyers have been sent to lie outside of heligoland well get that back by daylight and on land every one of the three services is under arms on this coast alone before sunrise well have one hundred thousand men and from colchester the brigade division of artillery from ipswich the r h as with siegeguns fieldguns quickfiringguns all kinds of guns spread out over every foot of ground from here to hunstanton they thought theyd give us a surprise party they will never give us another surprise party on the top of the hill at overstrand the headwaiter of the east cliff hotel and the bearded german stood in the garden back of the house with the forbidding walls from the road in front came unceasingly the tramp and shuffle of thousands of marching feet the rumble of heavy cannon the clanking of their chains the voices of men trained to command raised in sharp confident orders the sky was illuminated by countless fires every window of every cottage and hotel blazed with lights the night had been turned into day the eyes of the two germans were like the eyes of those who had passed through an earthquake of those who looked upon the burning of san francisco upon the destruction of messina we were betrayed general whispered the headwaiter we were betrayed baron replied the bearded one but you were in time to warn the flotilla with a sigh the older man nodded the last message i received over the wireless he said before i destroyed it read your message understood we are returning our movements will be explained as manoeuvres and added the general the english having driven us back will be willing to officially accept that explanation as manoeuvres this night will go down into history return to the hotel he commanded and in two months you can rejoin your regiment on the morning after the invasion the new york republic published a map of great britain that covered three columns and a woodcut of ford that was spread over five beneath it was printed lester ford our london correspondent captured by the germans he escapes and is the first to warn the english people on the same morning in an editorial in the times of london appeared this paragraph the germans were first seen by the hon arthur herbert the eldest son of lord cinaris mr patrick headford birrell both of balliol college oxford and mr lester ford the correspondent of the new york republic these gentlemen escaped from the landing party that tried to make them prisoners and at great risk proceeded in their motorcar over roads infested by the germans to all the coast towns of norfolk warning the authorities should the war office fail to recognize their services the people of great britain will prove that they are not ungrateful a week later three young men sat at dinner on the terrace of the savoy shall we or shall we not asked herbert tell my uncle that we three and we three alone were the invaders thats hardly correct said ford as we now know there were two hundred thousand invaders we were the only three who got ashore i vote we dont tell him said birrell let him think with everybody else that the germans blundered that an advance party landed too soon and gave the show away if we talk he argued well get credit for a successful hoax if we keep quiet everybody will continue to think we saved england im content to let it go at that chapter blood will tell david greene was an employee of the burdett automatic punch company the manufacturing plant of the company was at bridgeport but in the new york offices there were working samples of all the punches from the little nickelplated hand punch with which conductors squeezed holes in railroad tickets to the big punch that could bite into an iron plate as easily as into a piece of pie davids duty was to explain these different punches and accordingly when burdett senior or one of the sons turned a customer over to david he spoke of him as a salesman but david called himself a demonstrator for a short time he even succeeded in persuading the other salesmen to speak of themselves as demonstrators but the shipping clerks and bookkeepers laughed them out of it they could not laugh david out of it this was so partly because he had no sense of humor and partly because he had a greatgreatgrandfather among the salesmen on lower broadway to possess a greatgreatgrandfather is unusual even a greatgrandfather is a rarity and either is considered superfluous but to david the possession of a greatgreatgrandfather was a precious and open delight he had possessed him only for a short time undoubtedly he always had existed but it was not until davids sister anne married a doctor in bordentown new jersey and became socially ambitious that david emerged as a son of washington it was sister anne anxious to get in as a daughter and wear a distaff pin in her shirtwaist who discovered the revolutionary ancestor she unearthed him or rather ran him to earth in the graveyard of the presbyterian church at bordentown he was no less a person than general hiram greene and he had fought with washington at trenton and at princeton of this there was no doubt that later on moving to new york his descendants became peaceloving salesmen did not affect his record to enter a society founded on heredity the important thing is first to catch your ancestor and having made sure of him david entered the society of the sons of washington with flying colors he was not unlike the man who had been speaking prose for forty years without knowing it he was not unlike the other man who woke to find himself famous he had gone to bed a timid nearsighted underpaid salesman without a relative in the world except a married sister in bordentown and he awoke to find he was a direct descendant of neck or nothing greene a revolutionary hero a friend of washington a man whose portrait hung in the state house at trenton davids life had lacked color the day he carried his certificate of membership to the big jewelry store uptown and purchased two rosettes one for each of his two coats was the proudest of his life the other men in the broadway office took a different view as wyckoff one of burdetts flying squadron of travelling salesmen said all grandfathers look alike to me whether theyre great or greatgreatgreat each one is as dead as the other id rather have a live cousin who could loan me a five or slip me a drink what did your greatgreat dad ever do for you well for one thing said david stiffly he fought in the war of the revolution he saved us from the shackles of monarchical england he made it possible for me and you to enjoy the liberties of a free republic dont try to tell me your grandfather did all that protested wyckoff because i know better there were a lot of others helped i read about it in a book i am not grudging glory to others returned david i am only saying i am proud that i am a descendant of a revolutionist wyckoff dived into his inner pocket and produced a leather photograph frame that folded like a concertina i dont want to be a descendant he said id rather be an ancestor look at those proudly he exhibited photographs of mrs wyckoff with the baby and of three other little wyckoffs david looked with envy at the children when im married he stammered and at the words he blushed i hope to be an ancestor if youre thinking of getting married said wyckoff youd better hope for a raise in salary the other clerks were as unsympathetic as wyckoff at first when david showed them his parchment certificate and his silver gilt insignia with on one side a portrait of washington and on the other a continental soldier they admitted it was dead swell they even envied him not the grandfather but the fact that owing to that distinguished relative david was constantly receiving beautifully engraved invitations to attend the monthly meetings of the society to subscribe to a fund to erect monuments on battlefields to mark neglected graves to join in joyous excursions to the tomb of washington or of john paul jones to inspect west point annapolis and bunker hill to be among those present at the annual banquet at delmonicos in order that when he opened these letters he might have an audience he had given the society his office address in these communications he was always addressed as dear compatriot and never did the words fail to give him a thrill they seemed to lift him out of burdetts salesrooms and broadway and place him next to things uncommercial untainted high and noble he did not quite know what an aristocrat was but be believed being a compatriot made him an aristocrat when customers were rude when mr john or mr robert was overbearing this idea enabled david to rise above their illtemper and he would smile and say to himself if they knew the meaning of the blue rosette in my buttonhole how differently they would treat me how easily with a word could i crush them but few of the customers recognized the significance of the button they thought it meant that david belonged to the y m c a or was a teetotaler david with his gentle manners and pale ascetic face was liable to give that impression when wyckoff mentioned marriage the reason david blushed was because although no one in the office suspected it he wished to marry the person in whom the office took the greatest pride this was miss emily anthony one of burdett and sons youngest most efficient and prettiest stenographers and although david did not cut as dashing a figure as did some of the firms travelling men miss anthony had found something in him so greatly to admire that she had out of office hours accepted his devotion his theatre tickets and an engagement ring indeed so far had matters progressed that it had been almost decided when in a few months they would go upon their vacations they also would go upon their honeymoon and then a cloud had come between them and from a quarter from which david had expected only sunshine the trouble befell when david discovered he had a greatgreatgrandfather with that fact itself miss anthony was almost as pleased as was david himself but while he was content to bask in anothers glory miss anthony saw in his inheritance only an incentive to achieve glory for himself from a hardworking salesman she had asked but little but from a descendant of a national hero she expected other things she was a determined young person and for david she was an ambitious young person she found she was dissatisfied she found she was disappointed the greatgreatgrandfather had opened up a new horizon had in a way raised the standard she was as fond of david as always but his tales of past wars and battles his accounts of present banquets at which he sat shoulder to shoulder with men of whom even burdett and sons spoke with awe touched her imagination you shouldnt be content to just wear a button she urged if youre a son of washington you ought to act like one i know im not worthy of you david sighed i dont mean that and you know i dont emily replied indignantly it has nothing to do with me i want you to be worthy of yourself of your grandpa hiram but how complained david what chance has a twentyfive dollar a week clerk it was a year before the spanishamerican war while the patriots of cuba were fighting the mother country for their independence if i were a son of the revolution said emily id go to cuba and help free it dont talk nonsense cried david if i did that id lose my job and wed never be able to marry besides whats cuba done for me all i know about cuba is i once smoked a cuban cigar and it made me ill did lafayette talk like that demanded emily did he ask what have the american rebels ever done for me if i were in lafayettes class sighed david i wouldnt be selling automatic punches theres your trouble declared emily you lack selfconfidence youre too humble youve got fighting blood and you ought to keep saying to yourself blood will tell and the first thing you know it will tell you might begin by going into politics in your ward or you could join the militia that takes only one night a week and then if we did go to war with spain youd get a commission and come back a captain emilys eyes were beautiful with delight but the sight gave david no pleasure in genuine distress he shook his head emily he said youre going to be awfully disappointed in me emilys eyes closed as though they shied at some mental picture but when she opened them they were bright and her smile was kind and eager no im not she protested only i want a husband with a career and one wholl tell me to keep quiet when i try to run it for him ive often wished you would said david would what run your career for you no keep quiet only it didnt seem polite to tell you so maybe id like you better said emily if you werent so darned polite a week later early in the spring of the unexpected happened and david was promoted into the flying squadron he now was a travelling salesman with a rise in salary and a commission on orders it was a step forward but as going on the road meant absence from emily david was not elated nor did it satisfy emily it was not money she wanted her ambition for david could not be silenced with a raise in wages she did not say this but david knew that in him she still found something lacking and when they said goodby they both were ill at ease and completely unhappy formerly each day when emily in passing david in the office said goodmorning she used to add the number of the days that still separated them from the vacation which also was to be their honeymoon but for the last month she had stopped counting the days at least she did not count them aloud david did not ask her why this was so he did not dare and sooner than learn the truth that she had decided not to marry him or that she was even considering not marrying him he asked no questions but in ignorance of her present feelings set forth on his travels absence from emily hurt just as much as he had feared it would he missed her needed her longed for her in numerous letters he told her so but owing to the frequency with which he moved her letters never caught up with him it was almost a relief he did not care to think of what they might tell him the route assigned david took him through the south and kept him close to the atlantic seaboard in obtaining orders he was not unsuccessful and at the end of the first month received from the firm a telegram of congratulation this was of importance chiefly because it might please emily but he knew that in her eyes the greatgreatgrandson of hiram greene could not rest content with a telegram from burdett and sons a year before she would have considered it a high honor a cause for celebration now he could see her press her pretty lips together and shake her pretty head it was not enough but how could he accomplish more he began to hate his greatgreatgrandfather he began to wish hiram greene had lived and died a bachelor and then dame fortune took david in hand and toyed with him and spanked him and pelted and petted him until finally she made him her favorite son dame fortune went about this work in an abrupt and arbitrary manner on the night of the st of march two trains were scheduled to leave the union station at jacksonville at exactly the same minute and they left exactly on time as never before in the history of any southern railroad has this miracle occurred it shows that when dame fortune gets on the job she is omnipotent she placed david on the train to miami as the train he wanted drew out for tampa and an hour later when the conductor looked at davids ticket he pulled the bellcord and dumped david over the side into the heart of a pine forest if he walked back along the track for one mile the conductor reassured him he would find a flag station where at midnight he could flag a train going north in an hour it would deliver him safely in jacksonville there was a moon but for the greater part of the time it was hidden by fitful hurrying clouds and as david stumbled forward at one moment he would see the rails like streaks of silver and the next would be encompassed in a complete and bewildering darkness he made his way from tie to tie only by feeling with his foot after an hour he came to a shed whether it was or was not the flag station the conductor had in mind he did not know and he never did know he was too tired too hot and too disgusted to proceed and dropping his suit case he sat down under the open roof of the shed prepared to wait either for the train or daylight so far as he could see on every side of him stretched a swamp silent dismal interminable from its black water rose dead trees naked of bark and hung with streamers of funereal moss there was not a sound or sign of human habitation the silence was the silence of the ocean at night david remembered the berth reserved for him on the train to tampa and of the loathing with which he had considered placing himself between its sheets but now how gladly would he welcome it for in the sleepingcar illsmelling close and stuffy he at least would have been surrounded by fellowsufferers of his own species here his companions were owls watersnakes and sleeping buzzards i am alone he told himself on a railroad embankment entirely surrounded by alligators and then he found he was not alone in the darkness illuminated by a match not a hundred yards from him there flashed suddenly the face of a man then the match went out and the face with it david noted that it had appeared at some height above the level of the swamp at an elevation higher even than that of the embankment it was as though the man had been sitting on the limb of a tree david crossed the tracks and found that on the side of the embankment opposite the shed there was solid ground and what once had been a wharf he advanced over this cautiously and as he did so the clouds disappeared and in the full light of the moon he saw a bayou broadening into a river and made fast to the decayed and rotting wharf an oceangoing tug it was from her deck that the man in lighting his pipe had shown his face at the thought of a warm engineroom and the company of his fellow creatures davids heart leaped with pleasure he advanced quickly and then something in the appearance of the tug something mysterious secretive threatening caused him to halt no lights showed from her engineroom cabin or pilothouse her decks were empty but as was evidenced by the black smoke that rose from her funnel she was awake and awake to some purpose david stood uncertainly questioning whether to make his presence known or return to the loneliness of the shed the question was decided for him he had not considered that standing in the moonlight he was a conspicuous figure the planks of the wharf creaked and a man came toward him as one who means to attack or who fears attack he approached warily he wore high boots riding breeches and a sombrero he was a little man but his movements were alert and active to david he seemed unnecessarily excited he thrust himself close against david who the devil are you demanded the man from the tug howd you get here i walked said david walked the man snorted incredulously i took the wrong train explained david pleasantly they put me off about a mile below here i walked back to this flag station im going to wait here for the next train north the little man laughed mockingly oh no youre not he said if you walked here you can just walk away again with a sweep of his arm he made a vigorous and peremptory gesture you walk he commanded ill do just as i please about that said david as though to bring assistance the little man started hastily toward the tug ill find some one wholl make you walk he called you wait thats all you wait david decided not to wait it was possible the wharf was private property and he had been trespassing in any case at the flag station the rights of all men were equal and if he were in for a fight he judged it best to choose his own battleground he recrossed the tracks and sat down on his suit case in a dark corner of the shed himself hidden in the shadows he could see in the moonlight the approach of any other person theyre river pirates said david to himself or smugglers theyre certainly up to some mischief or why should they object to the presence of a perfectly harmless stranger partly with cold partly with nervousness david shivered i wish that train would come he sighed and instantly as though in answer to his wish from only a short distance down the track he heard the rumble and creak of approaching cars in a flash david planned his course of action the thought of spending the night in a swamp infested by alligators and smugglers had become intolerable he must escape and he must escape by the train now approaching to that end the train must be stopped his plan was simple the train was moving very very slowly and though he had no lantern to wave in order to bring it to a halt he need only stand on the track exposed to the glare of the headlight and wave his arms david sprang between the rails and gesticulated wildly but in amazement his arms fell to his sides for the train now only a hundred yards distant and creeping toward him at a snails pace carried no headlight and though in the moonlight david was plainly visible it blew no whistle tolled no bell even the passenger coaches in the rear of the sightless engine were wrapped in darkness it was a ghost of a train a flying dutchman of a train a nightmare of a train it was as unreal as the black swamp as the moss on the dead trees as the ghostly tugboat tied to the rotting wharf is the place haunted exclaimed david he was answered by the grinding of brakes and by the train coming to a sharp halt and instantly from every side men fell from it to the ground and the silence of the night was broken by a confusion of calls and eager greeting and questions and sharp words of command so fascinated was david in the stealthy arrival of the train and in her mysterious passengers that until they confronted him he did not note the equally stealthy approach of three men of these one was the little man from the tug with him was a fat redfaced irishamerican he wore no coat and his shirtsleeves were drawn away from his hands by garters of pink elastic his derby hat was balanced behind his ears upon his right hand flashed an enormous diamond he looked as though but at that moment he had stopped sliding glasses across a bowery bar the third man carried the outward marks of a sailor david believed he was the tallest man he had ever beheld but equally remarkable with his height was his beard and hair which were of a fierce brickdust red even in the mild moonlight it flamed like a torch whats your business demanded the man with the flamboyant hair i came here began david to wait for a train the tall man bellowed with indignant rage yes he shouted this is the sort of place any one would pick out to wait for a train in front of davids nose he shook a fist as large as a catchers glove dont you lie to me he bullied do you know who i am do you know who youre up against im the barkeeper person interrupted never mind who you are he said we know that find out who he is david turned appealingly to the barkeeper do you suppose id come here on purpose he protested im a travelling man you wont travel any tonight mocked the redhaired one youve seen what you came to see and all you want now is to get to a western union wire well you dont do it you dont leave here tonight as though he thought he had been neglected the little man in ridingboots pushed forward importantly tie him to a tree he suggested better take him on board said the barkeeper and send him back by the pilot when were once at sea he cant hurt us any what makes you think i want to hurt you demanded david who do you think i am we know who you are shouted the fieryheaded one youre a blankettyblank spy youre a government spy or a spanish spy and whichever you are you dont get away tonight david had not the faintest idea what the man meant but he knew his selfrespect was being illtreated and his selfrespect rebelled you have made a very serious mistake he said and whether you like it or not i am leaving here tonight and you can go to the devil turning his back david started with great dignity to walk away it was a short walk something hit him below the ear and he found himself curling up comfortably on the ties he had a strong desire to sleep but was conscious that a bed on a railroad track on account of trains wanting to pass was unsafe this doubt did not long disturb him his head rolled against the steel rail his limbs relaxed from a great distance and in a strange singsong he heard the voice of the barkeeper saying nine ten and out when david came to his senses his head was resting on a coil of rope in his ears was the steady throb of an engine and in his eyes the glare of a lantern the lantern was held by a pleasantfaced youth in a golf cap who was smiling sympathetically david rose on his elbow and gazed wildly about him he was in the bow of the oceangoing tug and he saw that from where he lay in the bow to her stern her decks were packed with men she was steaming swiftly down a broad river on either side the gray light that comes before the dawn showed low banks studded with stunted palmettos close ahead david heard the roar of the surf sorry to disturb you said the youth in the golf cap but we drop the pilot in a few minutes and youre going with him david moved his aching head gingerly and was conscious of a bump as large as a tennis ball behind his right ear what happened to me he demanded you were sort of kidnapped i guess laughed the young man it was a raw deal but they couldnt take any chances the pilot will land you at okra point you can hire a rig there to take you to the railroad but why demanded david indignantly why was i kidnapped what had i done who were those men who from the pilothouse there was a sharp jangle of bells to the engineroom and the speed of the tug slackened come on commanded the young man briskly the pilots going ashore heres your grip heres your hat the ladders on the port side look where youre stepping we cant show any lights and its dark as but even as he spoke like a flash of powder as swiftly as one throws an electric switch as blindingly as a train leaps from the tunnel into the glaring sun the darkness vanished and the tug was swept by the fierce blatant radiance of a searchlight it was met by shrieks from two hundred throats by screams oaths prayers by the sharp jangling of bells by the blind rush of many men scurrying like rats for a hole to hide in by the ringing orders of one man above the tumult this one voice rose like the warning strokes of a firegong and looking up to the pilothouse from whence the voice came david saw the barkeeper still in his shirtsleeves and with his derby hat pushed back behind his ears with one hand clutching the telegraph to the engineroom with the other holding the spoke of the wheel david felt the tug like a hunter taking a fence rise in a great leap her bow sank and rose tossing the water from her in black oily waves the smoke poured from her funnel from below her engines sobbed and quivered and like a hound freed from a leash she raced for the open sea but swiftly as she fled as a thief is held in the circle of a policemans bullseye the shaft of light followed and exposed her and held her in its grip the youth in the golf cap was clutching david by the arm with his free hand he pointed down the shaft of light so great was the tumult that to be heard he brought his lips close to davids ear thats the revenue cutter he shouted shes been laying for us for three weeks and now he shrieked exultingly the old mans going to give her a race for it from excitement from cold from alarm davids nerves were getting beyond his control but how he demanded how do i get ashore you dont when he drops the pilot dont i how can he drop the pilot yelled the youth the pilots got to stick by the boat so have you david clutched the young man and swung him so that they stood face to face stick by what boat yelled david who are these men who are you what boat is this in the glare of the searchlight david saw the eyes of the youth staring at him as though he feared he were in the clutch of a madman wrenching himself free the youth pointed at the pilothouse above it on a blue board in letters of goldleaf a foot high was the name of the tug as david read it his breath left him a finger of ice passed slowly down his spine the name he read was the three friends the three friends shrieked david shes a filibuster shes a pirate wherere we going to cuba david emitted a howl of anguish rage and protest what for he shrieked the young man regarded him coldly to pick bananas he said i wont go to cuba shouted david ive got to work im paid to sell machinery i demand to be put ashore ill lose my job if im not put ashore ill sue you ill have the law david found himself suddenly upon his knees his first thought was that the ship had struck a rock and then that she was bumping herself over a succession of coral reefs she dipped dived reared and plunged like a hooked fish she flung herself in the air quivering from bow to stern no longer was david of a mind to sue the filibusters if they did not put him ashore if only they had put him ashore in gratitude he would have crawled on his knees what followed was of no interest to david nor to many of the filibusters nor to any of the cuban patriots their groans of selfpity their prayers and curses in eloquent spanish rose high above the crash of broken crockery and the pounding of the waves even when the searchlight gave way to a brilliant sunlight the circumstance was unobserved by david nor was he concerned in the tidings brought forward by the youth in the golf cap who raced the slippery decks and vaulted the prostrate forms as surefootedly as a hurdler on a cinder track to david in whom he seemed to think he had found a congenial spirit he shouted joyfully shes fired two blanks at us he cried now shes firing cannonballs thank god whispered david perhaps shell sink us but the three friends showed her heels to the revenue cutter and so far as david knew hours passed into days and days into weeks it was like those nightmares in which in a minute one is whirled through centuries of fear and torment sometimes regardless of nausea of his aching head of the hard deck of the waves that splashed and smothered him david fell into broken slumber sometimes he woke to a dull consciousness of his position at such moments he added to his misery by speculating upon the other misfortunes that might have befallen him on shore emily he decided had given him up for lost and married probably a navy officer in command of a battleship burdett and sons had cast him off forever possibly his disappearance had caused them to suspect him even now they might be regarding him as a defaulter as a fugitive from justice his accounts no doubt were being carefully overhauled in actual time two days and two nights had passed to david it seemed many ages on the third day he crawled to the stern where there seemed less motion and finding a boats cushion threw it in the lee scupper and fell upon it from time to time the youth in the golf cap had brought him food and drink and he now appeared from the cooks galley bearing a bowl of smoking soup david considered it a doubtful attention but he said youre very kind how did a fellow like you come to mix up with these pirates the youth laughed goodnaturedly theyre not pirates theyre patriots he said and im not mixed up with them my name is henry carr and im a guest of jimmy doyle the captain the barkeeper with the derby hat said david hes not a barkeeper hes a teetotaler carr corrected and hes the greatest filibuster alive he knows these waters as you know broadway and hes the salt of the earth i did him a favor once sort of mousehelpingthelion idea just through dumb luck i found out about this expedition the government agents in new york found out id found out and sent for me to tell but i didnt and i didnt write the story either doyle heard about that so he asked me to come as his guest and hes promised that after hes landed the expedition and the arms i can write as much about it as i darn please then youre a reporter said david im what we call a cub reporter laughed carr you see ive always dreamed of being a war correspondent the men in the office say i dream too much theyre always guying me about it but havent you noticed its the ones who dream who find their dreams come true now this isnt real war but its a near war and when the real thing breaks loose i can tell the managing editor i served as a war correspondent in the cubanspanish campaign and he may give me a real job and you like this groaned david i wouldnt if i were as sick as you are said carr but ive a stomach like a harlem goat he stooped and lowered his voice now here are two fake filibusters he whispered the men you read about in the newspapers if a mans a real filibuster nobody knows it coming toward them was the tall man who had knocked david out and the little one who had wanted to tie him to a tree all they ask whispered carr is money and advertisement if they knew i was a reporter theyd eat out of my hand the tall man calls himself lighthouse harry he once kept a lighthouse on the florida coast and thats as near to the sea as he ever got the other one is a daredevil calling himself colonel beamish he says hes an english officer and a soldier of fortune and that hes been in eighteen battles jimmy says hes never been near enough to a battle to see the redcross flags on the base hospital but theyve fooled these cubans the junta thinks theyre great fighters and its sent them down here to work the machine guns but im afraid the only fighting they will do will be in the sporting columns and not in the ring a half dozen seasick cubans were carrying a heavy oblong box they dropped it not two yards from where david lay and with a screwdriver lighthouse harry proceeded to open the lid carr explained to david that the three friends was approaching that part of the coast of cuba on which she had arranged to land her expedition and that in case she was surprised by one of the spanish patrol boats she was preparing to defend herself theyve got an automatic gun in that crate said carr and theyre going to assemble it youd better move theyll be tramping all over you david shook his head feebly i cant move he protested i wouldnt move if it would free cuba for several hours with very languid interest david watched lighthouse harry and colonel beamish screw a heavy tripod to the deck and balance above it a quickfiring onepounder they worked very slowly and to david watching them from the lee scupper they appeared extremely unintelligent i dont believe either of those thugs put an automatic gun together in his life he whispered to carr i never did either but ive put hundreds of automatic punches together and i bet that gun wont work whats wrong with it said carr before david could summon sufficient energy to answer the attention of all on board was diverted and by a single word whether the word is whispered apologetically by the smokingroom steward to those deep in bridge or shrieked from the tops of a sinking ship it never quite fails of its effect a sweating stoker from the engineroom saw it first land he hailed the seasick cubans raised themselves and swung their hats their voices rose in a fierce chorus cuba libre they yelled the sun piercing the morning mists had uncovered a coastline broken with bays and inlets above it towered green hills the peak of each topped by a squat blockhouse in the valleys and water courses like columns of marble rose the royal palms you must look carr entreated david its just as it is in the pictures then i dont have to look groaned david the three friends was making for a point of land that curved like a sickle on the inside of the sickle was nipe bay on the opposite shore of that broad harbor at the place of rendezvous a little band of cubans waited to receive the filibusters the goal was in sight the dreadful voyage was done joy and excitement thrilled the ships company cuban patriots appeared in uniforms with cuban flags pinned in the brims of their straw sombreros from the hold came boxes of smallarm ammunition of mausers rifles machetes and saddles to protect the landing a box of shells was placed in readiness beside the onepounder in two hours if we have smooth water shouted lighthouse harry we ought to get all of this on shore and then all i ask he cried mightily is for some one to kindly show me a spaniard his hearts desire was instantly granted he was shown not only one spaniard but several spaniards they were on the deck of one of the fastest gunboats of the spanish navy not a mile from the three friends she sprang from the cover of a narrow inlet she did not signal questions or extend courtesies for her the name of the oceangoing tug was sufficient introduction throwing ahead of her a solid shell she raced in pursuit and as the three friends leaped to full speed there came from the gunboat the sharp dry crackle of mausers with an explosion of terrifying oaths lighthouse harry thrust a shell into the breech of the quickfiring gun without waiting to aim it he tugged at the trigger nothing happened he threw open the breech and gazed impotently at the base of the shell it was untouched the ship was ringing with cries of anger of hate with ratlike squeaks of fear above the heads of the filibusters a shell screamed and within a hundred feet splashed into a wave from his mat in the lee scupper david groaned miserably he was far removed from any of the greater emotions its no use he protested they cant do its not connected whats not connected yelled carr he fell upon david he halflifted halfdragged him to his feet if you know whats wrong with that gun you fix it fix it he shouted or ill david was not concerned with the vengeance carr threatened for on the instant a miracle had taken place with the swift insidiousness of morphine peace ran through his veins soothed his racked body his jangled nerves the three friends had made the harbor and was gliding through water flat as a pond but david did not know why the change had come he knew only that his soul and body were at rest that the sun was shining that he had passed through the valley of the shadow and once more was a sane sound young man with a savage thrust of the shoulder he sent lighthouse harry sprawling from the gun with swift practised fingers he fell upon its mechanism he wrenched it apart he lifted it reset readjusted it ignorant themselves those about him saw that he understood saw that his work was good they raised a joyous defiant cheer but a shower of bullets drove them to cover bullets that ripped the deck splintered the superstructure smashed the glass in the air ports like angry wasps sang in a continuous whining chorus intent only on the gun david worked feverishly he swung to the breech locked it and dragged it open pulled on the trigger and found it gave before his forefinger he shouted with delight ive got it working he yelled he turned to his audience but his audience had fled from beneath one of the lifeboats protruded the ridingboots of colonel beamish the tall form of lighthouse harry was doubled behind a water butt a shell splashed to port a shell splashed to starboard for an instant david stood staring wideeyed at the greyhound of a boat that ate up the distance between them at the jets of smoke and stabs of flame that sprang from her bow at the figures crouched behind her gunwale firing in volleys to david it came suddenly convincingly that in a dream he had lived it all before and something like raw poison stirred in david something leaped to his throat and choked him something rose in his brain and made him see scarlet he felt rather than saw young carr kneeling at the box of ammunition and holding a shell toward him he heard the click as the breech shut felt the rubber tire of the brace give against the weight of his shoulder down a long shining tube saw the pursuing gunboat saw her again and many times disappear behind a flash of flame a bullet gashed his forehead a bullet passed deftly through his forearm but he did not heed them confused with the thrashing of the engines with the roar of the gun he heard a strange voice shrieking unceasingly cuba libre it yelled to hell with spain and he found that the voice was his own the story lost nothing in the way carr wrote it and the best of it is he exclaimed joyfully its true for a spanish gunboat had been crippled and forced to run herself aground by a tugboat manned by cuban patriots and by a single gun served by one man and that man an american it was the first seafight of the war over night a cuban navy had been born and into the limelight a cub reporter had projected a new hero a readymade warrantednottorun popular idol they were seated in the pilothouse jimmy doyle carr and david the patriots and their arms had been safely dumped upon the coast of cuba and the three friends was gliding swiftly and having caught the florida straits napping smoothly toward key west carr had just finished reading aloud his account of the engagement you will tell the story just as i have written it commanded the proud author your being south as a travelling salesman was only a blind you came to volunteer for this expedition before you could explain your wish you were mistaken for a secretservice man and hustled on board that was just where you wanted to be and when the moment arrived you took command of the ship and singlehanded won the naval battle of nipe bay jimmy doyle nodded his head approvingly you certainty did dave protested the great man i seen you when you done it at key west carr filed his story and while the hospital surgeons kept david there over one steamer to dress his wounds his fame and features spread across the map of the united states burdett and sons basked in reflected glory reporters besieged their office at the merchants downtown club the business men of lower broadway tendered congratulations of course its a great surprise to us burdett and sons would protest and wink heavily of course when the boy asked to be sent south wed no idea he was planning to fight for cuba or we wouldnt have let him go would we then again they would wink heavily i suppose you know they would say that hes a direct descendant of general hiram greene who won the battle of trenton what i say is blood will tell and then in a body every one in the club would move against the bar and exclaim heres to cuba libre when the olivette from key west reached tampa bay every cuban in the tampa cigar factories was at the dock there were thousands of them and all of the junta in high hats to read david an address of welcome and when they saw him at the top of the gangplank with his head in a bandage and his arm in a sling like a mob of maniacs they howled and surged toward him but before they could reach their hero the courteous junta forced them back and cleared a pathway for a young girl she was travelworn and pale her shirtwaist was disgracefully wrinkled her best hat was a wreck no one on broadway would have recognized her as burdett and sons most immaculate and beautiful stenographer she dug the shapeless hat into davids shoulder and clung to him david she sobbed promise me youll never never do it again chapter the sailorman before latimer put him on watch the nantucket sailorman had not a care in the world if the wind blew from the north he spun to the left if it came from the south he spun to the right but it was entirely the wind that was responsible so whichever way he turned he smiled broadly happily his outlook upon the world was that of one who loved his fellowman he had many brothers as like him as twins all over nantucket and cape cod and the north shore smiling from the railings of verandas from the roofs of bungalows from the eaves of summer palaces empaled on their little iron uprights each sailorman whirled sometimes languidly like a great lady revolving to the slow measures of a waltz sometimes so rapidly that he made you quite dizzy and had he not been a sailorman with a heart of oak and a head and stomach of pine he would have been quite seasick but the particular sailorman that latimer bought for helen page and put on sentry duty carried on his shoulders most grave and unusual responsibilities he was the guardian of a buried treasure the keeper of the happiness of two young people it was really asking a great deal of a carefree happygolucky weathervane every summer from boston helen pages people had been coming to fair harbor they knew it when what now is the polo field was their cow pasture and whether at the age of twelve or of twenty or more helen page ruled fair harbor when she arrived the season opened when she departed the local tradespeople sighed and began to take account of stock she was so popular because she possessed charm and because she played no favorites to the grooms who held the ponies on the sidelines her manner was just as simple and interested as it was to the gilded youths who came to win the championship cups and remained to try to win helen she was just as genuinely pleased to make a four at tennis with the kids as to take tea on the veranda of the clubhouse with the matrons to each her manner was always as though she were of their age when she met the latter on the beach road she greeted them riotously and joyfully by their maiden names and the matrons liked it in comparison the deference shown them by the other young women did not so strongly appeal when im jogging along in my station wagon said one of them and helen shrieks and waves at me from her car i feel as though i were twenty and i believe that she is really sorry i am not sitting beside her instead of that goodlooking latimer man who never wears a hat why does he never wear a hat because he knows hes goodlooking or because helen drives so fast he cant keep it on does he wear a hat when he is not with helen asked the new arrival that might help some we will never know exclaimed the young matron he never leaves her this was so true that it had become a public scandal you met them so many times a day driving together motoring together playing golf together that you were embarrassed for them and did not know which way to look but they gloried in their shame if you tactfully pretended not to see them helen shouted at you she made you feel you had been caught doing something indelicate and underhand the mothers of fair harbor were rather slow in accepting young latimer so many of their sons had seen helen shake her head in that inarticulate worried way and look so sorry for them that any strange young man who apparently succeeded where those who had been her friends for years had learned they must remain friends could not hope to escape criticism besides they did not know him he did not come from boston and harvard but from a western city they were told that at home at both the law and the game of politics he worked hard and successfully but it was rather held against him by the youth of fair harbor that he played at there games not so much for the sake of the game as for exercise he put aside many things such as whiskey and soda at two in the morning and bridge all afternoon with the remark i find it does not tend toward efficiency it was a remark that irritated and to the minds of the men at the country clubs seemed to place him they liked to play polo because they liked to play polo not because it kept their muscles limber and their brains clear some western people were telling me said one of the matrons that he wants to be the next lieutenantgovernor they say he is very ambitious and very selfish any man is selfish protested one who for years had attempted to marry helen who wants to keep helen to himself but that he should wish to be a lieutenantgovernor too is rather an anticlimax it makes one lose sympathy latimer went on his way without asking any sympathy the companionship of helen page was quite sufficient he had been working overtime and was treating himself to his first vacation in years he was young he was in love and he was very happy nor was there any question either that helen page was happy those who had known her since she was a child could not remember when she had not been happy but these days she wore her joyousness with a difference it was in her eyes in her greetings to old friends it showed itself hourly in courtesies and kindnesses she was very kind to latimer too she did not deceive him she told him she liked better to be with him than with any one else it would have been difficult to deny to him what was apparent to an entire summer colony but she explained that that did not mean she would marry him she announced this when the signs she knew made it seem necessary she announced it in what was for her a roundabout way by remarking suddenly that she did not intend to marry for several years this brought latimer to his feet and called forth from him remarks so eloquent that helen found it very difficult to keep her own she as though she had been caught in an undertow and was being whirled out to sea when at last she had regained her breath only because latimer had paused to catch his she shook her head miserably the trouble is she complained there are so many think the same thing what do they think demanded latimer that they want to marry me checked but not discouraged latimer attacked in force i can quite believe that he agreed but theres this important difference no matter how much a man wants to marry you he cant love you as i do thats another thing they think sighed helen im sorry to be so unoriginal snapped latimer please dont pleaded helen i dont mean to be unfeeling im not unfeeling im only trying to be fair if i dont seem to take it to heart its because i know it does no good i can see how miserable a girl must be if she is loved by one man and cant make up her mind whether or not she wants to marry him but when theres so many she just stops worrying for she cant possibly marry them all all exclaimed latimer it is incredible that i have undervalued you but may i ask how many there are i dont know sighed helen miserably there seems to be something about me that there is interrupted latimer ive noticed it you dont have to tell me about it i know that the helen page habit is a damned difficult habit to break it cannot be said that he made any violent effort to break it at least not one that was obvious to fair harbor or to helen one of their favorite drives was through the pine woods to the point on which stood the lighthouse and on one of these excursions they explored a forgotten wood road and came out upon a cliff the cliff overlooked the sea and below it was a jumble of rocks with which the waves played hide and seek on many afternoons and mornings they returned to this place and while latimer read to her helen would sit with her back to a tree and toss pinecones into the water sometimes the poets whose works he read made love so charmingly that latimer was most grateful to them for rendering such excellent first aid to the wounded and into his voice he would throw all that feeling and music that from juries and mass meetings had dragged tears and cheers and votes but when his voice became so appealing that it no longer was possible for any woman to resist it helen would exclaim excitedly please excuse me for interrupting but there is a large spider and the spell was gone one day she exclaimed oh and latimer patiently lowered the oxford book of verse and asked what is it now im so sorry helen said but i cant help watching that chapman boy hes only got one reef in and the next time he jibs hell capsize and he cant swim and hell drown i told his mother only yesterday i havent the least interest in the chapman boy said latimer or in what you told his mother or whether he drowns or not im a drowning man myself helen shook her head firmly and reprovingly men get over that kind of drowning she said not this kind of man doesnt said latimer and dont tell me he cried indignantly that thats another thing they all say if one could only be sure sighed helen if one could only be sure that you that the right man would keep on caring after you marry him the way he says he cares before you marry him if you could know that it would help you a lot in making up your mind there is only one way to find that out said latimer that is to marry him i mean of course he corrected hastily to marry me one day when on their way to the cliff at the end of the wood road the man who makes the nantucket sailor and peddles him passed through the village and latimer bought the sailorman and carried him to their hidingplace there he fastened him to the lowest limb of one of the ancient pinetrees that helped to screen their hidingplace from the world the limb reached out free of the other branches and the wind caught the sailorman fairly and spun him like a dancing dervish then it tired of him and went off to try to drown the chapman boy leaving the sailorman motionless with his arms outstretched balancing in each hand a tiny oar and smiling happily he has a friendly smile said helen i think he likes us he is on guard latimer explained i put him there to warn us if any one approaches and when we are not here he is to frighten away trespassers do you understand he demanded of the sailorman your duty is to protect this beautiful lady so long as i love her you must guard this place it is a life sentence you are always on watch you never sleep you are her slave she says you have a friendly smile she wrongs you it is a beseeching abject worshipping smile i am sure when i look at her mine is equally idiotic in fact we are in many ways alike i also am her slave i also am devoted only to her service and i never sleep at least not since i met her from her throne among the pine needles helen looked up at the sailorman and frowned it is not a happy simile she objected for one thing a sailorman has a sweetheart in every port wait and see said latimer and continued the girl with some asperity if there is anything on earth that changes its mind as often as a weathervane that is less certain less constant constant latimer laughed at her in open scorn you come back here he challenged months from now years from now when the winds have beaten him and the sun blistered him and the snow frozen him and you will find him smiling at you just as he is now just as confidently proudly joyously devotedly because those who are your slaves those who love you cannot come to any harm only if you disown them only if you drive them away the sailorman delighted at such beautiful language threw himself about in a delirium of joy his arms spun in their sockets like indian clubs his oars flashed in the sun and his eyes and lips were fixed in one blissful longdrawnout unalterable smile when the goldenrod turned gray and the leaves red and yellow and it was time for latimer to return to his work in the west he came to say goodby but the best helen could do to keep hope alive in him was to say that she was glad he cared she added it was very helpful to think that a man such as he believed you were so fine a person and during the coming winter she would try to be like the fine person he believed her to be but which she assured him she was not then he told her again she was the most wonderful being in the world to which she said oh indeed no and then as though he were giving her a cue he said goodby but she did not take up his cue and they shook hands he waited hardly daring to breathe surely now that the parting has come he assured himself she will make some sign she will give me a word a look that will write total under the hours we have spent together that will help to carry me through the long winter but he held her hand so long and looked at her so hungrily that he really forced her to say dont miss your train which kind consideration for his comfort did not delight him as it should nor indeed later did she herself recall the remark with satisfaction with latimer out of the way the other two hundred and fortynine suitor attacked with renewed hope among other advantages they had over latimer was that they were on the ground they saw helen daily at dinners dances at the country clubs in her own drawingroom like any sailor from the charlestown navy yard and his sweetheart they could walk beside her in the park and throw peanuts to the pigeons and scratch dates and initials on the green benches they could walk with her up one side of commonwealth avenue and down the south bank of the charles when the sun was gilding the dome of the state house when the bridges were beginning to deck themselves with necklaces of lights they had known her since they wore knickerbockers and they shared many interests and friends in common they talked the same language latimer could talk to her only in letters for with her he shared no friends or interests and he was forced to choose between telling her of his lawsuits and his efforts in politics or of his love to write to her of his affairs seemed wasteful and impertinent and of his love for her after she had received what he told of it in silence he was too proud to speak so he wrote but seldom and then only to say you know what i send you had he known it his best letters were those he did not send when in the morning mail helen found his familiar handwriting that seemed to stand out like the face of a friend in a crowd she would pounce upon the letter read it and assured of his love would go on her way rejoicing but when in the morning there was no letter she wondered why and all day she wondered why and the next morning when again she was disappointed her thoughts of latimer and her doubts and speculations concerning him shut out every other interest he became a perplexing insistent problem he was never out of her mind and then he would spoil it all by writing her that he loved her and that of all the women in the world she was the only one and reassured upon that point helen happily and promptly would forget all about him but when she remembered him although months had passed since she had seen him she remembered him much more distinctly much more gratefully than that one of the two hundred and fifty with whom she had walked that same afternoon latimer could not know it but of that anxious multitude he was first and there was no second at least helen hoped when she was ready to marry she would love latimer enough to want to marry him but as yet she assured herself she did not want to marry any one as she was life was very satisfactory everybody loved her everybody invited her to be of his party or invited himself to join hers and the object of each seemed to be to see that she enjoyed every hour of every day her nature was such that to make her happy was not difficult some of her devotees could do it by giving her a dance and letting her invite half of boston and her kid brother could do it by taking her to cambridge to watch the team at practice she thought she was happy because she was free as a matter of fact she was happy because she loved some one and that particular some one loved her her being free was only her mistaken way of putting it had she thought she had lost latimer and his love she would have discovered that so far from being free she was bound hand and foot and heart and soul but she did not know that and latimer did not know that meanwhile from the branch of the tree in the sheltered secret hidingplace that overlooked the ocean the sailorman kept watch the sun had blistered him the storms had buffeted him the snow had frozen upon his shoulders but his loyalty never relaxed he spun to the north he spun to the south and so rapidly did he scan the surrounding landscape that no one could hope to creep upon him unawares nor indeed did any one attempt to do so once a fox stole into the secret hidingplace but the sailorman flapped his oars and frightened him away he was always triumphant to birds to squirrels to trespassing rabbits he was a thing of terror once when the air was still an impertinent crow perched on the very limb on which he stood and with scornful disapproving eyes surveyed his white trousers his blue reefer his red cheeks but when the wind suddenly drove past them the sailorman sprang into action and the crow screamed in alarm and darted away so alone and with no one to come to his relief the sailorman stood his watch about him the branches bent with the snow the icicles froze him into immobility and in the treetops strange groanings filled him with alarms but undaunted month after month alert and smiling he waited the return of the beautiful lady and of the tall young man who had devoured her with such beseeching unhappy eyes latimer found that to love a woman like helen page as he loved her was the best thing that could come into his life but to sit down and lament over the fact that she did not love him did not to use his favorite expression tend toward efficiency he removed from his sight the three pictures of her he had cut from illustrated papers and ceased to write to her in his last letter he said i have told you how it is and that is how it is always going to be there never has been there never can be any one but you but my love is too precious too sacred to be brought out every week in a letter and dangled before your eyes like an advertisement of a motorcar it is too wonderful a thing to be cheapened to be subjected to slights and silence if ever you should want it it is yours it is here waiting but you must tell me so i have done everything a man can do to make you understand but you do not want me or my love and my love says to me dont send me there again to have the door shut in my face keep me with you to be your inspiration to help you to live worthily and so it shall be when helen read that letter she did not know what to do she did not know how to answer it her first impression was that suddenly she had grown very old and that some one had turned off the sun and that in consequence the world had naturally grown cold and dark she could not see why the two hundred and fortynine expected her to keep on doing exactly the same things she had been doing with delight for six months and indeed for the last six years why could they not see that no longer was there any pleasure in them she would have written and told latimer that she found she loved him very dearly if in her mind there had not arisen a fearful doubt suppose his letter was not quite honest he said that he would always love her but how could she now know that why might not this letter be only his way of withdrawing from a position which he wished to abandon from which perhaps he was even glad to escape were this true and she wrote and said all those things that were in her heart that now she knew were true might she not hold him to her against his will the love that once he had for her might no longer exist and if in her turn she told him she loved him and had always loved him might he not in some mistaken spirit of chivalry feel it was his duty to pretend to care her cheeks burned at the thought it was intolerable she could not write that letter and as day succeeded day to do so became more difficult and so she never wrote and was very unhappy and latimer was very unhappy but he had his work and helen had none and for her life became a game of putting little things together like a picture puzzle an hour here and an hour there to make up each day it was a dreary game from time to time she heard of him through the newspapers for in his own state he was an insurgent making a fight the outcome of which was expected to show what might follow throughout the entire west when he won his fight much more was written about him and he became a national figure in his own state the people hailed him as the next governor promised him a seat in the senate to helen this seemed to take him further out of her life she wondered if now she held a place even in his thoughts at fair harbor the two hundred and fortynine used to joke with her about her politician then they considered latimer of importance only because helen liked him now they discussed him impersonally and over her head as though she were not present as a power an influence as the leader and exponent of a new idea they seemed to think she no longer could pretend to any peculiar claim upon him that now he belonged to all of them older men would say to her i hear you know latimer what sort of a man is he helen would not know what to tell them she could not say he was a man who sat with his back to a pinetree reading from a book of verse or halting to devour her with humble entreating eyes she went south for the winter the doctors deciding she was run down and needed the change and with an unhappy laugh at her own expense she agreed in their diagnosis she was indifferent as to where they sent her for she knew wherever she went she must still force herself to go on putting one hour on top of another until she had built up the inexorable and necessary twentyfour when she returned winter was departing but reluctantly and returning unexpectedly to cover the world with snow to eclipse the thin spring sunshine with cheerless clouds helen took herself seriously to task she assured herself it was weakminded to rebel the summer was coming and fair harbor with all its old delights was before her she compelled herself to take heart to accept the fact that after all the world is a pretty good place and that to think only of the past to live only on memories and regrets was not only cowardly and selfish but as latimer had already decided did not tend toward efficiency among the other rules of conduct that she imposed upon herself was not to think of latimer at least not during the waking hours should she as it sometimes happened dream of him should she imagine they were again seated among the pines riding across the downs or racing at fifty miles an hour through country roads with the stone fences flying past with the wind and the sun in their eyes and in their hearts happiness and content that would not be breaking her rule if she dreamed of him she could not be held responsible she could only be grateful and then just as she had banished him entirely from her mind he came east not as once he had planned to come only to see her but with a blare of trumpets at the command of many citizens as the guest of three cities he was to speak at public meetings to confer with party leaders to carry the war into the enemys country he was due to speak in boston at faneuil hall on the first of may and that same night to leave for the west and three days before his coming helen fled from the city he had spoken his message to philadelphia he had spoken to new york and for a week the papers had spoken only of him and for that week from the sight of his printed name from sketches of him exhorting cheering mobs from snapshots of him on rear platforms leaning forward to grasp eager hands helen had shut her eyes and that during the time he was actually in boston she might spare herself further and more direct attacks upon her feelings she escaped to fair harbor there to remain until on the first of may at midnight he again would pass out of her life maybe forever no one saw in her going any significance spring had come and in preparation for the summer season the house at fair harbor must be opened and set in order and the presence there of some one of the page family was easily explained she made the three hours run to fair harbor in her car driving it herself and as the familiar landfalls fell into place she doubted if it would not have been wiser had she stayed away for she found that the memories of more than twenty summers at fair harbor had been wiped out by those of one summer by those of one man the natives greeted her joyously the boatmen the fishermen her own grooms and gardeners the village postmaster the oldest inhabitant they welcomed her as though they were her vassals and she their queen but it was the one man she had exiled from fair harbor who at every turn wrung her heart and caused her throat to tighten she passed the cottage where he had lodged and hundreds of years seemed to have gone since she used to wait for him in the street blowing noisily on her automobile horn calling derisively to his open windows wherever she turned fair harbor spoke of him the golflinks the bathing beach the ugly corner in the main street where he always reminded her that it was better to go slow for ten seconds than to remain a long time dead the old house on the stone wharf where the schooners made fast which he intended to borrow for his honeymoon the wooden trough where they always drew rein to water the ponies the pond into which he had waded to bring her lilies on the second day of her stay she found she was passing these places purposely that to do so she was going out of her way they no longer distressed her but gave her a strange comfort they were old friends who had known her in the days when she was rich in happiness but the secret hidingplace their very own hidingplace the opening among the pines that overhung the jumble of rocks and the sea she could not bring herself to visit and then on the afternoon of the third day when she was driving alone toward the lighthouse her pony of his own accord from force of habit turned smartly into the wood road and again from force of habit before he reached the spot that overlooked the sea he came to a full stop there was no need to make him fast for hours stretching over many summer days he had stood under those same branches patiently waiting on foot her heart beating tremulously stepping reverently as one enters the aisle of some dim cathedral helen advanced into the sacred circle and then she stood quite still what she had expected to find there she could not have told but it was gone the place was unknown to her she saw an opening among gloomy pines empty silent unreal no haunted house no barren moor no neglected graveyard ever spoke more poignantly more mournfully with such utter hopelessness there was no sign of his or of her former presence across the open space something had passed its hand and it had changed what had been a trystingplace a bower a nest had become a tomb a tomb she felt for something that once had been brave fine and beautiful but which now was dead she had but one desire to escape from the place to put it away from her forever to remember it not as she now found it but as first she had remembered it and as now she must always remember it she turned softly on tiptoe as one who has intruded on a shrine but before she could escape there came from the sea a sudden gust of wind that caught her by the skirts and drew her back that set the branches tossing and swept the dead leaves racing about her ankles and at the same instant from just above her head there beat upon the air a violent joyous tattoo a sound that was neither of the sea nor of the woods a creaking swiftly repeated sound like the flutter of caged wings helen turned in alarm and raised her eyes and beheld the sailorman tossing his arms in a delirious welcome waltzing in a frenzy of joy calling her back to him with wild beckonings she saw him smiling down at her with the same radiant beseeching worshipping smile in helens ears latimers commands to the sailorman rang as clearly as though latimer stood before her and had just spoken only now they were no longer a jest they were a vow a promise an oath of allegiance that brought to her peace and pride and happiness so long as i love this beautiful lady had been his foolish words you will guard this place it is a life sentence with one hand helen page dragged down the branch on which the sailorman stood with the other she snatched him from his post of duty with a joyous laugh that was a sob she clutched the sailorman in both her hands and kissed the beseeching worshipping smile an hour later her car on its way to boston passed through fair harbor at a rate of speed that caused her chauffeur to pray between his chattering teeth that the first policeman would save their lives by landing them in jail at the wheel her shoulders thrown forward her eyes searching the dark places beyond the reach of the leaping headlights helen page raced against time against the minions of the law against sudden death to beat the midnight train out of boston to assure the man she loved of the one thing that could make his life worth living and close against her heart buttoned tight beneath her greatcoat the sailorman smiled in the darkness his long watch over his soul at peace his duty well performed chapter the mind reader when philip endicott was at harvard he wrote stories of undergraduate life suggested by things that had happened to himself and to men he knew under the title of tales of the yard they were collected in book form and sold surprisingly well after he was graduated and became a reporter on the new york republic he wrote more stories in each of which a reporter was the hero and in which his failure or success in gathering news supplied the plot these appeared first in the magazines and later in a book under the title of tales of the streets they also were well received then came to him the literary editor of the republic and said there are two kinds of men who succeed in writing fiction men of genius and reporters a reporter can describe a thing he has seen in such a way that he can make the reader see it too a man of genius can describe something he has never seen or any one else for that matter in such a way that the reader will exclaim i have never committed a murder but if i had thats just the way id feel about it for instance kipling tells us how a greek pirate chained to the oar of a trireme suffers how a mother rejoices when her baby crawls across her breast kipling has never been a mother or a pirate but he convinces you he knows how each of them feels he can do that because he is a genius you cannot do it because you are not at college you wrote only of what you saw at college and now that you are in the newspaper business all your tales are only of newspaper work you merely report what you see so if you are doomed to write only of what you see then the best thing for you to do is to see as many things as possible you must see all kinds of life you must progress you must leave new york and you had better go to london but on the republic endicott pointed out i get a salary and in london i should have to sweep a crossing then said the literary editor you could write a story about a man who swept a crossing it was not alone the literary editors words of wisdom that had driven philip to london helen carey was in london visiting the daughter of the american ambassador and though philip had known her only one winter he loved her dearly the great trouble was that he had no money and that she possessed so much of it that unless he could show some unusual quality of mind or character his asking her to marry him from his own point of view at least was quite impossible of course he knew that no one could love her as he did that no one so truly wished for her happiness or would try so devotedly to make her happy but to him it did not seem possible that a girl could be happy with a man who was not able to pay for her home or her clothes or her food who would have to borrow her purse if he wanted a new pair of gloves or a haircut for philip endicott while rich in birth and education and charm of manner had no money at all when in may he came from new york to lay siege to london and to the heart of helen carey he had with him all told fifteen hundred dollars that was all he possessed in the world and unless the magazines bought his stories there was no prospect of his getting any more friends who knew london told him that if you knew london well it was easy to live comfortably there and to go about and even to entertain modestly on three sovereigns a day so at that rate philip calculated he could stay three months but he found that to know london well enough to be able to live there on three sovereigns a day you had first to spend so many fivepound notes in getting acquainted with london that there were no sovereigns left at the end of one month he had just enough money to buy him a secondclass passage back to new york and he was as far from helen as ever often he had read in stories and novels of men who were too poor to marry and he had laughed at the idea he had always said that when two people truly love each other it does not matter whether they have money or not but when in london with only a fivepound note and face to face with the actual proposition of asking helen carey not only to marry him but to support him he felt that money counted for more than he had supposed he found money was many different things it was selfrespect and proper pride and private honors and independence and lacking these things he felt he could ask no girl to marry him certainly not one for whom he cared as he cared for helen carey besides while he knew how he loved her he had no knowledge whatsoever that she loved him she always seemed extremely glad to see him but that might be explained in different ways it might be that what was in her heart for him was really a sort of old home week feeling that to her it was a relief to see any one who spoke her own language who did not need to have it explained when she was jesting and who did not think when she was speaking in perfectly satisfactory phrases that she must be talking slang the ambassador and his wife had been very kind to endicott and as a friend of helens had asked him often to dinner and had sent him cards for dances at which helen was to be one of the belles and beauties and helen herself had been most kind and had taken early morning walks with him in hyde park and through the national galleries and they had fed buns to the bears in the zoo and in doing so had laughed heartily they thought it was because the bears were so ridiculous that they laughed later they appreciated that the reason they were happy was because they were together had the bear pit been empty they still would have laughed on the evening of the thirtyfirst of may endicott had gone to bed with his ticket purchased for america and his last fivepound note to last him until the boat sailed he was a miserable young man he knew now that he loved helen carey in such a way that to put the ocean between them was liable to unseat his courage and his selfcontrol in london he could each night walk through carlton house terrace and leaning against the iron rails of the carlton club gaze up at her window but once on the other side of the ocean that tender exercise must be abandoned he must even consider her pursued by most attractive guardsmen diplomats and belted earls he knew they could not love her as he did he knew they could not love her for the reasons he loved her because the fine and beautiful things in her that he saw and worshipped they did not seek and so did not find and yet for lack of a few thousand dollars he must remain silent must put from him the best that ever came into his life must waste the wonderful devotion he longed to give must starve the love that he could never summon for any other woman on the thirtyfirst of may he went to sleep utterly and completely miserable on the first of june he woke hopeless and unrefreshed and then the miracle came prichard the exbutler who valeted all the young gentlemen in the house where philip had taken chambers brought him his breakfast as he placed the eggs and muffins on the tables to philip it seemed as though prichard had said i am sorry he is leaving us the next gentleman who takes these rooms may not be so openhanded he never locked up his cigars or his whiskey i wish hed give me his old dresscoat it fits me except across the shoulders philip stared hard at prichard but the lips of the valet had not moved in surprise and bewilderment philip demanded how do you know it fits have you tried it on i wouldnt take such a liberty protested prichard not with any of our gentlemens clothes how did you know i was talking about clothes demanded philip you didnt say anything about clothes did you no sir i did not but you asked me sir and i were you thinking of clothes well sir you might say in a way that i was answered the valet seeing as youre leaving sir and theyre not overnew i thought its mental telepathy said philip i beg your pardon exclaimed prichard you neednt wait said philip the coincidence puzzled him but by the time he had read the morning papers he had forgotten about it and it was not until he had emerged into the street that it was forcibly recalled the street was crowded with people and as philip stepped in among them it was as though every one at whom he looked began to talk aloud their lips did not move nor did any sound issue from between them but without ceasing broken phrases of thoughts came to him as clearly as when in passing in a crowd snatches of talk are carried to the ears one man thought of his debts another of the weather and of what disaster it might bring to his silk hat another planned his luncheon another was rejoicing over a telegram he had but that moment received to himself he kept repeating the words of the telegram no need to come out of danger to philip the message came as clearly as though he were reading it from the folded slip of paper that the stranger clutched in his hand confused and somewhat frightened and in order that undisturbed he might consider what had befallen him philip sought refuge from the crowded street in the hallway of a building his first thought was that for some unaccountable cause his brain for the moment was playing tricks with him and he was inventing the phrases he seemed to hear that he was attributing thoughts to others of which they were entirely innocent but whatever it was that had befallen him he knew it was imperative that he should at once get at the meaning of it the hallway in which he stood opened from bond street up a flight of stairs to the studio of a fashionable photographer and directly in front of the hallway a young woman of charming appearance had halted her glance was troubled her manner ill at ease to herself she kept repeating did i tell hudson to be here at a quarter to eleven or a quarter past will she get the telephone message to bring the ruff without the ruff it would be absurd to be photographed without her ruff mary queen of scots would look ridiculous although the young woman had spoken not a single word although indeed she was biting impatiently at her lower lip philip had distinguished the words clearly or if he had not distinguished them he surely was going mad it was a matter to be at once determined and the young woman should determine it he advanced boldly to her and raised his hat pardon me he said but i believe you are waiting for your maid hudson as though fearing an impertinence the girl regarded him in silence i only wish to make sure continued philip that you are she for whom i have a message you have an appointment i believe to be photographed in fancy dress as mary queen of scots well assented the girl and you telephoned hudson he continued to bring you your muff the girl exclaimed with vexation oh she protested i knew theyd get it wrong not muff ruff i want my ruff philip felt a cold shiver creep down his spine for the love of heaven he exclaimed in horror its true whats true demanded the young woman in some alarm that im a mind reader declared philip ive read your mind i can read everybodys mind i know just what youre thinking now youre thinking im mad the actions of the young lady showed that again he was correct with a gasp of terror she fled past him and raced up the stairs to the studio philip made no effort to follow and to explain what was there to explain how could he explain that which to himself was unbelievable besides the girl had served her purpose if he could read the mind of one he could read the minds of all by some unexplainable miracle to his ordinary equipment of senses a sixth had been added as easily as before that morning he could look into the face of a fellowmortal he now could look into the workings of that fellowmortals mind the thought was appalling it was like living with ones ear to a keyhole in his dismay his first idea was to seek medical advice the best in london he turned instantly in the direction of harley street there he determined to the most skilled alienist in town he would explain his strange plight for only as a misfortune did the miracle appear to him but as he made his way through the streets his pace slackened was he wise he asked himself in allowing others to know he possessed this strange power would they not at once treat him as a madman might they not place him under observation or even deprive him of his liberty at the thought he came to an abrupt halt his own definition of the miracle as a power had opened a new line of speculation if this strange gift already he was beginning to consider it more leniently were concealed from others could he not honorably put it to some useful purpose for among the blind the man with one eye is a god was not he among all other men the only one able to read the minds of all other men a god turning into bruton street he paced its quiet length considering the possibilities that lay within him it was apparent that the gift would lead to countless embarrassments if it were once known that he possessed it would not even his friends avoid him for how could any one knowing his most secret thought was at the mercy of another be happy in that others presence his power would lead to his social ostracism indeed he could see that his gift might easily become a curse he decided not to act hastily that for the present he had best give no hint to others of his unique power as the idea of possessing this power became more familiar he regarded it with less aversion he began to consider to what advantage he could place it he could see that given the right time and the right man he might learn secrets leading to farreaching results to a statesman to a financier such a gift as he possessed would make him a ruler of men philip had no desire to be a ruler of men but he asked himself how could he bend this gift to serve his own what he most wished was to marry helen carey and to that end to possess money so he must meet men who possessed money who were making money he would put questions to them and with words they would give evasive answers but their minds would tell him the truth the ethics of this procedure greatly disturbed him certainly it was no better than reading other peoples letters but he argued the dishonor in knowledge so obtained would lie only in the use he made of it if he used it without harm to him from whom it was obtained and with benefit to others was he not justified in trading on his superior equipment he decided that each case must be considered separately in accordance with the principle involved but principle or no principle he was determined to become rich did not the end justify the means certainly an allwise providence had not brought helen carey into his life only to take her away from him it could not be so cruel but in selecting them for one another the allwise providence had overlooked the fact that she was rich and he was poor for that oversight providence apparently was now endeavoring to make amends in what certainly was a fantastic and roundabout manner providence had tardily equipped him with a gift that could lead to great wealth and who was he to fly in the face of providence he decided to set about building up a fortune and building it in a hurry from bruton street he had emerged upon berkeley square and as lady woodcote had invited him to meet helen at luncheon at the ritz he turned in that direction he was too early for luncheon but in the corridor of the ritz he knew he would find persons of position and fortune and in reading their minds he might pass the time before luncheon with entertainment possibly with profit for while pacing bruton street trying to discover the principles of conduct that threatened to hamper his new power he had found that in actual operation it was quite simple he learned that his mind in relation to other minds was like the receiver of a wireless station with an unlimited field for while the wireless could receive messages only from those instruments with which it was attuned his mind was in key with all other minds to read the thoughts of another he had only to concentrate his own upon that person and to shut off the thoughts of that person he had only to turn his own thoughts elsewhere but also he discovered that over the thoughts of those outside the range of his physical sight he had no control when he asked of what helen carey was at that moment thinking there was no result but when he asked of what is that policeman on the corner thinking he was surprised to find that that officer of the law was formulating regulations to abolish the hobble skirt as an impediment to traffic as philip turned into berkeley square the accents of a mind in great distress smote upon his new and sixth sense and in the person of a young gentleman leaning against the park railing he discovered the source from which the mental sufferings emanated the young man was a pinkcheeked yellowhaired youth of extremely boyish appearance and dressed as if for the racetrack but at the moment his pink and babyish face wore an expression of complete misery with tearfilled eyes he was gazing at a house of yellow stucco on the opposite side of the street and his thoughts were these she is the best that ever lived and i am the most ungrateful of fools how happy were we in the house of yellow stucco only now when she has closed its doors to me do i know how happy if she would give me another chance never again would i distress or deceive her so far had the young man progressed in his thoughts when an automobile of surprising smartness swept around the corner and drew up in front of the house of yellow stucco and from it descended a charming young person she was of the dresdenshepherdess type with large blue eyes of haunting beauty and innocence my wife exclaimed the blond youth at the railings and instantly he dodged behind a horse that while still attached to a fourwheeler was contentedly eating from a nosebag with a key the dresden shepherdess opened the door to the yellow house and disappeared the calling of the reporter trains him in audacity and to act quickly he shares the troubles of so many people that to the troubles of other people he becomes callous and often will rush in where friends of the family fear to tread although philip was not now acting as a reporter he acted quickly hardly had the door closed upon the young lady than he had mounted the steps and rung the visitors bell as he did so he could not resist casting a triumphant glance in the direction of the outlawed husband and in turn what the outcast husband peering from across the back of the cab horse thought of philip of his clothes of his general appearance and of the manner in which he would delight to alter all of them was quickly communicated to the american they were thoughts of a nature so violent and uncomplimentary that philip hastily cut off all connection as philip did not know the name of the dresdenchina doll it was fortunate that on opening the door the butler promptly announced her ladyship is not receiving her ladyship will i think receive me said philip pleasantly when you tell her i come as the special ambassador of his lordship from a tiny receptionroom on the right of the entrancehall there issued a feminine exclamation of surprise not unmixed with joy and in the hall the noble lady instantly appeared when she saw herself confronted by a stranger she halted in embarrassment but as even while she halted her only thought had been oh if he will only ask me to forgive him philip felt no embarrassment whatsoever outside concealed behind a cab horse was the erring but bitterly repentant husband inside her tenderest thoughts racing tumultuously toward him was an unhappy childwife begging to be begged to pardon for a new york reporter and a harvard graduate of charm and good manners it was too easy i do not know you said her ladyship but even as she spoke she motioned to the butler to go away you must be one of his new friends her tone was one of envy indeed i am his newest friend philip assured her but i can safely say no one knows his thoughts as well as i and they are all of you the china shepherdess blushed with happiness but instantly she shook her head they tell me i must not believe him she announced they tell me never mind what they tell you commanded philip listen to me he loves you better than ever before he loves you all he asks is the chance to tell you so you cannot help but believe him who can look at you and not believe that he loves you let me he begged bring him to you he started from her when remembering the somewhat violent thoughts of the youthful husband he added hastily or perhaps it would be better if you called him yourself called him exclaimed the lady he is in parisat the races with her if they tell you that sort of thing protested philip indignantly you must listen to me he is not in paris he is not with her there never was a her he drew aside the lace curtains and pointed he is there behind that ancient cab horse praying that you will let him tell you that not only did he never do it but what is much more important he will never do it again the lady herself now timidly drew the curtains apart and then more boldly showed herself upon the iron balcony leaning over the scarlet geraniums she beckoned with both hands the result was instantaneous philip bolted for the front door leaving it open and as he darted down the steps the youthful husband in strides resembling those of an ostrich shot past him philip did not cease running until he was well out of berkeley square then not illpleased with the adventure he turned and smiled back at the house of yellow stucco bless you my children he murmured bless you he continued to the ritz and on crossing piccadilly to the quieter entrance to the hotel in arlington street found gathered around it a considerable crowd drawn up on either side of a red carpet that stretched down the steps of the hotel to a court carriage a red carpet in june when all is dry under foot and the sun is shining gently can mean only royalty and in the rear of the men in the street philip halted he remembered that for a few days the young king of asturia and the queen mother were at the ritz incognito and as he never had seen the young man who so recently and so tragically had been exiled from his own kingdom philip raised himself on tiptoe and stared expectantly as easily as he could read their faces could he read the thoughts of those about him they were thoughts of friendly curiosity of pity for the exiles on the part of the policemen who had hastened from a cross street of pride at their temporary responsibility on the part of the coachman of the court carriage of speculation as to the possible amount of his majestys tip the thoughts were as harmless and protecting as the warm sunshine and then suddenly and harshly like the stroke of a fire bell at midnight the harmonious chorus of gentle hospitable thoughts was shattered by one that was discordant evil menacing it was the thought of a man with a brain diseased and its purpose was murder when they appear at the doorway spoke the brain of the maniac i shall lift the bomb from my pocket i shall raise it above my head i shall crash it against the stone steps it will hurl them and all of these people into eternity and me with them but i shall live a martyr to the cause and the cause will flourish through the unsuspecting crowd like a football player diving for a tackle philip hurled himself upon a little dark man standing close to the open door of the court carriage from the rear philip seized him around the waist and locked his arms behind him elbow to elbow philips face appearing over the mans shoulder stared straight into that of the policeman he has a bomb in his righthand pocket yelled philip i can hold him while you take it but for heavens sake dont drop it philip turned upon the crowd run all of you he shouted run like the devil at that instant the boy king and his queen mother herself still young and beautiful and cloaked with a dignity and sorrow that her robes of mourning could not intensify appeared in the doorway go back sir warned philip he means to kill you at the words and at sight of the struggling men the great lady swayed helplessly her eyes filled with terror her son sprang protectingly in front of her but the danger was past a second policeman was now holding the maniac by the wrists forcing his arms above his head philips arms like a lariat were wound around his chest and from his pocket the first policeman gingerly drew forth a round black object of the size of a glass firegrenade he held it high in the air and waved his free hand warningly but the warning was unobserved there was no one remaining to observe it leaving the wouldbe assassin struggling and biting in the grasp of the stalwart policeman and the other policeman unhappily holding the bomb at arms length philip sought to escape into the ritz but the young king broke through the circle of attendants and stopped him i must thank you said the boy eagerly and i wish you to tell me how you came to suspect the mans purpose unable to speak the truth philip the wouldbe writer of fiction began to improvise fluently to learn their purpose sir he said is my business i am of the international police and in the secret service of your majesty then i must know your name said the king and added with a dignity that was most becoming you will find we are not ungrateful philip smiled mysteriously and shook his head i said in your secret service he repeated did even your majesty know me my usefulness would be at an end he pointed toward the two policemen if you desire to be just as well as gracious those are the men to reward he slipped past the king and through the crowd of hotel officials into the hall and on into the corridor the arrest had taken place so quietly and so quickly that through the heavy glass doors no sound had penetrated and of the fact that they had been so close to a possible tragedy those in the corridor were still ignorant the members of the hungarian orchestra were arranging their music a waiter was serving two men of middle age with sherry and two distinguishedlooking elderly gentlemen seated together on a sofa were talking in leisurely whispers one of the two middleaged men was well known to philip who as a reporter had often in new york endeavored to interview him on matters concerning the steel trust his name was faust he was a pennsylvania dutchman from pittsburgh and at one time had been a foreman of the night shift in the same mills he now controlled but with a roar and a spectacular flash not unlike one of his own blast furnaces he had soared to fame and fortune he recognized philip as one of the bright young men of the republic but in his own opinion he was far too selfimportant to betray that fact philip sank into an imitation louis quatorze chair beside a fountain in imitation of one in the apartment of the pompadour and ordered what he knew would be an execrable imitation of an american cocktail while waiting for the cocktail and lady woodcotes luncheon party philip from where he sat could not help but overhear the conversation of faust and of the man with him the latter was a german with hebraic features and a pointed beard in loud tones he was congratulating the american manytime millionaire on having that morning come into possession of a rare and valuable masterpiece a hitherto unknown and but recently discovered portrait of philip iv by velasquez philip sighed enviously fancy he thought owning a velasquez fancy having it all to yourself it must be fun to be rich it certainly is hell to be poor the german who was evidently a picturedealer was exclaiming in tones of rapture and nodding his head with an air of awe and solemnity i am telling you the truth mr faust he said in no gallery in europe no not even in the prado is there such another velasquez this is what you are doing mr faust you are robbing spain you are robbing her of something worth more to her than cuba and i tell you so soon as it is known that this velasquez is going to your home in pittsburgh every spaniard will hate you and every artcollector will hate you too for it is the most wonderful art treasure in europe and what a bargain mr faust what a bargain to make sure that the reporter was within hearing mr faust glanced in the direction of philip and seeing that he had heard frowned importantly that the reporter might hear still more he also raised his voice nothing can be called a bargain baron he said that costs three hundred thousand dollars again he could not resist glancing toward philip and so eagerly that philip deemed it would be only polite to look interested so he obligingly assumed a startled look with which he endeavored to mingle simulations of surprise awe and envy the next instant an expression of real surprise overspread his features mr faust continued if you will come upstairs he said to the picturedealer i will give you your check and then i should like to drive to your apartments and take a farewell look at the picture i am sorry the baron said but i have had it moved to my art gallery to be packed then lets go to the gallery urged the patron of art weve just time before lunch he rose to his feet and on the instant the soul of the picturedealer was filled with alarm in actual words he said the picture is already boxed and in its lead coffin no doubt by now it is on its way to liverpool i am sorry but his thoughts as philip easily read them were fancy my letting this vulgar fool into the tate street workshop even he would know that old masters are not found in a halffinished state on chelseamade frames and canvases fancy my letting him see those two halfcompleted van dycks the new hals the halfdozen corots he would even see his own copy of velasquez next to the one exactly like it the one macmillan finished yesterday and that i am sending to oporto where next year in a convent we shall discover it philips surprise gave way to intense amusement in his delight at the situation upon which he had stumbled he laughed aloud the two men who had risen surprised at the spectacle of a young man laughing at nothing turned and stared philip also rose pardon me he said to faust but you spoke so loud i couldnt help overhearing i think weve met before when i was a reporter on the republic the pittsburgh millionaire made a pretense of annoyance really he protested irritably you reporters butt in everywhere no public man is safe is there no place we can go where you fellows wont annoy us you can go to the devil for all i care said philip or even to pittsburgh he saw the waiter bearing down upon him with the imitation cocktail and moved to meet it the millionaire fearing the reporter would escape him hastily changed his tone he spoke with effective resignation however since youve learned so much he said ill tell you the whole of it i dont want the fact garbled for it is of international importance do you know what a velasquez is do you asked philip the millionaire smiled tolerantly i think i do he said and to prove it i shall tell you something that will be news to you i have just bought a velasquez that i am going to place in my art museum it is worth three hundred thousand dollars philip accepted the cocktail the waiter presented it was quite as bad as he had expected now i shall tell you something he said that will be news to you you are not buying a velasquez it is no more a velasquez than this hair oil is a real cocktail it is a bad copy worth a few dollars how dare you shouted faust are you mad the face of the german turned crimson with rage who is this insolent one he sputtered i will make you a sporting proposition said philip you can take it or leave it you two will get into a taxi you will drive to this mans studio in tate street you will find your velasquez is there and not on its way to liverpool and you will find one exactly like it and a dozen other old masters halffinished ill bet you a hundred pounds im right and ill bet this man a hundred pounds that he doesnt dare take you to his studio indeed i will not roared the german it would be to insult myself it would be an easy way to earn a hundred pounds too said philip how dare you insult the baron demanded faust what makes you think i dont think i know said philip for the price of a taxicab fare to tate street you win a hundred pounds we will all three go at once cried the german my car is outside wait here i will have it brought to the door faust protested indignantly do not disturb yourself baron he said just because a fresh reporter but already the german had reached the hall nor did he stop there they saw him without his hat rush into piccadilly spring into a taxi and shout excitedly to the driver the next moment he had disappeared thats the last youll see of him said philip his actions are certainly peculiar gasped the millionaire he did not wait for us he didnt even wait for his hat i think after all i had better go to tate street do so said philip and save yourself three hundred thousand dollars and from the laughter of two continents youll find me here at lunch if im wrong ill pay you a hundred pounds you should come with me said faust it is only fair to yourself ill take your word for what you find in the studio said philip i cannot go this is my busy day without further words the millionaire collected his hat and stick and in his turn entered a taxicab and disappeared philip returned to the louis quatorze chair and lit a cigarette save for the two elderly gentlemen on the sofa the lounge was still empty and his reflections were undisturbed he shook his head sadly surely philip thought the french chap was right who said words were given us to conceal our thoughts what a strange world it would be if every one possessed my power deception would be quite futile and lying would become a lost art i wonder he mused cynically is any one quite honest does any one speak as he thinks and think as he speaks at once came a direct answer to his question the two elderly gentlemen had risen and before separating had halted a few feet from him i sincerely hope sir john said one of the two that you have no regrets i hope you believe that i have advised you in the best interests of all i do indeed the other replied heartily we shall be thought entirely selfish but you know and i know that what we have done is for the benefit of the shareholders philip was pleased to find that the thoughts of each of the old gentlemen ran hand in hand with his spoken words here at least he said to himself are two honest men as though loath to part the two gentlemen still lingered and i hope continued the one addressed as sir john that you approve of my holding back the public announcement of the combine until the afternoon it will give the shareholders a better chance had we given out the news in this mornings papers the stockbrokers would have it was most wise interrupted the other most just the one called sir john bowed himself away leaving the other still standing at the steps of the lounge with his hands behind his back his chin sunk on his chest he remained gazing at nothing his thoughts far away philip found them thoughts of curious interest they were concerned with three flags now the gentleman considered them separately and philip saw the emblems painted clearly in colors fluttering and flattened by the breeze again the gentleman considered them in various combinations but always in whatever order his mind arranged them of the three his heart spoke always to the same flag as the heart of a mother reaches toward her firstborn then the thoughts were diverted and in his minds eye the old gentleman was watching the launching of a little schooner from a shipyard on the clyde at her main flew one of the three flags a flag with a red cross on a white ground with thoughts tender and grateful he followed her to strange hot ports through hurricanes and tidal waves he saw her return again and again to the london docks laden with odorous coffee mahogany red rubber and raw bullion he saw sister ships follow in her wake to every port in the south sea saw steam packets take the place of the ships with sails saw the steam packets give way to great ocean liners each a floating village each equipped as no village is equipped with a giant power house thousands of electric lamps suite after suite of silklined boudoirs with the floating harps that vibrate to a love message three hundred miles away to the fierce call for help from a sinking ship but at the main of each great vessel there still flew the same houseflag the red cross on the field of white only now in the arms of the cross there nestled proudly a royal crown philip cast a scared glance at the old gentleman and raced down the corridor to the telephone of all the young englishmen he knew maddox was his best friend and a stockbroker in that latter capacity philip had never before addressed him now he demanded his instant presence at the telephone maddox greeted him genially but philip cut him short i want you to act for me he whispered and act quick i want you to buy for me one thousand shares of the royal mail line of the elderdempster and of the union castle he heard maddox laugh indulgently theres nothing in that yarn of a combine he called it has fallen through besides shares are at fifteen pounds philip having in his possession a secondclass ticket and a fivepound note was indifferent to that and said so i dont care what they are he shouted the combine is already signed and sealed and no one knows it but myself in an hour everybody will know it what makes you think you know it demanded the broker ive seen the houseflags cried philip i have do as i tell you he commanded there was a distracting delay no matter whos back of you objected maddox its a big order on a gamble its not a gamble cried philip its an accomplished fact im at the ritz call me up there start buying now and when youve got a thousand of each stop philip was much too agitated to go far from the telephone booth so for half an hour he sat in the readingroom forcing himself to read the illustrated papers when he found he had read the same advertisement five times he returned to the telephone the telephone boy met him halfway with a message have secured for you a thousand shares of each he read at fifteen maddox like a man awakening from a nightmare philip tried to separate the horror of the situation from the cold fact the cold fact was sufficiently horrible it was that without a penny to pay for them he had bought shares in three steamship lines which shares added together were worth two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars he returned down the corridor toward the lounge trembling at his own audacity he was in a state of almost complete panic when that happened which made his outrageous speculation of little consequence it was drawing near to halfpast one and in the persons of several smart men and beautiful ladies the component parts of different luncheon parties were beginning to assemble of the luncheon to which lady woodcote had invited him only one guest had arrived but so far as philip was concerned that one was sufficient it was helen herself seated alone with her eyes fixed on the doors opening from piccadilly philip his heart singing with appeals blessings and adoration ran toward her her profile was toward him and she could not see him but he could see her and he noted that as though seeking some one her eyes were turned searchingly upon each young man as he entered and moved from one to another of those already in the lounge her expression was eager and anxious if only philip exclaimed she were looking for me she certainly is looking for some man i wonder who it can be as suddenly as if he had slapped his face into a wall he halted in his steps why should he wonder why did he not read her mind why did he not know a waiter was hastening toward him philip fixed his mind upon the waiter and his eyes as well mentally philip demanded of him of what are you thinking there was no response and then seeing an unlit cigarette hanging from philips lips the waiter hastily struck a match and proffered it obviously his mind had worked first in observing the halfburned cigarette next in furnishing the necessary match and of no step in that mental process had philip been conscious the conclusion was only too apparent his power was gone no longer was he a mind reader hastily philip reviewed the adventures of the morning as he considered them the moral was obvious the moment he had used his power to his own advantage he had lost it so long as he had exerted it for the happiness of the two lovers to save the life of the king to thwart the dishonesty of a swindler he had been allpowerful but when he endeavored to bend it to his own uses it had fled from him as he stood abashed and repentant helen turned her eyes toward him and at the sight of him there leaped to them happiness and welcome and complete content it was the look that never was on land or sea and it was not necessary to be a mind reader to understand it philip sprang toward her as quickly as a man dodges a taxicab i came early said helen because i wanted to talk to you before the others arrived she seemed to be repeating words already rehearsed to be following a course of conduct already predetermined i want to tell you she said that i am sorry you are going away i want to tell you that i shall miss you very much she paused and drew a long breath and she looked at philip as if she was begging him to make it easier for her to go on philip proceeded to make it easier will you miss me he asked in the row where i used to wait among the trees to see you ride past will you miss me at dances where i used to hide behind the dowagers to watch you waltzing by will you miss me at night when you come home by sunrise and i am not hiding against the railings of the carlton club just to see you run across the pavement from your carriage just to see the light on your window blind just to see the light go out and to know that you are sleeping helens eyes were smiling happily she looked away from him did you use to do that she asked every night i do that said philip ask the policemen they arrested me three times why said helen gently but philip was not yet free to speak so he said they thought i was a burglar helen frowned he was making it very hard for her you know what i mean she said why did you keep guard outside my window it was the policeman kept guard said philip i was there only as a burglar i came to rob but i was a coward or else i had a conscience or else i knew my own unworthiness there was a long pause as both of them whenever they heard the tune afterward always remembered the hungarian band with rare inconsequence was playing the grizzly bear and people were trying to speak to helen by her they were received with a look of so complete a lack of recognition and by philip with a glare of such savage hate that they retreated in dismay the pause seemed to last for many years at last helen said do you know the story of the two roses they grew in a garden under a ladys window they both loved her one looked up at her from the ground and sighed for her but the other climbed to the ladys window and she lifted him in and kissed him because he had dared to climb philip took out his watch and looked at it but helen did not mind his doing that because she saw that his eyes were filled with tears she was delighted to find that she was making it very hard for him too at any moment philip said i may know whether i owe two hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars which i can never pay or whether i am worth about that sum i should like to continue this conversation at the exact place where you last spoke after i know whether i am going to jail or whether i am worth a quarter of a million dollars helen laughed aloud with happiness i knew that was it she cried you dont like my money i was afraid you did not like me if you dislike my money i will give it away or i will give it to you to keep for me the money does not matter so long as you dont dislike me what philip would have said to that helen could not know for a page in many buttons rushed at him with a message from the telephone and with a hand that trembled philip snatched it it read combine is announced shares have gone to thirtyone shall i hold or sell that at such a crisis he should permit of any interruption hurt helen deeply she regarded him with unhappy eyes philip read the message three times at last and not without uneasy doubts as to his own sanity he grasped the preposterous truth he was worth almost a quarter of a million dollars at the page he shoved his last and only fivepound note he pushed the boy from him run he commanded get out of here tell him he is to sell he turned to helen with a look in his eyes that could not be questioned or denied he seemed incapable of speech and to break the silence helen said is it good news that depends entirely upon you replied philip soberly indeed all my future life depends upon what you are going to say next helen breathed deeply and happily and what am i going to say how can i know that demanded philip am i a mind reader but what she said may be safely guessed from the fact that they both chucked lady woodcotes luncheon and ate one of penny buns which they shared with the bears in regents park philip was just able to pay for the penny buns helen paid for the taxicab chapter the naked man in their home town of keepsburg the keeps were the reigning dynasty socially and in every way old man keep was president of the trolley line the telephone company and the keep national bank but fred his son and the heir apparent did not inherit the business ability of his father or if he did he took pains to conceal that fact fred had gone through harvard but as to that also unless he told people they would not have known it ten minutes after fred met a man he generally told him when fred arranged an alliance with winnie platt who also was of the innermost inner set of keepsburg everybody said keepsburg would soon lose them and everybody was right when single each had sighed for other social worlds to conquer and when they combined their fortunes and ambitions they found keepsburg impossible and they left it to lay siege to new york they were too crafty to at once attack new york itself a widow lady they met while on their honeymoon at palm beach had told them not to attempt that and she was the palm beach correspondent of a society paper they naturally accepted her advice she warned them that in new york the waitinglist is already interminable and that if you hoped to break into new york society the clever thing to do was to lay siege to it by way of the suburbs and the country clubs if you went direct to new york knowing no one you would at once expose that fact and the result would be disastrous she told them of a couple like themselves young and rich and from the west who at the first dance to which they were invited asked who is the old lady in the wig and that question argued them so unknown that it set them back two years it was a terrible story and it filled the keeps with misgivings they agreed with the lady correspondent that it was far better to advance leisurely first firmly to intrench themselves in the suburbs and then to enter new york not as the keeps from keepsburg which meant nothing but as the fred keeps of long island or westchester or bordentown in all of those places explained the widow lady our smartest people have country homes and at the country club you may get to know them then when winter comes you follow them on to the city the point from which the keeps elected to launch their attack was scarboroonthehudson they selected scarboro because both of them could play golf and they planned that their first skirmish should be fought and won upon the golflinks of the sleepy hollow country club but the attack did not succeed something went wrong they began to fear that the lady correspondent had given them the wrong dope for although three months had passed and they had played golf together until they were as loath to clasp a golf club as a redhot poker they knew no one and no one knew them that is they did not know the van wardens and if you lived at scarboro and were not recognized by the van wardens you were not to be found on any map since the days of hendrik hudson the countryseat of the van wardens had looked down upon the river that bears his name and ever since those days the van wardens had looked down upon everybody else they were so proud that at all their gates they had placed signs reading no horses allowed take the other road the other road was an earth road used by tradespeople from ossining the road reserved for the van wardens and automobiles was of bluestone it helped greatly to give the van warden estate the appearance of a well kept cemetery and those van wardens who occupied the countryplace were as cold and unsociable as the sort of people who occupy cemeteries except harry van warden and she lived in new york at the turf club harry according to all local tradition for he frequently motored out to warden koopf the van warden countryseat and according to the newspapers was a devil of a fellow and in no sense cold or unsociable so far as the keeps read of him he was always being arrested for overspeeding or breaking his collarbone out hunting or losing his front teeth at polo this greatly annoyed the proud sisters at warden koopf not because harry was arrested or had broken his collarbone but because it dragged the family name into the newspapers if you would only play polo or ride to hounds instead of playing golf sighed winnie keep to her husband you would meet harry van warden and hed introduce you to his sisters and then we could break in anywhere if i was to ride to hounds returned her husband the only thing id break would be my neck the countryplace of the keeps was completely satisfactory and for the purposes of their social comedy the stagesetting was perfect the house was one they had rented from a man of charming taste and inflated fortune and with it they had taken over his welldisciplined butler his pictures furniture family silver and linen it stood upon an eminence was heavily wooded and surrounded by many gardens but its chief attraction was an artificial lake well stocked with trout that lay directly below the terrace of the house and also in full view from the road to albany this latter fact caused winnie keep much concern in the neighborhood were many italian laborers and on several nights the fish had tempted these born poachers to trespass and more than once on hot summer evenings small boys from tarrytown and ossining had broken through the hedge and used the lake as a swimmingpool it makes me nervous complained winnie i dont like the idea of people prowling around so near the house and think of those twelve hundred convicts not one mile away in sing sing most of them are burglars and if they ever get out our house is the very first one theyll break into i havent caught anybody in this neighborhood breaking into our house yet said fred and id be glad to see even a burglar they were seated on the brick terrace that overlooked the lake it was just before the dinner hour and the dusk of a wonderful october night had fallen on the hedges the clumps of evergreens the rows of closeclipped box a full moon was just showing itself above the treetops turning the lake into moving silver fred rose from his wicker chair and crossing to his young bride touched her hair fearfully with the tips of his fingers what if we dont know anybody win he said and nobody knows us its been a perfectly good honeymoon hasnt it if you just look at it that way it works out all right we came here really for our honeymoon to be together to be alone winnie laughed shortly they certainly have left us alone she sighed but where else could we have been any happier demanded the young husband loyally where will you find any prettier place than this just as it is at this minute so still and sweet and silent theres nothing the matter with that moon is there nothing the matter with the lake wheres there a better place for a honeymoon its a bower a bower of peace solitude a bower of as though mocking his words there burst upon the sleeping countryside the shriek of a giant siren it was raucous virulent insulting it came as sharply as a scream of terror it continued in a bellow of rage then as suddenly as it had cried aloud it sank to silence only after a pause of an instant as though giving a signal to shriek again in two sharp blasts and then again it broke into the hideous long drawn scream of rage insistent breathless commanding filling the soul of him who heard it even of the innocent with alarm in the name of heaven gasped keep whats that down the terrace the butler was hastening toward them when he stopped he spoke as though he were announcing dinner a convict sir he said has escaped from sing sing i thought you might not understand the whistle i thought perhaps you would wish mrs keep to come indoors why asked winnie keep the house is near the road madam said the butler and there are so many trees and bushes last summer two of them hid here and the keepers there was a fight the man glanced at keep fred touched his wife on the arm its time to dress for dinner win he said and what are you going to do demanded winnie im going to finish this cigar first it doesnt take me long to change he turned to the butler and ill have a cocktail too ill have it out here the servant left them but in the french window that opened from the terrace to the library mrs keep lingered irresolutely fred she begged you youre not going to poke around in the bushes are you just because you think im frightened her husband laughed at her i certainly am not he said and youre not frightened either go in ill be with you in a minute but the girl hesitated still shattering the silence of the night the siren shrieked relentlessly it seemed to be at their very door to beat and buffet the windowpanes the bride shivered and held her fingers to her ears why dont they stop it she whispered why dont they give him a chance when she had gone fred pulled one of the wicker chairs to the edge of the terrace and leaning forward with his chin in his hands sat staring down at the lake the moon had cleared the tops of the trees had blotted the lawns with black rigid squares had disguised the hedges with wavering shadows somewhere near at hand a criminal a murderer burglar thug was at large and the voice of the prison he had tricked still bellowed in rage in amazement still clamored not only for his person but perhaps for his life the whole countryside heard it the farmers bedding down their cattle for the night the guests of the briar cliff inn dining under red candle shades the joy riders from the city racing their cars along the albany road it woke the echoes of sleepy hollow it crossed the hudson the granite walls of the palisades flung it back against the granite walls of the prison whichever way the convict turned it hunted him reaching for him pointing him out stirring in the heart of each who heard it the lust of the hunter which never is so cruel as when the hunted thing is a man find him shrieked the siren find him hes there behind your hedge hes kneeling by the stone wall thats he running in the moonlight thats he crawling through the dead leaves stop him drag him down hes mine mine but from within the prison from within the gray walls that made the home of the siren each of twelve hundred men cursed it with his soul each clinging to the bars of his cell each trembling with a fearful joy each his thumbs up urging on with all the strength of his will the hunted ratlike figure that stumbled panting through the crisp october night bewildered by strange lights beset by shadows staggering and falling running like a mad dog in circles knowing that wherever his feet led him the siren still held him by the heels as a rule when winnie keep was dressing for dinner fred in the room adjoining could hear her unconsciously and lightheartedly singing to herself it was a habit of hers that he loved but on this night although her room was directly above where he sat upon the terrace he heard no singing he had been on the terrace for a quarter of an hour gridley the aged butler who was rented with the house and who for twenty years had been an inmate of it had brought the cocktail and taken away the empty glass and keep had been alone with his thoughts they were entirely of the convict if the man suddenly confronted him and begged his aid what would he do he knew quite well what he would do he considered even the means by which he would assist the fugitive to a successful getaway the ethics of the question did not concern fred he did not weigh his duty to the state of new york or to society one day when he had visited the institution as a somewhat sensitive neighborhood prefers to speak of it he was told that the chance of a prisoners escaping from sing sing and not being at once retaken was one out of six thousand so with fred it was largely a sporting proposition any man who could beat a sixthousandtoone shot commanded his admiration and having settled his own course of action he tried to imagine himself in the place of the man who at that very moment was endeavoring to escape were he that man he would first he decided rid himself of his telltale clothing but that would leave him naked and in westchester county a naked man would be quite as conspicuous as one in the purplegray cloth of the prison how could he obtain clothes he might hold up a passerby and if the passerby did not flee from him or punch him into insensibility he might effect an exchange of garments he might by threats obtain them from some farmer he might despoil a scarecrow but with none of these plans was fred entirely satisfied the question deeply perplexed him how best could a naked man clothe himself and as he sat pondering that point from the bushes a naked man emerged he was not entirely undraped for around his nakedness he had drawn a canvas awning fred recognized it as having been torn from one of the rowboats in the lake but except for that the man was naked to his heels he was a young man of freds own age his hair was cut close his face smoothshaven and above his eye was a halfhealed bruise he had the sharp clever ratlike face of one who lived by evil knowledge water dripped from him and either for that reason or from fright the young man trembled and like one who had been running breathed in short hard gasps fred was surprised to find that he was not in the least surprised it was as though he had been waiting for the man as though it had been an appointment two thoughts alone concerned him that before he could rid himself of his visitor his wife might return and take alarm and that the man not knowing his friendly intentions and in a state to commit murder might rush him but the stranger made no hostile move and for a moment in the moonlight the two young men eyed each other warily then taking breath and with a violent effort to stop the chattering of his teeth the stranger launched into his story i took a bath in your pond he blurted forth and and they stole my clothes thats why im like this fred was consumed with envy in comparison with this ingenious narrative how prosaic and commonplace became his own plans to rid himself of accusing garments and explain his nakedness he regarded the stranger with admiration but even though he applauded the others invention he could not let him suppose that he was deceived by it isnt it rather a cold night to take a bath he said as though in hearty agreement the naked man burst into a violent fit of shivering it wasnt a bath he gasped it was a bet a what exclaimed fred his admiration was increasing a bet then you are not alone i am now damn them exclaimed the naked one he began again reluctantly we saw you from the road you and a woman sitting here in the light from that room they bet me i didnt dare strip and swim across your pond with you sitting so near i can see now it was framed up on me from the start for when i was swimming back i saw them run to where id left my clothes and then i heard them crank up and when i got to the hedge the car was gone keep smiled encouragingly the car he assented so youve been riding around in the moonlight the other nodded and was about to speak when there burst in upon them the roaring scream of the siren the note now was of deeper rage and came in greater volume between his clinched teeth the naked one cursed fiercely and then as though to avoid further questions burst into a fit of coughing trembling and shaking he drew the canvas cloak closer to him but at no time did his anxious prying eyes leave the eyes of keep you you couldnt lend me a suit of clothes could you he stuttered just for tonight ill send them back its all right he added reassuringly i live near here with a start keep raised his eyes and distressed by his look the young man continued less confidently i dont blame you if you dont believe it he stammered seeing me like this but i do live right near here everybody around here knows me and i guess youve read about me in the papers too im that is my name like one about to take a plunge he drew a short breath and the ratlike eyes regarded keep watchfully my name is van warden im the one you read about harry im harry van warden after a pause slowly and reprovingly fred shook his head but his smile was kindly even regretful as though he were sorry he could not longer enjoy the strangers confidences my boy he exclaimed youre more than van warden youre a genius he rose and made a peremptory gesture sorry he said but this isnt safe for either of us follow me and ill dress you up and send you where you want to go he turned and whispered over his shoulder some day let me hear from you a man with your nerve in alarm the naked one with a gesture commanded silence the library led to the front hall in this was the coatroom first making sure the library and hall were free of servants fred tiptoed to the coatroom and opening the door switched on the electric light the naked man leaving in his wake a trail of damp footprints followed at his heels fred pointed at golfcapes sweaters greatcoats hanging from hooks and on the floor at boots and overshoes put on that motorcoat and the galoshes he commanded theyll cover you in case you have to run for it im going to leave you here while i get you some clothes if any of the servants butt in dont lose your head just say youre waiting to see me mr keep i wont be long wait wait snorted the stranger you bet ill wait as fred closed the door upon him the naked one was rubbing himself violently with mrs keeps yellow golfjacket in his own room fred collected a suit of blue serge a tennis shirt boots even a tie underclothes he found ready laid out for him and he snatched them from the bed from a roll of money in his bureau drawer he counted out a hundred dollars tactfully he slipped the money in the trousers pocket of the serge suit and with the bundle of clothes in his arms raced downstairs and shoved them into the coatroom dont come out until i knock he commanded and he added in a vehement whisper dont come out at all unless you have clothes on the stranger grunted fred rang for gridley and told him to have his car brought around to the door he wanted it to start at once within two minutes when the butler had departed fred by an inch again opened the coatroom door the stranger had draped himself in the underclothes and the shirt and at the moment was carefully arranging the tie hurry commanded keep the carll be here in a minute where shall i tell him to take you the stranger chuckled excitedly his confidence seemed to be returning new york he whispered fast as he can get there look here he added doubtfully theres a roll of bills in these clothes theyre yours said fred the stranger exclaimed vigorously youre all right he whispered i wont forget this or you either ill send the money back same time i send the clothes exactly said fred the wheels of the touringcar crunched on the gravel drive and fred slammed to the door and like a sentry on guard paced before it after a period which seemed to stretch over many minutes there came from the inside a cautious knocking with equal caution fred opened the door of the width of a finger and put his ear to the crack you couldnt find me a buttonhook could you whispered the stranger indignantly fred shut the door and walking to the veranda hailed the chauffeur james the chauffeur was a keepsburg boy and when keep had gone to cambridge james had accompanied him keep knew the boy could be trusted youre to take a man to new york he said or wherever he wants to go dont talk to him dont ask any questions so if youre questioned you can say you know nothing thats for your own good the chauffeur mechanically touched his cap and started down the steps as he did so the prison whistle still unsatisfied still demanding its prey shattered the silence as though it had hit him a physical blow the youth jumped he turned and lifted startled inquiring eyes to where keep stood above him i told you said keep to ask no questions as fred reentered the hall winnie keep was coming down the stairs toward him she had changed to one of the prettiest evening gowns of her trousseau and so outrageously lovely was the combination of herself and the gown that her husbands excitement and anxiety fell from him and he was lost in admiration but he was not for long lost to his horror the door of the coatcloset opened toward his wife and out of the closet the stranger emerged winnie not accustomed to seeing young men suddenly appear from among the dustcoats uttered a sharp shriek with what he considered great presence of mind fred swung upon the visitor did you fix it he demanded the visitor did not heed him in amazement in abject admiration his eyes were fastened upon the beautiful and radiant vision presented by winnie keep but he also still preserved sufficient presence of mind to nod his head dully come commanded fred the car is waiting still the stranger did not move as though he had never before seen a woman as though her dazzling loveliness held him in a trance he stood still gazing gaping devouring winnie with his eyes in her turn winnie beheld a strange youth who looked like a groom out of livery so overcome by her mere presence as to be struck motionless and inarticulate for protection she moved in some alarm toward her husband the stranger gave a sudden jerk of his body that might have been intended for a bow before keep could interrupt him like a parrot reciting its lesson he exclaimed explosively my names van warden im harry van warden he seemed as little convinced of the truth of his statement as though he had announced that he was the czar of russia it was as though a stagemanager had drilled him in the lines but upon winnie as her husband saw to his dismay the words produced an instant and appalling effect she fairly radiated excitement and delight how her husband had succeeded in capturing the social prize of scarboro she could not imagine but for doing so she flashed toward him a glance of deep and grateful devotion then she beamed upon the stranger wont mr van warden stay to dinner she asked her husband emitted a howl he will not he cried hes not that kind of a van warden hes a plumber hes the man that fixes the telephone he seized the visitor by the sleeve of the long motorcoat and dragged him down the steps reluctantly almost resistingly the visitor stumbled after him casting backward amazed glances at the beautiful lady fred thrust him into the seat beside the chauffeur pointing at the golfcap and automobile goggles which the stranger was stupidly twisting in his hands fred whispered fiercely put those on cover your face dont speak the man knows what to do with eager eyes and parted lips james the chauffeur was waiting for the signal fred nodded sharply and the chauffeur stooped to throw in the clutch but the car did not start from the hedge beside the driveway directly in front of the wheels something on all fours threw itself upon the gravel something in a suit of purplegray something torn and bleeding smeared with sweat and dirt something that cringed and crawled that tried to rise and sank back upon its knees lifting to the glare of the headlights the white face and white hair of a very old old man the kneeling figure sobbed the sobs rising from far down in the pit of the stomach wrenching the body like waves of nausea the man stretched his arms toward them from long disuse his voice cracked and broke im done he sobbed i cant go no farther i give myself up above the awful silence that held the four young people the prison siren shrieked in one long mocking howl of triumph it was the stranger who was the first to act pushing past fred and slipping from his own shoulders the long motorcoat he flung it over the suit of purplegray the goggles he clapped upon the old mans frightened eyes the golfcap he pulled down over the white hair with one arm he lifted the convict and with the other dragged and pushed him into the seat beside the chauffeur into the hands of the chauffeur he thrust the roll of bills get him away he ordered its only twelve miles to the connecticut line as soon as youre across buy him clothes and a ticket to boston go through white plains to greenwich and then youre safe as though suddenly remembering the presence of the owner of the car he swung upon fred am i right he demanded of course roared fred he flung his arm at the chauffeur as though throwing him into space gettohelloutofhere he shouted the chauffeur by profession a criminal but by birth a human being chuckled savagely and this time threw in the clutch with a grinding of gravel the racingcar leaped into the night its ruby rear lamp winking in farewell its tiny siren answering the great siren of the prison in jeering notes of joy and victory fred had supposed that at the last moment the younger convict proposed to leap to the runningboard but instead the stranger remained motionless fred shouted impotently after the flying car in dismay he seized the stranger by the arm but you he demanded how are you going to get away the stranger turned appealingly to where upon the upper step stood winnie keep i dont want to get away he said i was hoping maybe youd let me stay to dinner a terrible and icy chill crept down the spine of fred keep he moved so that the light from the hall fell full upon the face of the stranger will you kindly tell me fred demanded who the devil you are the stranger exclaimed peevishly ive been telling you all evening he protested im harry van warden gridley the ancient butler appeared in the open door dinner is served madam he said the stranger gave an exclamation of pleasure hello gridley he cried will you please tell mr keep who i am tell him if hell ask me to dinner i wont steal the spoons upon the face of gridley appeared a smile it never had been the privilege of fred keep to behold the butler beamed upon the stranger fondly proudly by the right of long acquaintanceship with the affection of an old friend still beaming he bowed to keep if mr harry mr van warden he said is to stay to dinner might i suggest sir he is very partial to the paul vibert fred keep gazed stupidly from his butler to the stranger and then at his wife she was again radiantly beautiful and smilingly happy gridley coughed tentatively shall i open a bottle sir he asked hopelessly fred tossed his arms heavenward open a case he roared at ten oclock when they were still at table and reaching a state of such mutual appreciation that soon they would be calling each other by their first names gridley brought in a written message he had taken from the telephone it was a longdistance call from yonkers sent by james the faithful chauffeur fred read it aloud i got that party the articles he needed it read and saw him safe on a train to boston on the way back i got arrested for speeding the car on the way down please send money i am in a cell in yonkers chapter the boy who cried wolf before he finally arrested him jimmie sniffen had seen the man with the golfcap and the blue eyes that laughed at you three times twice unexpectedly he had come upon him in a wood road and once on round hill where the stranger was pretending to watch the sunset jimmie knew people do not climb hills merely to look at sunsets so he was not deceived he guessed the man was a german spy seeking gun sites and secretly vowed to stalk him from that moment had the stranger known it he was as good as dead for a boy scout with badges on his sleeve for stalking and pathfinding not to boast of others for gardening and cooking can outwit any spy even had general badenpowell remained in mafeking and not invented the boy scout jimmie sniffen would have been one because by birth he was a boy and by inheritance a scout in westchester county the sniffens are one of the county families if it isnt a sarles its a sniffen and with brundages platts and jays the sniffens date back to when the acres of the first charles ferris ran from the boston post road to the coach road to albany and when the first gouverneur morris stood on one of his hills and saw the indian canoes in the hudson and in the sound and rejoiced that all the land between belonged to him if you do not believe in heredity the fact that jimmies greatgreatgrandfather was a scout for general washington and hunted deer and even bear over exactly the same hills where jimmie hunted weasles will count for nothing it will not explain why to jimmie from tarrytown to port chester the hills the roads the woods and the cowpaths caves streams and springs hidden in the woods were as familiar as his own kitchen garden nor explain why when you could not see a pease and elliman for sale sign nailed to a tree jimmie could see in the highest branches a last years birds nest or why when he was out alone playing indians and had sunk his scouts axe into a fallen log and then scalped the log he felt that once before in those same woods he had trailed that same indian and with his own tomahawk split open his skull sometimes when he knelt to drink at a secret spring in the forest the autumn leaves would crackle and he would raise his eyes fearing to see a panther facing him but there aint no panthers in westchester jimmie would reassure himself and in the distance the roar of an automobile climbing a hill with the muffler open would seem to suggest he was right but still jimmie remembered once before he had knelt at that same spring and that when he raised his eyes he had faced a crouching panther mebbe dad told me it happened to grandpop jimmie would explain or i dreamed it or mebbe i read it in a story book the german spy mania attacked round hill after the visit to the boy scouts of clavering gould the war correspondent he was spending the week end with squire harry van vorst and as young van vorst besides being a justice of the peace and a master of beagles and president of the country club was also a local councilman for the round hill scouts he brought his guest to a campfire meeting to talk to them in deference to his audience gould told them of the boy scouts he had seen in belgium and of the part they were playing in the great war it was his peroration that made trouble and any day he assured his audience this country may be at war with germany and every one of you boys will be expected to do his bit you can begin now when the germans land it will be near new haven or new bedford they will first capture the munition works at springfield hartford and watervliet so as to make sure of their ammunition and then they will start for new york city they will follow the new haven and new york central railroads and march straight through this village i havent the least doubt exclaimed the enthusiastic war prophet that at this moment german spies are as thick in westchester as blackberries they are here to select camp sites and gun positions to find out which of these hills enfilade the others and to learn to what extent their armies can live on the country they are counting the cows the horses the barns where fodder is stored and they are marking down on their maps the wells and streams as though at that moment a german spy might be crouching behind the door mr gould spoke in a whisper keep your eyes open he commanded watch every stranger if he acts suspiciously get word quick to your sheriff or to judge van vorst here remember the scouts motto be prepared that night as the scouts walked home behind each wall and hayrick they saw spiked helmets young van vorst was extremely annoyed next time you talk to my scouts he declared youll talk on votes for women after what you said tonight every real estate agent who dares open a map will be arrested were not trying to drive people away from westchester were trying to sell them building sites you are not retorted his friend you own half the county now and youre trying to buy the other half im a justice of the peace explained van vorst i dont know why i am except that they wished it on me all i get out of it is trouble the italians make charges against my best friends for overspeeding and i have to fine them and my best friends bring charges against the italians for poaching and when i fine the italians they send me black hand letters and now every day ill be asked to issue a warrant for a german spy who is selecting gun sites and he will turn out to be a millionaire who is tired of living at the ritzcarlton and wants to own his own home and his own golflinks and hell be so hot at being arrested that hell take his millions to long island and try to break into the piping rock club and it will be your fault the young justice of the peace was right at least so far as jimmie sniffen was concerned the words of the war prophet had filled one mind with unrest in the past jimmies idea of a holiday had been to spend it scouting in the woods in this pleasure he was selfish he did not want companions who talked and trampled upon the dead leaves so that they frightened the wild animals and gave the indians warning jimmie liked to pretend he liked to fill the woods with wary and hostile adversaries it was a game of his own inventing if he crept to the top of a hill and on peering over it surprised a fat woodchuck he pretended the woodchuck was a bear weighing two hundred pounds if himself unobserved he could lie and watch off its guard a rabbit squirrel or most difficult of all a crow it became a deer and that night at supper jimmie made believe he was eating venison sometimes he was a scout of the continental army and carried despatches to general washington the rules of that game were that if any man ploughing in the fields or cutting trees in the woods or even approaching along the same road saw jimmie before jimmie saw him jimmie was taken prisoner and before sunrise was shot as a spy he was seldom shot or else why on his sleeve was the badge for stalking but always to have to make believe became monotonous even dry shopping along the rue de la paix when you pretend you can have anything you see in any window leaves one just as rich but unsatisfied so the advice of the war correspondent to seek out german spies came to jimmie like a day at the circus like a week at the danbury fair it not only was a call to arms to protect his flag and home but a chance to play in earnest the game in which he most delighted no longer need he pretend no longer need he waste his energies in watching unobserved a greedy rabbit rob a carrot field the game now was his fellowman and his enemy not only his enemy but the enemy of his country in his first effort jimmie was not entirely successful the man looked the part perfectly he wore an auburn beard disguising spectacles and he carried a suspicious knapsack but he turned out to be a professor from the museum of natural history who wanted to dig for indian arrowheads and when jimmie threatened to arrest him the indignant gentleman arrested jimmie jimmie escaped only by leading the professor to a secret cave of his own though on some one elses property where one not only could dig for arrowheads but find them the professor was delighted but for jimmie it was a great disappointment the week following jimmie was again disappointed on the bank of the kensico reservoir he came upon a man who was acting in a mysterious and suspicious manner he was making notes in a book and his runabout which he had concealed in a wood road was stuffed with blueprints it did not take jimmie long to guess his purpose he was planning to blow up the kensico dam and cut off the water supply of new york city seven millions of people without water with out firing a shot new york must surrender at the thought jimmie shuddered and at the risk of his life by clinging to the tail of a motor truck he followed the runabout into white plains but there it developed the mysterious stranger so far from wishing to destroy the kensico dam was the state engineer who had built it and also a large part of the panama canal nor in his third effort was jimmie more successful from the heights of pound ridge he discovered on a hilltop below him a man working alone upon a basin of concrete the man was a germanamerican and already on jimmies list of suspects that for the use of the german artillery he was preparing a concrete bed for a siege gun was only too evident but closer investigation proved that the concrete was only two inches thick and the hyphenated one explained that the basin was built over a spring in the waters of which he planned to erect a fountain and raise gold fish it was a bitter blow jimmie became discouraged meeting judge van vorst one day in the road he told him his troubles the young judge proved unsympathetic my advice to you jimmie he said is to go slow accusing everybody of espionage is a very serious matter if you call a man a spy its sometimes hard for him to disprove it and the name sticks so go slow very slow before you arrest any more people come to me first for a warrant so the next time jimmie proceeded with caution besides being a farmer in a small way jimmies father was a handy man with tools he had no union card but in laying shingles along a blue chalk line few were as expert it was august there was no school and jimmie was carrying a dinnerpail to where his father was at work on a new barn he made a crosscut through the woods and came upon the young man in the golfcap the stranger nodded and his eyes which seemed to be always laughing smiled pleasantly but he was deeply tanned and from the waist up held himself like a soldier so at once jimmie mistrusted him early the next morning jimmie met him again it had not been raining but the clothes of the young man were damp jimmie guessed that while the dew was still on the leaves the young man had been forcing his way through underbrush the stranger must have remembered jimmie for he laughed and exclaimed ah my friend with the dinnerpail its luck you havent got it now or id hold you up im starving jimmie smiled in sympathy its early to be hungry said jimmie when did you have your breakfast i didnt laughed the young man i went out to walk up an appetite and i lost myself but i havent lost my appetite which is the shortest way back to bedford the first road to your right said jimmie is it far asked the stranger anxiously that he was very hungry was evident its a halfhours walk said jimmie if i live that long corrected the young man and stepped out briskly jimmie knew that within a hundred yards a turn in the road would shut him from sight so he gave the stranger time to walk that distance and then diving into the wood that lined the road stalked him from behind a tree he saw the stranger turn and look back and seeing no one in the road behind him also leave it and plunge into the woods he had not turned toward bedford he had turned to the left like a runner stealing bases jimmie slipped from tree to tree ahead of him he heard the stranger trampling upon dead twigs moving rapidly as one who knew his way at times through the branches jimmie could see the broad shoulders of the stranger and again could follow his progress only by the noise of the crackling twigs when the noises ceased jimmie guessed the stranger had reached the wood road grassgrown and mosscovered that led to middle patent so he ran at right angles until he also reached it and as now he was close to where it entered the main road he approached warily but he was too late there was a sound like the whir of a rising partridge and ahead of him from where it had been hidden a gray touringcar leaped into the highway the stranger was at the wheel throwing behind it a cloud of dust the car raced toward greenwich jimmie had time to note only that it bore a connecticut state license that in the wheelruts the tires printed little vs like arrowheads for a week jimmie saw nothing of the spy but for many hot and dusty miles he stalked arrowheads they lured him north they lured him south they were stamped in soft asphalt in mud dust and freshspread tarvia wherever jimmie walked arrowheads ran before in his sleep as in his copybook he saw endless chains of vs but not once could he catch up with the wheels that printed them a week later just at sunset as he passed below round hill he saw the stranger on top of it on the skyline in silhouette against the sinking sun he was as conspicuous as a flagstaff but to approach him was impossible for acres round hill offered no other cover than stubble it was as bald as a skull until the stranger chose to descend jimmie must wait and the stranger was in no haste the sun sank and from the west jimmie saw him turn his face east toward the sound a storm was gathering drops of rain began to splash and as the sky grew black the figure on the hilltop faded into the darkness and then at the very spot where jimmie had last seen it there suddenly flared two tiny flashes of fire jimmie leaped from cover it was no longer to be endured the spy was signalling the time for caution had passed now was the time to act jimmie raced to the top of the hill and found it empty he plunged down it vaulted a stone wall forced his way through a tangle of saplings and held his breath to listen just beyond him over a jumble of rocks a hidden stream was tripping and tumbling joyfully it laughed and gurgled jimmie turned hot it sounded as though from the darkness the spy mocked him jimmie shook his fist at the enshrouding darkness above the tumult of the coming storm and the tossing treetops he raised his voice you wait he shouted ill get you yet next time ill bring a gun next time was the next morning there had been a hawk hovering over the chicken yard and jimmie used that fact to explain his borrowing the family shotgun he loaded it with buckshot and in the pocket of his shirt buttoned his license to hunt pursue and kill to take with traps or other devices he remembered that judge van vorst had warned him before he arrested more spies to come to him for a warrant but with an impatient shake of the head jimmie tossed the recollection from him after what he had seen he could not possibly be again mistaken he did not need a warrant what he had seen was his warrant plus the shotgun as a pathfinder should he planned to take up the trail where he had lost it but before he reached round hill he found a warmer trail before him stamped clearly in the road still damp from the rain of the night before two lines of little arrowheads pointed the way they were so fresh that at each twist in the road lest the car should be just beyond him jimmie slackened his steps after half a mile the scent grew hot the tracks were deeper the arrowheads more clearly cut and jimmie broke into a run then the arrowheads swung suddenly to the right and in a clearing at the edge of a wood were lost but the tires had pressed deep into the grass and just inside the wood he found the car it was empty jimmie was drawn two ways should he seek the spy on the nearest hilltop or until the owner returned wait by the car between lying in ambush and action jimmie preferred action but he did not climb the hill nearest the car he climbed the hill that overlooked that hill flat on the ground hidden in the goldenrod he lay motionless before him for fifteen miles stretched hills and tiny valleys six miles away to his right rose the stone steeple and the red roofs of greenwich directly before him were no signs of habitation only green forests green fields gray stone walls and where a road ran uphill a splash of white that quivered in the heat the storm of the night before had washed the air each leaf stood by itself nothing stirred and in the glare of the august sun every detail of the landscape was as distinct as those in a colored photograph and as still in his excitement the scout was trembling if he moves he sighed happily ive got him opposite across a little valley was the hill at the base of which he had found the car the slope toward him was bare but the top was crowned with a thick wood and along its crest as though establishing an ancient boundary ran a stone wall mosscovered and wrapped in poisonivy in places the branches of the trees reaching out to the sun overhung the wall and hid it in black shadows jimmie divided the hill into sectors he began at the right and slowly followed the wall with his eyes he took it apart stone by stone had a chipmunk raised his head jimmie would have seen him so when from the stone wall like the reflection of the sun upon a windowpane something flashed jimmie knew he had found his spy a pair of binoculars had betrayed him jimmie now saw him clearly he sat on the ground at the top of the hill opposite in the deep shadow of an oak his back against the stone wall with the binoculars to his eyes he had leaned too far forward and upon the glass the sun had flashed a warning jimmie appreciated that his attack must be made from the rear backward like a crab he wriggled free of the goldenrod and hidden by the contour of the hill raced down it and into the woods on the hill opposite when he came to within twenty feet of the oak beneath which he had seen the stranger he stood erect and as though avoiding a live wire stepped on tiptoe to the wall the stranger still sat against it the binoculars hung from a cord around his neck across his knees was spread a map he was marking it with a pencil and as he worked he hummed a tune jimmie knelt and resting the gun on the top of the wall covered him throw up your hands he commanded the stranger did not start except that he raised his eyes he gave no sign that he had heard his eyes stared across the little sunfilled valley they were half closed as though in study as though perplexed by some deep and intricate problem they appeared to see beyond the sunfilled valley some place of greater moment some place far distant then the eyes smiled and slowly as though his neck were stiff but still smiling the stranger turned his head when he saw the boy his smile was swept away in waves of surprise amazement and disbelief these were followed instantly by an expression of the most acute alarm dont point that thing at me shouted the stranger is it loaded with his cheek pressed to the stock and his eye squinted down the length of the brown barrel jimmie nodded the stranger flung up his open palms they accented his expression of amazed incredulity he seemed to be exclaiming can such things be get up commanded jimmie with alacrity the stranger rose walk over there ordered the scout walk backward stop take off those fieldglasses and throw them to me without removing his eyes from the gun the stranger lifted the binoculars from his neck and tossed them to the stone wall see here he pleaded if youll only point that damned blunderbuss the other way you can have the glasses and my watch and clothes and all my money only dont jimmie flushed crimson you cant bribe me he growled at least he tried to growl but because his voice was changing or because he was excited the growl ended in a high squeak with mortification jimmie flushed a deeper crimson but the stranger was not amused at jimmies words he seemed rather the more amazed im not trying to bribe you he protested if you dont want anything why are you holding me up im not returned jimmie im arresting you the stranger laughed with relief again his eyes smiled oh he cried i see have i been trespassing with a glance jimmie measured the distance between himself and the stranger reassured he lifted one leg after the other over the wall if you try to rush me he warned ill shoot you full of buckshot the stranger took a hasty step backward dont worry about that he exclaimed ill not rush you why am i arrested hugging the shotgun with his left arm jimmie stopped and lifted the binoculars he gave them a swift glance slung them over his shoulder and again clutched his weapon his expression was now stern and menacing the name on them he accused is weiss berlin is that your name the stranger smiled but corrected himself and replied gravely thats the name of the firm that makes them jimmie exclaimed in triumph hah he cried made in germany the stranger shook his head i dont understand he said where would a weiss glass be made with polite insistence he repeated would you mind telling me why i am arrested and who you might happen to be jimmie did not answer again he stooped and picked up the map and as he did so for the first time the face of the stranger showed that he was annoyed jimmie was not at home with maps they told him nothing but the penciled notes on this one made easy reading at his first glance he saw correct range yards this stream not fordable slope of hill degrees inaccessible for artillery wire entanglements here forage for five squadrons jimmies eyes flashed he shoved the map inside his shirt and with the gun motioned toward the base of the hill keep forty feet ahead of me he commanded and walk to your car the stranger did not seem to hear him he spoke with irritation i suppose he said ill have to explain to you about that map not to me you wont declared his captor youre going to drive straight to judge van vorsts and explain to him the stranger tossed his arms even higher thank god he exclaimed gratefully with his prisoner jimmie encountered no further trouble he made a willing captive and if in covering the five miles to judge van vorsts he exceeded the speed limit the fact that from the rear seat jimmie held the shotgun against the base of his skull was an extenuating circumstance they arrived in the nick of time in his own car young van vorst and a bag of golf clubs were just drawing away from the house seeing the car climbing the steep driveway that for a halfmile led from his lodge to his front door and seeing jimmie standing in the tonneau brandishing a gun the judge hastily descended the sight of the spy hunter filled him with misgiving but the sight of him gave jimmie sweet relief arresting german spies for a small boy is no easy task for jimmie the strain was great and now that he knew he had successfully delivered him into the hands of the law jimmies heart rose with happiness the added presence of a butler of magnificent bearing and of an athletic looking chauffeur increased his sense of security their presence seemed to afford a feeling of security to the prisoner also as he brought the car to a halt he breathed a sigh it was a sigh of deep relief jimmie fell from the tonneau in concealing his sense of triumph he was not entirety successful i got him he cried i didnt make no mistake about this one what one demanded van vorst jimmie pointed dramatically at his prisoner with an anxious expression the stranger was tenderly fingering the back of his head he seemed to wish to assure himself that it was still there that one cried jimmie hes a german spy the patience of judge van vorst fell from him in his exclamation was indignation anger reproach jimmie he cried jimmie thrust into his hand the map it was his exhibit a look what hes wrote commanded the scout its all military words and these are his glasses i took em off him theyre made in germany i been stalking him for a week hes a spy when jimmie thrust the map before his face van vorst had glanced at it then he regarded it more closely as he raised his eyes they showed that he was puzzled but he greeted the prisoner politely im extremely sorry youve been annoyed he said im only glad its no worse he might have shot you hes mad over the idea that every stranger he sees the prisoner quickly interrupted please he begged dont blame the boy he behaved extremely well might i speak with you alone he asked judge van vorst led the way across the terrace and to the smokingroom that served also as his office and closed the door the stranger walked directly to the mantelpiece and put his finger on a gold cup i saw your mare win that at belmont park he said she must have been a great loss to you she was said van vorst the week before she broke her back i refused three thousand for her will you have a cigarette the stranger waved aside the cigarettes i brought you inside he said because i didnt want your servants to hear and because i dont want to hurt that boys feelings hes a fine boy and hes a damned clever scout i knew he was following me and i threw him off twice but today he caught me fair if i really had been a german spy i couldnt have got away from him and i want him to think he has captured a german spy because he deserves just as much credit as though he had and because its best he shouldnt know whom he did capture van vorst pointed to the map my bet is he said that youre an officer of the state militia taking notes for the fall manoeuvres am i right the stranger smiled in approval but shook his head youre warm he said but its more serious than manoeuvres its the real thing from his pocketbook he took a visiting card and laid it on the table im sherry mccoy he said captain of artillery in the united states army he nodded to the hand telephone on the table you can call up governors island and get general wood or his aide captain dorey on the phone they sent me here ask them im not picking out gun sites for the germans im picking out positions of defense for americans when the germans come van vorst laughed derisively my word he exclaimed youre as bad as jimmie captain mccoy regarded him with disfavor and you sir he retorted are as bad as ninety million other americans you wont believe when the germans are shelling this hill when theyre taking your hunters to pull their cookwagons maybe youll believe then are you serious demanded van vorst and you an army officer thats why i am serious returned mccoy we know but when we try to prepare for what is coming we must do it secretly in underhand ways for fear the newspapers will get hold of it and ridicule us and accuse us of trying to drag the country into war thats why we have to prepare under cover thats why ive had to skulk around these hills like a chicken thief and he added sharply thats why that boy must not know who i am if he does the general staff will get a calling down at washington and ill have my ears boxed van vorst moved to the door he will never learn the truth from me he said for i will tell him you are to be shot at sunrise good laughed the captain and tell me his name if ever we fight over westchester county i want that lad for my chief of scouts and give him this tell him to buy a new scout uniform tell him it comes from you but no money could reconcile jimmie to the sentence imposed upon his captive he received the news with a howl of anguish you mustnt he begged i never knowed youd shoot him i wouldnt have caught him if id knowed that i couldnt sleep if i thought he was going to be shot at sunrise at the prospect of unending nightmares jimmies voice shook with terror make it for twenty years he begged make it for ten he coaxed but please promise you wont shoot him when van vorst returned to captain mccoy he was smiling and the butler who followed bearing a tray and tinkling glasses was trying not to smile i gave jimmie your ten dollars said van vorst and made it twenty and he has gone home you will be glad to hear that he begged me to spare your life and that your sentence has been commuted to twenty years in a fortress i drink to your good fortune no protested captain mccoy we will drink to jimmie when captain mccoy had driven away and his own car and the golf clubs had again been brought to the steps judge van vorst once more attempted to depart but he was again delayed other visitors were arriving up the driveway a touringcar approached and though it limped on a flat tire it approached at reckless speed the two men in the front seat were white with dust their faces masked by automobile glasses were indistinguishable as though preparing for an immediate exit the car swung in a circle until its nose pointed down the driveway up which it had just come raising his silk mask the one beside the driver shouted at judge van vorst his throat was parched his voice was hoarse and hot with anger a gray touringcar he shouted it stopped here we saw it from that hill then the damn tire burst and we lost our way where did he go who demanded van vorst stiffly captain mccoy the man exploded with an oath the driver with a shove of his elbow silenced him yes captain mccoy assented the driver eagerly which way did he go to new york said van vorst the driver shrieked at his companion then hes doubled back he cried hes gone to new haven he stooped and threw in the clutch the car lurched forward a cold terror swept young van vorst what do you want with him he called who are you over one shoulder the masked face glared at him above the roar of the car the words of the driver were flung back were secret service from washington he shouted hes from their embassy hes a german spy leaping and throbbing at sixty miles an hour the car vanished in a curtain of white whirling dust chapter the cardsharp i had looked forward to spending christmas with some people in suffolk and every one in london assured me that at their house there would be the kind of a christmas house party you hear about but see only in the illustrated christmas numbers they promised mistletoe snapdragon and sir roger de coverley on christmas morning we would walk to church after luncheon we would shoot after dinner we would eat plum pudding floating in blazing brandy dance with the servants and listen to the waits singing god rest you merry gentlemen let nothing you dismay to a lone american bachelor stranded in london it sounded fine and in my gratitude i had already shipped to my hostess for her children of whose age number and sex i was ignorant half of gamages dolls skees and cricket bats and those crackers that when you pull them sometimes explode but it was not to be most inconsiderately my wealthiest patient gained sufficient courage to consent to an operation and in all new york would permit no one to lay violent hands upon him save myself by cable i advised postponement having lived in lawful harmony with his appendix for fifty years i thought for one week longer he might safely maintain the status quo but his cable in reply was an ultimatum so on christmas eve instead of hallam hall and a yule log i was in a gale plunging and pitching off the coast of ireland and the only log on board was the one the captain kept to himself i sat in the smokingroom depressed and cross and it must have been on the principle that misery loves company that i foregathered with talbot or rather that talbot foregathered with me certainty under happier conditions and in haunts of men more crowded the openfaced manner in which he forced himself upon me would have put me on my guard but either out of deference to the holiday spirit as manifested in the fictitious gayety of our few fellowpassengers or because the young man in a knowing impertinent way was most amusing i listened to him from dinner time until midnight when the chief officer hung with snow and icicles was blown in from the deck and wished all a merry christmas even after they unmasked talbot i had neither the heart nor the inclination to turn him down indeed had not some of the passengers testified that i belonged to a different profession the smokingroom crowd would have quarantined me as his accomplice on the first night i met him i was not certain whether he was english or giving an imitation all the outward and visible signs were english but he told me that though he had been educated at oxford and since then had spent most of his years in india playing polo he was an american he seemed to have spent much time and according to himself much money at the french wateringplaces and on the riviera i felt sure that it was in france i had already seen him but where i could not recall he was hard to place of people at home and in london well worth knowing he talked glibly but in speaking of them he made several slips it was his taking the trouble to cover up the slips that first made me wonder if his talking about himself was not mere vanity but had some special object i felt he was presenting letters of introduction in order that later he might ask a favor whether he was leading up to an immediate loan or in new york would ask for a card to a club or an introduction to a banker i could not tell but in forcing himself upon me except in selfinterest i could think of no other motive the next evening i discovered the motive he was in the smokingroom playing solitaire and at once i recalled that it was at aixlesbains i had first seen him and that he held a bank at baccarat when he asked me to sit down i said i saw you last summer at aixlesbains his eyes fell to the pack in his hands and apparently searched it for some particular card what was i doing he asked dealing baccarat at the casino des fleurs with obvious relief he laughed oh yes he assented jolly place aix but i lost a pot of money there im a rotten hand at cards cant win and cant leave em alone as though for this weakness so frankly confessed he begged me to excuse him he smiled appealingly poker bridge chemin de fer i like em all he rattled on but they dont like me so i stick to solitaire its dull but cheap he shuffled the cards clumsily as though making conversation he asked you care for cards yourself i told him truthfully i did not know the difference between a club and a spade and had no curiosity to learn at this when he found he had been wasting time on me i expected him to show some sign of annoyance even of irritation but his disappointment struck far deeper as though i had hurt him physically he shut his eyes and when again he opened them i saw in them distress for the moment i believe of my presence he was utterly unconscious his hands lay idle upon the table like a man facing a crisis he stared before him quite improperly i felt sorry for him in me he thought he had found a victim and that the loss of the few dollars he might have won should so deeply disturb him showed his need was great almost at once he abandoned me and i went on deck when i returned an hour later to the smokingroom he was deep in a game of poker as i passed he hailed me gayly dont scold now he laughed you know i cant keep away from it from his manner those at the table might have supposed we were friends of long and happy companionship i stopped behind his chair but he thought i had passed and in reply to one of the players answered known him for years hes set me right many a time when i broke my right femur chasin he got me back in the saddle in six weeks all my people swear by him one of the players smiled up at me and talbot turned but his eyes met mine with perfect serenity he even held up his cards for me to see what would you draw he asked his audacity so astonished me that in silence i could only stare at him and walk on when on deck he met me he was not even apologetic instead as though we were partners in crime he chuckled delightedly sorry he said had to do it they werent very keen at my taking a hand so i had to use your name but im all right now he assured me they think you vouched for me and tonight theyre going to raise the limit ive convinced them im an easy mark and i take it you are not i said stiffly he considered this unworthy of an answer and only smiled then the smile died and again in his eyes i saw distress infinite weariness and fear as though his thoughts drove him to seek protection he came closer im in bad doctor he said his voice was frightened bewildered like that of a child i cant sleep nerves all on the loose i dont think straight i hear voices and no one around i hear knockings at the door and when i open it no one there if i dont keep fit i cant work and this trip i got to make expenses you couldnt help me could you couldnt give me something to keep my head straight the need of my keeping his head straight that he might the easier rob our fellowpassengers raised a pretty question of ethics i meanly dodged it i told him professional etiquette required i should leave him to the ships surgeon but i dont know him he protested mindful of the use he had made of my name i objected strenuously well you certainly dont know me my resentment obviously puzzled him i know who you are he returned you and i with a deprecatory gesture as though good taste forbade him saying who we were he stopped but the ships surgeon he protested hes an awful bounder besides he added quite simply hes watching me as a doctor i asked or watching you play cards play cards the young man answered im afraid he was ships surgeon on the p o i came home on there was trouble that voyage and i fancy he remembers me his confidences were becoming a nuisance but you mustnt tell me that i protested i cant have you making trouble on this ship too how do you know i wont go straight from here to the captain as though the suggestion greatly entertained him he laughed he made a mock obeisance i claim the seal of your profession he said nonsense i retorted its a professional secret that your nerves are out of hand but that you are a cardsharp is not dont mix me up with a priest for a moment talbot as though fearing he had gone too far looked at me sharply he bit his lower lip and frowned i got to make expenses he muttered and besides all card games are games of chance and a cardsharp is one of the chances anyway he repeated as though disposing of all argument i got to make expenses after dinner when i came to the smokingroom the poker party sat waiting and one of them asked if i knew where they could find my friend i should have said then that talbot was a steamer acquaintance only but i hate a row and i let the chance pass we want to give him his revenge one of them volunteered hes losing then i asked the man chuckled complacently the only loser he said i wouldnt worry i advised hell come for his revenge that night after i had turned in he knocked at my door i switched on the lights and saw him standing at the foot of my berth i saw also that with difficulty he was holding himself in hand im scared he stammered scared i wrote out a requisition on the surgeon for a sleepingpotion and sent it to him by the steward giving the man to understand i wanted it for myself uninvited talbot had seated himself on the sofa his eyes were closed and as though he were cold he was shivering and hugging himself in his arms have you been drinking i asked in surprise he opened his eyes i cant drink he answered simply its nerves and worry im tired he relaxed against the cushions his arms fell heavily at his sides the fingers lay open god he whispered how tired i am in spite of his tan and certainly he had led the outofdoor life his face showed white for the moment he looked old worn finished theyre crowdin me the boy whispered theyre always crowdin me his voice was querulous uncomprehending like that of a child complaining of something beyond his experience i cant remember when they havent been crowdin me movin me on you understand always movin me on moved me out of india then cairo then they closed paris and now theyve shut me out of london i opened a club there very quiet very exclusive smart neighborhood too a flat in berkeley street roulette and chemin de fer i think it was my valet sold me out anyway they came in and took us all to bow street so ive plunged on this its my last chance this trip no my family in new york havent seen em in ten years they paid me to live abroad im gambling on them gambling on their takin me back im coming home as the prodigal son tired of filling my belly with the husks that the swine do eat reformed character repentant and all that want to follow the straight and narrow and theyll kill the fatted calf he laughed sardonically like hell they will theyd rather see me killed it seemed to me if he wished his family to believe he were returning repentant his course in the smokingroom would not help to reassure them i suggested as much if you get into trouble as you call it i said and they send a wireless to the police to be at the wharf your people would hardly i know he interrupted but i got to chance that i got to make enough to go on with until i see my family if they wont see you i asked what then he shrugged his shoulders and sighed lightly almost with relief as though for him the prospect held no terror then its goodnight nurse he said and i wont be a bother to anybody any more i told him his nerves were talking and talking rot and i gave him the sleepingdraft and sent him to bed it was not until after luncheon the next day when he made his first appearance on deck that i again saw my patient he was once more a healthy picture of a young englishman of leisure keen smart and fit ready for any exercise or sport the particular sport at which he was so expert i asked him to avoid cant be done he assured me im the loser and we dock tomorrow morning so tonight ive got to make my killing it was the others who made the killing i came into the smokingroom about nine oclock talbot alone was seated the others were on their feet and behind them in a wider semicircle were passengers the smokingroom stewards and the ships purser talbot sat with his back against the bulkhead his hands in the pockets of his dinner coat from the corner of his mouth his long cigaretteholder was cocked at an impudent angle there was a tumult of angry voices and the eyes of all were turned upon him outwardly at least he met them with complete indifference the voice of one of my countrymen a noisy pest named smedburg was raised in excited accusation when the ships surgeon first met you he cried you called yourself lord ridley ill call myself anything i jolly well like returned talbot if i choose to dodge reporters thats my pidgin i dont have to give my name to every meddling busybody that youll give it to the police all right chortled mr smedburg in the confident bullying tones of the man who knows the crowd is with him he shouted and in the meantime youll keep out of this smokingroom the chorus of assent was unanimous it could not be disregarded talbot rose and with fastidious concern brushed the cigarette ashes from his sleeve as he moved toward the door he called back only too delighted to keep out the crowd in this room makes a gentleman feel lonely but he was not to escape with the last word his prosecutor pointed his finger at him and the next time you take the name of adolph meyer he shouted make sure first he hasnt a friend on board some one to protect him from sharpers and swindlers talbot turned savagely and then shrugged his shoulders oh go to the devil he called and walked out into the night the purser was standing at my side and catching my eye shook his head bad business he exclaimed what happened i asked im told they caught him dealing from the wrong end of the pack he said i understand they suspected him from the first seems our surgeon recognized him and tonight they had outsiders watching him the outsiders claim they saw him slip himself an ace from the bottom of the pack its a pity hes a nicelooking lad i asked what the excited smedburg had meant by telling talbot not to call himself meyer they accused him of travelling under a false name explained the purser and he told em he did it to dodge the ships news reporters then he said he really was a brother of adolph meyer the banker but it seems smedburg is a friend of meyers and he called him hard it was a silly ass thing to do protested the purser everybody knows meyer hasnt a brother and if he hadnt made that break he might have got away with the other one but now this smedburg is going to wireless ahead to mr meyer and to the police has he no other way of spending his money i asked hes a confounded nuisance growled the purser he wants to show us he knows adolph meyer wants to put meyer under an obligation it means a scene on the wharf and newspaper talk and he added with disgust these smokingroom rows never helped any line i went in search of talbot partly because i knew he was on the verge of a collapse partly as i frankly admitted to myself because i was sorry the young man had come to grief i searched the snowswept decks and then after threading my way through faintly lit tunnels i knocked at his cabin the sound of his voice gave me a distinct feeling of relief but he would not admit me through the closed door he declared he was all right wanted no medical advice and asked only to resume the sleep he claimed i had broken i left him not without uneasiness and the next morning the sight of him still in the flesh was a genuine thrill i found him walking the deck carrying himself nonchalantly and trying to appear unconscious of the glances amused contemptuous hostile that were turned toward him he would have passed me without speaking but i took his arm and led him to the rail we had long passed quarantine and a convoy of tugs were butting us into the dock what are you going to do i asked doesnt depend on me he said depends on smedburg hes a busy little body the boy wanted me to think him unconcerned but beneath the flippancy i saw the nerves jerking then quite simply he began to tell me he spoke in a low even monotone dispassionately as though for him the incident no longer was of interest they were watching me he said but i knew they were and besides no matter how close they watched i could have done what they said i did and theyd never have seen it but i didnt my scepticism must have been obvious for he shook his head i didnt he repeated stubbornly i didnt have to i was playing in luck wonderful luck sheer dumb luck i couldnt help winning but because i was winning and because they were watching i was careful not to win on my own deal i laid down or played to lose it was the cards they gave me i won with and when they jumped me i told em that i could have proved it if theyd listened but they were all up in the air shouting and spitting at me they believed what they wanted to believe they didnt want the facts it may have been credulous of me but i felt the boy was telling the truth and i was deeply sorry he had not stuck to it so rather harshly i said they didnt want you to tell them you were a brother to adolph meyer either why did you think you could get away with anything like that talbot did not answer why i insisted the boy laughed impudently how the devil was i to know he hadnt a brother he protested it was a good name and hes a jew and two of the six who were in the game are jews you know how they stick together i thought they might stick by me but you i retorted impatiently are not a jew i am not said talbot but ive often said i was its helped lots of times if id told you my name was cohen or selinsky or meyer instead of craig talbot youd have thought i was a jew he smiled and turned his face toward me as though furnishing a description for the police he began to enumerate hair dark and curly eyes poppy lips full nose roman or hebraic according to taste do you see he shrugged his shoulders but it didnt work he concluded i picked the wrong jew his face grew serious do you suppose that smedburg person has wirelessed that banker i told him i was afraid he had already sent the message and what will meyer do he asked will he drop it or make a fuss what sort is he briefly i described adolph meyer i explained him as the richest hebrew in new york given to charity to philanthropy to the betterment of his own race then maybe cried talbot hopefully he wont make a row and my family wont hear of it he drew a quick breath of relief as though a burden had been lifted his shoulders straightened and then suddenly harshly in open panic he exclaimed aloud look he whispered there at the end of the wharf the little jew in furs i followed the direction of his eyes below us on the dock protected by two obvious members of the strongarm squad the great banker philanthropist and hebrew adolph meyer was waiting we were so close that i could read his face it was stern set the face of a man intent upon his duty unrelenting without question of a bad business mr smedburg had made the worst i turned to speak to talbot and found him gone his silent slipping away filled me with alarm i fought against a growing fear how many minutes i searched for him i do not know it seemed many hours his cabin where first i sought him was empty and dismantled and by that i was reminded that if for any desperate purpose talbot were seeking to conceal himself there now were hundreds of other empty dismantled cabins in which he might hide to my inquiries no one gave heed in the confusion of departure no one had observed him no one was in a humor to seek him out the passengers were pressing to the gangway the stewards concerned only in counting their tips from deck to deck down lane after lane of the great floating village i raced blindly peering into halfopened doors pushing through groups of men pursuing some one in the distance who appeared to be the man i sought only to find he was unknown to me when i returned to the gangway the last of the passengers was leaving it i was about to follow to seek for talbot in the customs shed when a whitefaced steward touched my sleeve before he spoke his look told me why i was wanted the ships surgeon sir he stammered asks you please to hurry to the sickbay a passenger has shot himself on the bed propped up by pillows young talbot with glazed shocked eyes stared at me his shirt had been cut away his chest lay bare against his left shoulder the doctor pressed a tiny sponge which quickly darkened i must have exclaimed aloud for the doctor turned his eyes it was he sent for you he said but he doesnt need you fortunately hes a damned bad shot the boys eyes opened wearily before we could prevent it he spoke i was so tired he whispered always moving me on i was so tired behind me came heavy footsteps and though with my arm i tried to bar them out the two detectives pushed into the doorway they shoved me to one side and through the passage made for him came the jew in the sable coat mr adolph meyer for an instant the little great man stood with wide owllike eyes staring at the face on the pillow then he sank softly to his knees in both his hands he caught the hand of the cardsharp heine he begged dont you know me it is your brother adolph your little brother adolph
