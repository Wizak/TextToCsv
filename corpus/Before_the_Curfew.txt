childs of philadelphia to the poets who only read and listen for the dedication of the new city library for the window in st margarets james russell lo well before the curfew at my fireside alone beneath the darkened sky with saddened heart and unstrung lyre i heap the spoils of years gone by and leave them with a longdrawn sigh like driftwood brands that glimmering lie before the ashes hide the fire let not these slow declining days the rosy light of dawn outlast still round my lonely hearth it plays and gilds the east with borrowed rays while memorys mirrored sunset blaze flames on the windows of the past march at the saturday club this is our place of meeting opposite that towered and pillared building look at it kings chapel in the second georges day rebellion stole its regal name away stone chapel sounded better but at last the poisoned name of our provincial past had lost its ancient venom then once more stone chapel was kings chapel as before so let rechristened north street when it can bring back the days of marlborough and queen anne next the old church your wandering eye will meet a granite pile that stares upon the street our civic temple slanderous tongues have said its shape was modelled from st botolphs head lofty but narrow jealous passersby say boston always held her head too high turn halfway round and let your look survey the white facade that gleams across the way the manywindowed building tall and wide the palaceinn that shows its northern side in grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat the granite wall in summers scorching heat this is the place whether its name you spell tavern or caravansera or hotel would i could steal its echoes you should find such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind such feasts the laughs of many a jocund hour that shook the mortar from king georges tower such guests what famous names its record boasts whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts such stories every beam and plank is filled with juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled ready to ooze as once the mountain pine the floors are laid with oozed its turpentine a month had flitted since the club had met the day came round i found the table set the waiters lounging round the marble stairs empty as yet the double row of chairs i was a full half hour before the rest alone the banquetchambers single guest so from the tables side a chair i took and having neither company nor book to keep me waking by degrees there crept a torpor over me in short i slept loosed from its chain along the wreckstrown track of the dead years my soul goes travelling back my ghosts take on their robes of flesh it seems dreaming is life nay life less life than dreams so real are the shapes that meet my eyes they bring no sense of wonder no surprise no hint of other than an earthborn source all seems plain daylight everything of course how dim the colors are how poor and faint this palette of weak words with which i paint here sit my friends if i could fix them so as to my eyes they seem my page would glow like a queens missal warm as if the brush of titian or velasquez brought the flush of life into their features ay de mi if syllables were pigments you should see such breathing portraitures as never man found in the pitti or the vatican here sits our poet laureate if you will long has he worn the wreath and wears it still dead nay not so and yet they say his bust looks down on marbles covering royal dust kings by the grace of god or natures grace dead no alive i see him in his place fullfeatured with the bloom that heaven denies her children pinched by cold new england skies too often while the nurserys happier few win from a summer cloud its roseate hue kind softvoiced gentle in his eye there shines the ray serene that filled evangelines modest he seems not shy content to wait amid the noisy clamor of debate the lookedfor moment when a peaceful word smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred in every tone i mark his tender grace and all his poems hinted in his face what tranquil joy his friendly presence gives how could i think him dead he lives he lives there at the tables further end i see in his old place our poets visavis the great professor strong broadshouldered square in lifes rich noontide joyous debonair his social hour no leaden care alloys his laugh rings loud and mirthful as a boys that lusty laugh the puritan forgot what ear has heard it and remembers not how often halting at some wide crevasse amid the windings of his alpine pass high up the cliffs the climbing mountaineer listening the faroff avalanche to hear silent and leaning on his steelshod staff has heard that cheery voice that ringing laugh from the rude cabin whose nomadic walls creep with the moving glacier as it crawls how does vast nature lead her living train in ordered sequence through that spacious brain as in the primal hour when adam named the newborn tribes that young creation claimed how will her realm be darkened losing thee her darling whom we call our agassiz but who is he whose massive frame belies the maiden shyness of his downcast eyes who broods in silence till by questions pressed some answer struggles from his laboring breast an artist nature meant to dwell apart locked in his studio with a human heart tracking its eaverned passions to their lair and all its throbbing mysteries laying bare count it no marvel that he broods alone over the heart he studies t is his own so in his page whatever shape it wear the essex wizards shadowed self is there the great romancer hid beneath his veil like the stern preacher of his sombre tale virile in strength yet bashful as a girl prouder than hester sensitive as pearl from his mild throng of worshippers released our concord delphi sends its chosen priest prophet or poet mystic sage or seer by every title always welcome here why that ethereal spirits frame describe you know the racemarks of the brahmin tribe the spare slight form the sloping shoulders droop the calm scholastic mien the clerkly stoop the lines of thought the sharpened features wear carved by the edge of keen new england air list for he speaks as when a king would choose the jewels for his bride he might refuse this diamond for its flaw find that less bright than those its fellows and a pearl less white than fits her snowy neck and yet at last the fairest gems are chosen and made fast in golden fetters so with light delays he seeks the fittest word to fill his phrase nor vain nor idle his fastidious quest his chosen word is sure to prove the best where in the realm of thought whose air is song does he the buddha of the west belong he seems a winged franklin sweetly wise born to unlock the secrets of the skies and which the nobler calling if t is fair terrestrial with celestial to compare to guide the stormclouds elemental flame or walk the chambers whence the lightning came amidst the sources of its subtile fire and steal their effluence for his lips and lyre if lost at times in vague aerial flights none treads with firmer footstep when he lights a soaring nature ballasted with sense wisdom without her wrinkles or pretence in every bible he has faith to read and every altar helps to shape his creed ask you what name this prisoned spirit bears while with ourselves this fleeting breath it shares till angels greet him with a sweeter one in heaven on earth we call him emerson i start i wake the vision is withdrawn its figures fading like the stars at dawn crossed from the roll of life their cherished names and memorys pictures fading in their frames yet life is lovelier for these transient gleams of buried friendships blest is he who dreams our dead singer h w l pride of the sister realm so long our own we claim with her that spotless fame of thine white as her snow and fragrant as her pine ours was thy birthplace but in every zone some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown breathes perfume from its blossoms that entwine whereer the dewdrops fall the sunbeams shine on lifes long path with tangled cares oergrown can art thy truthful counterfeit command the silverhaloed features tranquil mild soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled give warmth and pressure to the marble hand seek the lost rainbow in the sky it spanned farewell sweet singer heaven reclaims its child carved from the block or cast in clinging mould will grateful memory fondly try her best the mortal vesture from decay to wrest his look shall greet us calm but ah how cold no breath can stir the brazen draperys fold no throb can heave the statues stony breast he is not here but risen will stand confest in all we miss in all our eyes behold how nature loved him on his placid brow thoughts ample dome she set the sacred sign that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine nor asked a leaflet from the laurels bough that envious time might clutch or disallow to prove her chosen minstrels song divine on many a saddened hearth the evening fire burns paler as the childrens hour draws near that joyous hour his song made doubly dear and tender memories touch the faltering choir he sings no more on earth our vain desire aches for the voice we loved so long to hear in dorian flutenotes breathing soft and clear the sweet contralto that could never tire deafened with listening to a harsher strain the maenads scream the stark barbarians cry still for those soothing loving tones we sigh oh for our vanished orpheus once again the shadowy silence hears us call in vain his lips are hushed his song shall never die two poems to harriet beecher stowe on her seventieth birthday june i at the summit sister we bid you welcome we who stand on the high tableland we who have climbed lifes slippery alpine slope and rest still leaning on the staff of hope looking along the silent mer de glace leading our footsteps where the dark crevasse yawns in the frozen sea we all must pass sister we clasp your hand rest with us in the hour that heaven has lent before the swift descent look the warm sunbeams kiss the glittering ice see next the snowdrift blooms the edelweiss the mated eagles fan the frosty air life beauty love around us everywhere and in their time the darkening hours that bear sweet memories peace content thrice welcome shining names our missals show amid their rubrics glow but search the blazoned records starry line what halos radiance fills the page like thine thou who by some celestial clue couldst find the way to all the hearts of all mankind on thee already canonized enshrined what more can heaven bestow ii the worlds homage if every tongue that speaks her praise for whom i shape my tinkling phrase were summoned to the table the vocal chorus that would meet of mingling accents harsh

the holy maid does well who counts her beads in convent cell where pale devotion lingers but she who serves the sufferers needs whose prayers are spelt in loving deeds may trust the lord will count her beads as well as human fingers when truth herself was slaverys slave thy hand the prisoned suppliant gave the rainbow wings of fiction and truth who soared descends today bearing an angels wreath

ionians mizraims learned kings from the dim days of shinars hoary sages to his who weighed the planets fluid rings and we for whom the northern heavens are lighted for whom the storm has passed the

your returning feet puts forth her best your coming steps to greet and heaven must surely find the earth in tune when home sweet home exhales the breath of june these blessed days are waning all too fast and junes bright visions mingling with the past lilacs have bloomed and faded and the rose has dropped its petals but the clover blows and fills its slender tubes with honeyed sweets the fields are pearled with milkwhite margarites the dandelion which you sang of old has lost its pride of place its crown of gold but still displays its featherymantled globe which childrens breath or wandering winds unrobe these were your humble friends your opened eyes nature had trained her common gifts to prize not cam nor isis taught you to despise charles with his muddy margin and the harsh plebeian grasses of the reeking marsh new englands homebred scholar well you knew her soil her speech her people through and through and loved them ever with the love that holds all sweet fond memories in its fragrant folds though far and wide your winged words have flown your daily presence kept you all our own till with a sorrowing sigh a thrill of pride we heard your summons and you left our side for larger duties and for tasks untried how pleased the spaniards for a while to claim this frank hidalgo with the liquid name who stored their classics on his crowded shelves and loved their calderon as they did themselves before his eyes what changing pageants pass the bridal feast how near the funeral mass the deathstroke falls the misereres wail the joybells ring the tearstained cheeks unveil

uncle s says he to my good cousin whom he calls j b a nations servants go where they are sent he heard his uncles orders and he went by what enchantments what alluring arts our truthful james led captive british hearts whether his shrewdness made their statesmen halt or if his learning found their dons at fault or if his virtue was a strange surprise or if his wit flung stardust in their eyes like honest yankees we can simply guess but that he did it all must needs confess england herself without a blush may claim her only conqueror since the norman came eight years an exile what a weary while since first our herald sought the mother isle his snowwhite flag no churlish wrong has soiled he left unchallenged he returns unspoiled here let us keep him here he saw the light his genius wisdom wit are ours by right and if we lose him our lament will be we have five hundred not as good as he to john greenleaf whittier on his eightieth birthday friend whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear than when lifes roseate summer on thy cheek burned in the flush of manhoods manliest year lonely how lonely is the snowy peak thy feet have reached and mine have climbed so near close on thy footsteps mid the landscape drear i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak look backward from thy lofty height survey thy years of toil of peaceful victories won of dreams made real largest hopes outrun look forward brighter than earths morning ray streams the pure light of heavens unsetting sun the unclouded dawn of lifes immortal day prelude to a volume printed in raised letters for the blind dear friends left darkling in the long eclipse that veils the noonday you whose fingertips a meaning in these ridgy leaves can find where ours go stumbling senseless helpless blind this wreath of verse how dare i offer you to whom the gardens choicest gifts are due the hues of all its glowing beds are ours shall you not claim its sweetestsmelling flowers nay those i have i bring you at their birth lifes cheerful sunshine warmed the grateful earth if my rash boyhood dropped some idle seeds and here and there you light on saucy weeds among the fairer growths remember still song comes of grace and not of human will we get a jarring note when most we try then strike the chord we know not how or why our stately verse with too aspiring art oft overshoots and fails to reach the heart while the rude rhyme one human throb endears turns grief to smiles and softens mirth to tears kindest of critics ye whose fingers read from natures lesson learn the poets creed the queenly tulip flaunts in robes of flame the wayside seedling scarce a tint may claim yet may the lowliest leaflets that unfold a dewdrop fresh from heavens own chalice hold boston to florence sent to the philological circle of florence for its meeting in commemoration of dante january the anniversary of his first condemnation proud of her clustering spires her newbuilt towers our venice stolen from the slumbering sea a sisters kindliest greeting wafts to thee rose of val d arno queen of all its flowers thine exiles shrine thy sorrowing love embowers yet none with truer homage bends the knee or stronger pledge of fealty brings than we whose poets make thy dead immortal ours lonely the height but ah to heaven how near dante whence flowed that solemn verse of thine like the stern river from its apennine whose name the faroff scythian thrilled with fear now to all lands thy deeptoned voice is dear and every language knows the song divine at the unitarian festival march the waves unbuild the wasting shore where mountains towered the billows sweep yet still their borrowed spoils restore and build new empires from the deep so while the floods of thought lay waste the proud domain of priestly creeds its heavenappointed tides will haste to plant new homes for human needs be ours to mark with hearts unchilled the change an outworn church deplores the legend sinks but faith shall build a fairer throne on newfound shores poem for the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of harvard college twice had the mellowing sun of autumn crowned the hundredth circle of his yearly round when as we meet today our fathers met that joyous gathering who can eer forget when harvards nurslings scattered far and wide through mart and village lakes and oceans side came with one impulse one fraternal throng and crowned the hours with banquet speech and song once more revived in fancys magic glass i see in state the long procession pass tall courtly leader as by right divine winthrop our winthrop rules the marshalled line still seen in front as on that faroff day his ribboned baton showed the columns way not all are gone who marched in manly pride and waved their truncheons at their leaders side gray lowell dixwell who his empire shared these to be with us envious time has spared few are the faces so familiar then our eyes still meet amid the haunts of men scarce one of all the living gathered there whose unthinned locks betrayed a silver hair greets us today and yet we seem the same as our own sires and grandsires save in name there are the patriarchs looking vaguely round for classmates faces hardly known if found see the cold brow that rules the busy mart close at its side the pallid son of art whose purchased skill with borrowed meaning clothes and stolen hues the smirking face he loathes here is the patient scholar in his looks you read the titles of his learned books what classic lore those spidery crowsfeet speak what problems figure on that wrinkled cheek for never thought but left its stiffened trace its fossil footprint on the plastic face as the swift record of a raindrop stands fixed on the tablet of the hardening sands on every face as on the written page each year renews the autograph of age one trait alone may wasting years defy the fire still lingering in the poets eye while hope the siren sings her sweetest strain non omnis moriar is its proud refrain sadly we gaze upon the vacant chair he who should claim its honors is not there otis whose lips the listening crowd enthrall that press and pack the floor of bostons hall but kirkland smiles released from toil and care since the silk mantle younger shoulders wear quincys whose spirit breathes the selfsame fire that filled the bosom of his youthful sire who for the altar bore the kindled torch to freedoms temple dying in its porch three grave professions in their sons appear whose words well studied all well pleased will hear palfrey ordained in varied walks to shine statesman historian critic and divine solid and square behold majestic shaw a mass of wisdom and a mine of law warren whose arm the doughtiest warriors fear asks of the startled crowd to lend its ear proud of his calling him the world loves best not as the coming but the parting guest look on that form with eye dilating scan the stately mould of natures kingliest man towerlike he stands in lifes unfaded prime ask you his name none asks a second time he from the land his outward semblance takes where stormswept mountains watch oer slumbering lakes see in the impress which the body wears how its imperial might the soul declares the foreheads large expansion lofty wide that locks unsilvered vainly strive to hide the lines of thought that plough the sober cheek lips that betray their wisdom ere they speak in tones like answers from dodonas grove an eye like junos when she frowns on jove i look and wonder will he be content this man this monarch for the purple meant the meaner duties of his tribe to share clad in the garb that common mortals wear ah wild ambition spread thy restless wings beneath whose plumes the hidden cestrum stings thou whose bold flight would leave earths vulgar crowds and like the eagle soar above the clouds must feel the pang that fallen angels know when the red lightning strikes thee from below less bronze more silver mingles in the mould of him whom next my roving eyes behold his more the scholars than the statesmans face proclaims him born of academic race weary his look as if an aching brain left on his brow the frozen prints of pain his voice farreaching grave sonorous owns a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires glows with a heat that every bosom fires such everett seems no chancesown wild flower knows the fullblown charms of cultures double rose alas how soon by deaths unsparing frost its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost two voices only two to earth belong of all whose accents met the listening throng winthrop alike for speech and guidance framed on that proud day a twofold duty claimed one other yet remembered or forgot forgive my silence if i name him not can i believe it i whose youthful voice claimed a brief gamut notes not over choice stood undismayed before the solemn throng and propria voce sung that saucy song which even in memory turns my soul aghast felix audacia was the verdict cast what were the glory of these festal days shorn of their grand illuminations blaze night comes at last with all her starry train to find a light in every glittering pane from harvards windows see the sudden flash old massachusetts glares through every sash from wall to wall the kindling splendors run till all is glorious as the noonday sun how to the scholars mind each object brings what some historian tells some poet sings the good gray teacher whom we all revered loved honored laughed at and by freshmen feared as from old harvard where its light began from hall to hall the clustering splendors ran took down his wellworn eschylus and read lit by the rays a thousand tapers shed how the swift herald crossed the leagues between mycenaes monarch and his faithless queen and thus he read my verse but ill displays the attic picture clad in modern phrase on idas summit flames the kindling pile and lemnos answers from his rocky isle from athos next it climbs the reddening skies thence where the watchtowers of macistus rise the sentries of mesapius in their turn bid the dry heath in high piled masses burn cithoerons crag the crimson billows stain far aegiplanctus joins the fiery train thus the swift courier through the pathless night has gained at length the arachnoean height whence the glad tidings borne on wings offlame ilium has fallen reach the royal dame so ends the day before the midnight stroke the lights expiring cloud the air with smoke while these the toil of younger hands employ the slumbering grecian dreams of smouldering troy as to that hour with backward steps i turn midway i pause behold a funeral urn ah sad memorial known but all too well the tale which thus its golden letters tell this dust once breathing changed its joyous life for toil and hunger wounds and mortal strife love friendship learnings all prevailing charms for the cold bivouac and the clash of arms the cause of freedom won a race enslaved called back to manhood and a nation saved these sons of harvard falling ere their prime leave their proud memory to the coming time while in their still retreats our scholars turn the mildewed pages of the past to learn with endless labor of the sleepless brain what once has been and neer shall be again we reap the harvest of their ceaseless toil and find a fragrance in their midnight oil but let a purblind mortal dare the task the embryo future of itself to ask the world reminds him with a scornful laugh that times have changed since prospero broke his staff could all the wisdom of the schools foretell the dismal hour when lisbon shook and fell or name the shuddering night that toppled down our sisters pride beneath whose mural crown scarce had the scowl forgot its angry lines when earths blind prisoners fired their fatal mines new realms new worlds exulting science claims still the dim future unexplored remains her trembling scales the faroff planet weigh her torturing prisms its elements betray we know what ores the fires of sirius melt what vaporous metals gild orions belt angels archangels may have yet to learn those hidden truths our heaventaught eyes discern yet vain is knowledge with her mystic wand to pierce the cloudy screen and read beyond once to the silent stars the fates were known to us they tell no secrets but their own at israels altar still we humbly bow but where oh where are israels prophets now where is the sibyl with her hoarded leaves where is the charm the weird enchantress weaves no croaking raven turns the auspex pale no reeking altars tell the morrows tale the measured footsteps of the fates are dumb unseen unheard unheralded they come prophet and priest and all their following fail who then is left to rend the futures veil who but the poet he whose nicer sense no film can baffle with its slight defence whose finer vision marks the waves that stray felt but unseen beyond the violet ray who while the stormwind waits its darkening shroud foretells the tempest ere he sees the cloud stays not for time his secrets to reveal but reads his message ere he breaks the seal so mantuas bard foretold the coming day ere bethlehems infant in the manger lay the promise trusted to a mortal tongue found listening ears before the angels sung so while his load the creeping packhorse galled while inch by inch the dull canalboat crawled darwin beheld a titan from afar drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car that panting giant fed by air and flame the mightiest forges task their strength to tame happy the poet him no tyrant fact holds in its clutches to be chained and racked him shall no mouldy document convict no stern statistics gravely contradict no rival sceptre threats his airy throne he rules oer shadows but he reigns alone shall i the poets broad dominion claim because you bid me wear his sacred name for these few moments shall i boldly clash my flint and steel and by the sudden flash read the fair vision which my soul descries through the wide pupils of its wondering eyes list then awhile the fifty years have sped the third full centurys opened scroll is spread blank to all eyes save his who dimly sees the shadowy future told in words like these how strange the prospect to my sight appears changed by the busy hands of fifty years full well i know our oceansalted charles filling and emptying through the sands and marls that wall his restless stream on either bank not all unlovely when the sedges rank lend their coarse veil the sable ooze to hide that bares its blackness with the ebbing tide in other shapes to my illumined eyes those ragged margins of our stream arise through walls of stone the sparkling waters flow in clearer depths the golden sunsets glow on purer waves the lamps of midnight gleam that silver oer the unpolluted stream along his shores what stately temples rise what spires what turrets print the shadowed skies our smiling mother sees her broad domain spread its tall roofs along the western plain those blazoned windows blushing glories tell of grateful hearts that loved her long and well yon gilded dome that glitters in the sun was dives gift alas his only one these buttressed walls enshrine a bankers name that hallowed chapel hides a misers shame their wealth they left their memory cannot fade though age shall crumble every stone they laid great lord of millions let me call thee great since countless servants at thy bidding wait richesse oblige no mortal must be blind to all but self or look at human kind laboring and suffering all its want and woe through sheets of crystal as a pleasing show that makes life happier for the chosen few duty for whom is something not to do when thy last page of life at length is filled what shall thine heirs to keep thy memory build will piles of stone in auburns mournful shade save from neglect the spot where thou art laid nay deem not thus the sauntering strangers eye will pass unmoved thy columned tombstone by no memory wakened not a teardrop shed thy name uncared for and thy date unread but if thy record thou indeed dost prize bid from the soil some stately temple rise some hall of learning some memorial shrine with names long honored to associate thine so shall thy fame outlive thy shattered bust when all around thee slumber in the dust thus englands henry lives in etons towers saved from the spoil oblivions gulf devours our later records with as fair a fame have wreathed each uncrowned benefactors name the walls they reared the memories still retain that churchyard marbles try to keep in vain in vain the delving antiquary tries to find the tomb where generous harvard lies here here his lasting monument is found where every spot is consecrated ground oer stoughtons dust the crumbling stone decays fast fade its lines of lapidary praise there the wild bramble weaves its ragged nets there the dry lichen spreads its gray rosettes still in yon walls his memory lives unspent nor asks a braver nobler monument thus hollis lives and holden honored praised and good sir matthew in the halls they raised thus live the worthies of these later times who shine in deeds less brilliant grouped in rhymes say shall the muse with faltering steps retreat or dare these names in rhythmic form repeat why not as boldly as from homers lips the long array of argive battleships when oer our graves a thousand years have past if to such date our threatened globe shall last these classic precincts myriad feet have pressed will show on high in beauteous garlands dressed those honored names that grace our later day weld matthews sever thayer austin gray sears phillips lawrence hemenway to the list add sanders sibley all the muse has missed once more i turn to read the pictured page bright with the promise of the coming age ye unborn sons of children yet unborn whose youthful eyes shall greet that faroff morn blest are those eyes that all undimmed behold the sights so longed for by the wise of old from higharched alcoves through resounding halls clad in full robes majestic science calls tireless unsleeping still at natures feet whateer she utters fearless to repeat her lips at last from every cramp released that israels prophet caught from egypts priest i see the statesman firm sagacious bold for lifes long conflict cast in amplest mould not his to clamor with the senseless throng that shouts unshamed our party right or wrong but in the patriots neverending fight to side with truth who changes wrong to right i see the scholar in that wondrous time men women children all can write in rhyme these four brief lines addressed to youth inclined to idle rhyming in his notes i find who writes in verse that should have writ in prose is like a traveller walking on his toes happy the rhymester who in time has found the heels he lifts were made to touch the ground i see gray teachers on their work intent their lavished lives in endless labor spent had closed at last in age and penury wrecked martyrs not burned but frozen in neglect save for the generous hands that stretched in aid of wornout servants left to die half paid ah many a year will pass i thought ere we such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt that cold republics hasten to forget i see the priest if such a name he bears who without pride his sacred vestment wears and while the symbols of his tribe i seek thus my first impulse bids me think and speak let not the mitre englands prelate wears next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares though low before it courtly christians bow leave its red mark on younger englands brow we love we honor the maternal dame but let her priesthood wear a modest name while through the waters of the pilgrims bay a newborn mayflower shows her keels the way too old grew britain for her mothers beads must we be necklaced with her childrens creeds welcome alike in surplice or in gown the loyal lieges of the heavenly crown we greet with cheerful not submissive mien a sister church but not a mitred queen a few brief flutters and the unwilling muse who feared the flight she hated to refuse shall fold the wings whose gayer plumes are shed here where at first her halffledged pinions spread well i remember in the long ago how in the forest shades of fontainebleau strained through a fissure in a rocky cell one crystal drop with measured cadence fell still as of old forever bright and clear the fissured cavern drops its wonted tear and wondrous virtue simple folk aver lies in that teardrop of la roche qui pleure of old i wandered by the rivers side between whose banks the mighty waters glide where vast niagara hurrying to its fall builds and unbuilds its evertumbling wall oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar of battling floods and feel the trembling shore as the huge torrent girded for its leap with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep not less distinct from memorys pictured urn the gray old rock the leafy woods return robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear and once again with quickened sense i hear through the low murmur of the leaves that stir the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure so when the third ripe century stands complete as once again the sons of harvard meet rejoicing numerous as the seashore sands drawn from all quarters farthest distant lands where through the reeds the scaly saurian steals where cold alaska feeds her floundering seals where plymouth glorying wears her iron crown where sacramento sees the suns go down nay from the cloisters whence the refluent tide wafts their pale students to our mothers side mid all the tumult that the day shall bring while all the echoes shout and roar and ring these tinkling lines oblivions easy prey once more emerging to the light of day not all unpleasing to the listening ear shall wake the memories of this bygone year heard as i hear the measured drops that flow from the gray rock of wooded fontainebleau yet ere i leave one loving word for all those fresh young lives that wait our mothers call one gift is yours kind natures richest dower youth the fair bud that holds lifes opening flower full of high hopes no coward doubts enchain with all the future throbbing in its brain and mightiest instincts which the beating heart fills with the fire its burning waves impart o joyous youth whose glory is to dare thy foot firm planted on the lowest stair thine eye uplifted to the loftiest height where fame stands beckoning in the rosy light thanks for thy flattering tales thy fond deceits thy loving lies thy cheerful smiling cheats natures rash promise every day is broke a thousand acorns breed a single oak the myriad blooms that make the orchard gay in barren beauty throw their lives away yet shall we quarrel with the sap that yields the painted blossoms which adorn the fields when the fair orchard wears its mayday suit of pinkwhite petals for its scanty fruit thrice happy hours in hopes illusion dressed in fancys cradle nurtured and caressed though rich the spoils that ripening years may bring to thee the dewdrops of the orient cling not all the dyestuffs from the vats of truth can match the rainbow on the robes of youth dear unborn children to our mothers trust we leave you fearless when we lie in dust while oer these walls the christian banner waves from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves while oer those portals veritas you read no church shall bind you with its human creed take from the past the best its toil has won but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed quit the old paths that error loved to tread and a new wreath of living blossoms seek a narrower pathway up a loftier peak lose not your reverence but unmanly fear leave far behind you all who enter here as once of old from idas lofty height the flaming signal flashed across the night so harvards beacon sheds its unspent rays till every watchtower shows its kindling blaze caught from a spark and fanned by every gale a brighter radiance gilds the roofs of yale amherst and williams bid their flambeaus shine and bowdoin answers through her groves of pine oer princetons sands the far reflections steal where mighty edwards stamped his iron heel nay on the hill where old beliefs were bound fast as if styx had girt them nine times round bursts such a light that trembling souls inquire if the whole church of calvin is on fire well may they ask for what so brightly burns as a dry creed that nothing ever learns thus link by link is knit the flaming chain lit by the torch of harvards hallowed plain thy son thy servant dearest mother mine lays this poor offering on thy holy shrine an

along the zuyder zee like our motleys john of barnveld you have always been inclined to speak well somewhat frankly to let us know your mind and the mynheers would have told you to be cautious what you said or else that silver tongue of yours might cost your precious head but were very glad youve kept it it was always freedoms own and whenever reason chose it she found a royal throne you have whacked us with your sceptre our backs were little harmed and while we rubbed our bruises we owned we had been charmed and you our quasi dutchman what welcome should be yours for all the wise

common december during the transit of venus i love all sights of earth and skies from flowers that glow to stars that shine the comet and the penny show all curious things above below hold each in turn my wandering eyes i claim the christian pagans line humani nihil even so and is not human life divine when soft the western breezes blow and strolling youths meet sauntering maids i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our muchenduring elms bestow the vender and his rhetorics flow that lambent stream of liquid lies the bait he dangles from his line the gudgeon and his goldwashed prize i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire the little hero of the hunch with iron arm and soul of fire and will that works his fierce desire untamed unscared unconquered punch my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds the dame sans mercis broken strain whom i erewhile perchance have known when orleans filled the bourbon throne a siren singing by the seine but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets disks as if to blind their bloodshot eyes or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run to pop like corn that children parch from summer something overdone and roll a cinder through the skies grudge not today the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament to whom the milky way is free who holds the wondrous crystal key the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent who takes his toll and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star if venus only comes to time and prophets say she must and shall today will hear the tinkling chime of many a ringing silver dime for him whose optic glass supplies the crowd with astronomic eyes the galileo of the mall dimly the transit morning broke the sun seemed doubting what to do as one who questions how to dress and takes his doublets from the press and halts between the old and new please heaven he wear his suit of blue or don at least his ragged cloak with rents that show the azure through i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern the last newcomer of the file and wait and wait a weary while and gape and stretch and shrug and smile for each his place must fairly earn hindmost and foremost in his turn till hitching onward pace by pace i gain at last the envied place and pay the white exiguous coin the sun and i are face to face he glares at me i stare at him and lo my straining eye has found a little spot that black and round lies near the crimsoned fireorbs rim o blessed beauteous evening star well named for her whom earth adores the lady of the dovedrawn car i know thee in thy white simar but veiled in black a rayless spot blank as a careless scribblers blot stripped of thy robe of silvery flame the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors i see thee yet i know thee not and canst thou call thyself the same a black round spot and that is all and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see and art thou then a world like ours flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone how must thy burning sands absorb the firewaves of the blazing orb thy chain so short thy path so near thy flamedefying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers and bast thou cities domes and towers and life and love that makes it dear and death that fills thy tribes with fear lost in my dream my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know my allpervading thought explores the azure oceans lucent shores i leave my mortal self below as up the starlit stairs i climb and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time new spheres new suns new systems gleam the voice no earthborn echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears i hear them singing as they shine a mortals voice dissolves my dream my patient neighbor next in line hints gently there are those who wait o guardian of the starry gate what coin shall pay this debt of mine too slight thy claim too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscans hand has placed in thine forgive my own the small affront the insult of the proffered dime take it o friend since this thy wont but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee and pay thee with a grateful rhyme ave prelude to illustrated poems full well i know the frozen hand has come that smites the songs of grove and garden dumb and chills sad autumns last chrysanthemum yet would i find one blossom if i might ere the dark loom that weaves the robe of white hides all the wrecks of summer out of sight sometimes in dim novembers narrowing day when all the seasons pride has passed away as mid the blackened stems and leaves we stray we spy in sheltered nook or rocky cleft a starry disk the hurrying winds have left of all its blooming sisterhood bereft some pansy with its wondering baby eyes poor wayside nursling fixed in blank surprise at the rough welcome of unfriendly skies or golden daisy will it dare disclaim the lions tooth to wear this gentler name or bloodred salvia with its lips aflame the storms have stripped the lily and the rose still on its cheek the flush of summer glows and all its heartleaves kindle as it blows so had i looked some bud of song to find the careless winds of autumn left behind with these of earlier seasons growth to bind ah me my skies are dark with sudden grief a flower lies faded on my garnered sheaf yet let the sunshine gild this virgin leaf the joyous blessed sunshine of the past still with me though the heavens are overcast the
