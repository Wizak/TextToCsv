 madame thibaults hall of waxworks attracted a lot of visitors the front of the building was bright with red and yellow lights even during the day inside the hall were scenes of murders and other famous historical events with lifelike figures made out of wax clive wilkes loved the place both the outside and the inside he was a delivery boy for a small supermarket so he was often able to find some free time during the day to stop and visit the waxworks at the entrance to the hall there was a man sitting at a desk selling tickets then after passing through a dark area you came to the main hall there in front of you was a bloody murder scene a girl with long fair hair was pushing a knife into the neck of an old man who sat at a table eating his dinner his dinner was a plate of wax meat and wax potatoes next there was the eighteenthcentury frenchman marat who was killed as he sat in his bath then the murder of president kennedy and then a scene in a nazi prison camp clive loved every scene and he never got tired of looking at them but they didnt frighten him as they frightened other people they made him smile or even laugh they were funny why not laugh one thing which clive wanted to do very much was to spend a night in the hall it wouldnt be too difficult clive knew that three people worked there as well as the ticket seller at the door there was a rather fat woman with brown hair and glasses who took the tickets as you went in there was a man who gave little talks about the different scenes though not more than half the people listened to him and there was another man small with black hair who walked around watching people to make sure they didnt damage anything so one night in november clive went in half an hour before the hall closed with a cheese sandwich in his pocket he hid himself in the shadows and listened to the three people as they got ready to leave the woman whose name was mildred got the moneybox from fred the ticket seller and took it into a room at the back of the hall fred left by the front door the others by the back first mildred then the taller man then the small one when clive heard the door shut and the key turn in the lock he waited for a moment in the beautiful silence then he went to look at the room at the back where they kept their coats because he had never seen it they seemed to use it as an office there was an old desk there next to the room was a toilet in a drawer in the desk was the wooden moneybox but he wasnt interested in the money clive started to enjoy himself he found the lights and put them on so that the scenes were all lit up now he was alone so he could touch things as well as look at them he stood next to the figures and touched their faces he ate his sandwich and sang a few songs by two in the morning he was bored and tried to get out but both the front door and the back door were locked and there were no keys anywhere he used the toilet and went to sleep on the floor he woke up early and had another look around he wanted to find something to take home with him he stopped by a waxwork of president wood row wilson signing a document in at the end of the first world war yes he would have wood row wilsons tie when the hall opened at clive was hiding behind a screen members of the public began to come in but clive waited until ten oclock before he felt it was safe to join them he left with woodrow wilsons tie in his pocket he was half an hour late for work there was a job waiting for him so he went off on his bicycle clive lived alone with his mother who worked in a dress shop she had no other children and her husband had left her when clive was five he was eighteen now he had left school early without completing his education then he had spent a year doing nothing much his mother worried about him and so she was pleased when he got the job at the supermarket when clive came home that evening he had a story ready for his mother last night he said he had met a friend and gone back to his house and his parents had invited him to spend the night there she accepted this story clive put woodrow wilsons tie in the cupboard with his own it was a beautiful tie pale grey and expensive he imagined someone mildred perhaps looking at the figure of the president and saying just a minute what happened to woodrow wilsons tie he felt very proud of his adventure and wanted to tell someone about it but he had no close friends who he could talk to by the next day it didnt seem exciting any more one afternoon the following week clive had another idea it was a really amusing idea one that would certainly make the public take notice when should he do it tonight no he needed time to plan it two nights later clive went to the hall at nine oclock and bought a ticket luckily the ticket seller didnt really look at people he was too busy clive went straight to woodrow wilson and saw that he was still without a tie the murder scenes didnt interest him as much as usual some real murder scenes would be so much better he laughed he would kill the woman first as the visitors went out clive hid in a dark corner near the office when mildred walked past him in her hat and coat he stepped forward and put his arm around her neck she made only a small urrk sound clive pressed her neck with his hands until her body fell to the floor then he pulled her to the dark corner has mildred gone said one of the men yes shes not in the office well im going too clive jumped on him as he passed and attacked him in the same way the job was more difficult because the man fought hard but clive managed to knock his head against the wall it was the taller man who gave the talks whats happening the small dark man appeared this time clive tried to hit him on the chin he missed and hit him in the neck the man was unconscious now so clive was able to knock his head against the wall too they all seemed to be dead blood was pouring from the heads of the two men and the woman was bleeding a little from the mouth clive found the keys in the second mans pocket there was a pocketknife there which he took too then the taller man moved a little clive opened the pocketknife and pushed it into his neck four times they were all dead now and that was certainly real blood coming out not the red paint of the wax figures clive turned on the lights which lit up the scenes and began the interesting job of choosing the right places to put the bodies the woman should certainly go in marats hath clive thought of taking off her clothes but decided against it because she would look much funnier sitting in a bath with a coat and hat on he took the figure of marat out of the bath carried it into the office and placed it on the desk then he carried mildred to the bath and put her in god she looked funny now for the men he decided that the man whose neck was cut would look good in the place of the old man who was having dinner after all the girl with the long fair hair was pushing a knife into his neck the figure of the old man was in a sitting position so clive put him on the toilet he looked so funny there with a knife in one hand and a fork in the other waiting for something to eat clive laughed and laughed last the little man clive looked around and noticed the woodrow wilson scene the figure of the president was sitting at a large desk signing a paper that was an excellent place clive thought for a man whose head was cut open and bleeding he managed to take the wax pen out of wilsons fingers carry him into the office and put him on the chair at the desk his arms were in a position for writing so clive found a pen on the desk to put into his right hand now he could put the little man in woodrow wilsons place he lifted him up onto the chair but his head fell forward onto the desk and clive could not make his hand hold the pen at last it was done clive smiled then he realized that every part of his body was tired now that he had the keys he could get out go home and sleep well in his own bed he wanted to be ready to enjoy tomorrow there was some blood on his coat so he must throw it away somewhere but he needed a coat he took one off a wax figure which was about his size and put that on then he used the inside of his own coat to clean off any possible fingerprints from places he had touched he turned off the lights and found his way to the back door he locked it behind him and dropped the keys on the ground in the street was a box with some old newspapers empty cans and plastic bags in it where he hid the coat clive slept very well that night the next morning he was standing across the street from the hall when the ticket seller arrived just before by only three people had gone in but clive could not wait any longer so he crossed the street and bought a ticket the ticket seller was telling people just go in everybody is late this morning he went inside to put on the lights and clive followed him there were four other customers now they looked at mildred in her hat and coat sitting in marats bath without noticing anything strange about her two more people came in at last by the woodrow wilson scene a woman said to the man with her was someone shot when they signed that document at the end of the war there was blood real blood on the papers on the desk by now they were dark red i dont know i dont think so the man answered clive wanted very much to laugh but he managed not to suddenly a woman cried out in terror and at the same time a man shouted my god its real another man was examining the body with its face in the meat and potatoes the bloods real its a dead man the ticket seller fred came in whats the trouble there are two dead bodies here real ones now fred looked at marats bath good god good god mildred and this one and this one here i must call the police said fred could you all please just leave he ran into the office where the telephone was and clive heard him cry ours he had seen woodrow wilson at the desk of course and marat clive thought it was time to leave so he did no one looked at him as he made his way out that was all right he thought that was good he decided to go to work and to ask for the day off he told his employer he felt ill and put his hand on his stomach old mr simmons had to let him go clive wanted to take a long bus ride somewhere he didnt know why he wanted to do this but the need was very strong he had brought all his cash with him about twentythree dollars and now he bought a ticket for a bus going west for seven dollars one way this took him by the evening to a town in indiana there was a cafe here where the bus stopped as he went in he saw newspapers on sale there it was in big letters mystery killer three dead in waxworks hall he bought a paper and read it at the bar drinking beer this morning at ticket man fred keating and several visitors to madame thibaults waxworks discovered three real dead bodies they were the bodies of mrs mildred veery aged george hartley and richard macfadden all employed at the hall police believe the murders happened at about ten yesterday evening because the bodies were put in place of wax figures police are looking for a killer with a sick mind clive laughed over that sick mind but he was sorry that there were no details about the really amusing things the old man sitting on the toilet the man signing the document with his head broken and bleeding two men were standing at the bar beside him did you read about the murders at the waxworks he asked one of them not really he didnt seem interested you see i did them said clive he pointed to a picture of the bodies thats my work listen boy said the man were not troubling you and dont you trouble us they moved away from clive clive slept in the street that night on the road the next day he waved at a passing car which took him to another town nearer his hometown that days newspapers did not have any more news about the murders in another cafe that evening he had a similar conversation this time with two young men they didnt believe him either next day he stopped a few more cars and finally reached his hometown he went straight to the police station i have something important to say about a murder he told the policeman sitting at a desk he was sent to the office of a police officer who had grey hair and a fat face clive told his story where do you go to school clive i dont im eighteen he told him about his job clive youve got troubles but theyre not the ones youre talking about said the officer clive had to wait in a small room in the police station and nearly an hour later a doctor was brought in then his mother they didnt believe him they said he was just telling this story to attract attention to himself clive needs a man around the house his mother told them someone who can teach him to behave like a man since he was fourteen hes been asking me questions like who am i and am i a person the policeman told clive he must see the doctor twice a week for treatment clive was very angry he refused to go back to the supermarket but found another delivery job they havent found the murderer have they clive said to the doctor on one of his visits youre all stupid stupid the doctor only laughed at him there was one thing which might help to prove his story woodrow wilsons tie which was still in his cupboard but he wasnt going to show it to these stupid people as he delivered things on his bicycle as he had supper with his mother he was planning next time he would do something really big he would take a gun up to the top of a high building and shoot at the people in the street kill a hundred people at least then they would take notice of him then they would realize that he was a person the end
